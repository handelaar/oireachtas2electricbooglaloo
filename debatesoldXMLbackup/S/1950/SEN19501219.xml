      <P>As Senators are aware, this is an annual Bill which merely proposes to continue for a further year certain enactments or portions of enactments which would otherwise expire on the 31st December.  The measures being continued are listed in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, is omitted from the list this year, as the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950, has continued it in operation for five years, that is, up to the 31st December, 1955. The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill explains why the other measures have to be continued in operation for a further period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The replacement of these Acts by permanent legislation forms part of the wider question of consolidating and modernising the whole code of local government law.  The Local Government (Repeal of Enactments) Act, <Col N="186" /> which recently became law, cleared away many obsolete provisions in the local government code.  I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the work done by the Special Committee of the Seanad which so meticulously examined this very complicated measure.  The Repeal of Enactments Act was merely a first step towards the eventual simplification and modernisation of the legislation dealing with local government. We are already proceeding with the next steps.  The preparation of proposals for the codification of the electoral law, the general local government law and the sanitary law are well under way in the Department.</P>
    <P>I do not think Senators will require from me any more elaborate explanation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages to-day.</P>

      <P>I should like, as far as possible, to confine and to relate my remarks with strict relevancy to the Bill before us.  This Bill, which is one of those hardy annuals that the Seanad is over-familiar with, and which has been coming before the Seanad for a great number of years, is comparatively unchanged this year, with the exception of one particular section to which I shall refer.  In Dáil Eireann, the debate lasted about four weeks and it centred on the cost of living&mdash;on whether the cost of living had or had not gone up and, if it had gone up, on whether it had gone up prior or subsequent to August last.  It was a very interesting and instructive debate but definitely it was not a debate on the Bill which we have before us to-day and which it is necessary to have passed into law by the 31st of this month.  It was a discussion about very important matters, but, on moving up to the Division Lobby prior to the division on the Bill, an Opposition Deputy, with a droll sense of humour, remarked quite seriously that he really did not think the Bill was strictly relevant to the debate.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which is before the Seanad this evening, is a continuation or a renewal of the powers contained in the Supplies and Services Act which has come before the Dáil and Seanad on numerous occasions.  There is one additional section to it.  It is an important section around which I think the main part of the discussion should take place.  With regard to the general position, and to the necessity for having a Bill such as this, I think it is within the knowledge of the Seanad that the ambition of Governments, past and present, is to get back, as rapidly as possible, to normal conditions.  Control or interference with trade and industry is normally undesirable.  It may be necessary at times, but the outcrop of that necessity is not always good.  Very frequently, it produces an outcrop that is evil and damaging in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Government went out of office shortly after the war had ended. When the present Government took <Col N="188" /> over, war appeared to be behind us. It was our desire that the State should, as rapidly as possible, pull out of interference with industry and with commerce.  Such a pull-out could have been effected too rapidly.  We were conscious of the arguments advanced that, in the long run, the best way of controlling prices, and of bringing about a reduction in prices, was to let the ordinary laws of supply and demand apply, and that, once they began to operate, the ordinary competitive spirit would result in reduced prices.  From time to time, over the last two and a half years, we have decontrolled and we have pulled out the State to meet the arguments advanced in order to see to what extent the ordinary laws of supply and demand, and the competitive spirit, would effect satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>It is within the experience of every single member of the Seanad that, in all cases, the results were not entirely happy.  One of the normal effects of State control, State penetration and State interference was the organisation of bodies and communities, with a related interest, into a more solidified form, so that when controls, and the power of control over prices, were removed, and the ordinary laws of supply and demand were left to operate, and when the competitive spirit was left to pull down prices, in some respects, certainly, we found that the organised spirit was supreme over the competitive spirit and that the removal of control resulted in an increase in prices, even where the article was somewhat surplus to production. It is only fair to say that when I give that particular illustration, I am not applying it to the general organisation of commercial life.  But, here and there, we did find that the removal of controls resulted in increased prices, even where the article was surplus, more or less, to requirement.</P>
    <P>With regard to traders generally, we have gone through a couple of years in which there were certain increases in overhead charges: where rates increased and where wages increased. We had something like a national increase in wages and we had something approaching a national increase <Col N="189" /> in rates.  These added heavily to the overhead charges on industry and business generally.  In addition, we had the devaluation of the £, which meant a certain increase in costs in certain directions.  The quantity of goods that we bought from the Western Hemisphere, and, in fact, all the goods that we bought from the hard-currency countries&mdash;the extent to which we in this country purchased them either from the Western Hemisphere or the hard-currency countries&mdash;was rather big&mdash;that is, within the scope of our daily lives.  Maize, which is the raw product of very much of our agricultural production; wheat, which enters, to a greater or a lesser extent, into every slice of bread eaten; petrol, fuel oil, tobacco, and, to a great extent, machinery, and, to a certain extent, other items which are more or less in daily use, all came either from the Western Hemisphere or from the hard-currency countries.  Yet, with rate increases, with wage increases, with the increases flowing out from hard-currency and dollar purchases, we had not anything like a commensurate increase in the cost of living.  In fact, up to some time at the end of the summer, in spite of all these factors, we had a cost of living remaining somewhat about stationary.  It is due to the industrial and commercial classes of the country to state that as a matter of official opinion and as a matter of ascertainable fact.  During the latter end of the period I refer to, in addition to the factors I mention which might contribute to an increase in prices, we had, to a very great extent, the world turning from normal, domestic or economic production back towards war production, and that turn in the world trend of production meant, in turn, shortages of certain lines of goods and, where the demand is greater than the article in production, normally you do get an increase in price.  Nevertheless, up to the end of the summer you had all these factors operating and you had no tilt in the cost-of-living index figure.</P>
    <P>In recent months we had a sudden very, very grave and completely unexpected turn in world events.  You had the Korean War apparently being <Col N="190" /> worked out to a standstill.  Then, completely unexpectedly, you had the break-through of the Chinese armies and you had the whole of the western world and the whole of Europe suddenly changing their policy, changing their outlook, and deciding, not as so many individuals, but as so many people welded into a solid community to get back rapidly to war production. As a result of that sudden and unexpected turn in the world's economy, you had this country, the same as any other country, suddenly faced with a gigantic jump in the price of very, very many war materials and with shortages in very, very many directions.</P>
    <P>With that state of affairs staring us in the face and with a crisis that may be just around the corner, it was clear that the procedure of decontrol, in fact that the deliberate policy of gradual but progressive decontrol, had got to be abandoned; that we had got to turn right about and face a regrettable but, nevertheless, real and new emergency. In an emergency when prices might sky-rocket and supplies decline beyond normal visibility, it was necessary to re-enact every one of the previous emergency controls and, acting in the light of experience, to add to them further controls where experience would direct those charged with responsibility to feel that there was a deficiency in the pre-existing machine.</P>
    <P>Controls are imposed in the public interest, in the interest of the general consumer.  So far as the general consumer goes, controls operate (1) in order to get as fair and reasonable distribution of goods as it is possible to effect; and (2) to have those goods supplied at the most reasonable price taking into account all the conditions that operate on the level of prices.  We were confronted with a position in which the whole situation changed quite suddenly and we found certain raw materials going up with an unexpected jump and to a very considerable height.  We found industrialists keeping pace with the jump in raw material long before that raw material went into the make-up of the goods.  We had a situation a couple of months ago where the prices of wool sky-rocketed, and immediately afterwards the price of every sock in Ireland jumped higher <Col N="191" /> than the wool when it was well within the knowledge of everyone that that highly expensive wool would not go into the Irish sock for a considerable number of months.  Retailers were blamed for that by some; manufacturers were blamed for that by many. Some are blameless; some are blameworthy. It is in the public interest and in the interest of those who are playing the game in a straightforward manner by the public to ascertain accurately exactly where the blame rests.</P>
    <P>We have different commodities going up because world prices are rising.  We have producers and retailers in this country being blamed for every single increase in the price of any article. Yet, when a proposal is made to publicise fully the reasons for every increase, to show that this article increased because of factors completely outside the control of anybody in this country and that the price of another article increased because the raw material from abroad going into it has increased; to show clearly and fairly to the public where the cause originates and where the blame, if any, rests, we have a panic in industrial circles and, to an extent, a panic in commercial circles that is difficult to understand.  It is difficult to understand why any industrialist, where the price of his raw material from an outside source goes up, and his finished product must go up in proportion, should get into a tail-spin because the public are going to be told that the product of his industry goes up because rubber or something else goes up in price abroad.  You have that planning and you have every evidence of opposition to the proposals made; and you have that opposition progressing along two lines of attack, each line being directly contradictory and in conflict with the other line of attack.  We had evidence of both approaches in the debates on this measure in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>One line of attack to the proposal to establish an advisory prices committee is that such a committee, in so far as it is outlined in this Bill, will be quite powerless and will prove wholly impotent and inoperative from <Col N="192" /> the very beginning because it has not sufficient powers.  It was said that it was, after all, only an advisory committee and, in so far as it is only an advisory committee, it will be quite surplus to requirements and will serve no useful function.  That is one line of attack.  The other line of attack was that this is the most brutal and ruthless proposal ever made in the history of a democratic State; that this proposal will ride roughshod over the interests of industrialists and those engaged in commerce.  In matters of this kind, irrespective of what Government happens to be in power, the body most concerned with the progress, development and expansion of industry is that group of men who form the Government.  They are more concerned than any chambers of commerce or federations of industry. There is no tendency apparent in any of our organisations or in any of our political Parties to commit sudden political suicide or completely ruin ourselves in so far as the desired national expansion in the fields of industry, agriculture, commerce and everything else is concerned.  The Government as a government has as great a sense of responsibility as any group of citizens in the State or as any group that one could get together anywhere.  When a proposal is tabled before both the Dáil and the Seanad, after full and mature consideration and in the light of experience over years of emergency and post-emergency, that proposal is not put down in any spirit of reckless folly or in order to make more trouble for some particular Minister in piloting such a measure through the Oireachtas.  That proposal is put down because, in the considered opinion of the people who are charged in the last analysis with full responsibility, it is desirable in the public interest, in the interests of the consumer, in the interests of the producer and in the interests of the retailer.  It is desirable to have a new body such as that outlined in this Bill to take over the work of control and to ensure that the work of price fixing will be done as far as possible in such manner as will not militate against normal trading operations or desirable <Col N="193" /> industrial expansion and production. As far as reasonable, it is desirable to have it done in the broad light of day.</P>
    <P>It is a very, very simple matter for any one of us to put ourselves up as a prophet.  Some people have presumed to be prophets who take greater pleasure in prophesying gloom rather than bliss.  Amongst the people who constitute themselves prophets in relation to this proposal, there have been those who framed their prophecies in the most gloomy terms.  It is presumed and prophesied that the Government will establish a price-fixing committee and that that committee will consist of a group of irresponsible lunatics who have no sense of proportion and who do not place any value on the normal development and expansion of industry. It is presumed and prophesied that that committee will fix prices at such a level that one industry after another will be put out of business.  Furthermore, it is prophesied that the Government will act on the advice of that committee and then lean back happily to watch the doors of one industry after another close up and down the country, and watch the miserable men put out of work through the lunacy of this advisory committee.</P>
    <P>When we come into the Dáil and Seanad, we are supposed to have reached a certain age and, in reaching that age, we are presumed to have reached the use of reason.  All reason would have long since departed from this institution as an institution of the State, and from the Government as a Government, if such a lunatic proposal was within the bounds of consideration. It must be presumed, and I am entitled to ask the Seanad to assume that, before the Government considered the establishment of an advisory body to advise the Minister in relation to prices, that body will consist of people with a responsible outlook and of people, in so far as they can be found, with considerable experience of the particular type of business upon which they are asked to advise; that body will be as conscious as any body would be of the necessity for keeping industry going in difficult times and of the fact that, if any death blow is struck at an industrialist, the industrialist may be the first to fall but he will be only one; <Col N="194" /> the casualties behind the industrialist will be every single worker with a vested interest in the particular line of business.</P>
    <P>I have to ask the Seanad in dealing with this particular section of the Bill to have a certain amount of trust. Obviously before a Bill becomes law no Minister is in a position to announce the names of those people who will constitute a tribunal or committee of this kind.  The Government has under consideration a panel of names.  From that panel a suitable selection will be made.  When the names are ultimately published I am inclined to guarantee that that committee or tribunal will not only have the confidence of the consumer but will have at the same time the confidence of every honest industrialist and of every individual engaged in trade up and down the country.  Judgment on the suitability of the personnel of a committee of this kind must naturally be reserved until the names are available.</P>
    <P>I would merely ask the Seanad at this stage to accept it as a fact that any Government constituting such a body would naturally aim at constituting a body that would have the maximum confidence of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the work which will fall on this particular body you have three interests&mdash;the producer, the retailer and the consumer.  It would be a tragic mistake for the Government to constitute a body of this kind where the dice would be heavily loaded in the interests of one section of these three to the prejudice of any other section.  There has been a certain amount of discussion and a certain amount of uneasiness with regard to the public nature of the work which will be done by this particular body. The purpose behind having such a body as this operating in public is, firstly, that where the price of any commodity is increased, the public will be told the reason for the increase.  If the reason is because of increased prices of the raw material outside this country, then is it not in the interest of the industrialist or in the interest of the trader in this country that his customers should not blame him, that his customers <Col N="195" /> should know and have published that that increase was due to the fact that there was an increase in the price of the raw material from some foreign source?  If the increase is due to increased wages, to increased rates, to increased overhead charges within the country, then is it not unfair to have the trader blamed for the increased prices?  Is it not in his interests to publicise the fact that this increase is because the cost of printing went up, the cost of rates went up or wages went up?  What we are aiming at in this is not only to have public confidence in the price-fixing authority but to have public confidence in the honesty, reliability and national outlook of industrialists, retailers and others concerned in the supply of commodities to the people.</P>
    <P>So far, I take it, there is no objection to publicity.  No industrialist will object, where his products increase in price, to having a body that will say in the public Press: &ldquo;That increased because of the price of the raw material,&rdquo; or to having a representative committee putting their stamp on the increased price rather than the producer's own stamp.  No retailer would object to it so far.  The next question &mdash;there is a lot of uneasiness with regard to this&mdash;is to what extent information secured from industrialists and traders, which must be made available to the committee, will be made public. Obviously any of us can see that, in so far as there is competitive business in any country, if you publish all the intimate details of the work of any particular industry or business and give competitors the advantage of the closest and most confidential information as to the inner workings of a competitive firm, that would completely deprive the business supplying the information of any advantage acquired through ability, organisation or initiative and would, in fact, so much undermine the confidence of business men in dealing with the Department of Industry and Commerce or through any advisory committee, that business men would keep their money in their pockets rather than speculate it in a <Col N="196" /> business where every trade secret was to be published to the whole world.  I would suggest that these fears are as groundless and unreal as the fears I referred to with regard to the type of person we shall put on this body.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Minister for Industry and Commerce has got to have a sense of responsibility.  Obviously he has got to consider whether the publication of any information would militate against or be damaging to industry as a whole. The chairman of this particular body has got to be selected with much greater care than we sometimes take when selecting the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The chairman of that body, in consultation with the Minister, is the person who is going to decide what exactly will be made public and what will not.  The terms of reference of this body have got to be drafted if and when the Bill becomes law.  The procedure has got to be defined if and when this Bill becomes law.  Representations that are in the public interest and in the interest of the community generally can be made and will be considered fully and reasonably after this Bill becomes law and before any body such as is outlined here begins to operate.  I do not know, within the limits of reason, what there is to fear in these proposals.  Every Senator knows that the old method of fixing prices within the Department was resisted, condemned and criticised by industrialists and business people. It was challenged in the very beginning. It was consistently challenged up to the time that new proposals were made.  It was challenged by consumers generally.  Their line of approach was: &ldquo;What do civil servants know about prices?  What do they know about business?&rdquo;  So long as any work affecting the lives of many people is done behind closed doors, then you never get the degree of confidence which we should get as a community possibly facing a really grave emergency.  It is public confidence in the machine, public confidence in our business men, public confidence in our industrialists, that is the object of the suggestions made here.</P>
    <P>We had price control based on controlling prices via the margin of profits <Col N="197" /> and prices have been controlled, whether effectively or otherwise, via the margin of profits ever since price control started.  Consistently, that was challenged by the producer and by the man engaged in business from the very beginning.  It was challenged by the consumer from the very beginning.  The consumer's challenge to that system of price control was that in effect and in practice what you are doing&mdash;there is a certain amount of truth in this&mdash;was that you were guaranteeing the profit of every individual that handled or saw the article from the raw material until it was passed to the consumer across a retailer's counter.  Every single intermediate profit was guaranteed and everyone was insured against loss or hardship, except the consumer at the other end of the spout.</P>
    <P>That criticism was a fair criticism. It was true, at least, to the extent that you guaranteed against loss or hardship everybody that touched the article from the raw material to the finished article on the retailer's counter, except the purchaser.  There was a certain amount of justice in that criticism but, in so far as it was not abused, there was also a sound and reasonable defence of that system of price control. But when, under a system such as that, you see group profits in certain groups, not just increasing, but going up by 400 or 500 per cent. in two or three years, and, commensurate with the increase in group profits by 400 or 500 per cent. in two or three years, you see the price of the article to the consumer increasing, then any Minister with a broad sense of justice would say to himself, &ldquo;Something has to be done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the face of those facts and those figures, and if those facts prove to be facts reliably demonstrated and those figures prove to be correct and authentic, then surely there is nobody in Seanad Eireann or elsewhere that would say: &ldquo;Jog along happily; that is the ideal arrangement; profits quadruple, prices go up, the consumer pays more.&rdquo;  Surely industrialists or people concerned with commerce as a whole, seeing that graph&mdash;steeply bounding profits, progressively rising prices&mdash; would say to themselves, in the interest of the industry and in the interest of <Col N="198" /> commerce as a whole, that some of these profits should be plugged back towards reducing prices.  That is the picture.  It is a picture that everyone will read in the published revenue returns.  A Minister gets no more information than is available to the general public.  We do not know the concerns of any particular industry. We do not know the position of any individual businessman.  The returns are laid out by groups, by classifications, and the picture that I have given the House is a real picture based on real figures.  Could anyone, in face of those figures, contemplate a real Government carrying on, being perfectly content and sitting placidly over that state of affairs?</P>
    <P>There is in this Bill a proposal to have advice, to have a liaison group between the Government centre, where prices are fixed, the business people, the industrialists and the consumer outside, an organisation that will sift certain information, that will give certain advice to the Minister.  The Minister is free either to act or not on that advice.  It is a body calculated to throw a certain amount of light on the mystery of price fixation.</P>
    <P>Some people criticise this by saying that there is an expert body inside the Department of Industry and Commerce, experienced in its work, having studied trade, prices and produce over a great number of years and they ask, why discard all those experts, why throw them aside and begin to lean on a group of completely inexperienced people who do not understand trade, produce or price fixation?  Of course, that is more of the imaginary bogies that people are mentally producing. The hard core of the centre staff operating in conjunction with and behind this advisory committee will be that prices staff that have been experienced over a great number of years.</P>
    <P>I have taken a considerable length of time to deal with that particular section of the Bill.  I have endeavoured to confine my remarks to the Bill.  I believe that I would be wasting time in referring to portions of the Bill that have been before the House time and again, that have had approval from various geographical seats in this Assembly down through the years. Therefore, I have related my remarks <Col N="199" /> exclusively to the one portion of the Bill which is new and have explained to the Seanad as best I could the proposals contained here, the meaning of those proposals, the intentions behind them and the spirit in which they will be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is generally known or not, but you often hear a good yarn out in the anteroom or around the House here and there, and this Bill reminds me of a story I heard from my friend and colleague, Senator Ó Buachalla, not so very long ago.  He was visiting a mental hospital in the West and, walking around the grounds, he saw one of the inmates riding a bicycle.  The bicycle obviously got out of control and the inmate got a fall.  Another inmate came up to him and said: &ldquo;What is wrong with you that you cannot ride the bicycle?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;The seat is too high for me.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other inmate, &ldquo;I will fix that for you,&rdquo; and he walked over, unscrewed the valves, and let the wind out of the tubes.  &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; be said, &ldquo;off you go and you will be all right.&rdquo;  The other inmate got a few more falls and then he gave up riding the bicycle as a bad job.</P>
      <P>This Bill reminds me very forcibly of that story told to me by Senator Liam Ó Buachalla.  I am quite convinced that this Bill is really another method of bluffing the workers in the hope, the forlorn hope, that in the forthcoming election, which, according to general opinion, is not very far off, the workers will again be fooled by the Coalition Government.  I have the greatest possible confidence in the workers and in their wisdom, as a result of the experience they have had for the past three years, and I am quite satisfied that anybody who thinks that the workers are going to be directed by the plump-fed political leaders of Labour is merely barking up the wrong tree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often said in private, and I do not mind saying it in public, that the Minister who is conducting this Bill through the House can make an <Col N="200" /> excellent speech practically on any subject.  I do not mind congratulating him on the speech he made on this Bill.  I have read the debates in the other House and, while I think anybody would be justified in saying that in practically any debate certain speakers stray a little bit off the beaten track, I think it comes very badly from the Minister for Defence to tell us to please confine our remarks to the Bill.  In actual fact, that is what the Minister said.</P>

      <P>If the Chair will excuse me, I was really about to defend the Chair and the House.  What I intended to say was that the Minister could have saved his remarks.  In this House we very seldom stray from what is under discussion; we seldom stray from the subject-matter of Bills or anything connected with them and, if we do, we are usually brought to order by the Chair.  If the Chair be a little bit lenient with the Minister or with other Ministers, or once and again with odd speakers, then we are not going to condemn the Chair or the House because of that liberty.  I feel, at any rate, and I think most Senators will feel the same way, to use Lincoln's phrase:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I pray that my country may always be right; but, right or wrong, my country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We must defend this House and our methods of conducting debate against any opposition, even that of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that nobody could possibly imagine any Government doing certain things which would indicate a tendency on the part of that Government to commit political suicide.  My own opinion is that there is a very grave tendency on the part of this Government to commit political suicide.  In the opinion of most people, this Government has practically completed the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so much alive as the Minister might think&mdash;and, mind you, the Minister is pretty wise.  The Government have fallen out with most people in the country and, if we are to take the Minister seriously in the speech he made to-day, and the Parliamentary Secretary in the speech he made in the other House, we can only come to the conclusion that they now propose to fall out with the Civil Service. I never heard such a condemnation of the Civil Service as I heard from the Minister to-day.  He suggests, as an alternative to the method heretofore in force, that an advisory committee will now be set up.  These people are going to be supermen; they will not be like civil servants; they will not be criticised by the consumers and manufacturers and the various other people interested.</P>
      <P>I have never accused, and I have not heard anybody else accusing, the Minister for Defence of simplicity, but I suggest now that he must be a very simple man if he believes that anybody in the capacity he proposes to put members of this committee will not be criticised.  Of course, they will be criticised; they will be condemned and told they do not know what they are talking about.  When provision was being made by the previous Government to set up a tribunal to deal adequately with problems facing the country, problems such as those they propose to handle by the measure before the House, it was strongly opposed by Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, this Bill is entirely unnecessary.  We have not been told what powers will be given to this committee. The Minister tells us that no Minister can give the names of the people beforehand.  I respectfully suggest that, even if the Minister did give us the names beforehand, that would not be without precedent.  We had a Bill last week or the week before and we had the names connected with it a year ago; in fact, the committee was actually sitting, and it was working, so far as we know, for a considerable length of time and nobody criticised individual members of it. We all wished them good luck in the <Col N="202" /> debate here.  I do not think there is anything wrong with the Minister now telling us the names of the people whom it is proposed to nominate as members of this committee.</P>
    <P>So far as I gather from the Minister's speech here and the Parliamentary Secretary's speech in the other House, this committee is not likely to have any great power.  This is called the Supplies and Services Bill.  The question of supplies is a very serious one at the moment.  The fact of the matter is that we have so little in the way of supplies, it will be very easy to handle the services.  It was most interesting to hear the Minister coming to the rescue of the Parliamentary Secretary arising out of his speech in connection with prices.  I have nothing whatever against the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. In fact, I like him&mdash;he is one of the few people I do like in the Coalition Government&mdash;and I really felt sorry for him when I saw the speech he made, but I cannot arouse any sympathy for the Minister for Defence, as I know he knows better, when he tries to justify here the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary on prices.</P>
    <P>On the 23rd November, the Parliamentary Secretary made a speech which will go down in the history of this or the other House for a considerable number of years as the greatest piece of nonsense ever talked.  Now the Minister for Defence tells us, without any reference to that speech, of course, that until the late summer there was no appreciable rise in prices.  I do not know what he thinks, but if he thinks there has been no rise in the past couple of years he must not take any notice of what bills he is paying to grocers, drapers and others.  It is the greatest nonsense ever talked, as everyone knows that prices have risen. One paper&mdash;I do not like to throw bouquets at any paper&mdash;very wisely said that if the Parliamentary Secretary were right in his speech, the best thing the Government could do would be to set up a board of psychiatrists to examine the women of the country, as they were all convinced that prices had risen.</P>

      <P>One of the greatest indications we have as to what the results of this measure will be is that given by the Minister for Social Welfare.  We must take it that any Minister speaking in public is speaking on behalf of the Government and we have a promise from the Minister for Social Welfare that he is prepared to freeze prices. He was talking in very good weather, before the thaw set in, but if the Minister and the Government are prepared to freeze prices, it is an extraordinary thing that they are prepared to do it for some commodities at 100 per cent. more than last year.  It will be generally admitted that the price of woollen goods, such as blankets, has increased 100 per cent. since this Government took office.  It is poor consolation for people now in need of blankets&mdash;particularly within the last week or two, and a good number have been in need in that time&mdash;for them to know that if they possibly can stick it out and stand the racket until the thaw sets in, the prices will then be frozen at 100 per cent. more than they were when this Government came into office.  It is poor consolation for those people, and I do not believe they will allow themselves to be fooled again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago we had a statement by the Minister for Defence on the war situation.  He was being criticised in the Dáil then because of the preparations which were being made&mdash; or perhaps I should say the preparations which were not being made&mdash;for the defence of this country in case of serious emergency.  At that time the Minister said&mdash;and he was not the only Minister who said it&mdash;that the Government was basing its policy on continuing peace.  Now we have the Taoiseach saying in Wexford the other day that anybody who did not realise the seriousness of the situation was a terrible optimist, or some words to that effect.  I suggest with all respect that if the Government did not realise that <Col N="205" /> a war situation was developing in the world within the past 12 months they were just the very few people who did not realise it.  Take the average man who reads the paper every day, the average worker going out to work with spade and shovel, when chatting with his co-workers at lunch-time and when he went home to his own house in the evening and read the paper: 99 out of every 100 came to the conclusion that the world was heading for war.</P>
    <P>One would think that, as a result of the travelling done by the various Ministers forming the present Government and particularly the thousands or even millions of miles travelled by the Minister for External Affairs, the Government would at least be kept in touch with the world situation.  The Minister tells us, by way of explanation for the increase in prices, that as soon as the Korean situation developed prices began to rise.  Surely nobody had to wait for the reverses to the United Nations armies in Korea to know that a very serious situation had developed already?  Surely no one had to wait for the landing of the first troops in Korea to know that we were entering on a very serious situation?</P>

Now, as a result of the developments in Korea we find ourselves in a very serious position.  We all remember the time when we were facing the last general election.  We had a series of <Col N="206" /> alleged scandals publicised through the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>It has all to do with it, because, as a result of these alleged scandals and of this false propaganda, the stores which were laid by in case of an emergency were disposed of. Allegations were made that coal was purchased at outlandish prices and stored in the Phænix Park.  In this campaign by scandalmongers, allegations were made that wood was also bought at outlandish prices and piled in the Phænix Park.  I think that the reason why that stuff which was there was disposed of at ridiculously low prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And you would also pass coal in the houses of a few people along Infirmary Road, and if Senator Baxter is in touch with conditions in this country, he will know that coal was sold out of the park in order to prove that Fianna Fáil was wrong.  If Senator Baxter had driven through the park, walked through the park, or ridden through the park every day for the past two years as I have done, he would know that the piles of turf we had on the main road from the main gate practically at Kingsbridge to the gate at Castleknock have disappeared from both sides of that main road.  He would also realise that the coal was being hauled out of the park to such an extent that it was not safe to pass up by Kingsbridge with all the lorries. Immediately the reverse started in Korea, it was impossible to get a load of turf or a load of coal.  It is being guarded there now like gold dust.  Even now the people who tried to carry on this scandalmongering have not the decency to come along and say: &ldquo;We made a mistake and thought Fianna Fáil were wrong in storing that turf and <Col N="207" /> coal in the park.&rdquo;  The fact of the matter is that no Government can continue to live on false charges.  This Government got into power largely on false accusations against other people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely dealing with the reduction in the cost of living as promised by one political Party at that time.  I suggest that the cost of living was not reduced since then, and even the Minister conducting the Bill agrees with me on that.  Provision should be made, even now, to try to keep the cost of living where it is, to stop it from rising any further.  The only way to do that is by producing in this country and manufacturing in this country the necessaries of life for the people of the country.  I cannot see that, as a result of this Bill, any improvement will be made in the production of those necessaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the Minister for Social Welfare in his famous attack on the industrialists of this country a few weeks ago referring to the people who <Col N="208" /> were manufacturing the various commodities which we needed in this country as racketeers.  I suppose there are black sheep in every fold.  We have a few of them in this House on the other side of the room.  It is ridiculous for any Minister to make such a sweeping statement.  I believe, generally speaking, the industrialists of this country are giving good results and are entitled to make a living and are entitled to charge fair prices for their products, because if they are not, they will not be in a position to maintain a decent level of wages for their workers.  This matter has been dealt with by other speakers in public, and I do not think it is necessary for me to deal with that any further.  As far as I can see, the results which we are likely to get from this advisory body is that they will call before them the business people and the manufacturers of this country and ask them a whole lot of questions. They will insist, in so far as they can insist, on getting confidential information and the only result I can see coming from that will be a slowing down of the production of the necessaries of life for the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it is, when we have a discussion on industrial development or industries generally, we confine ourselves to what may be called manufacturing industries.  I would like to hear, before this debate is over, a few words from Senator Counihan in defence of the cattle trade and the agricultural community of this country. The prices of cattle at present all will admit are pretty good.  Senator Counihan will agree with me when I say that were it not for the muddling of the present Minister for Agriculture in the deal he made with regard to live cattle to Britain, the prices of cattle would be much better to-day.  As a result of that deal, the foreign buyers, to a great extent, were eliminated from the markets of this country.  If they were here, it would be to the good, so far as the farming community is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Various Ministers and spokesmen of the Coalition Parties stated that, as a result of very bad weather, supplies of turf have been reduced and that supplies of wheat are also not what they should be.  A person is always fairly safe in accusing the weather, particularly in this country. I do not think it is right to say that the scarcity of turf, or the scarcity of wheat for that matter, is attributable to the bad weather.  Admittedly, we had bad weather, but turf has been saved in this country in the worst years that ever came, and so has wheat.  The reason for the scarcity of turf and wheat at the present time is the discouragement given to the people, as far as the production of both these commodities is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other speakers that turf workers cannot be got.  They have advertised in the daily papers for these workers and have found it impossible to get them, and, even at the best time, so far as the turf industry was concerned, there was a shortage of something like 800 workers.  The figure varied from 800 up to 1,000 and 1,200. The fact of the matter is that, if they had left in operation the turf schemes initiated by Fianna Fáil, there would be no scarcity of turf or turf workers. The reason the Government have found it hard to get turf workers is that they eliminated the production of turf by machine methods in areas where workers could be got.  With all the talk they had during the election campaign, they decided they must do something to prove that they were sincere and they said: &ldquo;We will do away with <Col N="210" /> this; we will stop that machine; and we will eliminate turf production in this area and in that area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They were not very long in office, however, when they realised that the turf industry was a very important industry and they proceeded to produce turf, if you like, at long distance.  They called for workers, but because they found that the workers from Kerry did not feel anxious to work in Kildare and that the workers in Galway and along the western seaboard were not satisfied to work in Offaly, we had all this cry by the Government about being unable to get workers.  I suggest that it is not reasonable to complain that you cannot get workers if you do not at least make an effort to provide work within a reasonable distance of the workers' homes.  It is, perhaps, traditional in other countries for workers to travel long distances.  Workers on the Continent travel long distances, but it is not traditional in this country that workers go even from one county to another, because they have been used in the past to obtaining work within reasonable distance of their homes. They built their families on that basis and now, when they are not anxious to travel 100, 150 and 200 miles to get work, they are accused by this Government of being unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Workers in other countries have been forced&mdash;physical force has actually been used to get workers in the dictator countries&mdash;to travel long distances.  They have been shifted from one end of Russia to the other and quite a number of them have gone to Siberia.  We have not reached that stage yet and I hope we never will. The Government, even at this stage, should make up their mind to put these machines back where they found them and start the production of turf in these areas and store that turf when the weather is good.  There is an old saying about making hay while the sun shines, and that turf should be cut in a good year and stored in a good year against a possible bad year or two years.</P>
    <P>The same applies to everything else &mdash;wheat, for instance.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us that the stores <Col N="211" /> of the country were bulging with wheat at present.  I hope he is right, even if it is imported wheat, but I should like to hear from the Minister how many months' supply of wheat we have stored to maintain a normal bread ration for the people.  If it is not a matter of months, perhaps he will tell us how many weeks' supply we have.  The sooner the Government realise that we must, in the last analysis, fall back on the farmers to provide the necessaries of life for the people, the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, unfortunately, started off on the wrong foot.  In the <i>Irish Press</i> of May 7th, 1948, the Minister is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Only for the sake of freedom he would make it illegal for any man to plough the land of this country with horses and a plough.  Let no one pull them into a career of taking up agriculture on the terms of the handloom and the spinning-wheel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the statement we had from the Minister for Agriculture and still we are told that no Government would commit political suicide.  It was political suicide for the Minister for Agriculture to make that speech and it was political suicide for the Coalition Government to let him get away with making that speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they not live a long time after committing suicide?  That was 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be economic suicide for the people to follow that policy and I do not believe they will stand for it very much longer.  At the time the Minister and his backers in the Government and out of it said they were basing their policy on the hypothesis of peace and that, mind you, at a time when most people knew that any man with any common sense would base his policy for the future on the possibility of a war developing in Europe.  I suggest, and I have often said it here before, that it is insanity nationally for this country to allow the production of its food supply to get into the hands of people in other countries. <Col N="212" /> It is insanity for the people of this country to allow themselves to be put into a position in which they have to depend on shipping for the production of the necessaries of life.  The Minister for Agriculture in the same speech said that, in ten years' time, the only place a plough would be found would be the museum.  It would be ridiculous to begin to count up the numerous fantastic statements made by that Minister, but any man in his senses&mdash;even Senator Baxter will agree &mdash;that it is sound policy for the people not alone to maintain the plough in its proper place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not if I can keep as I am, and I am hoping that Senator Baxter and the Minister, in their combined wisdom, will be able to develop some system that will enable us to live forever.  The fact of the matter is that the whole economy of this country is dependent on the horse and the plough, and on the people who follow the horse and the plough, the people whom the Minister, according to his own statement, would put into jail were it not that he thought he might be accused of being unjust.  According to himself, he would put into jail the man who would attempt to plough with a horse and plough.</P>
      <P>I want to impress on the Minister&mdash;I am sorry he has gone because I am sure he would take serious notice of what I am saying&mdash;that the quicker he gets back to the horse and plough the better for the people.  If a war starts, anybody with any sense knows that, no matter what storage we put in, no matter what tanks we build for the storage of fuel oil and petrol, inside a very short time, these supplies will have run out.  If the war develops along the lines on which most sensible people think it may&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The election will come about 11th March next.  I hope it will not come any sooner because this is very bad weather.  The position, if a world war developed, would be that, no matter how far we went in our preparation, within a year we would find ourselves dependent on the methods of production that kept us alive during the recent war.  There is no reason why we should not use tractors in an emergency or in the absence of an emergency.  I believe it is a good thing, and, from the point of view of the individual farmer, it is very hard to put up an argument against the use of tractors.  But at the same time as we use tractors we should maintain the nucleus of an organisation in this country on which we could fall back in case the supply of fuel for our tractors disappeared overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest exports we have from this country, in fact the second most important, is the horse.  If the policy of the Minister for Agriculture to make it a crime punishable by death for a man to follow horses and the plough were put into effective operation, I suggest that it would be a matter of a very short time until the horse population of the country had dwindled alarmingly.  Anybody who knows anything at all about the horse industry knows that the majority of our Army jumpers&mdash;the Minister for Defence will bear me out on this&mdash;are bred from mares worked on the farms of Ireland.  Some of them may be thoroughbreds, but the vast majority, 75 per cent. of the horses which jump in the Irish jumping team, are bred from mares which did their day's work on the agricultural holdings of the <Col N="214" /> country at the same time as they bred the horses we are all proud of to-day. If we wish to maintain the hunter type of horse and our show jumping stock, which is a very valuable asset, we are mad to get rid of our working mares. God help the farmers, their workers and the ploughmen if the Minister for Agriculture got where he thinks he should be and could run them into jail. He has said that he would make it a crime punishable by law and I am satisfied he would carry that out but, thank God, there are a few wise men in the Government who put on the brake.</P>
    <P>I have very little confidence in this committee and I believe, as I said at an earlier stage, that it is merely a piece of bluff to try to satisfy the workers of the country.  It is significant that whenever this Government got into difficulties since they took office, they seemed to hope to get out of them by setting up a commission, a committee of inquiry or something of that kind.  The same thing applied to emigration.  In the election campaign, at least two of the Parties now forming the Government promised us that if or when they got into power they would stop emigration.  Emigration has gone on and the only thing, as far as I can see, that the Government did to satisfy the people who swallowed that pill at that time was to set up a Commission on Emigration.  We also had a Commission on Flour Milling and we all know the result of that.</P>

The only unsatisfactory thing about it&mdash;I was talking to the people&mdash;was that the Government refused to pay what people thought were their lawful debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that this committee <Col N="215" /> which it is proposed to set up under the Bill will have any power, but if it will I would like the Minister to elaborate on that in his reply or perhaps Senator Baxter will, seeing that he is apparently talking for the whole Government while the Minister is talking only for one Department.  If this tribunal&mdash;as it was referred to in the other House&mdash;is to have any powers, by means of an emergency powers Order from the Minister or some other method, seriously to interfere with any industry, I should like to ask the Minister if the manufacturer, retailer or wholesaler who is to be brought before this tribunal will have the right to have legal assistance or advice and if he is acquitted before it if he will be compensated for such expenses as he may have incurred in defending himself.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that will not be necessary but if the committee is to have the power to inflict any grave sentences I suggest that the people appearing before it should have the right to legal assistance and if they have that right I suggest that there should be a departure from the procedure adopted in the past in connection with the Locke Tribunal and that any man at least who is acquitted should be compensated for his out-of-pocket expenses. Senator Baxter wants to talk?  No, he is dumb.</P>

We have had a statement from the Minister for Lands which to my mind is tantamount to contempt of court.  As far as I am concerned I am quite satisfied.  I have nothing to grumble about.  I could not be more whitewashed than I was by three judges, two of whom were appointed by the present Government, and I am glad that I am not in the position some people are in&mdash;present company excluded&mdash;who might be and are regarded as perjurers by the people of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is to have any control over prices or the cost of living, I think it necessary that this committee or tribunal should have considerably more powers than it has.  The Parliamentary Secretary said in the other House that the Minister, under an emergency powers Order, has the right to confer certain powers on the individuals who will form this committee.  I could not find it in the Bill but, if he has that right, what is to stop him from conferring these powers on three or four individuals either in the Department of Industry and Commerce or outside it?  I refuse to believe that the senior officers in the Department of Industry and Commerce are so incompetent as to be incapable of acting on this committee.  I believe they are capable and, further, I believe that a committee formed of civil servants, senior officers in the Department of Industry and Commerce, would inspire more confidence in the people of the country than people picked, as I am quite sure they will be picked, from the various Parties forming the present Coalition Government.  We can only assume that that is so.  I should like an assurance from the Minister before he finishes his speech, that no member of the Fianna Fáil Party will be appointed to this committee, because I should not like to see him take the blame.  I am sure the Minister can give that assurance even though he cannot give the names of the people <Col N="217" /> who will eventually form the committee.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that this committee will really stabilise the prices of the necessaries of life for the people of this country.  Unless we proceed to grow the necessaries of life for man and beast, in so far as it is possible to do so, we cannot continue to control the prices.  For instance, we are importing maize.  The price of maize has gone up by one third in the past couple of months&mdash;possibly, again, as a result of the Korean War&mdash;I do not know.  It has gone up from £18 a ton to £27 a ton: that is, by a third.  We have heard numerous statements by various people to the effect that the price of eggs will come down from 3/- per dozen to 2/- per dozen: that means a reduction in the price of eggs.  As long as that situation exists and, at the same time, the price of raw materials continues to increase, we cannot hope to maintain the cost of living at a reasonable point.</P>
      <P>I believe that all we can expect from this committee is that it will have a very bad effect: the best, I think, they can hope to do is to poke their noses into the affairs of the manufacturers and business people of this country.  According to the statements of the Parliamentary Secretary in the other House, it will be within the powers of the Minister to get from those people&mdash;whether they be manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers&mdash; confidential information.  We are told in the next breath that the Minister can, and probably will, pass on that information to this committee.  If he does not do that, the committee will have no business in being there.  If he does pass on the information, then, according to the rules setting up this committee, it will have a right to publish these statements&mdash;statements which, in the first instance, were made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or his deputy, in confidence. That will not make for the better working of industry in this country and, therefore, I am against the adoption of any such methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government, composed as it is of five or six or seven Parties&mdash;I do not know how many&mdash;including the Independents, <Col N="218" /><i>mar dheadh</i>, could not possibly carry out the promises which they made.  One Party promised to reduce the cost of living and another Party promised that if they were elected, or elected as individuals, in so far as they could do so, they would reduce taxation. That policy has been carried out, in so far as it was possible to carry out a policy to please the numerous political Parties, but the only way in which it was possible to do so was to continue to borrow.  The Government have had to continue to borrow instead of tackling the situation seriously, and they have borrowed more than any other country of the size of this country could possibly carry.  I believe that it is a crazy policy.  I appeal to the Government not to continue to evade their responsibility by appointing such committees as is proposed under this Bill.  I appeal to the Government to tackle the situation seriously and to set about correcting some of the mistakes which they must surely know they have made.  For instance, if the Minister for Defence realises now that he was wrong in his attitude towards the building up of our Army, I appeal to him to admit his mistake and to set about correcting it immediately.  Anybody can make a mistake&mdash;that is, anybody but Senator Baxter.</P>

We did not build on the <Col N="219" /> Chinese coming into the picture.  We were wrong.

Be big enough to admit how wrong you were when you accused Deputy Seán Lemass of graft when he filled the Phænix Park with coal and turf.  Be big enough to admit that you should not have accused various other people of graft because they did things which they believed it was necessary for them to do in the interests of this country.  Be big enough to adopt the plans which were laid on the tables of Government Buildings when you took over office and in that way put this country into the position in which it should be, namely, of being capable of defending itself in case of emergency. Big enough to come out into the open and to apologise, as you must have done&mdash;bunch of craw-thumpers that you are&mdash;when you went to confession. Admit that you were wrong.  I may say that I do not mind fellows being craw-thumpers&mdash;lest that reference of mine might be deemed by one of the pillars of the Church, Senator Baxter, an irreligious statement.  This Government got into office on false promises and I say that 75 per cent. of them are a bunch of craw-thumping gangsters, and nothing else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of his last few remarks, I thoroughly enjoyed hearing Senator Quirke in action and in his old form again.  I imagine that most members of the House will agree with me.  It is a pleasure to hear him leading the Opposition. I do not propose to follow him in detail, but I would remind the House that, first of all, he told us that the present Government was about to commit suicide and, later on in his speech, he said that it had committed suicide.  He then continued as if he believed that the Government had committed suicide.  He followed up&mdash;as he used to when he was sitting on this side of the House&mdash;by defending the late Government and he did that for at least half of his speech.  I do not blame him at all for doing so, particularly <Col N="220" /> if he believes his own earlier remarks.  I am very tempted, though I do not think I shall yield to the temptation, to follow up his references to a tribunal which the previous Government proposed to set up under a Bill that did not become law&mdash;except to say that not a single argument that he put forward against the proposed tribunal under this Bill did not apply equally, if not more so, to the proposal that was contained in the previous Bill. However, I do not want to follow that line in any great detail.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, this is a comparatively simple Bill, but it provides us with an opportunity to discuss a great number of important questions. However, I do not think that that means that we should discuss everything that has happened in the past. The Bill itself continues certain emergency powers which this Government and its predecessors believed to be necessary, and, in addition, it gives the Government power to provide by Order for the establishment of bodies to advise in the exercise of the powers which are continued under the provisions of the Bill.  I do not think that any member of this House would take the responsibility of refusing these powers to the Government under present circumstances.  There is a restriction as to what the body can do and it is certainly clear that it is to advise in relation to the powers which this Bill gives the Government.</P>
      <P>A few days ago I was looking through some old correspondence, and I found a letter from the late Deputy Bryan Cooper, dated December, 1925, in which he asked me to speak at a meeting which he had invited his constituents to attend.  He said he would be very glad if I could speak, and that he proposed to discuss the cost of living and tariffs.  I could not attend the meeting, so I do not know what he said, but I have a shrewd suspicion that a discussion on the cost of living 25 years ago was not so very different from the kind of discussion we have to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of what has been said by some speakers, I am satisfied that, for a period of about two years, up to <Col N="221" /> July or August last, retail prices remained reasonably stationary.  There was a slight rise in the retail price of some articles and a slight fall in other prices.  If we could only have maintained that position, I believe we could have looked forward to a period of increasing prosperity for all classes. Since mid-summer there, has been a serious rise in the price of a large number of important commodities, and it is only partly shown in to-day's retail prices.</P>
    <P>Some of us who are connected with trade or industry, where orders have to be placed a long time before the delivery date, are very seriously perturbed at the effect which increased prices may have on our whole economy. Personally, I have been bitterly disappointed at the discussions in the Dáil, and that applies, to a considerable extent, to the discussions in the newspapers.  There has been far too great a tendency to talk what is only Party politics, and to mix it with irresponsible charges against trade and industry.  In my considered opinion, there is no person, or group of persons in this country, who can be blamed for the sudden and serious increase in price levels.  I am satisfied that the main causes are the after-effects of devaluation and the international situation as a result of unexpected developments in Korea.  The &ldquo;cold war&rdquo; suddenly developed into a threat of actual war, and the decision of many nations to re-arm caused unexpected shortages in many goods.</P>
    <P>This has created serious difficulties for every democratic country.  One would almost think, judging by some of our debates, that Ireland was alone in having its economy upset by an increase in world price levels.  Unfortunately, a small country like Ireland can do very little to improve the international situation.  I think the only sensible thing that we can do is to face the situation calmly without internal strife or bitterness, and see what we can do so that our people will suffer as little as possible.  If we were involved in an actual war, all classes would undoubtedly co-operate in the national interest.  I seriously suggest <Col N="222" /> to the House that we, against our will, are involved in a situation that is mainly caused by war and by preparations for war, and that we should regard it as a serious national problem which should be met in the same spirit as if we were at war.</P>
    <P>When a general rise takes place in world prices, there is very little indeed that any one Government can do about it.  Our Government does not fix the price of most raw materials and, with the best will in the world, it cannot reduce them.  The most the Government can do is to see what steps can be taken to prevent some individuals from gaining an unfair advantage at the expense of others, and to see, as far as possible, that our home production is kept at the highest possible level.  If we are going to dissipate our energies by calling each other names, and if everyone fights only for himself and for his own interest, the people are bound to suffer.  There is always the danger that groups of persons with large financial resources may look after their own interests at the expense of the rest of the people.  This applies quite as much, in my opinion, to powerful and wealthy trade unions as it does to well-organised and rich businesses.  While I agree that, under present circumstances, it may be necessary to have State controls of various kinds, I do not believe that State control by itself can solve our problems or our immediate difficulties.  We cannot ignore the possibility of State interference, but if it is not the result of a carefully thought out policy it may make matters worse instead of better, and may defeat its own purpose.</P>
    <P>If there is a sudden rise in prices, serious difficulties are created for every class of the community.  These are felt by everybody except, possibly, by rich individuals or very powerful companies. There are only very few such companies in Ireland, and, as compared with other countries, we have comparatively few rich individuals. But we must not overlook the fact that the hardships due to rising prices are felt more acutely by persons of the lower income class, especially those with families who have no savings and who have to buy necessities at current <Col N="223" /> prices from week to week.  They are also felt acutely by small businesses which have not the capital to cope with the higher price levels and which find expenses rising, without any means of increasing profits to meet them.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest that, in facing this problem, we should take an overall view of the situation.  In considering the cost of living, important as it is, we must not forget that the maintenance of the standard of living is even more important.  Low cost-of-living figures do not necessarily mean a high standard of living.  Many of us can remember the period, between the two wars, when prices fell and there was widespread unemployment.  To maintain a reasonable standard of living there must be steady employment, regular wages and people must be able to obtain the things they need. It would be quite useless to fix prices at a level which would stop imports of necessities and raw materials for industry at a time when everyone knows that many of these goods are becoming scarce.</P>
    <P>I think that the first duty of the Government, the overriding duty of the Government, is to do all in its power to maintain home production of every kind at the highest possible level and to secure the imports which are necessary to our economy.  But, no matter what steps the Government may take, it will fail if it does not receive the co-operation of all classes of the people.  Next to the danger of being involved in war, I believe that the danger of a fall in production and consequent unemployment is our greatest immediate danger.  After all, we cannot share what we have not got, and if we allow our agricultural or industrial production to fall, there will be less to go round.  I think we must face up to the fact that, until we can know exactly how the international situation, with a vast expenditure on armaments, is going to affect our economy, there should be caution and restraint on all sides.</P>
    <P>The rise in price levels makes inevitable a rise in the level of wages as expressed in terms of pounds, <Col N="224" /> shillings and pence, and unless we can further increase our actual production, I do not believe it would be possible to have any general rise in the real value of wages.  To meet increased costs there may have to be a rise in profits as expressed in terms of money, but I am satisfied that no general rise in actual profits can be justified in the next year or two except as a result of increased production.  I do not think we should be unduly alarmed because there are many demands for increased wages.  If, however, these demands are to be settled on the basis of the relative strength of the particular organised workers as against the relative strength or financial strength of the employers, then we should be seriously concerned, because the result on our whole economy may be disastrous.  The people who most urgently need increases to meet the increased cost of living are the lower-paid workers. Strikes or lock-outs can only reduce production, which will reduce the capacity to pay wages.  If comparatively well-off workers use their economic power to enforce their maximum demands it can only result in worsening the position of lower-paid workers.</P>
    <P>Every demand for increased wages should be considered on its merits. There is no general rule which can be applied all round.  During the next year, the Labour Court may have a difficult period and I believe it will play an even more important part in our national economy than it has in the past.  It is reasonable that the public should expect, particularly in a situation of this kind, both employers and workers to accept the recommendations of the court as a general rule and that they should not be rejected except in very exceptional circumstances.  In making its recommendations, the Labour Court has to take into consideration not only the position of workers and of the trade or industry concerned.  It has also to consider the effect of increased prices on the public generally.</P>
    <P>In considering the general question of prices and profits, certain speakers have indulged in wild generalisations <Col N="225" /> which can do a great deal of harm under the present circumstances.  It is simply not true to suggest that our present difficulties have been caused because Irish manufacturers and traders generally are fleecing the public.  I know that this is not true of all manufacturers and I do not believe it is true of the majority.  If excessive profits are being made in some cases, by all means get after them, but do not make the mistake of thinking, as some people seem to think, that Irish manufacturers suddenly started profiteering in July and August last and that that is the cause of the price rise with which we are very much concerned.  Whatever profiteering there may or may not have been&mdash;I think it has been nothing like what people believe&mdash;certainly did not suddenly start then.  Our problem cannot be solved by that kind of wild talk, which only tends to injure those of our manufacturers&mdash;and they are many&mdash;who are doing their best to serve the public in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>Too many people already think that when prices rise it must be due to profiteering somewhere in this country. It is a mistake to assume that high prices and high profits necessarily go together.  The aim of every responsible manufacturer is to reduce prices and increase overall, profits through increased production.  I wish it were possible to obtain figures to show the percentage of the price of each article of common use made in Ireland which represents manufacturers' profit.  In the business of which I have personal knowledge the percentage is very low. It is quite possible to have high prices and low profits or no profits at all.  It is by no means unusual to find that companies who sell at low prices make very good profits.  The two are not necessarily related.  Factors which can cause prices to be high are many and various.  They include high cost of basic raw materials, production on too small a scale to be economic, inefficiency of management or of operatives, low output per worker, high cost of distribution, etc., etc.  I need not go into all the details in order to demonstrate that each case must be considered separately on its merits and <Col N="226" /> cannot be dealt with by generalities such as are becoming too common to-day.  It is also true that high prices can be caused by too little capital and not enough profits to keep machinery and plant in a high state of efficiency. Too low profits can be just as injurious to our national economy as excessive profits.</P>
    <P>The control of prices by the State is not the simple matter that some people would have us believe.  If it is not done scientifically with full consideration of all the circumstances it can do very great harm.  If prices fixed are too low it may result in the virtual disappearance of the articles from the market as manufacturers and traders cannot and will not continue to sell at a loss. It may also result in unemployment. If the price fixed is too high it may cause the public to pay more than they would pay in open competition.  To be really satisfactory and fair, price controls should be revised every few months to allow for changes in costs and overheads, either upwards or downwards.  This is, of course, quite impracticable.  To do so would require an enormous staff of experts.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Government should immediately freeze all prices.  In my opinion such a step would have disastrous results, and I was glad to see that the Tánaiste, in his speech in the Dáil, recognised the difficulty.  It would only be practicable to make a standstill Order on commodities which are entirely produced in this country and not in any way affected by the prices of imports.  I do not know whether there are any. When prices began to rise, most manufacturers placed orders for raw-materials at prices which showed an increase but which are now much lower than current prices.  For many commodities which we import orders have to be placed nine to 12 months in advance.  A price stand still Order suddenly imposed on everything, as some people have suggested, would mean the cancellation of these orders until the Government fixed an increased price. The suppliers outside Ireland in nearly every case I know of would be only too delighted to cancel the orders as they can easily sell their full production <Col N="227" /> elsewhere or get more orders from us when we come back into the market. No one with a full knowledge of the situation would think of cancelling these orders which could only result in unemployment in 1951.</P>
    <P>The position is very much the same in the distributive trades which deal partly or wholly in imported goods. They have placed orders ahead which if cancelled could only be replaced at higher prices later on.  I am quite convinced that a general freeze of all prices is not practical politics and would only defeat its own purpose.  It may be possible to make a standstill Order for some articles but every case would have to be considered on its merits.  This is a highly complicated problem and there is no short-cut or general principle which can be applied all round.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about excessive profits and there is a demand for an excess profits tax.  I have not yet met anyone who can give me an adequate definition of what are excessive profits.  As far as I can see, the general attitude is that excess profits are the profits which everyone else is making except yourself.</P>
    <P>The late Government imposed an excess corporation profits tax during the emergency.  This proved a most inequitable tax and I do not believe any responsible company would stand over its reimposition in anything like its old form.  The underlying principle of the excess corporation profits tax was that if a company was profiteering before the war it could go on profiteering forever; and, if a company was making inadequate profits before the war, it must not exceed a certain statutory standard which every accountant that I know of regarded as much too low for safety.  Before excess profits can be taxed fairly and equitably without injury to industrial production here, it will be necessary to arrive at some agreed standard as to what is a necessary and proper profit. You cannot tax excessive profits without some standard as to what are reasonable profits.  An adequate profit for industry is just as essential to the future economy of the country as is an <Col N="228" /> adequate standard of wages.  I regard both as essential.  One cannot hope for successful industrial development unless we can get fair wages and fair profits.  State owned industries may perhaps run at a loss for a few years, but they cannot do it forever.  Private enterprise cannot carry on without a profit and very few private companies can survive a loss even over a period of two or three years.</P>
    <P>On several occasions here I have urged the Minister for Finance to set up an expert committee, inclusive of businessmen and accountants, as well as officials, to consider and report on the amendments required in the income-tax code with special reference to the method of assessing business profits.  No company could continue in a state of efficiency if it only made profits on the basis on which it is assessed for income-tax.  I dealt with my reasons at length for the appointment of such a committee on two occasions.  I shall not take up the time of the House now by repeating them again, except to urge upon the Government that it should seriously consider the early appointment of some such committee.  If the position should get worse and if it should become necessary by means of taxation to tax profits that taxation should be made on a practicable basis and we should not be faced with some sudden <i>ad hoc</i> legislation which would be almost certain to be inequitable.</P>
    <P>I am still strongly of the opinion that there should be a distinction made between profits distributed to shareholders and profits <i>bona fide</i> retained for use in business which, if properly used, should increase efficiency with consequent larger output and more employment.  It is not easy to decide what is a fair distribution of profit to shareholders.  People will not risk their money in the ordinary shares of industrial companies if they cannot hope for a reasonably good return should the company prove successful. All political Parties are agreed that there is room for further industrial development.  But this will require capital and, if prices go on rising, it will require much more capital than heretofore.  I think we are <Col N="229" /> all agreed that we want to see Irish capital invested at home.  I wish it were possible to obtain reliable information as to the extent to which small investors have invested their savings in Irish companies.  I have no definite data to go on, but I have seen some lists of shareholders and I am inclined to think that the smaller investors show much more faith in their own country and its prospects than do the people with large sums invest.  Now, if I am right in that, and I think I am, these small investors are just as likely to be hit by increased prices as any other section of the community, and we shall always have to think twice before we step in and take action to reduce their incomes.</P>
    <P>The Government proposes to appoint an advisory body with an independent chairman and representatives of consumers and business.  They may possibly appoint more than one advisory body.  The value of such an advisory body, or bodies, will almost entirely depend on the personnel and the discretion and common sense that that body exercises in carrying out its duties.  I can think of a lot of information which could not be made public without doing a great deal of harm. The suggestion, for instance, that the profits of a group of industries should be published might be grossly unfair to the more efficient members of the group.  I sincerely hope that the Government will be successful in finding people with the necessary experience and ability.</P>
    <P>The public must not expect this new advisory body to work miracles in a few weeks but, slowly and steadily, it may be able to gain public confidence if it publishes such facts as can suitably be given to the public as the reasons for price changes.  There is quite a lot of information which I think could usefully be given to the public, information which they do not usually get at the present time.  This information can be and is occasionally given by individual manufacturers, but I doubt if people believe it.  As an instance of what I have in mind, I think it would be useful if the public knew what proportion of the selling-price of articles in common use is <Col N="230" /> represented by raw materials, what percentage is represented by salaries and wages, what percentage is represented by overhead charges and what percentage by taxation.  I think all that would be information which, perhaps not in every case, but certainly in some cases, might be wisely and usefully given.  I certainly do not know of any reason why the public should not know what percentage of the cost of manufacture is represented by distributive profits and what percentage by profits that are retained in the business as reserves or for some other reason.</P>
    <P>Prices can best be controlled by free competition.  Where the Government is satisfied that open competition exists I think they may do more harm than good in fixing prices.  The attention of the new advisory body should, at any rate in the first instance, be directed to goods where competition is limited as a result of shortage, tariffs, import restrictions or for some other causes. We all know that rightly or wrongly the public is not satisfied with the present system of price control.  This is so mainly because they know very little about it.  For that reason I think the Government had no option but to appoint some new body.  I imagine that one of the first duties of the new body will be to examine the present price control machinery.  I would like, therefore, to say a word or two about the general charge that is made that price controls are not being enforced at the present time.  I do not believe that is true to any great extent.  There are three methods of price control: one is to fix the maximum wholesale and retail prices of certain goods and publish those prices; another, which is, I think, normal in the case of manufacturers, is to fix the over-all annual profit which will be permitted, and a third is to fix the maximum percentage of profit over cost for both the wholesale and the retail trade.  I have only a limited knowledge of the working of the over-all profit system, but I do know that the prices branch closely watches the profits of every manufacturer that I know of or have spoken to and endeavours to keep those manufacturers' prices as low as oracticable. <Col N="231" /> In the case of marginal profits, my experience is that these controls are definitely being carried out, and I would point out to the House that, no trader who employs a number of persons can take profits in excess of the permitted margin without the collusion of his employees.  Irish manufacturers have to, and do, mark the controlled price on the goods they supply, and it would be quite impracticable to alter these prices without the knowledge of the employees except perhaps in a very small business employing only one or two persons.  I do not believe there is any such collusion.</P>
    <P>The system of marginal profit control may be in some cases the only practicable method but it is not wholly satisfactory and has a tendency to operate in favour of people who have money as against the poorer classes. Before the last war, it was a normal practice in the lower class drapery trades to take a very low rate of profit on the cheapest articles and to make up for these by a higher rate of profit on more expensive goods.  Under the present system of control, the percentage margin is the same on all kinds of goods.  It is not easy to see how this can be remedied but it is not wholly satisfactory.  It also leads to great variations in price levels, with resultant dissatisfaction to the public, as it is not permissible to average costs&mdash;and probably it is right that it should not be, having regard to all the difficulties&mdash;so as to sell articles at a fixed price over a period of time.</P>
    <P>As an illustration of what I have in mind, I shall take the case of woollen blankets which have risen to almost prohibitive prices in a few months' time.  Orders for blankets placed last spring for delivery in the early autumn were accepted at reasonable prices. Prices had risen some what even then, and traders generally were unwilling to order large quantities in the hope that prices might fall.  I have not met any one manufacturer or trader in Ireland who guessed what was going to happen in mid-summer with regard to wool.  When they came to place further orders for later delivery, they had to pay steep increases in price.  If there had been no price control, most <Col N="232" /> traders would have averaged the cost and sold all their blankets for the season at the same price.  The newspapers, unfortunately, featured the spectacular rise in wool prices with the result that there was a scare and people with money rushed in and bought all the early delivery of blankets at the cheaper prices.  Poorer people who had not ready cash found that prices of blankets had become almost prohibitive when they tried to buy them later on when the weather became colder.  Almost the same thing happened in the case of knitting wool. There was a panic and retail shops were cleared in a very short time of the stocks they had bought at lower prices.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I should like to suggest to the new advisory body when it is appointed that it is not always wise to inform the public of rises in raw materials until after these rises are shown actually in the retail prices. There is always the danger of panic buying by people with more money than consideration for the public interest.  In conclusion, I should like to make it quite clear that I welcome the proposal to appoint a new advisory body, if only for the purpose of a new examination of price-control machinery.  I am not satisfied that they are going to make very drastic changes, but I think the result will be that the public will know a good deal more about the price-control machinery that is being operated and that they will have more reason to believe that it is in operation.  I do not believe that this new body can reduce prices generally, unless and until the whole world situation improves, but it may, and I hope it will, be able to prevent individuals from taking an unfair advantage of the abnormal situation for their own private advantage.  I think we may as well face the fact that this new body will have the unpleasant task of sanctioning further increased prices in many cases because there are many manufacturers and traders who cannot pay increased wages and meet increased costs without increasing prices.  It is not altogether popular at the moment to say this, but I believe it to be true <Col N="233" /> and I think it only right that one should say so in public.  The new advisory body will have enormous responsibility.  It is not only going to advise on prices, but the advice which it gives on prices, if adopted by the Government, may also fix the standard of wages and may further influence the extent of employment.  These three things are so closely allied that you cannot separate them.  I would suggest to the House that this whole problem of prices, wages and employment is so serious and so difficult that in order to be fair to all classes, all Parties should enter into a solemn pact and say: &ldquo;No matter who is in power, we should take this matter out of Party politics and see if it is not possible to combine and make a success of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to say that I agree with 95 per cent. of what Senator Douglas has said.  I would even go further and make one recommendation and that is, to advise the Clerk of the Seanad to send a copy of the Senator's speech to a few particular Ministers.  It may have a very useful effect.  The Bill before the House to-night asks that powers given to the then Government some 11 years ago be continued in operation.  It is not a new measure in any way.  It is merely continuing the powers which were given to the former Government 11 years ago.  We must regret that after 11 years the present Government has found it necessary to come before the House and ask for a continuation of these powers.  As Senator Douglas has referred to the cost of living and particularly to the effect of rising costs on the weaker sections of the community, it may be no harm for a few moments to go back and see how the powers given to the Government during the emergency were operated.  There was price control then and we well remember the many complaints that were made, both in this and the other House, as to the drastic manner in which these controls were enforced. We saw objection taken to the appointment of the necessary inspectors to carry out the orders.  We saw objection to the necessary steps taken by <Col N="234" /> the then Government to give effect to the controls.  We had protests against the fact that people were being taken to court.  We had protests at their being taken to a particular court because of the nature of their offences. While Senator Douglas also stated that price control, no matter how operated, particularly in a time of scarcity of commodities, is not going to have the effect of satisfying all sections, it is well to remember that steps were also taken to assist in another way the weaker sections of our people. Large sums were spent on the subsidisation of foodstuffs.  Special provision was made whereby the weaker sections, old age pensioners, widows and orphands, recipients of national health insurance and unemployment insurance or recipients of assistance of any kind from the State would get, in addition to the normal ration, a special allowance of bread, butter, tea, sugar and other rationed commodities. That was considered a better way of dealing with the position at that time than cash payments.  I think the majority of the members of this House will agree with me that it was.</P>
      <P>There was a very experienced staff in the Department of Industry and Commerce dealing with the question of price control.  I am not saying, and I do not think that those who were in charge would say, that it was perfect, I am sure that the Minister responsible for setting up this advisory council will not be foolish enough to claim that it will give satisfaction to all people.  Price control was in operation.  The Parliamentary Secretary, when introducing the Bill in the Dáil, indicated that it was necessary that the Government should have powers to continue and to give effect to the rationing of certain commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to place on record again my objection to the dual price system adopted by the Government in respect of bread, tea, butter and sugar.  It has been argued in public and in private by those who accept that policy that it is a policy of extracting from the rich the money to subsidise food for the poor and the working class.  I would put it this way: We all agree that it is <Col N="235" /> the working class and the middle class in general who have the largest families in this country and who are, therefore, the greatest consumers of the commodities that I have mentioned.  That being so, the second price payable for bread, tea, sugar and butter must have a greater effect on their cost of living than on the cost of living of the section of the community which is supposed to be paying this extra contribution.  It is a bad principle for a Government to enforce.  If there are supplies available of bread, tea, sugar and other commodities that are rationed, there should be equal distribution of these commodities, at the same price, between all sections of our people.</P>
    <P>When the previous Government were in power and were inviting tourists to this country, it was pointed out by the people who were in opposition then that the Government were making available to tourists supplies of food that should be reserved for our own people and were inducing foreigners to come in and consume them.  That was held to be a bad thing.  If that was a bad thing, I suggest that the system of making these commodities available to our own people at two prices, certainly, is bad.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter interjected when Senator Quirke was referring to the commodities that are on ration.  The same interrjections were made in the Dáil and I expected that they would be made here.  They were to the effect that while the present Opposition were in office, rationing was of a more severe nature and that there is now a more plentiful supply of bread, butter, tea and, in particular, sugar.  That is no argument.  During the war years, bread was not rationed in this country and it was only on the termination of the war, when and attempt was being made by all European nations to assist those who needed assistance, that it was found necessary to ration bread in this country.  We have had a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary and from various members of the Government that there was never a greater supply of wheat and other commodities in this country than there is at the present time.  If that is the case, <Col N="236" /> the dual price system should be abolished.</P>
    <P>If the principal reason advanced by the Minister for the passing of this Bill is that it is in order that the Government should have power to continue in force the present rationing system, we should have it clear from the Government that it is their policy to continue the present schemes in relation to these commodities, no matter what the supply position is.  If that is so, I would suggest that it would be better that this Bill should not pass but that we should ask the Government to bring in two separate measures, one giving them the powers they seek to continue the scheme that they believe in, and a separate Bill setting up the advisory council that is suggested in this measure. I put it to the House that it is a bad thing to incorporate in a measure of this kind just one section and to ask this House to pass the Bill containing that one section without giving an opportunity to members of Parliament of giving their views on the type of organisation that should be set up, the powers that should be given to that organisation and to discuss what their functions in general would be. We cannot do that on this Bill because all we are doing is giving power to the Minister to set up an advisory council or councils.</P>
    <P>The Minister put forward many very valid reasons for the setting up of this council, but it is an extraordinary thing that this proposal should come before the&mdash;House at the end of term and on the eve of the adjournment of this House and of Parliament.  The public and the Government are well aware that there has been a tendency to rises, in prices over a considerable time, that no steps have been taken by the Government, if they could have been taken, to control or to stop these rises in prices.  During the last year or one and a half years, many controls have been removed.  I think the controls have been removed in respect of about 30 articles.  In almost every case where control was removed, the effect was that there was a rise in price.  It may be suggested that that is an argument in favour of the continuation <Col N="237" /> of control.  I think the Minister referred to that in his statement and he pointed out that prices did rise when controls were removed.  If the Government were serious in the control of prices, surely, in cases of that kind, the thing to do would be to reimpose the controls.  It should not be necessary to wait 18 months for the setting up of this council, so that the council would advise the Minister as to whether controls should be reimposed or not.  I do not wish to detain the House in going over lists.  There was a fairly lengthy discussion on this matter in the Dáil.  I say that, if the effect of removing control was an increase in price, the controls should have been reimposed.</P>
    <P>I would like to have from the Minister a clearer explanation as to how the advisory council will work.  The last day we met we gave final approval to a Bill setting up another body.  Many of the powers given to that body, the Industrial Development Authority, are powers that must be given to this new body that the Government propose to set up.  When the Industrial Development Authority give their approval for the imposition of a certain tariff, I wonder must they go before the advisory council and give evidence as to why a certain Order was made and stress the advisability of making it? If that is not so, I do not see how this proposal is going to work.</P>
    <P>Certain charges have been made&mdash;I think this matter was referred to by the Minister, and also by Senator Douglas&mdash;against our industrialists. No less a person than the Tánaiste quite recently made very grave charges against those engaged in Irish industry, charges that are not well founded, charges that are bound to have a serious effect on industrial development. If the people who put their money into Irish industry are going to be accused, as they have been by the Tánaiste, then, to say the least of it, there will not be much encouragement for people to become in any way associated with Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Charges have also been levelled against wholesale and retail traders. It is time that somebody uttered a word of appreciation for the services <Col N="238" /> rendered, particularly during the emergency years, by these sections of our people.  It would have been impossible to give effect to the controls necessary at that time were it not for the wholehearted co-operation given by those in the wholesale and retail trades, by those connected with the commercial life of the country generally.  The operation of controls puts a grave responsibility and much additional work and worry on those engaged in the retail trade, and it is not at all fitting for a Minister to say that they have lined their pockets at the expense of the weaker sections of the people and that each and every person engaged as an industrialist or connected with the commercial life of the country should be put into separate cells in Mountjoy. Statements of that kind coming from responsible persons do not offer any encouragement and it would be well, even at this late stage, if the Minister advised his colleagues, when they are tempted to make such statements, to refrain from doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave, as reasons for the increase in prices of various commodities recently, the war in Korea and devaluation.  It is an extraordinary thing that when devaluation was first agreed to we were told by the Minister then responsible that it would have no effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Either the Senator did not hear me properly or I did not make my statement sufficiently clear. I pointed out that in spite of devaluation and the early period of the war in Korea, the cost-of-living index figure had been held firmly, although there was partial war production; but in the last couple of months the whole world had swung towards total war production and away from normal domestic economy and, as a result, there was an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told by the Minister for Agriculture that so far as <Col N="239" /> the needs of the farming community were concerned, in the matter of fertilisers and maize, there would be no scarcity.  Speaking in County Galway he assured the farmers in this manner:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I as Minister for maize can guarantee to the farmers of this country that there will be no increase as regards maize and that they will have an abundance, more than they will require, and I hope to encourage them in every way in its use.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He did the same in connection with fertilisers.</P>
      <P>On that point, we have heard the Minister abusing the people engaged in the sale and distribution of fertilisers. Every attempt was made to create in the minds of the people the belief that these merchants were making such great profits out of the farming community that steps should and would be taken by the Government to control the business entirely.</P>
      <P>We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce referring to the cement industry.  For a period of three years the Minister has failed to make up his mind on the subject of cement.  He has failed to give the necessary guidance to the factories engaged in the manufacture of cement; he has failed to indicate what should be done to provide this country with an adequate supply of cement.  The position is that there is a subsidy being paid by the Irish people of 15/-per ton for foreign cement.  Because of lack of direction from the Minister, the cement company is not in a position to go ahead either with an enlargement of the existing factories or the building of an additional factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When some of us on this side of the House not so very long ago reminded the Government that the interational situation was serious, we were accused of raising the bogey-man of war and were told that we were doing it for a political purpose.  We were told we should direct the people's minds to peace and that we should not be distracting them by talking of war or preparations for war.  Now we are told the position is serious, but we cannot <Col N="240" /> elicit from the Government what steps they are taking to make the necessary provisions to meet an emergency.</P>
    <P>I have referred to fertilisers and cement, but there are many other activities in relation to which we could have progressed if various Ministers had only stopped talking about them.  It would not have been necessary for the Minister for Agriculture to have taken any step in relation to the matters I have referred to if only he did not abuse the people engaged in industry, people who were doing their best to get the necessary supplies.</P>
    <P>We were fold that those engaged in the flour-milling industry were lining their pockets at the public expense, that a great scandal would one day be unfolded, and action would be taken to recover whatever amount was involved and that the people concerned would be dealt with in the way any Government should deal with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>When adjourning, I was referring to the charges that had been made against the flour and milling industry, arising out of which a commission was appointed under the chairmanship of Senator Lavery.  We looked forward to finding in that body's report some substantiation of the charges made, but having received a copy of it during the last few days we have failed to see in it any substantiation whatever.  Here again the bubble has been burst that that section of the community were lining their pockets at public expense.  The same is true of the various other industries. Persons in responsible positions, who are for the time being in charge of the destinies of this country, should bear that in mind and should be more careful in their statements.  Those engaged in Irish industry are not foreigners: they are public-spirited Irish people who have invested their money here and provided employment for our people, at the same time producing the many articles we require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same is also true of the charges that the products of Irish industry are inferior to the imported article.  On <Col N="241" /> various occasions here we have had criticism and suggestions that because Irish industry is given protection there is a certain amount of what one might term carelessness about their products. Last week, the Minister said here that it was no harm to be urging them on and to be criticising.  If the criticism is not well founded, it will have the opposite effect to what the Minister might desire.  During the last few weeks, we have seen more than one Minister make statements in the Dáil against those engaged, in industry&mdash;at a time when we were passing a Bill here to set up an organisation to develop Irish industry.  If there is any doubt created in the minds of those who would put in their money, or if suspicion is created that certain members of the Government look very unfavourably on their activities, it will not encourage them but will deter them from going ahead with many projects.  More care should be exercised in this respect.  If any encouragement can be given or any suggestion made to any particular industry as to how the industry can be run with greater benefit to the community, that is all right; but we should not go out and launch from the house tops a condemanation of the very thing we are trying to develop.  The Minister stated that there was a crisis probably around the corner but I am sure that the House and the country at large would welcome some statement from the Minister to-night as to what preparation has been made to meet that crisis.  In the greater part of the country at the present time there is a crisis.  There is a transport crisis on the one hand and there is a fuel crisis on the other.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House, drew the attention of the Government and of the Ministers as they came before us, as we got the opportunity, to the urgency of providing fuel for our people.  We urged the Government to proceed as fast as possible with turf production.  Some suggestion has been made that the fall in production is due on the one hand to it not being found possible to get sufficient men on the bogs, and that excuse is coupled with weather conditions.  Neither is correct. The position in regard to fuel production <Col N="242" /> has been this&mdash;one of the first acts of the present Government was to cancel or drop the hand-won turf scheme.  That was to be substituted by a machine-won scheme.  Bord na Móna were to take over production formerly carried out by the county councils and as far as possible that production was to be in the nature of machine-won turf.  What really happened, particularly in the area with which I am familiar, was that no less than 38 hand-won machines&mdash;machines. that were in operation the previous. year&mdash;in the first week of January of last year were cancelled out and not put into production at all.  So, no matter how the weather came, the machine-won turf scheme in Galway, Kerry and Mayo was dropped.</P>
    <P>The second excuse made by the Government is that the labour was not there to cut the turf.  During the emergency the previous Government, in order that the turf producers would be retained during the winter months in the turf district, made provision that they would receive some little cash allowance to encourage them to stay in these particular districts.  With the dropping of the hand-won turf scheme and the failure to provide alternative employment, there was emigration on a very large scale from the turf-producing districts and when a person, a family man, in particular, was forced to emigrate it meant very little to him whether it was to Scotland, Wales or Kildare.  He had an idea that the conditions of employment, probably the working conditions in general and the wages, would be more attractive across the water.  But once he was forced to leave his own little homestead he thought at least he would get better conditions.</P>
    <P>I have here a table of figures that I took down some time ago.  They are not up-to-date but they are useful to prove that we have had serious emigration from the particular areas.  The figures are issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Travel permits issued, 1948, 40,076 persons; 1949, 25,000; from 1st January to end March this year 4,873.  I have not the figures for the remainder of the year but the total of the figures I have mentioned <Col N="243" /> amounts to 70,000 odd.  I think the Minister and the members opposite will admit that the majority of the persons who were issued with travel permits to find employment abroad were from the turf-producing areas.</P>
    <P>The next excuse given by the Government is that there was no market for the turf.  That excuse was given in the other House a short time ago.  The Government, if it were interested in the development of fuel resources to ensure that our people would have supplies when necessary, should have encouraged and should have taken steps to see that particularly the institutions under Government control and under public control would use turf as a fuel rather than imported coal.  We have a statement given, I think, by the Minister himself of the amount of coal purchased by the Army.  I am not for the moment suggesting that the Army should not have a supply of coal, but I say that if they must have a supply of fuel that supply of fuel as far as possible should be our native production.</P>
    <P>When questions were asked in the Dáil as to what was being done to procure fuel supplies and coal imports these queries were all met with the one approach&mdash;&ldquo;there is going to be no shortage; there is going to be no scarcity, and there will be ample supplies&rdquo;. The first thing that should have been done by the Government knowing that a scarcity was in the offing was that steps should have been taken to ensure that the poorer sections of the community would have some small supplies of fuel available. For some months past we have had in some places in the country a real fuel scarcity.  Some people have been lucky enough to have some stocks in previously but the poor people are left uncatered for.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of criticism about the supplies of coal and turf and fire blocks in the park when the present Government took over.  We admit it was a liability but we said, and we say now, that it was a good insurance policy.  I put it to the House that the Government should have taken our advice based on the experience of the war years, and should have taken steps <Col N="244" /> to ensure that the same insurance policy would be taken out for the people of this city and the other cities of our country during the last 12 months.  That has not been done, and the question to be put to the Government now is what steps they propose to take in the coming year.</P>
    <P>You cannot start producing turf in October or November and you cannot start organising the workers in those months.  It is not sufficient for the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to say: &ldquo;We propose to go ahead; we propose to ensure that steps will be taken next year and that turf production will be increased.&rdquo; We heard that last year and the year before, and we saw a decline each year.  It is the Government's responsibility, even at this late hour, to take some steps to ensure that, when the crisis to which the Minister referred as being just around the corner comes, the country will be in a position to stand up to it in some way.</P>
    <P>The same may be said of supplies in general.  In this connection, I suggest. that the criticism levelled at our manufacturers, our wholesalers, our retailers and everybody connected with the industrial or commercial life of the country is bad at this stage.  What we should be doing now is encouraging every industrialist, every importer and everybody in a position to help to get into the country as large supplies of all commodities and articles as they possibly can.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a suggestion made by the Tánaiste last week in connection with the freezing of prices, to which Senator Douglas has referred.  I do not think anybody took his statement too seriously, but it can be said that he has already succeeded in freezing quite a large section of our people who have to wait on Aston's Quay by depriving them of the accommodation they would have if he had not taken over Store Street.  That is the only freezing he will succeed in doing.  If threats of that kind, threats about the Government taking steps the nature of which these people do not know, are directed against that section of our people who are in a position to get in supplies, they will <Col N="245" /> not put their money into the procuring of these supplies.</P>
    <P>The public would like to know also what is the Government's policy in relation to labour disputes, pending and taking place at present.  We have seen from day to day reports of meetings between various groups, presided over by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and we have read of threats of strikes and demands for increased wages, and it is up to the Government to give a lead and to avoid, so far as possible, any labour disputes which may threaten the progress we should be making in the matter of the provision of essentials for our people.  As I say, we do not know what the Government is doing.</P>
    <P>We have speakers, both inside and outside the House, referring to the position now as compared with the position which obtained during the emergency, but we must bear in mind that, at the outset of the emergency, we had not got the limited amount of shipping which we had towards the end of the emergency. We know the difficulties which attended the getting in of whatever supplies were got in&mdash;the difficulties created by having to land these supplies in Lisbon, and then bring them here and so on, and by the fact that a great part of our imports were not imported direct from the country of origin but through importers in England.  We had that difficulty, particularly in regard to tea.  When different speakers refer to the increased ration of tea now compared with what it was at that time, they should bear in mind the cause.  That cause was the failure of the British Minister at the time to keep the agreement made with the Government here that the amount of tea necessary to provide the same ration for our people as was provided for people in England would be provided.</P>
    <P>The questions arising out of the Bill, therefore, are, first, when did the Government decide to set up this advisory council which is proposed? Senators will remember that, when the original Bill was introduced, it contained no such provision.  That Bill was withdrawn and a new Bill containing <Col N="246" /> this provision introduced.  The only excuse that can be put forward is that the Government were forced by pressure from various directions to recognise that there was arising throughout the country a big volume of protest against the continued rise in prices and the Minister decided to pass on his responsibility to some body of persons.  When the original emergency legislation was passed, it empowered the Minister to do certain things.  The Minister was the person responsible, but now the Minister, having failed to take any action for the past 18 months or two years to control or to arrest the rise in prices, has decided that an advisory council should be set up.  What is that council going to do?  It is going to carry out a long and detailed examination.  It is to be composed of persons with a knowledge of industry and of commerce, with representatives of labour and a representative of the consumers, but there is no provision in the Bill for the taking of any active steps to control those prices which have already risen, prices which, according to the Minister, have risen since the withdrawal of the control that operated previously.</P>
    <P>The next question is how this advisory council is going to work with the Industrial Development Authority, the setting up of which we discussed last week.  This authority, as has been said already, has been in existence for 18 or 20 months.  It must have carried out a number of inquiries; it must have examined all the Orders which were withdrawn and must have satisfied itself that it was necessary to withdraw these Orders or to make a new Order, and that the new Order would, of necessity, mean an increase in the price of the particular commodity. Rather than take the responsibility of making an Order increasing the price of any commodity, the Minister took the easy way out.  He withdrew the Order and let the commodity rise in price and the public were given no indication whatever as to whether that rise was justified or not.</P>
    <P>There was even a worse case, sugar. By Order, the price of sugar was increased from 7d. to 8½d. per lb.  It was explained that the increase was <Col N="247" /> due to an increase in the cost of freight and in the cost of the sugar. It was justified in every possible way. Off-ration sugar was increased to 8½d. and inside three weeks another Order was made reducing it by a halfpenny. The explanation was that the outlook was a bit brighter in regard to sugar. It is easy to see the difficulties and dislocations Orders of that kind may cause in business.  If the price of such a commodity is either reduced or increased it should not be done without good reason and consultation with the trade concerned.  Swift changes from one price to another are found to have an effect both on the public and on persons dealing in that particular commodity.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke stated that when the price of a number of commodities was decontrolled the price had risen. Senator Baxter queried that and asked to be told the items.  It is a fairly long list but if the Senator wants the information it is no harm that he should have it.  You might say perhaps that the first increase did not affect the cost of living very much.  It was the increase imposed by the hero of Baltinglass, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, on postage.  As a result of the bakers' strike in Dublin we had an increase in the price of bread.  We had an increase in the price of meat of between a penny and twopence.  We had an increase in bus fares.  The price of off-ration tea was increased to 6/-.  We all know how bacon went up.  Other important items which increased in price were fertilisers, flakemeal which went up to 2/8 a lb., petrol which was increased by the Minister for Finance, tyres and tubes and cement which is subsidised by 15/- per ton.</P>

The list, which is a fairly lengthy one, includes the items I have mentioned, coffee and leather and, in order that we might get some little thing out of the 70,000 people who were forced to emigrate, the fee for a passport was increased from 12/6 to £1. I suppose it was felt that they would be more comfortable if they got it at a higher price.</P>

Promises were made, not to keep the cost of living at its existing figure, but to reduce it by no less than 30 per cent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>They have adopted the means of withdrawing control so that the Minister need not assume the responsibility of having the price of these articles increased.  I assume that the increases could be justified and that there was some reason for them <Col N="249" /> when the control was removed, but the Minister did not take the responsibility which he would have had to bear if he made an Order permitting an increase in the price of the article.</P>
      <P>Will Senator Baxter agree that the price of clothes form some little part of the cost of living and that when a man has a large family he must provide boots, clothing and all other necessaries? We know that ourselves and it is not necessary to set up a special council to tell us so.  We have a commission to discover why 70,000 people went abroad.  We have not heard the reasons yet but we know they have gone.  We know also from experience that the price of boots, clothing and household utensils of almost every kind has increased in the last two and a half years, particularly in the last 12 months.  In most households the price of oatenmeal, flakemeal, jam, butter and sugar contributes something to the cost of living and all these articles have gone up in price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Butter has gone up to 3/6 a lb. for many persons, persons who, it has been authoritatively proven to the satisfaction of Senators to-night, could not be termed under any stretch of the imagination as the rich of this country.  Senator Baxter knows that as well as I do.  The price of soap has gone up, and coal in this city at present is 11/6 a cwt. to the persons who can get it.  During the emergency the Government subsidised fuel for the majority of our people in the city together with oatenmeal, margarine and all other commodities in general use.  There is no use in <Col N="250" /> Senator Baxter or anybody else suggesting that the cost of living has not increased because nobody will believe them any more than they believed the Parliamentary Secretary when he stated in the Dáil that it had not gone up.  My complaint is that, having had all this information before them, the Government took no steps until almost the end of the year and, even yet, they have taken no really effective steps to curb the rise in the cost of living.  All they have done is to tell us that they are going to appoint this advisory council.  The advisory council will not and cannot do anything to reduce the cost of living.  Probably, it will do what the Minister says it will do&mdash;that if the hearing of the evidence is in public and the interested person is making an application for an increase, which is granted, he will probably be able to find more justification for the increase.  I would point out, however, that that is not taking steps to reduce the cost of living or to reduce the cost of government.</P>
      <P>The various parties who now compose the Government told us that the cost of living and the cost of government would be reduced.  On that point I should like to point out that this year we have had the greatest demand ever&mdash;it was something in the region of £20,000,000 greater than it was at the time the previous Government went out of office.  On three different occasions this Government has appealed to the public in order to borrow money.  Not alone were there appeals to borrow from our own people but, through Marshall Aid, a considerable amount of money has come into the hands of the Government in the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding all that, we have the unemployment figure to which I have already referred; emigration is still continuing and now the Minister who is responsible admits that there is a crisis round the corner.  Hitherto, every opportunity was availed of to direct the minds of the people from the crisis that is now so near us.  That has been the line of approach whenever we asked for information as to what was being done to combat that crisis, should it materialise, in order to be able to provide our people with the <Col N="251" /> necessaries of life and to build up our defences, by preparing our people to defend themselves against whatever might come and to build up their morale.</P>
    <P>When concluding the debate on this Bill in the Dáil, the Parliamentary Secretary, in order to get the support of the various members of the Dáil, intimidated them by saying that every member supporting the Government was elected to do one thing, namely, to keep Fianna Fáil out of office.  He emphasised that they should be very careful to bear that point in mind and that any little independent action on their part&mdash;any little independent expression of their feelings or those of their constituents&mdash;might have a very serious effect.  I submit that that statement is not true.  I submit to the Minister and I want to have it on the records of the House that no Party in the Coalition Government, except one, informed their supporters during the election campaign that they would be prepared to enter into a Coalition or an inter-Party Government, and that one Party was the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>I submit that the Minister has failed to make a case.  In his opening speech he said he would only deal with that part of the Bill which related to the setting-up of the advisory council.  He has failed to give us any information whatsoever as to how that council will be selected, how it will operate and what effect it will have on the job which the responsible Minister is shirking.  In setting up this council, the Minister is evading his responsibility and is trying to foist it on some group of people who will be selected.  He is doing so in the hope that he will thereby avoid the criticism that should justly be levelled at himself and have it directed, instead, at this new body.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the passage of this Bill, many Orders will be made by the Government during the year.  Many Orders have been made during the past year and since the powers were first given to the previous Government under the previous Act.  I urge the Minister to give effect to the recommendation of the particular committee that was appointed to examine such Orders, namely, that on the face of each Order there should be some intimation as to what it relates.</P>

Only last week we had an instance of the introduction of an Order which affected a particular industry. Without going to considerable trouble and looking up the various Orders, one would not know to what the new Order referred.  I urge also that if the necessity to make an Order should arise, some reasons for the making of that Order should be given to the public.  In that way, if the Order is necessary, it will get more support from the section of the people affected.  It will lead to a better understanding as to why the Minister <Col N="253" /> has found it necessary to make the Order and the people will be more cooperative in giving effect to it if they really understand its purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to meet the Minister's wishes by confining my remarks to the particular subjects which he dealt with, namely, the prices tribunal, the rise in prices and the various problems connected with that rise in prices, how it has been caused and how, to some extent, it may be prevented from developing further.  That there has been a rise in prices is undeniable.  As the Minister said in introducing the Bill, that rise has principally taken place since the early autumn of this year.  It is common knowledge that a rise has taken place.  There is no necessity for people to labour that point.  Everybody who lives in Dublin and the country is aware of it and no doubt it will be shown when the official index number for the November cost-of-living figure appears.  The last published figure for August fails to show the rise because, as is generally admitted, the causes of the rise became apparent only after the date at which the figure was compiled. What was said in this debate was that these rises will continue. That seems to suggest that the rise in prices will go on getting worse.  If that is so, it is a very serious position for the country.  It stresses the urgency of providing some machinery, either of the kind proposed by the Minister or some other kind, for dealing with the situation.</P>
      <P>I do not think the public generally appreciate the true magnitude of a scarcity crisis which is the result of large-scale rearmament in the biggest and richest countries in the world. There have been conditions of world-wide scarcity and of world-wide inflation, and no matter what we do in this country we cannot avoid the backwash of these great world movements. Therefore, it is a matter of major political and national importance that something should be done to try and reduce, at any rate to the minimum, the evil consequences of this trend of events which everything seems to indicate is about to occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been, in the discussion <Col N="254" /> here this evening, any reference made to matters which engaged considerable attention in the other House, namely, how far the cost-of-living index number truly reflects the rise in prices.  As the matter has not been raised in the debate here, I do not propose to say very much about it.  What I will say about it is that the cost-of-living index number is something really in the nature of an indicator of what has happened, and to spend public time wrangling and arguing at a time like this, when the cost-of-living index number is just a method for making a statistical measurement, would be rather as if a congress of physicists in Rome, when Rome was burning, were to enter on a discussion of the best type of thermometer for measuring the heat of the fire.  We have heard of Nero being criticised for fiddling while Rome was burning.  If a congress of physicists were to spend their time discussing the best type of thermometer in such a situation, I think they could be criticised for doing something which could not be said to be very helpful.</P>
    <P>I rather thought that we would be treated to a certain amount of criticism of the cost-of-living index number.  I had prepared to say certain things about it, but as the subject was not raised in the debate, all I will say is that the cost-of-living index number must not be asked to do what it never was intended to do.  The cost-of-living index number is nothing more or less than an index of the retail prices of certain named commodities.  It is not intended to measure the changes in the standard of living.  The statisticians responsible for it would, I am sure, admit that it has a strictly limited application. It serves its purpose as far as it goes, that inside the limited field which it is intended to serve, it serves its purpose very well.  There could be a very interesting academic discussion regarding the inclusion or the exclusion of certain different weights, of different cost-of-living index numbers for different localities in the country, or for different sections of the population.  All these are statistical refinements which would be very welcome, no doubt, in an academic discussion; but, as I say, an academic discussion regarding the <Col N="255" /> refinements of the cost-of-living index number, at a time like this, would be rather like as if physicians in a case around the bed of a patient with a raging fever were to have a discussion regarding improvements in the thermometer which would not do very much more than the less perfect clinical thermometer to lessen the patient's high fever, and which certainly would not do anything to prevent the fever getting worse or to cure it.  I do not propose to say anything more about the cost-of-living index number.  It was given an importance in the discussion in the other House, in the newspapers and in the country which it really did not deserve.</P>
    <P>Of course, the significance of a rise in the cost of living, whether great or small, is that it helps certain sections of the population at the expense of others.  If all prices and all incomes were to rise equally with a change in the price level, the cost of living would be a nuisance to accountants and bookkeepers, and nothing else.  What makes it really significant is that it benefits certain people and injures others.  The people who, it injures are those whose incomes are fixed for a shorter or a longer period in terms of monetary sums, people receiving weekly wages, people on annual salaries, people who live on old age pensions, people who live on investment income, rentiers and pensioners.  They would be injured automatically, whereas people who are in a position to raise the prices of what they have to sell, possibly farmers, manufacturers and commercial people inside certain limits, they would be able to neutralise or escape to some extent, at any rate, the impact of a rise in prices.</P>
    <P>In other words, the real significance of a change in the cost of living is that it affects, unconsciously and automatically, people without their being made aware of what is taking place.  The redistribution of income makes some people better off and others worse off. I am not saying that the incomes of people should be redistributed.  Every modern State does redistribute the income of the community from the rich to the poor to a greater or lesser extent. <Col N="256" /> What I say is that, when a change takes place in the cost of living, it is not a conscious deliberate process.  It is a by-product of something else.  The direction that it takes may not be a desirable one.  In other words, that instead of being a distribution of the national income in favour of the poor, a rise in the cost of living makes it much more difficult for people on a weekly wage to live.  It actually redistributes the national income away from the poor in favour of the rich.  In other words, it offends all the accepted canons of a desire for a redistribution of the national income.</P>
    <P>The fact is, whether we like it or not, that from the national point of view, when the terms of trade go against us, as they have gone against us owing to a rise in import prices, the standard of living of the community as a whole must suffer in some way.  There is no necessity to discuss at length why import prices have risen.  The subject has been mentioned already in the course of the debate.  I think people are fairly well agreed on what the causes are.  Devaluation and the effects of it are now becoming apparent for the first time.  Rearmament abroad, inflation abroad, the scarcity of certain raw materials, stock-piling in the United States&mdash;all these various factors have contributed to a rise in the price of all imports to this country.  There has not been a corresponding rise in export prices, and, therefore, the terms of trade have moved against us.  No nation can hope in an integrated world, in a dynamic world, to maintain the standard of living unchanged and insensitive to outside causes.  One must accept the fact, whether one likes it or not, that in a dynamic world, in a world where there are great political and international convulsions taking place, no international price level and no national standard is safe.  We have all seen the standard of living in many countries fall during the war years, while the standard of living in many countries to-day is falling during a period of rearmament, over which we in this country have no control and for which we are not responsible.  The point I want to make is that, if we are going through a <Col N="257" /> period of a fall in the standard of living, it is only right and equitable that that fall in the standard of living should be as far as possible equally diffused and spread over the whole population, and not confined to one class of people.</P>
    <P>Wage earners on the whole are the first to be affected by a fall in the standard of living.  At the same time, some wage earners are in a stronger position than others.  In so far as any section of wage earners are in a position to raise their money wages almost automatically when the cost of living rises they are in a position to maintain their real income in spite of the change in prices.  That is a very desirable position to be in.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to accept as almost axiomatic or part of the order of nature that wages should rise every time the cost of living rises.  Variations in wage rates have become so common in contracts in recent years that it is taken almost as axiomatic that when the cost of living rises there should be almost some sort of thermostatic adjustment in wage rates.  Just as no nation can hope to maintain its standard of living intact, no group of labour has got any particular right in a general national crisis to maintain its standard of living at the expense of other sections of the community. Thus, it is not a national right of people who are highly organised in a trade union to vary their money income in such a way that they will always have the same real income whatever the cost of living may be.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, prices must be taken on their merits and wages must be taken on their merits too.  All the factors affecting wage rates, productivity of labour, demand for products, and the purchasing power of money must be taken into account in fixing the standard of wages.  If any group of labour is sufficiently strong as a result of its organisation to raise its money wages to compensate for changes in the cost of living, it is maintaining its standard of living at the expense of other sections of the population.  In other words, there is a distribution of wealth between the different sections of the population not <Col N="258" /> based on any particular equity or merit.</P>
    <P>The people at whose expense this gain is obtained are, first of all, the less highly organised manual workers, and the poorer classes of workers in the unskilled trades who are not so unionised or protected.  If the stronger workers succeed in getting a large part of the national cake, the poorer workers who are not so well organised must inevitably get less.  People living on pensions, people who live on the social services, old people who live on small incomes, will all be poorer if certain sections of the population can push their money income up.</P>
    <P>One class of people who were referred to in the debate in the Dáil are a class with whom I have considerable sympathy because they are amongst the citizens who return members to the Seanad.  They are the white collar workers, the clerical classes and the people who, although they earn their living by the sweat of their brow, are not highly organised in trade unions. They are a section of the population who have to keep up a certain standard of expenses of a conventional kind and their incomes are very far from sufficient.  Many of them pay direct taxation which is not paid by the manual worker.  These people are very severely hit with the general rise in the cost of living.  Other groups of the population are able to raise their money income in a way that this group is not.</P>
    <P>Another section of the population who are injured are the farmers.  I have said already that the farmers are able to shift the burden of rising prices to some extent.  Irish agricultural prices have risen; Irish agricultural incomes have risen, but they have risen from a very low level.  Even at present, with the rise which has taken place, the ordinary producer in Irish agriculture, whether he is a small farmer or the son of a small farmer, still enjoys a comparatively small real income compared with many sections of the urban population.</P>
    <P>Another group of people who are injured unreasonably by action of this kind are people in the export trades. Irish wages are high compared with British wages.  If Irish wages in the <Col N="259" /> export trades are raised or pushed up automatically every time the cost-of-living index number shows a rise, exporters in this country will find themselves in difficulties and the balance of payments which is already in not too good a condition will further deteriorate.</P>
    <P>Finally, in so far as the people in the highly organised skilled trades consume each other's products, to that extent the standard of living of every group of skilled workers is reduced by every rise in money income of every other group.  Then we get to this vicious spiral of inflation.  When wages go up, costs go up, prices go up, and then the favoured sections of the population find themselves unable to get commodities.  In other words, the stability which is so much sought, and which, as I have said, is axiomatic now, is an unreal stability.  That stability is referred to in an article in this week's <i>Economist</i> in striking words one sentence of which I shall quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The stability of the wages in the skilled trades is a deceptive stability based on an ingenious statistical artifact.  It is not a real stability at all because it has inside itself the seeds of its own decay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All I have said, I think, is generally true and generally accepted&mdash;that if a group of workers tends to benefit itself owing to its superior strength by being highly unionised, it is injuring other sections of the population, the poorer workers, the white collar workers, the farmer, the people in the export trades and the people living on pensions.  I think that is true.  But when pressure of that kind is enforced by strike action which brings essential public utilities to a standstill or nearly to a standstill, that is a type of pressure and a type of force which amounts to an abuse of economic power.</P>
    <P>People in this country at the present moment are pretty generally agreed that what is going on in the Irish railway system is an anti-social exhibition of economic power.  A certain section of the railway workers are using their power in order to press their claims, not on their employers, not on capitalists, <Col N="260" /> because the Irish railways are owned by the Irish nation; they are pressing their claims on a nationalised industry, an essential public service in mid-winter when everybody wants railway services.  They are using economic pressure to better their position at a time when the whole nation is doomed to a fall in the standard of living.  I do not for one moment suggest that the claims which are being made by railway workers are in any way unfair. I do not know enough about the case. But I do say that to press or enforce even a just claim by certain methods is in itself wrong.  Ends do not justify means, and just ends do not justify unjust means.  All history shows that when power is abused public opinion insists on that power being reduced. There have been many examples in modern Europe of abuses of power by economically strong groups which have been followed in some cases by a very stringent Nemesis indeed.  I do not think we need go further than the history of our own country in the last 100 years.  We have all read, and it is a commonplace of Irish history, of the way in which landlords abused their power.  They were a privileged class. They lost their power ultimately because they abused it.  Public opinion forced legislation to reduce their power.  That should be a lesson to-day to other privileged groups.  The centre of gravity of privilege may move from century to century but every class which abuses its power will eventually suffer defeat.</P>
    <P>These are rather important issues though I do not wish to delay the House too long upon them.  I have suggested that rises in wages by organised groups may have deleterious effects on other groups.  A rise in the general wage level, far from remedying a situation, may make things even worse.  A rise in the general level of money wages at a time when the price level is rising does not really do anybody much good.  I cannot help feeling, therefore, that the Government is right in the attack it is making on this problem by trying, so far as it can, to keep down a further advance in prices. This claim for higher wages is based on rising prices.  It is a very natural <Col N="261" /> claim and one which it is very hard to resist.  Everything that can be done to hold down prices is important at the present time.  I am perfectly aware of the difficulties inherent in the situation. They have been referred to by Senator Douglas and by other speakers to-day.  I quite agree that certain price levels are altogether outside our control. Many imports have gone up as a result of world causes, but that is a situation over which we can exercise no control.  I suppose one could substitute home-produced commodities within certain limits for imports but, in all fairness, without raising too many questions, I think most people will agree that complete and 100 per cent. substitution is too much to hope for.  In so far, therefore, as the price of imports enters into the general price level it is somewhat difficult to see what can be done about it.  Subsidies may be the answer up to a certain point, but subsidies are expensive and, owing to the type of distribution of income here, it is very hard to find anybody to tax to pay such subsidies other than the people who enjoy them. Therefore I think the possibilities of holding down prices here by means of subsidy are very remote.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I agree with everything Senator Douglas said in relation to not discouraging business people. In general, profits must be allowed, since they act as a stimulus to enterprise. If profits are taxed out of existence by keeping prices too low there will be an insufficiency of investment and a lack of enterprise.  People will no longer have the stimulus to economise or be efficient and they will no longer have the stimulus to make profits. One must remember that there must always be sufficient funds for industry to meet its replacements and carry out its repairs at a time when prices are undoubtedly rising and therefore the depreciation allowed now and the replacement allowance made must be on a generous scale.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I would like to refer, though it is one which may not receive universal agreement, is that I do not see why dividends should not be allowed to rise.  We have not yet accepted here the principle of <Col N="262" /> dividend limitation in relation to our fiscal policy and I do not see why people who invest money in Irish companies should not be compensated to some extent for the rise in the cost of living, at least to the same extent as labourers and the poorer sections of the population.</P>
    <P>Circumstances are constantly changing. Irish industry has been through very difficult times in the last few years.  To go too far back in examining accounts, too far back in an effort to make industry now pay in some way or other for a period of prosperity it may have enjoyed in the past would, in my opinion, undermine business confidence.  I think this process of dealing with prices and profits ought to be a very, very carefully controlled one.  As Senator Douglas has said, if prices are set too low, commodities go under the counter.  Supplies dry up and the last situation is worse than the first.  People are driven into the black market and the very poor find themselves unsatisfied.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I still think there is a case for a strict control over prices in the present situation.  But I think there has been a certain slight confusion introduced into this debate by the constant slipping from the word &ldquo;excess&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; in regard to profits.  I do not think excess profits and excessive profits are necessarily one and the same thing. The terms have been used interchangeably in the course of this debate.  If evidence can be found of profiteering in the general sense of the word, that is of people who are taking advantage of a scarcity in order to make unreasonable profits or to increase prices unduly, I think that situation should be remedied and those who suffer must be afforded protection.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago, speaking on the Industrial Development Authority Bill. I referred to rings, monopolies and trade cartels.  I think they should be inquired into.  I think that possibly most of the allegations are exaggerated or unfounded but, at the same time, the public believes in them.  If they are not true they should be shown to be untrue.  I think they should certainly be investigated.  Earlier this <Col N="263" /> evening I referred to restrictive practices in trade unions.  There are restrictive practices in business too.  All such restrictive practices, whether on the part of labour or on the part of commerce, should be investigated with a not too friendly eye.  I think all protected industries should be examined.  They are in a sheltered position.  I do not think it is fair that business people should expect shelter and unlimited profits at the same time. As was said here to-day, the essence of price reduction is healthy competition. That is perfectly true.  In some of the sheltered industries there is no healthy competition.  Where that does not exist vigilance and inquiry are vitally essential.  Indeed, one should almost view such industries with suspicion.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposed committee or tribunal, it is probably as good as anything else we can get.  One must admit, of course, that difficulties exist. I quite agree that the difficulties have not been exaggerated either by the spokesman on this side of the House, who put forward the business point of view, or on the Opposition side of the House putting forward the Opposition view.  There are one or two suggestions I would like to make in relation to this proposed committee or tribunal which might possibly increase its effectiveness within certain limits.  In the first place, I think it should be constituted very rapidly.</P>
    <P>I think the problem is urgent and the need is great.  The institution of a tribunal of this kind is one of those things which depends for its effectiveness on being done rapidly.  A great deal of damage can take place before its institution if it is talked about too much.  The problem of prices and the problem of scarcities are problems which are going to get worse and not better in such a situation.  I think that the tribunal should be, not only one which should be rapidly instituted but one which should be as rapid in its proceedings as is consistent with efficiency. The suggestion that by appointing a tribunal the Government is in some way or other evading its own responsibility would, I think, possibly be substantiated to some extent, if the <Col N="264" /> tribunal were one that operated with endless delays and if every time a question was asked regarding prices in the Oireachtas, Deputies were told that the tribunal was still investigating the matter it would give a certain colour to that suggestion.  Therefore, I do suggest to the Minister to press on the tribunal the necessity for rapid action. In order that it should be rapid in its action, it should have certain powers. Something that was said about the Industrial Development Authority is true of this tribunal&mdash;that it should have power to get all the information required, to summon witnesses, to get evidence on oath and so on.</P>
    <P>Subject to what I have said already, the proceedings should be as public as possible.  This tribunal is meant to allay public suspicion.  Therefore, as the Minister said himself this evening, the proceedings should be as far as possible, conducted in public.  The public are at the present moment in a very suspicious mood and the best way to prevent further labour trouble and further pressure to increase wages, is to convince public opinion that an honest effort is being made, as far as possible in public, to keep the cost of living down and to prevent other sections of the population from benefiting themselves in a time of national emergency.</P>
    <P>The tribunal must command confidence and confidence in the tribunal will depend on its personnel.  I do urge on the Minister very strongly to choose for this tribunal personnel of a kind which will inspire confidence.  I have got no idea of the sort of people he proposes to put on the tribunal but I do suggest to him that the success of the tribunal will depend very largely on the personality of the people who compose it but, above all, on the chairman.  I furthermore, suggest to him that he should be prepared to revise his plans in regard to the tribunal.  It is being asked to do a difficult job in a rapidly changing world and I think he should be prepared to change his policy if necessary, in the interests of efficiency.  It is more important to get this job properly done than to be entirely consistent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> May I make a final suggestion, that the Government as far as possible&mdash;I know there may be exceptions&mdash;should follow the recommendations of their own tribunal?  If the public feel that the tribunal will sit and make recommendations and that the recommendations will not be followed by the Government, they will begin to lose confidence in the tribunal.  I do think it very important that the public must have some idea that the Government will feel itself almost as much bound by the findings of the tribunal as they do by decisions of the courts of law&mdash; in other words, that the tribunal should be a quasi-judicial authority with the same dignity, the same status and the same independence as the law courts.</P>
    <P>I want to say only one other thing before I sit down because I do not want to give any impression of lack of sympathy with the social problem and what I said about labour a moment ago might be so interpreted.  In so far as the line cannot be held, in so far as the price of articles that do enter into the cost of living cannot be held&mdash;I think we shall have to admit that they can be in some instances&mdash;the Government should make it part of its declared policy to define a minimum income for all the poorer sections of the population, employed and unemployed. The nutritional surveys provide ample material for showing the types of food which are required by different sections of the population.  I do think that regard should be had to the minimum requirements of the poorer sections.</P>
    <P>Organised trade unionists are able to look after themselves&mdash;I think I have already dealt with that&mdash;but there is a submerged tenth in the population of poor people with small incomes.  If the cost of living goes up in spite of all that can be done by the tribunal, then I do think that these people should be protected against hardship.  I think that that will involve, in the case of people in employment, a certain amount of subsidisation of foodstuffs, even if it should cost the taxpayers something, and in the case of people out of employment, some sort of rise in the level of social services.  These are the only suggestions I can make to the <Col N="266" /> Minister.  I fully sympathise with him in his difficulties and I think his attempt to solve them will receive sympathetic consideration from every member of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>In my capacity as President of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, I yesterday headed a rather representative deputation to the Taoiseach and at that interview we had also present the Minister who is in charge of the Bill in the House to-night. The interview lasted nearly two hours and practically every phase of the situation that those constituting the delegation could think of was covered in the course of the interview. We went there in no hostile sense and I am glad that the debate was in no sense personal.  I do feel, also, that much of what we said there yesterday helped Dr. O'Higgins, the Minister with us to-night, to present this problem to us in the reasoned and moderate language in which he did present it.  The matter is so vital to us all that I feel I am entitled to ask, and the country will be entitled to know, whether we are to accept as the voice of the Government, the speech which we have had in this House or the entirely different speech on the same Bill which was made by the Tánaiste in the Dáil on the 6th of this month.  At a time when I, in common with other representative employers, was spending hours and hours of our time, day after day, meeting representatives of organised labour in this country in an effort to think out conciliation machinery so that wage demands would be made in an orderly fashion, we had in that very morning's papers a speech from the Deputy Head of the Government that I am going to describe as vulgar, inflammatory and not worthy of the position that man occupies. This is no time for anyone in the position of Tánaiste in this country to come out with what was obviously an envenomed attack on the industrialists of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said in the course of the debate, the vast majority of the industrialists of this country are just as eager to keep prices down as any Minister of State or any of the vast body of the people described by the <Col N="267" /> term &ldquo;consumers.&rdquo;  It may be a matter of surprise to the House to know that voluntary price control is already in operation by many representative manufacturers in this country.  There are plenty of factors that are making it impossible for prices to be kept at present levels and that is why we at the deputation yesterday expressed the fears that we have, and which I am going to voice now, not about price-control machinery, but about this particular type of price-control machinery, if we are to accept the description as given by the Tánaiste, at column 1819 of Dáil Debates of 6th December:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That tribunal will be expected to undertake the most critical and the most microscopic examination of every claim for an increase made to it, and there must be no increase given by that tribunal unless the case for such an increase is proved beyond all possibility of doubt.  If there is to be a doubt, it is the public and not the applicant who will get the benefit of that doubt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it using too strong language to say that that kind of speech will bring this advisory tribunal into being in an atmosphere of suspicion and will give it a loaded dice to play with?  Is it any wonder that those of us who have industries now and who at the present minute are trying to create and bring into being here other industries look with fear on a new body, the composition of which is yet unknown, that is going to be given these microscopic powers?  The speech of the Tánaiste goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;the public Press will be available to report the applications for increases and to read the examination of the witnesses before that tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are various definitions of communism. I think that could rightly be described as the first lesson in communism in a State that puts its faith in private enterprise.  Who is going to create private enterprise and to maintain it in the light of that speech?  To get any increase at all, whether due to wage increases, increases in raw material or any other increases, every <Col N="268" /> applicant must go before this mysterious quintette with powers as wide as that.</P>
    <P>Neither this Government nor any other Government can control services which are based on contract estimates but which have an immediate impact on the manufacturing industries that have to utilise these services.  Take printing, for instance&mdash;an important and very costly item in any business. Nothing that the Government can do will control the price of printing.  If a manufacturer wants 10,000 envelopes to-day and he must pay to-day's price, then he has to absorb that price somewhere.  If on top of that he has to have a building erected to extend his works or maintain his existing works, he has to pay the builder's estimate on the day he gets the job done.  Then he has to go, cap in hand, to this body which is going to have further powers&mdash;I will not burden the House by giving the whole of the Tánaiste's speech&mdash;to compel that unfortunate applicant to go through every item of his costings to satisfy this tribunal that a rise in price is in fact necessary.</P>
    <P>I am nearly 50 years in business and I have spent a good deal of time in organised business, in representative organised associations, and I am saying now that the thing is impracticable and it will not work, and that if it is going to operate in the way that is indicated in the Tánaiste's speech, you can bury the Industrial Development Authority now because it will have no function.</P>
    <P>In common with other representative businessmen, I am at present personally engaged in the exploration of schemes calculated to bring new industries to that part of our country that needs them most, the West of Ireland, and to bring them to areas where there is no industry at present.  It will surprise you to know that I have got the draft scheme here in my pocket and that is where it is going to stay while we have the suspicions and the doubts that are engendered by the Tánaiste's speech.  In fairness to Dr. O'Higgins, the Minister who is here to-night, I must say that he did not use this extravagant language, this envenomed class hatred, that is <Col N="269" /> evidenced in every line of the Tánaiste's speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister here to-night gave a reasoned case why price control is necessary.  We fully agree that price control is necessary but microscopic examination of the confidential information applicable to all private business is neither necessary nor wise, and it will defeat itself.  I am sorry to speak so strongly.  Because I expressed my fears yesterday, backed up by my fellow delegates, I hope that does not justify the description of &ldquo;gloomy prophet,&rdquo; which was used by the Minister in the House to-night.  If it is to be a gloomy prophet to base your forecast on what may happen, on life experience, and to express that before the tragedy occurs, then I am a gloomy prophet, but up to now I have been alleged to have the average degree of foresight and business acumen.</P>
    <P>There is heavy capital investment in respect of supplies forward.  The only way in which a supplier will accept an order to-day is that the price will be the price ruling on the day of delivery. Will anybody tell me what the delivered price of £20,000 worth of goods ordered this week&mdash;that is, raw materials for industry here&mdash;will be on the scheduled delivery date of next April or May, that is, assuming that the world will not be at war?  When that material comes in, prices may be up 20, 25 or 50 per cent. because, if the present atmosphere of tension continues, this country, in common with every other country, will be glad to get supplies at any price, and we may not be able to get them at any price.  But, suppose that we do get them and that, in order to keep our own businesses going and to keep our men employed, we have to pay the prices then prevailing, have we got to wait in a queue to go before this new body to justify the inevitable increase that world conditions have imposed on us?</P>
    <P>These are practical things.  There is no theory in any of this.  It is hard fact, based, as I say, on the experience that is common to every business man. This is not any form of political criticism.  This is not, I hope, anything in the nature of destructive criticism. <Col N="270" /> It is merely an explanation of the fears that are entertained by the vast body of industrialists in this country at the setting-up of a tribunal that has been described in terms that have not yet been repudiated by any responsible member of the Government and we are entitled to assume that Deputy Norton in the speech I have quoted was in fact speaking with the full authority of the Government.  I hope he was not.</P>
    <P>To the underlying principles we do not object, as I have already said, but if this new body will be brought into being in an atmosphere as poisoned as this and given a loaded dice&mdash;there is no other meaning to &ldquo;where there is a doubt that has to be given against the applicant&rdquo;&mdash;then I say, with a full sense of responsibility, it will not get the co-operation that it would otherwise cheerfully get and which has been offered as recently as yesterday, at the interview, the co-operation of responsible industrialists.  Price control is necessary.  I have said that but there is something that I doubt any democratic constitution, any Government, can do, and that is, tear away all the veils of secrecy that are necessary in individual business.  The business man, for very good reasons, does not want his trade secrets, his whole costings set-up, everything that is peculiar to his business exposed, not merely to his competitor but in as widespread a manner as is indicated here, through the public Press.</P>
    <P>I could go on but I have no intention of going into all the things that were dealt with yesterday.  I wanted to concentrate on one or two things. In saying all that, I must not be quoted as having any animosity to price control as such.  Price control over the past few years has been applied far more rigorously than the man in the street has any idea about and, in addition to official control, we have had, and we are having now, a degree of voluntary control by the individual manufacturer to a degree that nobody in this House or in the other House has any conception of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The speeches of Senator O'Brien and Senator Summerfield, after the speech of Senator Hawkins, brought back some sense of realisation <Col N="271" /> into this debate.  Listening to Senator Summerfield, it was not quite clear that he was at variance to any great extent with the ideas enunciated by the Minister in his speech when introducing this measure.  The Senator may have certain fears, and in that sense perhaps he was justified.  At least, it is natural that anyone speaking for industrialists here would approach a proposition like this with a certain amount of doubt.  I cannot, however, imagine that he or any other practical person could for a moment dream that the secrets of a man's business are going to be revealed to the public.  At any rate, we are not debating this issue on the speech of the Tánaiste in the other House.  I did not actually read the Tánaiste's speech, but I suggest that were he here to defend and interpret that speech, perhaps it would present a somewhat different complexion.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Senator O'Brien on his very clear and precise definition of what he called the misuse of economic power.  He said something that I think ought to be repeated by every good citizen in and outside this House.  The misuse of economic power, either by those who possess it in such a way as that they are charged with the responsibility of handling the financial affairs of a country, by those captains of industry, or by the workers in any particular undertaking that affects the lives and fortunes, the comfort and the happiness, of a great section of the community, is a very serious matter for all of us.  I think Senator O'Brien will to-morrow have his views re-echoed in many a cottage in Connemara, where the boys and girls from England who are in Dublin to-night cannot get home because one of our public services will not operate to take them home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the Opposition side to-night we had, first of all, Senator Quirke.  I am not going to spend much time on him. To me he sounded as if he spoke with all the bitterness of the dispossessed. He rambled over years of history and went away back to the Locke Tribunal and, although he appeared to think that he was vindicated, it did not seem <Col N="272" /> to me that he was particularly enjoying the vindication.  I feel he got little comfort out of the result of that inquiry.  He went on to refer to speeches made by Ministers and to the actions of different members of the Government which, in his view, were suicidal&mdash;that is how he described them.  There again it did not strike me that he was particularly happy about what he called the suicidal actions of, the Government.  I would have expected him to be in a more joyous mood.  If your team wins an All-Ireland final, you will be expected to come out cheering and with a happy smile.  But the Senator did not have any of that spirit at all.  He came out with a strange prophecy&mdash;it seemed to me to be more of a statement of fact &mdash;that we were to have a general election on 11th March.  I would like to remind the Senator that that will be a Sunday.  There was something peculiarly continental in his declaration that we are going to have an election in Ireland on a Sunday.</P>

      <P>I wonder where the Senator got his inspiration?  The whole problem that has been debated round this measure in the other House and, to a certain extent, in this House, is one that concerns every citizen.  The matters involved in the debate are matters to which we should give our most intimate and thoughtful attention. As far as possible we ought to bring an air of realism into our discussion.  If we make statements about the situation, they should be as close as possible to fact and there ought not, even on the part of the Government's political opponents, to be too much extravagant exaggeration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot help observing the desperate efforts of the Opposition and of the propagandist organ of the Opposition over a long period to destroy the people's morale, especially on this question of the cost of living.  The utmost effort is being made to create disorder in the minds of the people, and those who ought to be leading the way, trying to bring light to those who may be somewhat in darkness, are not <Col N="273" /> setting an example that patriotic Irishmen can speak proudly of.  There is no question about it, I would not attempt to deny that there has been an increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth, of course, is, as the Minister said here to-night, that external conditions are operating to raise the cost of many products that go into the calculation in making up the cost-of-living figure.  The Parliamentary Secretary's statement was to the effect that up to mid-August the cost-of-living figure was approximately stationary.  Now, there have been changes in this country and in the outside world since August.  If you study the newspapers you will find this sort of contradiction.  One of the commodities discussed here to-night was bacon.  If you read to-day's <i>Irish Press</i> you will find an article indicating that the price of pigs in England is better than it is in Ireland and if our pigs are to be exported they will have to be subsidised.  After consideration you will discover that that article was written for the purpose of causing disquiet amongst the farmers, convincing them that they are not half as well off as farmers across the Border or in Britain, and it is playing its part in discouraging our farmers from continuing in pig production.  That should be taken into account, but the purpose of doing that is something that perhaps only the mind of Senator Quirke could reveal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having gone on that line, they are talking about the Minister for Agriculture lifting the ban on the export of pigs to the Six Counties and, lo and behold, the farmer here who was only getting £10 a cwt. for the pig before the ban was raised is getting £12 now. Yes, it is true; we got it.  Then the next day that something has happened to please the farmers, you find another article telling how a bacon factory is closing down and the workers are to be <Col N="274" /> thrown out of employment, because the ban has been raised and the pigs of the Republic are being driven across the Border; and side by side with that you are told the price of bacon is going up.</P>

      <P>I can manage to make my speech without Senator Burke or Senator Quirke, and I am going to make it in my own way.  I would like those opposite to tell us what they want.  Do they want the farmers of Ireland to get an economic price for pigs, do they want the farmers to be encouraged to produce pigs; what price do they want the farmers to sell their pigs at?  If that be their attitude, who is going to buy the bacon? Who but the Irish consumers?  Are the Irish consumers prepared to pay the farmers the economic price for raising pigs or are they not?  The people who write these propagandist sheets cannot have it both ways, and that is something we should try to get clear as quickly as we can.</P>
      <P>You go from pigs and find a complaint about butter.  Senator Hawkins talked about the price of butter here to-night.  He could have told the House, if he wanted the House to have all the facts, that while we are subsidising the eight ounces of butter to-day which the Irish consumer is buying at 2/8 a lb., in his day, when he sat on this side, we were getting only four ounces.</P>

      <P>Some time ago, when the Minister for Agriculture made a trade agreement, since the present <Col N="275" /> Government came into office, it was made possible to export to Germany a quantity of butter, valued I think for close on £1,000,000, and sold at the full economic price.  Then the outcry goes up that the people of Ireland are left without butter.  At the same time, the same organ will be trying to convince the farmers that if they do not get a higher price for milk at least the present price must not be reduced.</P>

      <P>Take the price of beef.  Senator Quirke referred to the bargain made by the Minister for Agriculture in regard to the sale of our beef.

The truth is that the situation in regard to turf supplies is entirely due to the unhappy season through which we have gone.  Where <Col N="277" /> is the use in coming to this House with a cock-and-bull story about the infamies of the Coalition Government in regard to turf policy?  I am not going over that old story again, but we all know that the files in the Government offices reveal that there was a decision taken in regard to hand-won turf by the predecessors of the present Government, before they left office.</P>

      <P>You had statements made yesterday that the coal output in Britain is responsible for the fuel crisis on the continent at present.  I have here a copy of the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> of Thursday last, which gives figures in respect of the imports of coal into the Six Counties.  It says: &ldquo;Northern Ireland received 12 per cent. less than its allocation of domestic coal and 16 per cent. less than its quota of industrial coal over the past three years.  It was allocated 590,500 tons of industrial coal for 1950, and it received 496,888 tons, and of other coal it was allocated 1,098,000 tons and it received 900,000 tons.&rdquo;  The <i>Statesman and Nation</i> has this to say about production in Britain, and it is full of sympathy for the Coal Board.  It is a very Leftist organ and stands for all this idea of nationalisation.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Did the present coal crisis take the National Coal Board by surprise? It is a serious crisis which threatens to involve much greater consequences for Britain's whole economy than it has experienced as a result of the severe freeze-up in 1947.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>You have it there.  They are trying to import coals to Newcastle. We, are trying to get coal from Newcastle. The people on the continent are short of coal because the miners are leaving the mines in England. Where is the use in blaming the Minister because our fuel supplies are low? Would it not be much better to face the facts?</P>

There are limitations to the quantity of grain we can import into the country.  We cannot store grain here as they do in parts of the Middle West of America, by leaving it out in the fields.  We have not got these climatic conditions here, and we know how little was done over the year to make any provision for a time of crisis like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Quirke were depending on the slack coal in the park for his breakfast, I am afraid he would come in hungry.  Somebody was talking about fertilisers.  I notice the Minister for Agriculture is making provision to import 100,000 tons of fertilisers. That is something for which the Senator should applaud the Minister because it is something which was not done by any of his predecessors. I was on that side of the House when I tried to urge the Minister to make provision against a war that was obviously inevitable, but there was nothing like that in store in this country when the last war broke out.  Now <Col N="282" /> it is urged that we should have stocks of fertilisers, so far as we can lay in stocks.  We can import certain quantities of superphosphates, but obviously supplies of nitrogen are going to be difficult to obtain, but they are going to be difficult, and are difficult, to obtain in Britain.  That is the true position and that is one of the difficulties with regard to stocks of fertilisers.</P>
      <P>I am not contradicting Senator Quirke with regard to the value of the horse.  I believe in the value of the horse.  I believe in the value of every bit of power, whether it comes from man, horse or machine.  I believe that all these have to be utilised in a time of crisis and it is on the basis of the capacity of our people to improvise, to organise and to co-ordinate these various forces that we will get the best out of the land and out of the people.</P>

      <P>I want to say that there are internal causes for price rises that have to be taken account of.  Senator O'Brien has referred to the dislocation of our transport organisation to-day.  I passed men carrying placards up and down one of our main streets to-day and these placards are apparently being carried for the purpose of preventing men from going to work, men who are willing to work at the wage. Did I hear an interruption by Senator Quirke?</P>

      <P>If the people who are carrying banners changed the mottoes on their banners or changed the story <Col N="283" /> these banners tell and said something like this: &ldquo;Any increase which we receive means that the rate for carrying beet, wheat and peat must be raised, as must also the rates for carrying cattle, pigs, butter and bacon, and, when we achieve that, we are going to increase the cost of living,&rdquo; they would be nearer the truth.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is admitting they were redundant, so that it is a fact, after all, that his colleague, when in office, was going to let these 3,000 men go?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether these people are trying to make themselves redundant or not, but the net result of every increase which any of us demand for our hire is that costs somewhere must go up.  If you increase costs on farmers, make no mistake, the price of their product must be raised, and when it comes to the people, to the consumers in the towns and cities, they must pay a share of that burden which these people have imposed. There has to be more attention paid to this factor&mdash;I think it is a vital factor&mdash;in the cost of living.  The strange thing about it is that these very people who, by their economic power, insist on imposing this burden on the community, will come back the next day and tell you that the price of milk, of bacon and of butter is too high.  We are not going to get anywhere along those lines.  I should have hoped that there would be a realisation on the part of this House that there are difficulties abroad in the world.  Senator Quirke and his colleagues think we are on the brink of war.  Pray God, we are not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>They probably would have risen long ago and to a much higher level.  They have risen because of factors outside the control of this <Col N="285" /> Government.  That is the truth and Senators opposite know it.  In the quietness of their own corners, they will admit it, while pretending to be great fellows for putting over such and such a story, but that is not acceptable and is not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator give us some information as to what steps this advisory council will be able to take in respect of these increased prices over which the Government have no control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have no control in regard to certain increases in prices because some of the commodities involved in production have to be imported either at an increased price, as has been the case recently, or from the hard currency area where, because of devaluation, prices have risen, or, as I believe with Senator O'Brien, for other reasons.  If you take men away from various activities in which they have been engaged over the past two or three years, if you take them away from industry and productive enterprise and put them into the armed services, naturally the commodities they were producing, the raw materials of industry, are going to be in short supply and prices inevitably are going to rise.  It is quite right that a Government should take control of a situation like that.</P>
      <P>Why should the man who is able to justify himself with regard to his demand for an increase&mdash;I take it that it is a legitimate increase&mdash;be ashamed to come before any tribunal and justify his action?  If his case is straight, nobody will stand for any body that will not deal fairly with the industrialist, the producer when he comes before the court and puts his cards on the table.  If his case is straight, his case will be accepted.  If he is making undue profits&mdash;and there possibly are people who are making undue profits&mdash; the sooner that is ended, the better, in the interests of all decent industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that that is the approach we would all make because we are all consumers&mdash;some may be consumers and producers&mdash;and we are all interested in this.  I think that in the situation confronting them the <Col N="286" /> Government are doing the right thing. I believe that they will set up a body which will be able to arrive at the facts and, having the facts before them, will adjudicate upon them with an impartiality which will command the respect of the country and that when that time comes these propagandists will have the legs taken from under them.  The reason for the increase in prices will be revealed and whether it is a legitimate increase or not and whether they are friends or foes the decision of this body advising the Minister will be accepted.  I would hope that instead of taking this stand that this authority will be unjust, this authority composed of Irishmen as it will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some of the speakers this evening have shown some surprise that this Bill should have received the attention it has received in the Dáil and in the Seanad and outside.  I do not quite appreciate why they should be surprised that interest has been shown and that this Bill has been subjected to the amount of criticism to which it has been subjected since it came before the Oireachtas.  The House will have noticed that the Supplies and Services Bill was originally introduced on the 8th November of this year.  Authorisation was then given by Dáil Eireann to have it printed, and it was in due course printed and circulated.  No sooner was that done than the voice of the community was raised in protest to such an extent that the Bill was withdrawn and a new Bill brought in in its place.  The second Bill was ordered to be printed on the 22nd November and contained one extra provision, and that provision has to do with the setting up of this advisory body.  It is clear that the Government had neglected to fulfil its duty regarding this question of prices and the general question of supplies. It is no wonder that the people outside and many people in the Dáil and Seanad felt that they should not let the occasion, pass without making a most solemn protest against the failure of the Government to attend to these urgent, these grave matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> It may be said that we on this side of the House have not been very constructive and I am not going to spend a whole lot of time making recommendations to the Minister, but I want to remind the Seanad that I subscribe and my colleagues here subscribe fully to the proposals contained in the Industrial Efficiency Bill which was introduced towards the end of the last session.</P>

      <P>Senator Professor O'Brien said that the public is suspicious.  He is quite right.  The public is suspicious and gravely suspicious.  I think it would be true to say that a great many of those who hold some measure of confidence in the present Government now feel that their confidence is misplaced. The public is suspicious and not without grave reason.  The question of the cost of living has been mentioned frequently in the debate here and it occupied a good deal of the attention of the Dáil.  Certainly, it is a burning topic among the people outside.  It is one of the most important questions to which attention might be directed in these days and perhaps the main advantage of this Bill is that it has focussed attention in a proper and an orderly manner on that particular question. There is a good deal of confusion with regard to the cost of living and Senator Professor O'Brien dealt fairly fully with it.  It is quite true that it would be better if greater scope were given in this discussion for a review of the whole question of the cost-of-living index.  However, the main trouble is that people are mistaking the retail prices index for the cost-of-living index.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, certain spokesmen for the Government did not seem to realise that there was <Col N="289" /> a serious difference between the two terms and they used this retail prices index as if it were a cost-of-living index.  I am not going to go into the shortcomings of the cost-of-living index. Its outstanding faults are well known. In the first place&mdash;I think Senator Professor O'Brien adverted to it&mdash;by the time we get the figures relating to retail prices and to the cost of living, they are out of date.  Again, changes in the weighting of certain items ought to be made, I think, much more frequently than has been the case so far.  We know that new items should be introduced and that there are change levels that have to be taken into consideration.  The public is unhappy about the whole question of the cost of living.  The public was promised very definitely by certain people that in certain eventualities the cost of living would be brought down by 30 per cent.  The people who made that promise have had pretty well the power to enforce their view during the past period of almost three years, if they had cared to remember their promise and if they had cared to make a genuine effort to have it fulfilled. That promise was not made lightly. The people who made it were people who claimed to be experienced in public affairs.  They had some experience in Parliament.  Apparently they had advisers of some standing. Failure to keep that promise or even an effort to keep that promise has undoubtedly shocked the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On occasions, we were told by a very responsible member of the Fine Gael Party that our difficulties could be surmounted by manipulating the monetary system of the country.  It was clearly indicated on one occasion that it was merely a matter of printing more money and all the difficulties of the people would be got rid of.  It has been said that the cost of living has been held steady.  That, of course, is not true. On balance, the retail prices index has remained fairly steady: it did show a slight rise but, in reality, the cost of living of very many people has changed, and changed for the worse.  I know of very many people who, because of Government policy, have lost their livelihood. The question of a rise or a fall <Col N="290" /> in the cost of living was, in its way, of very big consequence to them.  The income and the supplements to their income that they had been enjoying and for which they gave valuable service were snatched from them.  That is true not of isolated individuals but it is true of very many thousands along the seaboard from Donegal around to Cork.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter told us that the people have more money to spend.  I am sure some people have more money to spend but I am sure, from interviews with people who came to me on occasions&mdash;not merely road workers and builders' labourers but tradesmen, such as butchers and professional people, such as teachers, and so forth&mdash;whatever Senator Baxter may say about more money, that these people have experienced increasing difficulties during the past two and a half or three years.  Senator Baxter talked about more cars on the roads as being an indication of the prosperity of the people. I only hope that I shall see the day when every man who wishes to have a car may have one.  However, I can remember very vividly the occasions when Senator Baxter and his colleagues denounced the Fianna Fáil Government because motor cars appeared in considerable numbers in O'Connell Street after the war.  Fianna Fáil was denounced at the time as being responsible for providing people with gains of an ill-gotten nature, and it was said by certain people that the presence of these cars and the ability of people to run them was an indication of the failure of the Fianna Fáil Government. If that is true of Fianna Fáil, then I can only say that the huge increase in the numbers of cars in recent years is a downright condemnation of the present Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Professor O'Brien said that the public is suspicious&mdash;and why should it not be suspicious?  The failure to implement election promises with regard to the cost of living, the failure to reduce taxation, the failure to carry out the recommendations of the commissions or committees appointed by the Government, when, from the manner in which these commissions were appointed, it was understood <Col N="291" /> their recommendations would be implemented, all these things have created not alone suspicion in the minds of the people but have shocked them.</P>
    <P>Anyway, this Bill has led to the criticism of the Government which we have had during the past three or four weeks.  As an instance, some one mentioned here this evening, I think it was Senator O'Brien, the Roe Committee. From the way that committee was appointed, it was evident what the recommendations would be.  The majority of its members were of a certain mind.  Yet, the treatment of that committee's recommendations was nothing less than scandalous when all the circumstances are taken into account.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the attacks on industry by the Tánaiste and by other people supporting the Coalition during the last year or two. Surely, the information relating to industries must be available to the Government already.  During the term of office of the last Government, the Leader of the Labour Party, the present Tánaiste, was very vocal on the profits that were being made by industrialists. After assuming the office of Tánaiste, he indicated that he had examined the balance sheets of Irish industries, and said that from his investigations of these balance sheets, he had come to the conclusion that the owners of these businesses had got away with exorbitant profits&mdash;to such an extent that they ought to be imprisoned. He was either honest or dishonest in his criticisms of these people.  If he knew that Irish industrialists had been acting unfairly and unjustly towards the community when he was in opposition and when he became Tánaiste, why did he wait for three years to take some steps to rectify, what he considered to be a grievous wrong?</P>
    <P>There has been a prices section in the Department of Industry and Commerce for a long time.  It seems to be a growing habit with us to throw bouquets at our higher civil servants. I do not think these bouquets are out of place.  As regards the civil servants whom we have met we have learned to <Col N="292" /> respect them, and, by and large, we have learned to trust them.  They must have gathered a considerable amount of information from their practical investigations and from their reports of various kinds regarding the level of prices and profits.  We have had for some years now a Labour Court functioning. One of its duties is to report on price trends, to consider wage levels and wage values.  If the Government wanted specific information it might have gone there and asked for it.  We have had functioning for about 20 months the authority which is known as the Industrial Development Authority. Last week, when the Seanad was discussing the Bill dealing with that authority, it noticed that, in several places, the question of prices was adverted to, and that the duty was placed on this authority to investigate prices, the effect of tariffs on prices and so on and duly to report to the Government.</P>
    <P>We have had <i>ad hoc</i> committees. We have had a special committee of eminent people appointed to investigate the prices of flour and bread.  We all remember the speech which the Minister for External Affairs delivered in County Cork&mdash;in Youghal, to the best of my recollection&mdash;in which he threatened to expose the people engaged in this industry.  He indicated that if the public knew of the gains accruing to those people it would be shocked.  He had ample opportunity of bringing forth this evidence himself or of placing it before the three gentlemen who comprised this flour and bread inquiry committee.  Certainly, as far as the Minister for External Affairs is concerned, and as far as those who have been levelling these charges of excessive profits against those engaged in the bread and flour industry are concerned, their whole case has been a flop.</P>
    <P>Further information is obtainable, if necessary, from the revenue commissioners. They have pretty full information on the results of the trading of businesses, not alone of registered companies but of all types of business, and they would have been in a position to indicate fairly generally to the Government what the position was <Col N="293" /> with regard to this question of profits. Why did the Government wait so long to take this action?  It seems to me that the Government simply buried its head in the sand and refused to listen to the appeals made to it to make some effort to fulfil its promises, and so the position has deteriorated to what it is to-day.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked&mdash;I need not debate it now&mdash;as to whether prices are reasonable or not, whether profits are reasonable or not, and as to what constitutes a reasonable level of profit.  I agree with Senator O'Brien that this question of profits is one of very great importance.  I believe that people who are willing to save and put their money into business are entitled to a reasonable return on their money.  If 5 per cent. was a reasonable return in, say, 1938, would it be held that 5 per cent. is a reasonable return at present?  I am aware of a few cases, at any rate, where people are dependent on what comes to them in the way of dividends and interest. I can only say that in these cases where the rates have not changed the situation of these people is anything but one to be envied.  I believe that people ought to get a reasonable level of profit.  Who is going to decide what that level should be?  If the Government has strong views about it, and from the speeches of some of its members during the term of office of the last Government and from their speeches during the last general election one must conclude that they had strong and definite views, why did they not do something about these matters in the meantime?  It is a crime against the nation that the Government has failed to make adequate provision to meet the crisis.</P>
    <P>Fuel has been mentioned.  One would think that the fuel difficulty is one that arose only the other day.  On several occasions in this House I adverted to the fact that fuel was in short supply, in Galway one day, in Sligo another day and in Ennis another day, and that has been the position for some years past.  When one goes to the merchants' offices, if the notice is not already hanging up &ldquo;No coal, no turf, no blocks,&rdquo; then you are politely told on <Col N="294" /> making the inquiry that the fuel is not available.  That is something which has arisen time and again during the past two and a half or three years.  It is something of much longer than recent development.</P>
    <P>The failure to make provision for certain industrial supplies is also one on which the Government must be censured.  Senator Hawkins referred to the question of cement supplies.  One might mention others.  Senator Baxter would probably be interested in the supply of nitrates.  Surely an investigation into the possibility of supplying that valuable fertiliser should, instead of being curtailed, be pushed ahead. Should anything happen, it certainly will be a commodity which will be hard to get.  We know what its absence meant to us during the last war.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Government has failed to take adequate steps to ensure this country's food supply, as it has failed to take proper steps to ensure reasonable supplies of feeding stuffs.  I only wish that we had a somewhat saner Minister for Agriculture than we have had in the last few years.  Might I quote this gem from one of his speeches?  Talking of a tillage policy, and so on, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If that policy involves growing barley and brewing it into beer to intoxicate the British people in order to get their money to spend it in France or America, I will do it.  I will glory in that policy of brewing beer that will intoxicate quicker than any beer in the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It surely would have been much more in keeping with his responsibilities, with his dignity and with his duty to this country if he had taken some steps to ensure an adequate supply of the essential foodstuffs for this country should the emergency which we all dread develop.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of the balance of trade and the balance of payments.  During the period of Fianna Fáil these were matters that were continually adverted to.  The Government of the day was accused of failure because these accounts were not in balance and were not more favourable to the nation than <Col N="295" /> they were.  Certainly, in view of the opportunities given, in view of the easing in supplies over most of the period of office of the present Government, much more might be expected in these matters than has materialised.</P>
    <P>Labour unrest is as grave now as it ever was.  I want to join with those who have expressed the hope that the sanest of counsels will prevail among the trade union leaders and the trade unions.  I realise, like the speakers who adverted to the matter this evening, the grave danger that may flow to the whole Irish economy if the greatest care is not exercised in regard to the claims which are being made.  It is not for me at this juncture to pass judgment on anything that has been done or that has been projected.  I only hope that the sanest counsels will prevail and that the nation will not be pushed into a much more dangerous condition than it is in at the present time.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I do not know whether the trade unions are still against the idea of incentives in the way of piece work.  There are many ways in which workers might be encouraged to do more in their own interests and in the interests of the nation.  As one who has worked under the time system and who has worked and worked hard under the piece rate system, I plump for the piece rate system.  I have not yet heard any argument to convince me that it is not a good system.  It is not applicable in all cases, but, where it is applicable, <Col N="296" /> I should like to see both labour leaders and employers sit down to a discussion of the matter and I would like to see and would hope to see the introduction of the system in consequence of that discussion.</P>
    <P>We have had endless commissions and committees appointed to deal with matters which the Government itself should have dealt with.  It is because of the failure of the Government to deal with these things that the suspicion to which Senator O'Brien adverted exists.</P>
    <P>I move the Adjournment of the debate.</P>

The only other business which it is proposed to transact to-morrow is the Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, with advertence to Senator O'Connell's motion which also concerns the Minister for Education. Therefore, I move the Adjournment until 11 a.m. to-morrow.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 11 a.m. on Wednesday, 20th December.</P>
