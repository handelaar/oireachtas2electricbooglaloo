    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is in its simplest form this year; there are no clauses with regard to a Counterpart Fund, and there have been certain other finance measures.  It is a routine but an essential feature of our finance system.  The purposes are twofold. <Col N="610" /> Firstly, it authorises the issue from the Central Fund of the balance of the amount granted to meet the cost of the supply services for the year, and, secondly, it appropriates to the proper supply services and purposes the sums that have been granted by the Dáil that so far remain unappropriated.</P>
      <P>This attaches itself to the Central Fund Act of the year.  Under the Central Fund Act, 1950, there was authorised the issue from the fund of such part of the moneys required for the year as was voted on account by the Dáil.  That amounted to £26,710,660.  A further issue of £51,615,593, provided for in the first section of this year's Appropriation Bill, will make available for the services of the year the total amount asked for in the 1950-51 Estimates. There are also included the Supplementary Estimates voted by the Dáil since 31st March, 1950.  This amounts, roughly, to a trifle short of £200,000.</P>
      <P>In the second respect, the point of appropriation, this Bill is designed to give final and statutory effect to the Vote on Account, and to the special resolutions agreed to by the Dáil following the detailed consideration of the Estimates and the Supplementary Estimates.  Section 3 provides that each grant provided for the current financial year shall be expended on the services to which the Schedule to the Bill appropriates it.  It provides for the formal appropriation of supplementary grants for 1949-50 that were not covered by the Appropriation Act of last year, and it further provides that the Appropriations-in-Aid may be expended on the services indicated.</P>
      <P>Section 2 has the usual provision in regard to borrowing, enabling the Minister for Finance to make borrowings under the limitation set out in the section.  The borrowing must not exceed £51,615,593 authorised to be issued out of the Central Fund by Section 1.  Of course, nothing like that amount of borrowing will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is, as the Minister states, an essential part of the many finance <Col N="611" /> measures put before this and the other House.  It is more important to this House, having regard to the fact that this House has not an opportunity of discussing the Estimates individually.</P>
      <P>Here we have set out in the Bill more or less the whole field of Estimates for the coming year.  One, I am sure, would be compelled to observe the very brief statement the Minister made in putting this Bill before the House.  That seems to be his usual form.  Last year we drew the attention of the House to the same practice and pointed out that it would be well if more information were given.  Only a few weeks ago we had a discussion on the Finance Bill.  On that occasion more than one member of this House drew attention to the present position, particularly the situation in Europe, and we tried to get from the Minister some indication of Government policy and what the Government propose to do to bring this country through any emergency that may arise as result of what some of us thought at that time might take place and what has since actually taken place.  We were accused on that day of starting a campaign of warmongering, of trying to excite the people, to distract their attention from other things.</P>
      <P>I put it to the House to-day that the one question exercising the minds of the people is the policy of the Government and the steps they propose to take to provide for that to which many of us drew attention here on the last occasion.  We were asked by some Senators on the other side whether we advocated the drafting of men into the Army for the simple purpose of forming fours.  You can always over-estimate and always draw some red herring across any argument. When we spoke from this side, we had in mind that the people desire some indication as to the Government's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the past approach of two persons who now hold key positions. One key position is that of the Minister for Defence, who is charged with the responsibility of the Army, <Col N="612" /> the maintenance of discipline and provision of equipment.  He is charged in no small way with the direction of Government policy in regard to that Army and how it may be utilised.  The people are fully aware of his attitude during the emergency out of which we have hardly passed yet, and particularly his approach to the maintenance of neutrality.  Statements were made from time to time, and one particular statement was that if a parliamentary decision had to be taken by vote, he, for one, would not vote for the policy of neutrality.  Other members of the present Government, on that occasion and as far back as 1938, were predicting that war would come and that we could not maintain any semblance of neutrality and must be involved in it.  It is natural, therefore, to expect that the people should have some anxiety as to Government policy and as to the preparations being made.</P>
    <P>The next responsible Department which would be called upon to make the greatest contribution, should the present state of Europe deteriorate to such an extent that we would find ourselves in a new state of emergency, is the Department of Agriculture.  The people&mdash;the farmers, particularly&mdash; remember quite well the policy of the present Minister for Agriculture and his attitude to the provision by our farmers of food for the people.  These matters create no small amount of anxiety amongst our people.</P>
    <P>We had a statement from the Minister for Defence recently that we were driven willy-nilly into a policy of neutrality.  Since we spoke on this matter in the House on the Finance Bill, certain events have taken place and now we want to put a few questions to the present Minister.  Having regard to the events of the last few weeks, it would serve a useful national purpose if in his reply to this debate, he would give an outline of the steps proposed to be taken by the Government.  We have the experience of the past emergency. We know where our failings were, particularly in supplies.  We saw our transport system brought practically to a standstill.  Prophecies were made by the members who now compose <Col N="613" /> the Government, that we need take no heed, that all the food we required in the way of flour, sugar, tea, and so on, would be made available from both the British and the American people, and not alone that but that it would be shipped here in ships owned by those States.</P>
    <P>As regards the shipment of goods from America during the last war, we know quite well that the only American ship that entered an Irish port during that war was a ship that came into Galway Harbour, not for the purpose&mdash; as prophesied by no less a person than the present Minister&mdash;of bringing food in here, but for the purpose of taking American citizens away from this country to safety in America.  I want to ask the Minister if the present policy is now being given effect to, and if there will be a reliance on that provision which the Minister himself prophesied would be made during the last war.</P>
    <P>We would like to know what provision is being made for supplies of fuel for transport and what provision is being made for storage.  We have heard much in recent months about the land rehabilitation scheme.  We have heard of the amount of machinery that is being purchased and brought in. We would like to know now what provision is being made to keep that machinery in motion.  Is storage being made available?  Are steps being taken to make that storage available, so as to have sufficient oils of various kinds to keep the machinery moving?  In the last war, we knew that our farmers were hard pressed to maintain the production of essential foods.  One of the first steps to be taken immediately fertilisers were procurable would be, it was promised, to give them to the farmers at a most reasonable charge, in ample quantities.  Now that we are almost on the threshold&mdash;if we have not passed that stage&mdash;of what might be called another great European emergency or war, no matter what our attitude may be, whether we are driven to take part in it or whether we are in a position to maintain our neutrality, we are bound to come under its effects.  What steps have the Government taken to ensure ample <Col N="614" /> supplies of fertilisers and to make storage available, so that if our farmers are once more compelled to provide our food they will be given a better opportunity than they had on the last occasion?  I do not wish to dwell too long upon this matter, but I think it would be well that the Minister should give some indication on it in order to case the minds of the people.</P>
    <P>We come then to an examination of the Bill itself.  That might, perhaps, be more effectively done on the Committee Stage, but there are one or two items to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention on this stage.  Considerable sums of money have been made available in practically all Departments for expenditure of one kind or another, but there is nothing in the Bill, or in any financial measure so far introduced, which would indicate that any steps are being taken to implement the promises made by the Parties now forming the Coalition Government prior to the last general election.  We still have quite a number of unemployed. We still have emigration. I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the incidence of unemployment and emigration is far higher in the congested areas than elsewhere in the country.  It is from Galway, Mayo, Donegal and Kerry that the great numbers of our people are forced to emigrate in order to find employment abroad.  The tide of emigration still flows on.  There is no provision in this Bill which would lead one to suppose that the Government is coming to the rescue of the people living in what is commonly called the Gaeltacht.  There is no provision made to provide even temporary employment for them.  There is no inducement given to them to remain here.  In that direction the Government has failed.</P>
    <P>I think we should be given some information by the Minister about the commission that was set up with such a blowing of trumpets on the formation of the Coalition Government to consider and report on the problem of emigration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the Emigration Commission?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his Government set up a commission to inquire into the causes and effect of emigration two and a half years ago. I do not know how many meetings that commission has held.  I do not wish to criticise the personnel of the commission.  I feel it is faced with a very difficult problem and that they are doing their best to collate all the information and to make recommendations as to how the problem can be dealt with in the future.  While they are sitting, the tide of emigration continues.  There is no provision in this Bill which would lead one to suppose that any steps are being taken to stem the tide of emigration, particularly from the areas to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator mean that there is no specific sum against emigration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I would say there is about £25,000,000 in this Bill towards stopping emigration and most of it is expenditure to which you object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to what is a national problem.  That problem is gravest in the particular areas that have suffered most all down through the centuries and where the people have maintained the Irish language and the Irish way of life.  It is from these districts that emigration is greatest at all times.  I suggest there is no provision in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are millions in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision made for many schemes, but there is no provision to help the particular districts to which I have referred.  We would like to have some information from the Minister as to when we may expect to have the report of that <Col N="616" /> commission.  Has the commission already presented its report?  When will that report be made public?  When will steps be taken to implement the recommendations made in the report?</P>
      <P>There was another commission set up over which the former Attorney-General, a member of this House, presided as chairman.  That was set up to inquire into the subsidy given to the millers.  For many years we heard criticisms made of that subsidy. I understand that body made its report and recommendations some time back, but the report has not yet been made public.  I think the public is entitled to know what recommendations were made.  I think they are entitled to know what the findings are and what steps the Government proposes to take to implement those findings. It was suggested by one responsible Minister at one stage that the milling industry should be taken over and run by the State.  That might be a solution.  I do not know whether or not the Government is prepared to adopt that suggestion.  If it is discovered that the millers, as has been suggested, lined their pockets at the expense of the people, what steps does the Government propose to take to take back a little of the lining? If the millers have not lined their pockets and if the payment of the subsidy was justified and should be continued, it is well that the public should know that that is so.  It is well that that admission should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in this measure for grants to harbours.  Senator Concannon made a special plea to the Minister on the last occasion he was in the House for sympathetic consideration to an application made by the Galway Harbour Commissioners for a grant towards the development of that harbour. As a result of an interview between the harbour board and the Department of Industry and Commerce, we were disappointed last week to discover that the harbour authorities had been told that they must go back and prepare a more modest scheme. The scheme put forward and the plans prepared were a very costly item and they were presented to the Department of Industry and Commerce for its consideration. <Col N="617" /> Now we are told that we must prepare a more modest scheme. We have had a feeling in the West for a long time that the attitude in Dublin is that anything is good enough for the West.  A considerable amount of money has already been expended on the development of Galway Harbour.  The Minister himself recently referred here to wasteful expenditure on roads and he painted a graphic picture of men employed on a piece of road work to-day and the whole thing being dug up again to-morrow.  I think a lead should be given in this matter by a responsible Department.  I think that wasteful activities should not be entered into.  The fact that the Galway Harbour Board was told that it must be content with a more modest scheme leads one to believe that patchwork will be the order of the day.  Now the Galway Harbour Board is told it must accept a more modest scheme and some years hence it will be told to prepare a proper scheme.  To my mind that is a complete waste of money.  Time, materials and men are wasted carrying out small works.  I think a lead should be given by the State in this particular matter.  I agree with the Minister that a certain amount of expenditure carried out by local authorities in connection with roads in the way he described is wasteful.  The job should be tackled properly at the beginning.  I appeal to the Minister to have this matter of making sufficient moneys available to the Galway Harbour Commissioners reconsidered so that they can go ahead with the original scheme outlined by their engineers.</P>
    <P>We also have provision made in this Bill for public works.  I think that what I have just said would apply to public works.  Sometimes we see works carried out, even in this House, under the heading of public works which one would not entirely agree with.  One feels that it could be more efficiently carried out if given to a contractor. This Bill provides that moneys be made available for public works.  This, probably, is the last occasion on which we shall have an opportunity of referring to certain matters this year.  In that connection, I want to say that when a Government decides to set up <Col N="618" /> a State Department it also has the duty of finding a building for the staff of that Department.  Recently, we had a discussion on the question of finding housing accommodation for the Department of Social Welfare.  What did we find then?  That there had been what might be described as nothing less than a raid on the funds of the National Health Insurance Society to take over Store Street premises from Córas Iompair Éireann.  The raid was in the region of £1,000,000.  I am not at all too sure that the sum that will ultimately be required will stop at that figure.  Since the matter was raised in this House, we have had public attention again called to it.  In view of that, I would at this, the eleventh hour, once more make an appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter and allow that building to be used for the purpose for which it was first intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What was that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>A cinema!</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, at any rate, is this, that many people, not only in this country but visitors from abroad, have expressed the view that the building should be used for the purpose for which it was originally intended.  Quite recently, we had a statement published from an eminent architect in which he said, in a very emphatic way, that if the building were completed as a bus station it would be one of the finest in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We have, of course, the sneers of the Minister and of his colleagues that it was only intended to be a cinema or a restaurant. At any rate, it was admitted in this House by a Minister, who, after all, must be the person responsible as far as this House is concerned&mdash; I refer to the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;that Smithfield will also contain a restaurant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing the attention of the House to the fact that sums of money are being provided in this Bill for the provision of Government buildings and I am saying that it is the duty of the Government to provide a building for the staffs of Government Departments.  I do not think it was right to acquire this building for that purpose at the expense of the funds of the National Health Insurance Society, and at the same time to deprive the travelling public of the facilities which it was proposed to make available for them in the Store Street premises.  That certainly, to say the least of it, was not a good thing to do.  The only excuse that could be given for doing that, even by the Minister or by the most ardent supporters of the Government, was that that decision was come to, not as a matter of economy, not for the sake of saving Córas Iompair Éireann from bankruptcy or for the purpose of putting it on its feet again, but through political bias and for no other reason.</P>
      <P>That is the opinion that people who have examined this whole question have arrived at.  I suggest that, even at this late hour, the Government should reconsider the whole matter. I suggest, too, that the Government should give the new Board of Córas Iompair Éireann, which they have appointed themselves, an opportunity of re-examining the position.  If the new board, in their wisdom, decide that it is in the interests of the travelling public and of Córas Iompair Éireann itself as a national transport service that they should be allowed to complete the building as a bus station, I think they should be allowed to do so.  But they have been deprived of that opportunity.  The decision in regard to the building was made not by the former chairman and Board of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who are supporting the Government, and supporting Government policy, should feel not only complimented but very satisfied indeed that the spokesman for the Opposition in this House had so little criticism to offer on Government policy.  The Appropriation Bill affords Senators an opportunity of making criticism on Government policy, and of advancing constructive proposals as to how Government policy could be changed or amended so that conditions for the people of the country as a whole would be bettered. I do not like to be too severe on Senator Hawkins.  Personally, I feel that the very mild tone of his speech was in a way a compliment to the Government.  There was almost tacit approval of what the Government are doing.  The fact that we have had a complete absence of any concrete criticism of what is being done, I think, indicates that what we see before us in the Appropriation Bill, as well as the proposals embodied in it, have met with the acceptance of the people of the country as a whole.  If the Opposition are in disagreement with the way in which money is being spent, then I suggest they should give us some evidence of that in their speeches.  I suggest to them that, <Col N="621" /> unless they are politically bankrupt, we should have constructive proposals from them as to how the money could be better spent.  We have not had that from Senator Hawkins.  During three-fourths of his speech he contented himself by putting a series of queries to the Minister, queries as to what will be done in certain eventualities. He joined his colleagues in the rôle of prophet.  I suppose it is true to say that prophets never like to be disappointed.  They will always hope, I suppose, that their prophecies will be justified by events, and that someone will come to their aid if there is the possibility that they are going to be let down.</P>
      <P>This was one of the queries which Senator Hawkins put to the Minister. What are the Government doing, in the way of making preparations, if war comes?  We can work ourselves into such a state about war that eventually we arrive at the frame of mind in which we believe there must be war.  If there is a great deal of talk about war, the longer it goes on it seems to be an effort by those who want to keep out of war to get away from it.  I do not think it advisable for a small country like this, any more than it is for a large country, to have too much talk about war.  If one were to examine the attitude of the Great Powers, who are definitely going into it if there is a world-wide conflict, one will observe the caution with which they speak of world war.  God knows, none of us wants it and the less talk we have about it in public.  I think the greater will be our contribution towards averting it.  I do not say we must not think about it, but I do say that a small country like ours should have less talk about war.  If necessary, there should be silent preparation and thought and examination about the situation that would confront us in such an eventuality but that examination should be impartial and it should be realistic.  That is just what we are not getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins started off by demanding information from the military angle as to the preparations the Government were making.  Certain <Col N="622" /> statements have been made by the Minister for Defence and his colleagues on that aspect of national policy and I am not going to follow them up. That may or may not be satisfactory to Senators opposite but I am going to suggest that the condition of preparedness to-day is at least as efficient, and up to as high a standard, as it was in 1939 when the people now in opposition were in control.  If there was one thing obvious in 1939 to any student of history, it was that war was inevitable.  There was not as much talk about it then, but it came.  There were many people who saw it was coming from 1932, 1934 and 1936&mdash;in fact, from the first day that Hitler entered the Rhineland.  What was the condition of preparedness in which we found ourselves in the autumn of 1939? On the military side, surely nothing like as advanced as it is to-day.  There is no doubt that, prior to the last war, we had to send our students of military history abroad to make a study of strategy.  Our young men were being sent abroad to study in military colleges in foreign countries.  They came back with the knowledge and education which they obtained there.  They are now placing them at the disposal of the rising generation who, no doubt, are passing on that knowledge to the younger recruits.  There can be no question&mdash;I do not think it would be questioned by Senator Hawkins or any of his colleagues&mdash;that our conditions to-day on the military side are at least a great deal better than they were in 1939.  Let that statement be challenged if Senators can challenge it, and let evidence be produced to support the challenge but, for goodness' sake, let us not be told, without any evidence to support the statement, that we are in a worse position now from the point of view of defence than we were in 1939.</P>
    <P>The problem of defence is not a problem for the Government alone.  It was not a matter for the Government alone in 1939.  The leaders of all political Parties were called together and a council of defence was formed.  We did not pick and choose the men we wanted to go into the armed forces of the country.  They came from all <Col N="623" /> political Parties and I have no doubt that as many came from amongst the supporters of the Parties that were then in opposition as came from those who were supporting the Government. I speak with some knowledge of that matter and I know what was the attitude of some of the people then in the Government when we were trying to organise the country and trying to get young men into the Defence Forces. I know what happened in my own county.  Let us get away from that aspect of the situation for the moment.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister for Agriculture doing in regard to the provision of food for the people and to keep starvation from our doors in the event of war, this very much abused Minister for Agriculture, the man who never did anything right according to the Opposition? There again, I say that the situation to-day, in 1950, under the ministry of James Dillon, is ever so much better than it was in 1939 under the ministry of his predecessor in office, Dr. Ryan.  I challenge contradiction on that and I shall prove my statement from figures which are available to the Opposition just as they are available to me.  No doubt a wise people will make provision for the future in regard to food supplies whether we are going to have war or whether we are not going to have war.  It is necessary for the farmer to have vision for years ahead as to how conditions are likely to develop.  It is months and months, indeed, sometimes years, before you are able to sell the product you produce on the land.  In live stock that is so and there is at least a period of eight or nine months after you have sown your seed before you reap in the harvest. Farmers everywhere have, therefore, to take a longer view than any other section of the people.  The man who wants to carry on a live-stock economy will make provision for a balanced production.  He will secure food supplies for his stock in winter just as well as in summer, as prudent farmers everywhere are doing.  I think, speaking generally, that is the attitude of the farmers in the country to-day. I know that when the Opposition speak in critical tones of Government policy <Col N="624" /> in regard to food supplies, they are thinking primarily in terms of acres of wheat.  This is a matter which is constantly under discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture in replying in the other House to the debate on his Estimate, quoted the ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy Boland, who was reported in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of Saturday, June 17th, as making the following statement&mdash;the quotation by the Minister is to be found in column 516 of the Official Report for July 4th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the war we were at least in a position to ensure a fair sized ration of bread from our own wheat, and also sugar, and, as a result of the Fianna Fáil Government, we were able to overcome most of our fuel difficulties.  Now, however, thanks to the activities of Mr. James Dillon, we are almost totally dependent on outside sources for our bread and our animal feeding stuffs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement is definitely untrue and it should not be repeated.  In 1939, when the people opposite were in power, there had been years of propaganda in regard to the growing of wheat up and down the country.  The people were stormed from every church gate and with advertisements in the newspapers.  It was an article of faith with Fianna Fáil, a sign that you believed in Fianna Fáil, that you grew wheat.  In 1939, the year the war was coming to us&mdash;and everybody knew it was coming&mdash;they secured 255,280 acres of wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to tell the Senator something and he will not be pleased with the story, but I challenge contradiction before I say it.  In 1941 at one of the meetings of that executive, in February, I think, we realised the danger to the country.  It was just those days when the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dr. Ryan, was being sent on a stumping campaign up and down the country urging farmers to put a greater area under wheat.  Our information in the executive was that farmers were not doing this, and we realised the serious situation which would confront the country unless more land was put under wheat.  It was decided at that executive meeting that a deputation would be selected to go to see the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, to urge on him that the way to get more wheat was to increase the price to the farmers.  We selected as the man to head that deputation Deputy James Dillon, and those to accompany him were the late Jim Hughes, Senator James McGee and myself.  At the meeting in the room in which we were sitting&mdash;I am sure Senator Hayes was also present&mdash;the present Minister for Agriculture got up, went to the telephone, asked to speak to Deputy de Valera, and got on to his secretary.  There was prevarication; Deputy de Valera could not be seen, but after difficulties we made some advances.  There was no hope, Deputy Dillon was told, of seeing Deputy de Valera that day.  He pointed out that this was a matter we regarded as being of very great urgency and asked when could he be seen, but we could not get an answer.  We did get some information later that day and were told that the Taoiseach would see the deputation the following evening.  I had to go home and could not accompany the <Col N="627" /> deputation, but the deputation went to the Taoiseach and included Deputy James Dillon, the late Jim Hughes and Senator James T. McGee.  Practically immediately after the deputation left the decision was taken to increase the price of wheat by 5/- a barrel, and on the radio that same night an announcement was made to this effect.  The announcement was accompanied by the statement that this was the result of a deputation from the Fine Gael organisation and it was also indicated that this was going to increase the price of flour and listeners, of course, were to accept that the price of flour was increased to the consumer because the Fine Gael deputation had gone to the Ministry to get an increase in the price of wheat.  The gentleman who led that deputation to get more money, so that more wheat would be grown, was the present Minister for Agriculture, and in this House I publicly challenge the leaders of the Opposition to give me a denial of that.</P>

      <P>The past and present policy and the Minister's attitude of mind to the growing of wheat has been so consistently challenged, so blatantly misrepresented, that I think the country should know the truth.  I have all the figures here over all the years, pre-war and post-war, with regard to the growing of wheat.  We have had statements from the Minister himself and from his colleagues that more wheat will be available this year than in any year in the history of the country as far as recorded figures go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sometimes feel that what is annoying the Opposition most is that this is the truth, that wheat is available and that there is considerable evidence of security with regard to our food supply position.  They would be happier if there was not that security and if they could afford to be critical.  Otherwise why not face facts and when facts are available, why not accept them?  If the position is as they say it is, if it is <Col N="628" /> not satisfactory, let us have some constructive proposals.  When we have this line of argument from the Opposition, I would ask them to give us their views on what they would do.  I challenge the farmers over there to say whether they want compulsory tillage applied.  Do they or do they not?  If not, if you are not going to compel farmers to put certain areas under tillage, the only alternative is to give farmers such a price as to encourage them to grow it, believing that it will be profitable.  The present Minister for Agriculture believes that to make the job attractive for farmers by increasing the price of the product would be a more profitable national approach than to use our compulsory powers.  When the Minister went into office his Government increased the price of wheat.</P>

The present Minister for Agriculture increased the price of wheat and gave a guarantee for five years.  In our judgment that is the best way to encourage the farmers to grow any crops. Do these Senators want the price increased beyond 62/6?  I am sure they would be quite prepared to ask for that.  But if it is increased let them not forget the announcement made by Radio Éireann when their Government was in power that the price of flour must also be increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what reply the Minister for Finance may give to Senator Hawkins' other queries with regard to Government policy, the quantity of fuel in store, the quantity of oil in store for the machinery to be used on the rehabilitation project and the quantities of artificial manures. Whoever said it in the other House, so far as this country is concerned I believe there are supplies which we can lay up and which we should lay up in so far as it is wise.  Any wise farmer will always have something in his barn and the nation should also have something in its grain silos.  A provident farmer is not going to cut turf in the middle of winter.  You have to stack turf in the turf house and, in the same way, you will have to store the hay and the grain for the cattle.  I have no doubt that the Government have given ample consideration and attention to that aspect of our problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues in the other House stated that the best preparation we could make for war, in addition to having certain stores, is to build up the fertility of our soil.  That is the best preparation we can make. <Col N="630" /> It is something that the previous Government neglected, although we talked about it in this House year after year.  We can produce the records of the advice we gave, but no constructive effort was made to build up the fertility of our soil.  The truth is that with all the wheat growing they carried out before the war the most fertile fields we had were completely exploited before the war broke out and the fields in which we should have stored fertility upon which we could draw were the poorest and most impoverished in the country.  The result was that we had hundreds of thousands of impoverished acres of land and the legacy which was left to the Minister to restore the fertility of these impoverished lands is an immense undertaking. It has to be faced, however. The Minister and his colleagues are to be congratulated on the enthusiasm, the vigour and the imagination with which they are facing it.  The land rehabilitation project is one aspect of it and a very vital one.  It is important also that there should be a storage of fuel for the machinery required.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in the other House, when addressing himself to this problem of the rehabilitation programme, made a statement which I did not see reported in any newspaper. So far as I know, it has been given no publicity whatever.  I was astonished that such a vital declaration of policy, such a valuable statement, did not attract the notice of the daily papers and that for the nation's sake they did not give publicity to it. There has been a point of view very frequently expressed in regard to the land rehabilitation project that it is not only the lands which require drainage that require rehabilitation; that there are large areas all over the country of poor land which are very dry, where the rainfall is low and where the capacity of land to hold water is not very great.  These areas are generally parts of hillsides and, from the point of view of fertility and vigour, they are very debilitated.  It has therefore been urged that something ought to be done for these lands.</P>
    <P>I may say that a number of my colleagues of the Fine Gael Party and <Col N="631" /> myself saw the Minister for Agriculture before the land rehabilitation project was announced and discussed this aspect of the project with him.  In concluding the debate on his Estimate in the Dáil, the Minister made a statement. I do not know if it has been brought to the notice of any Senator. Had I not been told about it by a Deputy who listened to it and who was very interested in the proposal, I would not have known of it.  This is what the Minister said when he was referring to the lack of fertilisers and the poor soil, as reported in Volume 122, column 526, of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Very well; I am prepared to test that out and, under the land project, if any farmer in Ireland believes that his land lacks nothing but fertilisers to make it fructify and if he will apply to the Department of Agriculture&mdash;the scheme will have to be prepared in detail, but I offer the Dáil the outline of it now&mdash;enclosing a fee of 1/- per acre&mdash;if he is a tenacre man, 10/-; if he is a 1,000-acre man, £50&mdash;we will test the soil of every field upon his holding and we will undertake to provide, deliver and spread the lime, the phosphates and the potash the land may require. He will be informed of the total cost and, subject to his paying any fraction of that cost, the balance can be funded as an annuity to be consolidated with his land annuity&mdash;subject to the provision that second recourse may not be had to that scheme unless and until the annuity in respect of its first application has been redeemed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know if that statement of policy has been brought to the notice of any of the other Senators.  I must say that there are large areas in the country where the application of that plan would produce a revolution in regard to the quality of the soil.  The expenditure of £40,000,000 on the land of the country is the greatest act of faith any Government could make in regard to the country's future.  I felt that there was something slightly lopsided about that scheme but, with that declaration, there comes a balance into the scheme that will make it <Col N="632" /> applicable to the country as a whole, to the poor hillsides to be found in many counties just as much as to the low-lying, waterlogged lands which need all this big equipment which the Minister has secured for their drainage and rehabilitation.  It seems to me that we can have a quiet satisfaction in regard to the policy pursued by the Minister and his colleagues.  We can be confident that the conduct of the nation's affairs is in very competent hands, that there is vision and foresight in the way the money is to be spent, that there is imagination as well and that they are not afraid to take risks.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins was critical about the unemployment and emigration position.  I think that is pure fantasy. I do not know any part of rural Ireland to-day in which there is unemployment. In my own county, a county of small farmers, there is no unemployment, and&mdash;I have said it before and I now repeat it&mdash;some of our county schemes under the Works Act are limited by the availability of labour.  That is true not only of my own county.  I heard a story from Donegal the other day which sounds so astonishing that it is difficult to believe, but which is a fact. It is, perhaps, also true of West Galway, as Senator Hawkins will probably find if he makes inquiries.  If you want to get turf cut in West Donegal to-day, and if you wanted it during the past month or two, the man who will cut that turf will charge £1 per day and can get it.  There is not much evidence of unemployment there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that there has been emigration up to such a point in a great many districts that the race there is incapable of replacing itself. I have a keener appreciation of this than most Senators.  I have probably said more in this House, if Senators are fair to me, about emigration over the years than most, and I have studied it more closely.  It is less than it was, but it is less for a variety of reasons.  A great many of the people are gone, and they went in Fianna Fáil's time, as the figures which are available show.  They went in the midst of the war at a time when the land of this country required rehabilitation, and they went to Britain where they were engaged in the rehabilitation <Col N="634" /> of the land of Britain, when we should have kept them employed on our own land.  When boys go out of a district, you find a condition in a parish in which the girl there does not find one boy whom she will marry, and, looking at it the other way round, exactly the same thing is happening, and, if Senators want the evidence of a close observer, I suggest that they canvass the opinion of Senator Mrs. Concannon.</P>
      <P>That is what is taking place and has taken place, and the position to-day is such that we may see such a contraction of the population in a very short time, because of the operation of natural forces, that it will be quite impossible for our people to hold on in the more remote fastnesses of the country.  That is going to bring about a development of another kind which is not at all pleasant.  There is this to be said, however, that a great deal of the emigration that has gone on over the past 20 years has been as much due to a condition of mind as to economic necessity.  A great many boys and girls left the country and went to work in conditions that were not as pleasant or as happy as those of the surroundings from which they went.  They would not write home and tell about what was taking place, and others followed, and because one boy left, a girl left the week after.  The drain is going on, and, if it is to be stopped, there must be realism in our approach and in our effort to stem this bleeding.  These people will have to be talked to in a manner in which we have not been courageous enough to talk to them in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may attempt to spend money in a variety of ways, but if we are to hold on to the people in the hinterland, the people along the seaboard and in towards the centre, one thing against which we must set our faces is any further development of the City of Dublin from the point of view of industry.  It should be a cardinal policy of the Ministry from this on not to have any industry within 30 or 40 miles of Dublin City.  If you want to hold the people living beyond that point, you will have to build defences not so very far from their own doors. <Col N="635" /> These defences will be the growth of urban communities producing something our people require, or something which perhaps we may export; but that is the only way in which the population can be held.  We will have to build defences against their going much nearer to their own homes than we have attempted in the past.  If we have to pass an Act of the Oireachtas to prevent this line of development of building up Dublin which has been taking place, it would be a national duty to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins referred to the artificial manures and the storing of these manures, and I am all with him in that respect.  Probably the most vital of all the things we ought to store against an emergency is a supply of fertilisers.  If you have wheat or grain of any kind, you will get a crop the following harvest.  We may have a lean period in between, but we will know the crop is coming on; but we can only be certain of it if we have the fertility in the soil.  If you have it stored, no matter where, it will be an asset which will stretch its benefits into the years beyond, and, from that point of view, I should like to hear if there has been any close consideration of the possibility of the development of a nitrogenous industry in the country.  All during the last war certain quantities of superphosphates, of phosphatic manures, came into the country, but, from the point of view of nitrogen, practically nothing came in, except the sprinkling which was taken in across the Border.  That is one of the things for which we should make provision in the future.  It may be expensive to consumers and to the nation as a whole to sustain it, but it would be a sheet anchor, one of our greatest measures for security in any period of emergency.</P>
    <P>In agreeing as I do with the Government and supporting wholeheartedly Government policy, which is giving such satisfaction to the country as a whole, I believe there are projects such as that which, in present circumstances, ought to receive close-up attention which might not be necessary if <Col N="636" /> conditions in the world were other than they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sorry for sensible people who have to listen to a speech such as we have had from Senator Baxter.  There are many sensible people on both sides of the House. Senator Baxter went to great lengths to have a crack here and there and to criticise Senator Hawkins but Senator Baxter in his calmer moments will agree that anybody would be justified in saying that Senator Baxter's speech was an excellent exhibition of shadow boxing.  All this talk we have heard about criticism of the rehabilitation project of the present Government is so much shadow boxing.  I have not heard anybody speak adversely in connection with that particular scheme. As regards Fianna Fáil speakers that I have heard discussing projects of that kind introduced by the present Government, the furthest they have ever gone is to say&mdash;quite justifiably&mdash; that in certain cases schemes were put up by the previous Government and that credit for these schemes is being claimed by this Government.  That is a perfectly justifiable attitude for any member of Fianna Fáil to adopt either here or outside.  To try to create the impression that because something is being done by the present Government it must be criticised and condemned by the Fianna Fáil Party is so much nonsense.  That is not the case. Generally, those who support Fianna Fáil in this House, on county councils, on county committees of agriculture and public bodies everywhere, are a fairly good cross-section of the people, sensible men who know what is good for the country.  If something that is good for the country is being done by any Party, they do not want to take the credit from that Party.</P>
      <P>I am quite prepared to admit here publicly that a considerable amount of good is being done under this rehabilitation scheme.  While I and other speakers might think that certain things could be done a little bit better in a different way, I am always prepared for somebody to tell me, as I will be prepared to tell them, that the best hurlers are always on the ditch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> The only thing that I could take from Senator Baxter's speech was his evident jealousy of the present Minister for Agriculture.  I have no particular natural love and affection for the present Minister for Agriculture but, if the present Minister for Agriculture introduces a scheme which I think is a good scheme, I do not go around the country trying to steal his thunder. Senator Baxter told us that he and a few other people went to the Minister and discussed this scheme.  The suggestion was that, as a result of Senator Baxter's discussion with the Minister, this scheme was brought forward.  If the scheme is to be a success, it should have the whole-hearted support of the members of the House and particularly of the members of the Minister's Party. Senator Baxter's way was a petty way of approaching a matter of that kind.</P>
    <P>In connection with compulsory powers for tillage, the question has been asked repeatedly, and I have answered the question on a previous occasion: &ldquo;Would you approve of compulsory powers in connection with tillage at the present time?&rdquo;  My reply to that, as an individual&mdash;and I think it would be the reply of most members of our Party&mdash;is that if that question was asked a week ago or even to-day, I would say we have not any definite evidence that compulsory powers are necessary in the immediate future but that we have no apologies to make for having used compulsory powers in the past.  Rather than criticise the Fianna Fáil Government of that time for having used compulsory powers, Senator Baxter or any other reasonable, sincere Senator should congratulate those people and should give credit where credit is due.</P>
    <P>It must be evident, even at this late stage, some years after the conclusion of the war, that were it not for the use of those compulsory powers the people of this country would have starved during the last war.  I challenge contradiction on that.  It was fairly evident to anyone who was in touch with events at that particular time that there were days when it was touch and go whether or not the country would be faced with starvation and, incidentally, with revolution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> I do not propose to go back on the statements made by members of the Fine Gael Party at that time in connection with compulsory tillage.  I do not propose to go back on the period from 1932 to 1939 when Fianna Fáil consistently advocated increased tillage on the basis that the only sane policy in peace time or in war time was to try, in so far as it was possible, to grow our own requirements, particularly in so far as bread was concerned. I do say that, in the same circumstances again, a Fianna Fáil Government would do the same thing.  I would like to get an answer from either Senator Baxter or the Minister as to whether or not, if this country were again faced with war and with a similar situation, a shortage of food supplies and a shortage of the means of production of food supplies, they would introduce compulsory tillage.  I would like an answer to that question.  If they say that they would not in any circumstances introduce compulsory tillage, then I would say that the reference Senator Baxter made to the interest that the Fianna Fáil Party had in connection with the safety of the people and food for the people might be turned back on him and the cap would fit him a lot better than it fits some of us.</P>
    <P>It is foolish really to waste the time of the House or the country or to waste the newsprint of newspapers by a debate which is largely founded on a policy of overlooking facts.  Senator Baxter went into the figures of production of wheat over a number of years and told us with a great flourish of trumpets that more wheat was got from a certain number of acres in 1950 than was got from a greater number of acres in 1941.  Anyone who knows anything about current events knows that it was only in the last few years that fertilisers became available in any quantity.  As Senator Baxter admitted in another part of his speech, during the emergency &ldquo;we had no fertilisers except what was dribbling in over the Border&rdquo;.  That is so.  Admittedly, the land deteriorated over a considerable period.  There was consistent impoverishment of the land.  What was the alternative?  The alternative was <Col N="639" /> consistent impoverishment and starvation of the people.  The Government at that time were faced with that situation and I again say that, rather than criticise that Government, Senators should admit that they faced up to a very difficult situation, regardless of the popular vote or anything else, fully convinced of the responsibility they held as Government.  The results proved that they were right.</P>
    <P>In connection with this very important deputation which came from the Fine Gael national executive in the early stages, of the war, I would not like Senator Baxter to have a grievance over something that happened even as long ago as that.  In fact, I would not like anybody to go around with a chip on his shoulder.  Senator Baxter told us that a decision was arrived at at a meeting&mdash;on a certain Monday, I think it was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator can choose the day for himself.  A meeting was held on a certain day and, as a result of that meeting, a decision was arrived at that the then Taoiseach should be approached in connection with increasing the price of wheat.  The then Deputy James Dillon called up the then Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, to request an interview.  An interview could not be arranged immediately. Another telephone call was made.  Eventually, an arrangement was made to receive the deputation, headed by the then Deputy James Dillon, on the following evening. The then Senator Baxter, as I think he was at the time, with all his interest in the agricultural community of his part of the country, was so busy that he could not wait and accompany the deputation, and use his persuasive powers with the then Taoiseach, because it would mean that he would have to wait overnight and see him on the following day.  Surely we have not <Col N="640" /> reached the stage when we think that the Taoiseach, no matter which Government may be in power, ought to be on tap, as it were, in regard to appointments, and that he should receive a deputation at a moment's notice, even from Deputy Dillon.  If any of us here were to call up the present Taoiseach and ask for an interview, we would not expect to be told: &ldquo;Come right along.&rdquo;  It might happen that you would be told to come along this evening or in half an hour's time, but any man in that position&mdash;particularly at that particular time&mdash;would be likely to be so booked up with appointments that he could not receive anybody inside a period of 24 hours.  Now, it is held up as if something desperate had happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am getting any useful help.  Senator Hawkins says that that was the reason why Deputy Dillon was put out of the Fine Gael Party.  That is not so, and I do not believe that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to suggestions which might be made, I believe a desperate effort should now be made to put away a store of fertilisers.  I do not believe it should be done in tons or in hundreds of tons: I believe it should be done in thousands of tons.  I do not mind stating that at the beginning of the last war I made the suggestion that £1,000,000 should be spent on wheat.  I repeat that suggestion now that £1,000,000 or more should be spent on wheat to provide against a possible emergency.  I make that suggestion without criticising anybody and, while I make that suggestion, I say that the country is now in a better position to face an emergency than it was at the beginning of the last war because at that time we had not the equipment to carry out the enormous amount of tillage which would be <Col N="641" /> necessary to feed the people of the country.  We had not the men trained to carry out the tillage policy of that Government or of any other Government. As a result of the tillage policy of the Fianna Fáil Government, and operated over a number of years, men all over the country got to know how to handle a pair of horses, a plough and a tractor.  I am sorry to have to say that that tillage campaign was denounced in every parish of this country by people who should have known better.  However, as a result of that policy we have a situation whereby, if necessary overnight, men can be turned to the production of wheat, oats and the various other crops which would be required in case of emergency.  The only thing which might, and which would, indeed, require definite attention is the question of traction and transport for the purposes of agriculture.  It should not be necessary for me to have to give quotations to show that we are all well aware that there has been a drift towards mechanised farming.  If we should be faced with an emergency I ask any sensible man how long will our mechanised farming last?  I have stressed time after time that it is dangerous to go over totally to mechanised farming and to advocate a policy which might bring about a situation here that, in an emergency, we would be left without the means of the production of the food we require. I say now as I have said before that a desperate effort should be made to maintain in this country sufficient horses to carry on a tillage campaign in case of emergency.</P>
    <P>Statements have been made here in the past and made again to-day that no useful purpose can be served by talking of war.  I say very definitely that no useful purpose can be served by sticking one's head in the sand. Generally speaking, the people of the world to-day are turning their attention towards war and preparations for war.  While we in this country may not be war-minded, there is no reason why we should not make the necessary preparations to defend the people of this country in the event of war.  Any public man who denounces such a <Col N="642" /> policy is not doing his duty to the country.  Within the past couple of weeks we have seen a picture of men at work in this city demolishing A.R.P. shelters.  On the same day we saw pictures in the papers of other countries of men at work building A.R.P. shelters.  Though the A.R.P. shelters which were built in the early stages of the last war may now be out of date, at the same time I am practically convinced that a better type of shelter should be built now.  Surely, with the war clouds hanging overhead, we ought not demolish A.R.P. shelters but rather should we proceed with the building of bigger and better shelters and the making of more provision for our people in case of war.  Some people say that it is bad to have too much talk about war but I think it is very bad not to have some talk about war. If you do not talk about war publicly in this House and in the other House, you will not have people prepared to carry out the instructions which it may be necessary to issue in case of a sudden emergency.  It is all very well for Senator Baxter or anybody else to say that this war is a long way off.  It may be a long way off and I hope it is a long way off but I should have liked Senator Baxter to have been with me yesterday in Denmark and in Sweden and to have seen what I saw there&mdash; guns being moved into position to protect the airfields.  I think he will at least have to admit that some countries are taking the danger of the outbreak of war seriously.  I saw the guns being moved into position and I am satisfied that these people are not taking these precautions just for fun.  Very definitely, at this stage, we should take our responsibilities seriously.  We should take the necessary precautions and recruit the strongest army we can recruit.  Whether we are going to remain neutral or to be involved in war one thing is certain and that is that the only way to be reasonably sure of peace is to be ready to defend the policy of whatever Government may be in office.  We might as well face the situation now that the peace of the world is in a very precarious position and that it is up to us to look after our own people and protect their interests so as to be able to look after <Col N="643" /> them to the best advantage in case of emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the few occasions in the course of the year when the Seanad has an opportunity of reviewing Government policy generally. I do not intend to wander more than is absolutely necessary from the text of the Bill which we are debating this afternoon.  I shall, therefore, say very little and what I shall say will, I hope, be directed to the Appropriation Bill as far as possible.  I should like to say that the Taoiseach in the Dáil recently, in connection with the Estimate for his own Department, gave to the country a very valuable review of the statistical situation.  It is only fair for us in the Seanad and in the Dáil who will make use of these figures, to pay a tribute to the officers and officials who prepared them.  Without them our contributions to current discussion might possibly be even less helpful, despite the best of intentions.  I should like to impress on the Taoiseach the necessity for asking the officials to publish these figures fully as soon as they possibly can be published.  At present, we rely on the speeches of Ministers for some very valuable statistics.  We got some in the speech of the present Minister on the Budget in May and more from the Taoiseach the other day; but it would be very desirable if we had all these figures published as soon as possible so that we could study them at our leisure and with special relation to the earlier figures published by the same Department.  The general impression created by these figures, which the Taoiseach gave in the Dáil the other day, confirmed that created by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement in May last.  The national income has been rising; agricultural production has been rising; industrial production has been rising; though not, perhaps, as rapidly as might be desired. Above all, exports have been rising, also.  The great increase in exports in the past few years is a very encouraging feature.  It is one which has been rendered possible by the cessation of war conditions.  Therefore, it is one which nobody should attempt to make any Party debating points about; I, <Col N="644" /> for one, would not attempt to do so. The main thing is that it has taken place.  The fact that our balance of payments is in equilibrium shows that the country is paying its way with the outside world, if we set apart the abnormal problems arising out of the hard currency difficulties.</P>
      <P>While the main picture in the figures given by the Taoiseach is satisfactory, there are one or two less satisfactory elements to which it might be well to draw attention.  There is one matter that cannot easily be cured, if it can be cured at all&mdash;although it is agreed by everybody that it should be&mdash;and that is the continuing drain of emigration in the country.  There is no feature of Irish public life in relation to any of our industries or activities which does not directly or indirectly bear on this question of emigration.  Everything that can give employment will tend to reduce emigration.  If one were to discuss emigration at any great length, one would have to deal with every aspect of Irish life, with employment in agriculture and in industry.  Therefore, I do not think one could possibly deal with it satisfactorily, and all I will do is draw attention to the fact that the drain on our manpower continues, although I do not suggest that to stem it would be an easy matter.</P>
      <P>The second unsatisfactory feature of current statistics which I think is, perhaps, slightly more relevant to this discussion, is the falling short of savings in the country.  Rightly or wrongly, the country is committed to an investment programme, depending on private and public investment.  We fully debated public investment two or three months ago.  The fact appears to be, from the figures given by the Taoiseach, which bear out what we know already from other sources that, current savings are not equal to the finding of the capital necessary for this new investment programme.  As I said in relation to emigration, a discussion on the desirability of these various investment projects might take me too far afield.  We have discussed it here at length in this Chamber and it has been fully discussed several times in the Dáil, in the Press and in the country. Therefore, I do not propose to enter on that type of discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> The Estimates have been passed by the Dáil and the Appropriation Bill will, no doubt, be passed soon and, therefore, we may take it the financial programme of the Government must be regarded as an accomplished fact, as something that will take place whether we like it or whether we do not like it.  Therefore, I will not waste the time of the House discussing the desirability, either from the theoretical point of view or the practical point of view, of this public expenditure, its objects and whether it should be met by borrowing or from taxation.  The fact remains that it will be undertaken. When an individual or a community makes up its mind that it will do certain things it has to borrow money in order to do them.  The practical subject for discussion in the present circumstances is how we can borrow as cheaply as possible, where we can get the money and on what terms.  The decision to get it has been made already&mdash;that is an accomplished fact &mdash;and the only question so far as I know that has not been decided, it has not been publicly announced, is the method by which it is proposed to raise these large sums of money.</P>
    <P>When this matter was being discussed earlier this year, I threw out various suggestions.  I suggested that the variety of securities in the Dublin Stock Exchange was rather limited and certain people who read my observations in this Chamber have since informed me that they agree with what I said.  I have been told by a large London stockbroker that the range of our Government securities is not sufficiently wide to satisfy requirements. I will repeat what I said on that other occasion.  I suggest that the Minister ought to explore the possibilities of raising some of this money on shorter and cheaper terms than apply to existing Irish Government securities. I am not asking him to issue Treasury Bills or experiment with Treasury Deposit Receipts; still less am I asking him to use the printing press or resort to any inflationary type of borrowing. All I am asking him to do is to provide for savers in this country supplies of a type of security which, I have been informed, certain savers will be willing to take up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> I am told, but I cannot say whether my information is correct or not, by people connected with the business world in Dublin, that there are considerable sums of money being kept in liquid form mainly by companies and that these companies are unwilling to invest their savings in securities, the value of which may fluctuate owing to circumstances outside the control of anybody in this country.  I supplied the Minister, on the last occasion when this matter was being debated in the Seanad, with three types of security which, it was suggested to me by experts in the matter, might find acceptance in Dublin.  One is the 2½ per cent.  Savings Bond of a fixed date of redemption not further than five years; another is something calculated to appeal to the private investor rather than the company, a 2½ or 3 per cent.  Saving Bond issued on tap, with a certain maximum holding for each individual and possibly some concession in relation to income-tax; and the third type of security which, I understand, has been very satisfactorily used in England, is a tax certificate.</P>
    <P>Since I made that speech there has been published&mdash;and I refer to it here because it has not been published in the sense that it is on sale to the general public, though it may be of interest to the Seanad to be informed that this publication will be in our own Library in the Oireachtas&mdash;an exceedingly valuable publication dealing with the history of the gilt-edged market for the last 50 years, by a very well-known London firm of gilt-edged brokers.  This is an encyclopedia of the gilt-edged market.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I may say, by way of a footnote or in parenthesis, that it contains some rather interesting material regarding the financing of the old Irish Government prior to the amalgamation of the Exchequers in 1817.  It has some new historical material regarding our own country and is an extremely valuable publication. It is arriving in our own Library and any member of the Seanad who wishes to know all there is to be known about gilt-edged securities will find it in this valuable publication.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> The reason I mention it is that, in the course of correspondence with the firm responsible for this publication, I made the inquiry if, in view of their great knowledge of the gilt-edged market, the things I put forward on the Finance Bill here seemed to them to be reasonably correct.  I was told that there is very little doubt that there would be a market for a certain type of short-term Government security in this country.  I was also informed that it might be worth considering the possibility of offering securities of this country in the London market, with some provision for exemption from Irish income-tax, that it would be possible for a market for securities of that kind to be found outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>We are committed to this borrowing programme and, whether we like it or not, we accept it.  We were told by the Taoiseach in the Dáil last week that the current savings of the community are unable to meet the total capital expenditure and we have been exhorted to save more.  That exhortation may be realised in the long run, but in the short run the money must be raised and if the current saving of the community are not sufficient to meet the capital requirements&mdash;except by resort to inflationary devices, which I exclude from consideration&mdash;a certain amount of external financing becomes necessary.  I have not referred to the Marshall Aid, as there is something exceptional, something transitional in that, which cannot be discussed in the general way in which we are discussing this matter.</P>
    <P>There are two ways in which external financing can take place.  One way is the way I suggested a few moments ago, that is, an attempt to interest outside investors in Irish Government securities, offering them at cheap terms.  The other way is the way in which we have been financing externally, that is, by depletion of our external assets.  I want to repeat what I said in the debate on this subject in the Seanad.  The balance of payments appears to be in equilibrium, so far as we can see, but I want to put this point to the Minister and I hope he will agree with it, that whereas in normal <Col N="648" /> times, one year with another, an equilibrium in the balance of payments is an essential aim in the policy of every well-governed and every properly financially administered country, it should not be made a fetish, something to which every other consideration should have to take second place.  It is like balancing the Budget.  It is a useful general principle, a good rule of thumb, but a principle which, in certain circumstances, may have to yield to principles of greater urgency.  There has been a great deal of discussion for the last two or three years on the propriety of repatriating external assets in order to build up the equipment of the country.  In a general way, I think that the propriety of some action of that kind is agreed on by all Parties and by everybody in the House, subject to possible disagreement regarding the precise amount which would be repatriated and the particular purposes for which repatriation should be made.</P>
    <P>Since I made those observations two or three weeks ago, it seems to me that the situation in the world has changed, not for the better.  I do not wish to use this debate as an opportunity for talking about the danger of war. Everybody knows that the international situation at the present moment is not good.  There is no necessity for Senators to say that in order that the public may know it.  I have no reason to hold, more than anyone else, any personal opinion about that, but I would make this suggestion, without attempting to prejudge any issues or point in any particular direction, that at a period when international communications and international supplies are even remotely threatened, the definition of capital expenditure can take on a broader sense.  Objects of expenditure which, in the long run, in normal times, might not be regarded as proper subjects of capital expenditure might be so regarded in periods of emergency, where the accumulation of stocks, even of finished goods, may be amongst the most important types of capital investment in which any country could invest its savings.  I ask the Minister to apply his mind to that.</P>
    <P>I need not tell the Minister&mdash;he <Col N="649" /> knows as well as I do&mdash;that in modern discussions on problems of finance the definition of investment has been greatly widened from what it used to be.  In current discussions on the American business situation, one cannot read very far without coming across the word &ldquo;inventories,&rdquo; which simply means &ldquo;stocks.&rdquo;  When a business is adding to its stocks of raw materials, it is said to be investing quite as much as if it were making savings for expansion.  I think the same is true of a nation.  At a time when there is even a remote threat of the interruption of international supplies, the accumulation of stocks of essential raw materials can be justified as an investment and even finished commodities or consumer goods can be justified as a form of investment which could not be so justified in more normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>In other words, there are certain periods in history, both for individuals and for nations, when commodities are a better investment than money, and I am not sure that the present is not one of them.  That is the note upon which I shall end my observations.  I hope that the Minister for Finance will try to do two things which have not yet become accomplished facts in financial policy: one is to borrow what has to be borrowed as cheaply as he can, and the other is to broaden his definition of &ldquo;investment&rdquo; in the light of the changing and not improving circumstances of the present international situation.</P>

      <P>There are a few points I would like to raise.  Some of them have been put before me; some of them are my own.  They would more properly be dealt with under the Estimates but, as we get no opportunity in the ordinary way of raising matters germane to the Estimates, we have to take whatever opportunity is offered to us under this present measure.  There is no harm in my mentioning these points this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is an extraordinary thing that in one county, to my own knowledge, and in another, according to what I have been told, poor boarded-out <Col N="650" /> children are not looked after as they ought to be.  I know that in one county the position, as far as the home in which these children are kept is concerned, is simply farcical.  I do not wish to put any men out of work but I think there is definite room for improvement.  The inspectors in these homes are men.  I respectfully suggest that when these men either retire or die their positions should be filled by women.  Women understand children and they often find out things which a mere man will overlook.</P>
    <P>I understand, too, that it is customary to send out a formal notice a day or two before the home is inspected notifying the home that the inspector proposes to call.  What is the use in having an inspector calling when the children are all dolled up and everything in the garden is lovely?  On all the other days these children are doing work unsuitable to their years.  They are little better than slaves.  These matters should be dealt with in a wiser way.  I presume these homes still come under the Minister for Local Government. I suggest that that is one of the first matters to which he should direct his attention.  There should be no necessity to send out notices notifying these institutions of the proposed visits of inspectors.  That simply defeats the object.</P>
    <P>I want to touch now upon the evil of emigration.  Emigration is certainly on the increase.  There can be no doubt about that.  The evil of it was brought home forcibly to my mind by an individual case with which I came in contact.  I was in a London hotel some months ago and the hall porter discovered who I was.  Naturally he was anxious to have a chat.  I think he came from County Clare.  We had been talking for a little time and suddenly he said: &ldquo;When is the Coalition Government going out of office?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, God knows,&rdquo; I said.  &ldquo;The next election I hope.&rdquo;&ldquo;God forgive them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only for them I would not be here.&rdquo; He was one of thousands.  Those were his exact words: &ldquo;Only for them I would not be here&mdash;I was doing well enough.&rdquo;  I think he said he was working on turf.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I think is very <Col N="651" /> wrong is what is commonly called&mdash;the Minister will not like the expression&mdash; the Government black market.  I take serious exception to it.  The last time I mentioned it the Minister informed me, in his most reassuring manner, that through it we are helping to subsidise commodities for other people.  I object to it in principle.  It means that those who have money can buy more while those who have not got money must do with the ration.  The ration is not sufficient.  There should be some method whereby everyone would get a little more even if it meant we all had to pay a little more.  More butter, tea and sugar should be available to the ordinary people.  I think two prices are bad.  Personally I never call it anything but the Government black market.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I would like to point out that a number of new houses are going up all over the suburbs and the ordinary postmen find their work utterly beyond their capacity.  My post used to reach me around 9 o'clock.  It now reaches me any time between 10 o'clock and ten minutes to eleven.  The unfortunate postman is overwhelmed with deliveries.  There is practically a little Mount Merrion now in and around Rathfarnham and the existing postmen are overburdened and cannot do their work.  They are finding it extremely difficult to get anyone to undertake holiday duty because the wages paid are too low.</P>
    <P>I understand we shall have a Holy Year stamp.  I ask the Minister to ensure that no English will appear on those stamps.  It may be wise to have <i>Anno Sancto</i> and the same words in Irish, but no English of any kind should appear on them.  We had enough of it on the last two stamps.  I am very pleased and proud to say that I never bought one of them.  I can manage very well without them.</P>
    <P>There is grave dissatisfaction with regard to broadcasting.  Some people simply shut off the radio altogether or switch over to a foreign station.  I consider that a bad thing.  I do not know whether there have been any improvements. <Col N="652" /> Probably there are great difficulties in the way.  One appeal I would make is to ask that plays should not be broadcast in which there is any suspicion of blasphemy.  The people who write these plays may believe they are performing some service to art but I do not think it is the function of a Government Department to disseminate their ideas.  I know that in one house in which I was the radio was turned off because it was simply shocking. The most Sacred Name was freely used and that was being broadcast all over the country, for little children amongst others.  It was horrifying to listen to it.</P>
    <P>I first got my understanding about a matter of this kind when I was 13 years old.  We were spending a holiday in my father's city, Birmingham.  At that time, like many other children, we were interested in theatricals.  My elder brother used to write the plays and we acted them.  Some of our distant relatives over there had to do with the theatre and, on one occasion, we were asked to show our learning by doing a play.  The expression came into the play: &ldquo;My God, you killed my child!&rdquo;  The child fainted when the play was over.  A relative said to my father: &ldquo;Very good, the children are great,&rdquo; but he also said: &ldquo;Listen to me, Jim; tell them they are not to use the name of God on the stage in public or in private; let them change that expression to &lsquo;Great Heavens, you killed my child.&rsquo;&rdquo;.  The man who said that to my father was not a Catholic. I do not know if he had any religion, but he had respect for the name of God.  That happened in a Protestant country or, shall I say, in a non-Catholic country.  In that non-Catholic country I learned my lesson, that the name of God must be respected on the stage, and dear knows, it ought to be respected in Catholic Ireland on the wireless.</P>

      <P>For once, I agree wholeheartedly with the claim put forward by Senator Quirke when he said: &ldquo;Now is not the time to put one's head in the sand.&rdquo;  That came, curiously enough, from the opposite side of the House, because while Senators <Col N="653" /> there may be facing certain conditions and drawing attention to the deterioration in world events, they seem to be peculiarly oblivious of the facts regarding this country.  I, like Senator O'Brien, want to draw attention to the Taoiseach's very remarkable speech which he made in the Dáil on last Thursday.  It has been aptly described as a second Budget speech.  Well, comparisons are odious and so we will not compare it with the Minister's, but I would like to draw attention to certain very interesting features in that speech.</P>
      <P>First of all, the Taoiseach started out by explaining that the Statistics Office was now under his Department. I think in view of some of the figures we are getting, that there is in the Office of Statistics a wider conception in regard to its work than there used to be.  In days gone by, the chief function of the statistical department was to know where we had gone.  The officers there acted as an historian who measures factors.  Perhaps a few years ago they were even allowed to show, by measurement, where exactly we were or where we are, but they were always, practically, excluded from making any suggestion by figures as to where we were going.  It is interesting to note that we are beginning to get figures that tend to point where we are going, and, of course, from the point of view of those who have to carry the burden of the management and direction of the State, the most important figures we want are ones which point to where we are going. We all know where we have gone.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his speech&mdash;I am quoting from column 1760 of the Dáil Debates of last Thursday&mdash;drew attention to the substantial rise in the national income, and carefully warned us that most of that rise was merely a price change.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The real improvement in the standard of living since before the war has been experienced for the greater part, if not entirely, by the agricultural section of the community where, as it will presently appear, the improvement was most needed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> Now, I think that is true, but it is well to stress that that improvement in the standard of living of the agricultural community could be more aptly described as a redress of the want of balance, because all figures previously seemed to show that there was an undoubted disparity in the standard of living of the rural community as against their more fortunate brethren in urban areas.  So, while it is undoubted that there has been this improvement in rural Ireland, it is more in the nature, as I have said, of a redress of the want of balance.</P>
    <P>The national income rise to £352,000,000 as against £156,000,000 in 1938 can, as we say, in the main be accounted for in price change.  In other words, the real improvement is not as substantial as one would have liked. Now in this House&mdash;I think Senator O'Brien referred to it just now&mdash;the question as to the desirability of how far one should go in the repatriation of our external assets for capital development is a matter for debate.  It is very nice to say that we must bring back all our assets held abroad and utilise them at home.  It is not altogether wise to do that, unless we take very good care that when we repatriate these assets we will use them for productive purposes.  If we merely continue to bring them back for the purchase of consumer goods which, presumably, we will consume as quickly as we can, we may easily be left in the condition that we will have no more to bring back, that we will have no income from them, and that we shall have consumed the goods.  Therefore, I say it is highly desirable that we keep a very careful watch on how our accumulated external assets are dealt with.  May I say, in parenthesis, that these external assets were, to a very large extent, made by the agricultural community, though they no longer hold control of them?  They are now being utilised by the community, and not always too wisely.  If we bring these assets back and use them for capital purposes of a productive nature, well and good.  Of course it is a wide subject; the question arises as to exactly what is, strictly speaking, &ldquo;a productive nature&rdquo;&mdash;whether it is self-liquidating, <Col N="655" /> merely very desirable, or a necessity like housing.  We can justify large capital expenditure, I think, on houses provided we have regard to the real reason why we build these houses.  It is very nice to say that we must rehouse the population. Are we going to put new houses always where the people we wish to rehouse are living under bad conditions?  We must remember that a house, even a modern house, as I am told by a builder, is expected to last three generations.  Therefore, if we always consider, when we are rehousing the population, that the rate at which houses are to be built and the location of these houses must be determined by where the people are living to-day, we may create trouble in future.</P>
    <P>In a democracy almost the only means the Government has of directing willingly the movement of population is by means of subsidised houses. Nobody in a democracy wants to see people directed to where they are to live.  Yet, as I think Senator Baxter pointed out, Dublin is becoming an overloaded incubus on the rest of the country.  I think the population of Dublin is one-sixth of the total population, just about the same proportion as London is to the rest of Great Britain.  It is generally in that case referred to as the Great Wen.  We have an opportunity now and in the course of the next generation or so, of preventing, to some extent, any further excessive overgrowth of our capital because by providing houses and occupations in alternative places you can to some extent at the same time willingly move labour and decentralise industry.  You cannot do the two things separately.  They must go together and now is the time to attempt that rather difficult process.</P>
    <P>I want as usual to refer to one or two agricultural matters.  The Taoiseach in his speech drew attention to the fact that, at long last, the volume of agricultural production had got back to its pre-war or 1938-39 figure.  There was a slight increase, in fact, in the net volume of production. One of the things that always strikes the uninitiated is how slowly <Col N="656" /> the volume of production in agriculture changes.  People seem to forget, or seem not to remember, that agriculture unlike industry, operates on diminishing returns as against increasing returns and that it is a very slow production process.  You cannot get the rapid build up or the rapid fall that is admittedly a feature of industry. While the volume of agricultural production has now regained the 1939 figure, it is well to remember that over that period it succeeded in doing that and at the same time in handing over to industry, and possibly to emigration, some 80,000 people.  I cannot give the exact figure because we have got only the intercensual period of 1936-46 and 40,000 since 1946 leaving agriculture. Admittedly it is quite legitimate to say that in the past there was over-employment in agriculture.  There were some areas where people were not fully and usefully employed but now, in the eastern counties anyway, we have reached a stage where it is going to be difficult to bring about a large intensification of agricultural production if, at the same time, that requires additional manpower.</P>
    <P>Some of us on the coming into force of the land rehabilitation scheme undertook to do work on our own farms.  Most of us who said that we would do that after six months looking for workers have not yet succeeded in getting anybody to dig the drains. That is the position to some extent in the eastern counties.  Therefore I think we must realise that if, as we hope, we are to get increased agricultural production it can only be brought about by methods which will tend to make better use of the available manpower.  In other words, despite the warnings, we must go on using a number of machines to increase output with the same number of employees.</P>
    <P>One of the things, of course, that have been holding up agriculture, one of the factors that have contributed to the chronic static nature of the volume of production, has been want of price stability and lack of confidence in the future.  That has been inbred into the farmers from bitter experience.  Another factor is that despite an excellent <Col N="657" /> advisory service, despite masses of leaflets, books and pamphlets, we as yet have no real detailed knowledge of how to make the best use of the facilities available on the land.  We use things wastefully; we do not know; we have not enough research, enough detailed knowledge; to use a rather objectionable but very descriptive phrase from the United States, the farmer's trouble is the &ldquo;know-how.&rdquo; We have not got it yet although we are getting a little towards it.  In the past when we were young we used to be told that if we did this, that or the other it would lead to better animals, better crops, better farms and better farming.  We were never told what &ldquo;better&rdquo; meant; &ldquo;better&rdquo; for whom? That was always left out and unless at all times when we are investigating technical problems that are directly related to the economic results we are just wasting our time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his speech pointed out that over the period 1938 to 1949 the total output of those industries that are normally enumerated rose by 43 per cent.  He used a rather remarkable phrase to which I would like to draw attention when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The increases in the index of the volume of production have, of course, been accompanied by an increase in the total number of persons engaged in industries covered by the Census of Industrial Production from 166,000 in 1938 to 206,000 in 1949.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The operative word is &ldquo;of course&rdquo;.  I wonder does this House realise what has taken place.  Over the same period agriculture has regained its 1938 volume of production and it lost a rather larger number of people.  I think we need not go any further into it but it just presents one point to one's mind. It rather looks as if, over the period 1938 to 1949 agriculture has become very much more efficient and one would hope that industry is doing so as well.</P>
    <P>Just a note on industry: our industrial expansion is something to be proud of.  We had a lot of leeway to make up, but while it may be completely justified while we have infant industries to give them all that measure of protection one would give to an <Col N="658" /> infant, I wonder how long one should consider an industry is an infant.  How long must the consumer protect that infant?  Some of these industries have reached the stage when cutting teeth is over but do I see any marked change in the measure of protection that some of them are finding necessary?  After all, I know it is a little hard to say that the only measure of efficiency is to be able to face world competition.  That is not always a right viewpoint.  A late starter in the field cannot be expected to be able to face world competition.  In another country I have heard the complaint made that there were &ldquo;featherbed&rdquo; farmers.  I wonder have we a corresponding word for some of our industries here?  I stress this point about the industries because of these figures that appear in the Taoiseach's speech of the internal movement of population, what we might call the purchasing of workers from the countryside and bringing them into the town. It is a process which has gone on for centuries, but it cannot go on <i>ad infinitum.</i>  The time must come when we arrive at a balance between agriculture and industry.  It is very hard to see what that balance is.  Naturally, it depends upon the productivity of the agriculturist: how many earners on the land can provide for how many other earners?  You must have a balance somewhere if you are ever to achieve a satisfactory life for both.</P>
    <P>Some Senators were asking to-day what the Government are doing to prepare this country in the event of another emergency coming upon us. We are asked: are they storing this and storing that?  I maintain the best place to store food for danger ahead is in the fertility of the land.  The Minister for Agriculture, in his closing remarks on his Estimate, urged farmers to buy fertilisers in the late summer and autumn in order to facilitate the manufacturers so that they can deal with greater quantities.  That is one point which, obviously, the Minister for Agriculture is stressing as a means to increase the storage of fertilisers.  I suggest that some Senators should bring their minds back to June or July, 1937, just for a moment and inquire what the position of the phosphate <Col N="659" /> rock store of our manufacturers was on that date.  Normally, they hold about 100,000 tons.  They had practically none then, as they did not buy that year because the price was going up.  We started the war period with practically no phosphate rock on hands, if my recollection is correct.  We are doing something this time.</P>
    <P>If I have done nothing else, I think I have drawn attention to one of the outstanding speeches which is full of information and as to which, as Senator O'Brien says, it would be most interesting if we were given the basis on which some of those figures were arrived at and how they were compiled, because if we are to know what is happening and what is going to happen, we want what is called &ldquo;hot&rdquo; statistics, statistics giving us a measure of what is happening in our own time and not merely what happened in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter in his speech, in which he apparently spoke for his Party, deplored all the war talk.  People talk of what they are thinking about and it is difficult to read the newspapers at present and not think of war.  Since we last met a war, which we hope may not be the beginning of the war, has already started. We are interested in that to this extent, that already a lot of young men of Irish blood fighting in the American forces have lost their lives.  For that reason, it is impossible for anybody not to think of war.  It would be wrong for the Oireachtas to adjourn for the summer recess without having, on behalf of the Irish people, some assurance from the Government that they, too, are giving thought to the possibility that a war may break out, except, through the mercy of God, it is averted, and we may be involved, or at least there may be serious repercussions for us.  Nobody can deny that that is the position.  I think, therefore, that it is quite within reason that we should have from the Minister for Finance, who is perhaps the most important Minister in the Government, because the man who holds the purse strings directs policy, some assurance <Col N="660" /> that the Government are thinking of what may happen if war breaks out.</P>
      <P>It is not, perhaps, the province of this House to talk about military preparations, but it would seem common sense that what was done during the last war and was found to work satisfactorily should be done at present when there is a real fear of war; that is to say, there should be a defence council with members of all Parties in it, assisted by the Chief of Staff, the ex-Chief of Staff, who had experience during the last war, and people like General Costello and General MacNeill, people who know a lot about military strategy and developments in the military art. That would be only common sense.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that in the Dáil the Taoiseach should have treated the suggestion in the rather flippant way he did.  I am sure that some members of this Government and some of the members of the previous Government which I supported have ready tongues and sometimes say things which are smart and trenchant and which stick. Although they do not, I must say, represent the mind of the speaker, they are remembered.  For instance, the Minister for Agriculture will be long remembered for saying that he would not be seen dead in a wheat field.  That is used to the detriment of the reputation of the Minister for Agriculture and makes us suspicious of his attitude towards the position of this country, if all the essentials for our existence from outside sources are cut off.  We must contemplate a condition in which we are a sort of beleaguered garrison.  With the experience of the last war, and while we have yet time, we ought to think out and provide the things we can provide ourselves or which we can get in.  The Government should be giving serious thought to such a position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wheat is not the only foodstuff that we need.  It is very important and there has been more talk about it than anything else.  But there is also the question of tea, a very important part of our dietary.  Readers of the newspapers know that already in England the 2 oz. ration is threatened.  I think, therefore, that the free sale of tea should be abolished and that all tea <Col N="661" /> stocks should be put on the ration.  At all events, the Department in charge of this important matter&mdash;it may have already laid in stocks&mdash;should see to it that stocks are laid in and that these stocks are carefully conserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could also reduce the ration.  What would the Senator say to that?  Would she agree to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Already people are afraid that the tea ration will be reduced and something should be done about the buying up of tea.  It is a very serious danger and we ought to know that the stocks are going to be fairly divided amongst the people who have money and the people who have not. The Government has to take the major part in looking after us in respect of defence and provisions, but the trade unions have also a very important part to play.  I am glad to see that they are getting after the too frequent unofficial and lightning strikes which have played such havoc not only with the industry of the country but with trade unionism itself.  Trade unions have a duty to the country and they should not be selfish.  In the case of some strikes authorised by trade unions, the interests of the common people were not considered at all, and in fact there seems to be a danger that a dominion is growing up within a dominion and that trade unionism is threatening democracy.  I hope that the leaders, who are all very good and loyal Irishmen I am sure, will look after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade unions have taken on a very heavy task.  The labourer can give his labour or he can refuse it, but, when he joins a trade union, he gives up the absolute right by his own free will to dispose of his labour, and therefore it behoves the leaders of trade unions who have taken over these rights not to forget the interests of the community when considering the interests of trade unions.  I believe this aspect has not been considered and it ought to be considered because it is most important.  We have had a frightful strike in Galway for the past three months, a strike which has done great harm to Galway as a port, not to speak <Col N="662" /> of the harm it has done to the trade of the city.  It is time for the trade unions to give consideration to the moral aspects of strikes and to the obligations they have to the community as well as to their own members.  Some serious consideration ought also to be given to what are called sympathetic strikes. These matters must be considered by the trade unions themselves and the time when we have reached a position in which we are in grave danger is not the time at which they must consider them.</P>
    <P>We ought to realise that there is a real danger and that it is not by phrases that that danger is to be fought.  We ought to be able to rise above Party in this House and in the other House in relation to these matters.  Only a year ago last Easter, the Government proclaimed the Republic of Ireland, and, by that declaration, it took on an obligation not alone to the world and to the Irish people but to the dead generations and to the generations that will follow.  A Government which proclaimed the Republic of Ireland is, we think, bound to take proper thought for the defence of the Republic of Ireland, and I believe that it is only necessary to put it to them that they should not dissipate their effectiveness by trenchant phrases about the situation.  They should face up to it and tell us, in so far as it is consistent with our safety, that new thought is being given to many problems that will lie on their shoulders and in respect of which I here and now bespeak the support of the House and the Irish people.</P>

      <P>Some Senators have underlined the dangers of war.  They tell us that there is no use in our sticking our heads in the sand, but if, in the context of this Bill, it is in order to underline the dangers of war, may I intervene to say that others may be sticking their heads even deeper in the sand?  I suggest that those, both in this island and in Britain, who support the policy of dividing Ireland in face of the present international situation, are sticking their heads in the sand even deeper.  I just want to go on record as drawing attention to the fact <Col N="663" /> that there are degrees of blindness in face of present dangers; and still more I want to go on record as saying that those who support Partition bear a great proportion of the blame for the difficulties of this country in making full preparation for the possibility of war.</P>

    <P>It had then been intended that the <Col N="664" /> new salary scales and pension terms should come into operation from the 1st April, 1950, and that women teachers should receive different pension conditions from those to be accorded to men.  It was subsequently arranged, however, that the new scales and superannuation conditions would take effect as from the 1st January, 1950, and in the interval it has, I am glad to say, been found possible to agree that both men and women teachers shall have the same retiring terms, namely, first, annual pension based on 1/80th of average annual salary for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of 40/80ths; secondly, a lump sum on retirement calculated at the rate of 1/30th of average annual salary for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of 45/30ths; and thirdly, in the case of those who die in the service after five years' pensionable service, a death gratuity payable to their legal personal representatives amounting to the teacher's average annual salary or a sum calculated at the rate of 1/30th for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of 45/30ths, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>The original proposal was that women teachers should not receive a lump sum, but that their pension should be calculated on the basis of 1/60th for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of 40/60ths.  The superannuation schemes in force up to now provide a pension of 1/80th for both men and women teachers with no lump sum in either case and a death gratuity not exceeding the average annual salary.</P>
    <P>I think I can safely say that the terms now being introduced will be generally welcomed by the teachers. As regards the Order itself, paragraphs 1 to 4 are of the usual introductory character.  In addition, however, to bringing the scheme into effect from the 1st January, 1950, paragraph 2 provides specifically that those teachers who may have retired on pension since that date shall have the benefit of the new terms.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 indicates the classes of teachers to whom this scheme applies. They are briefly: All teachers actually <Col N="665" /> serving on the 1st January last or who enter the service for the first time after that date; and teachers who may not have been teaching on the 1st January, 1950, but were not then more than one year out of the service and were not on pension on that date.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (d) of paragraph 5 provides that teachers who were already on pension on the 1st January, 1950, and who come back to the service after that date, or those who were more than a year out of the service, and then reenter, cannot receive the new terms on subsequent re-retirement unless they shall have completed three years' pensionable service after the 1st December, 1949.  This restriction is intended to ensure that such persons cannot qualify for the new and greatly improved terms by coming back merely to teach for a nominal or brief period.  When I speak of those who had retired before the 1st January last subsequently re-entering the service, I have in mind, of course, those who had retired, and come back, before the age of 65 years.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 of the scheme provides for the payment of lump sum to both men and women on the lines I have already indicated.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7 improves the conditions for the payment of disablement gratuity to teachers who are compelled to retire owing to ill-health and who cannot qualify for a disability pension because they have not ten years' pensionable service.  At present the gratuity is at the rate of one-tenth of pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service, but this scheme provides for calculation at the rate of one-twelfth of pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service with the important addition, for those who have not less than two years' pensionable service, of one-thirtieth of pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service. Should any existing teacher on the 1st January, 1950, be compelled to retire before he or she has completed two years' pensionable service, sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 7 preserves his right to the existing basis of calculation of one-tenth.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 8 deals with the death gratuity on the basis I mentioned <Col N="666" /> in my opening statement.  Sub-paragraph (2) provides, as is the practice in official pension schemes where a lump sum is payable, that, if a teacher who has received a lump sum on retiring voluntarily or owing to disability, comes back into the service, he is not required to refund the lump sum but, should he die in the service, the death gratuity shall be reduced by the amount of the lump sum.  Sub-paragraph (3) merely provides that lump sum shall be regarded as a pension benefit.  Under the schemes as they existed up to now a pensioner might die before the amount of pension drawn by him had equalled the amount of death gratuity payable in respect of him had he died in the service; in such event there was provision to pay him the difference between the two amounts.  No pensioner who retires on these new terms can receive less after retirement than if he had died in the service and the paragraph makes it clear that the lump sum paid to him is to be reckoned for this purpose as pension.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 improves the conditions for the payment of marriage gratuity to women teachers who are compelled, under the regulations, to retire on marriage. At present a woman must have seven years' service of which at least five must be pensionable, to qualify for a gratuity and the gratuity is calculated at the rate of 1/12th of average annual salary for each year of pensionable service.  Under the new scheme, a teacher can qualify for the gratuity after six years' service instead of seven, of which at least four must be pensionable instead of five, and the amount of the gratuity will continue to be calculated at the rate of 1/12th of average annual salary for each year of pensionable service with this difference however that the first year will also be included.  The gratuity may not, however, exceed one year's salary.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10 enables applicants for a disability pension or gratuity to be required to deposit the medical referee's fee, the fee to be returned if the application is successful.  The provision is precautionary lest it should be found by experience that applications of this kind were being made on insufficient grounds thereby causing <Col N="667" /> waste of time and money; I do not say that it will be necessary to enforce the requirement.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 11 gives full effect to an intention which was not completely achieved when paragraph 7 of the 1948 scheme provided that service given by a teacher after reaching the age of 65 should be non-pensionable.  Even though the service itself was not pensionable it was possible under the 1947 scheme, in view of the definitions attaching to the words &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; and &ldquo;average annual salary,&rdquo; for a period of service given after the age of 65 to be reckoned in the computation of salary for the purpose of the calculation of pension or other benefits. This paragraph now ensures that service after 65 shall not either be pensionable or have the effect of increasing the amount of pension or lump sum.</P>
    <P>I ask the Seanad to confirm the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal now before us marks the end of a campaign which has been carried on by the teachers, through their organisation, for almost 70 years, that is, a campaign for a pension scheme which would be comparable to that paid to others in the public service.  Senators may remember that during the strike period of 1946 one of the strongest arguments put forward at that time was the argument that the national teachers' pensions were the least favourable of those paid to anybody in the public service, either civil servants or the servants of local authorities. Generally, anybody who occupied a public position received by way of pension either two-thirds of his retiring salary or half of his retiring salary plus a lump sum.  This agitation for the lump sum for the teachers was one that I personally was connected with for over 30 years.  I take the liberty of saying that I am pleased now to have the privilege of assisting at its implementation here to-night.  As I say, up to this time teachers received only half of their retiring salary, calculated on the last three years of their service, without any lump sum.  Now they are getting a lump sum as well. <Col N="668" /> I am specially pleased to note that the same conditions apply in the case of women teachers as in the case of men teachers.  That was always the position so far as the teachers were concerned: men and women received the half of their salary as pension, that is, after the full 40 years' service.  However, in the communication that was sent last November intimating the decision of the Government following the Roe Report it was proposed not to give the lump sum to the women teachers but rather two-thirds of their retiring salary.  It is stated that the lump sum provision and the two-thirds of salary on retirement are actually equal.  However, there can be no doubt, I think&mdash; certainly there is no doubt in my mind &mdash;that it is preferable when a teacher or any public servant retires that he should get a lump sum&mdash;which is equivalent to at least a year's salary and sometimes more&mdash;at that particular time.  It will help to ease the break from full salary to half salary. I am very glad indeed that this proposal is before us to-night.  I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Government and all concerned on making this&mdash;I will not call it a concession&mdash;full instalment, practically, of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But anything, of course, no matter how good it may be, can never reach perfection, and there are a few matters in this connection that I regret to see missing from this proposal.  The first is the question of the old pensioners&mdash; the teachers who retired on pension before the operative date set out in this proposal, namely, those who retired before 1st January, 1950.  It seems a hard thing indeed to say that if a teacher retired on 31st December, 1949, he gets as a pension all his life, no matter how long he may live, only half of his retiring salary while, if he could have retired on the following day, that is, on 1st January, 1950, he would get not only half his retiring salary as pension but also a lump sum equivalent to a year's salary or perhaps more than that.  I know it will be pointed out that we must begin somewhere and that there must be some line at which we should begin.  However, I think this is a case to which that argument <Col N="669" /> does not apply, certainly not as strongly as it might in other cases; there are precedents for giving to retired teachers the same privileges as are given to existing teachers.  The precedent was created in 1914 when the new pensions scheme was introduced by the British Government and the advantages which the existing teachers got were given to those who had retired.</P>
    <P>We must remember that there are not so very many individuals concerned, comparatively speaking, and they will be a gradually reducing number.  It would have rounded off this proposal very much if those who had retired before 1st January last were given the benefit of this concession.  Very sound arguments have been put before the Minister, and I do not want to go into them now in any great detail.  They have been put by the National Teachers' Organisation and by the Pensioned Teachers' Organisation and the Minister knows what they are.  The answer may be that it would cost too much, but in Budgets of £70,000,000, £80,000,000 or £100,000,000, the few hundred thousands necessary to give these pensioned teachers this benefit and make their years of retirement more pleasant than they now can possibly be, would not be, I think, too much to grant.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look into this matter again.  I know he is anxious to do what he can.  He has done a very big amount in so far as his efforts to create good feelings and relations between the teachers and himself are concerned, and I must congratulate him on that.  I hope this matter that I am referring to will be reconsidered by the Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>There was another demand put forward by the teachers, and I think there was much justification for it. That was that instead of calculating the pensions on the average of three years' salary, it should be calculated on the final year of service.  There are precedents for that, too, in the Civil Service, especially when there is a promotion or an increase in salary.  That was pressed for by the teachers' organisation. The point is that the teacher does not get half of his retiring salary as pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> One of the recommendations by the Roe Commission had reference to certain teachers who were non-pensionable before 1934 and whose service prior to that year counts only to the extent of two-thirds of that service. The service given since 1934 counts in full, but the service before 1934 does not count in full for pension purposes. The reason why they did not get the full service was because they did not pay pension premiums prior to that date.  The Roe Commission recommended that they should be given an opportunity of repaying as much as would compensate for the missing third, with compound interest, and in these circumstances they considered they would be entitled to full service. I do not know if the Government considered that point, but I trust the Minister will look into it.</P>
    <P>These teachers were mainly engaged in convent schools or they served as junior assistant mistresses.  The pension was introduced for them in 1934, but they did not get the full service at that time for pension purposes.  I know some of them are willing to pay the premiums which would compensate for the missing third, with compound interest, and they expect they should have their full service allowed for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number&mdash;not a large number, but still quite a few&mdash; who for one reason or another had to serve in a non-pensionable capacity for a number of years.  Some served in convent schools as supernumeraries and some in other capacities and although they gave full service they were not paid direct by the Department and their service does not count for pension. In the middle thirties, Senators will remember, there was a large surplus of teachers who were unable to find permanent employment; they had to serve in various temporary capacities and they lost a number of years for pensionable service.  Naturally, they claim that that service, which was given for the benefit of the community, should not be disregarded for pension purposes because it did not happen that they were paid by the Department direct.</P>
    <P>I welcome this proposal very sincerely <Col N="671" /> and I am glad to see it implemented here.  I am glad the disability terms and the marriage allowance terms are likewise improved.  I have no doubt that, as the Minister said, the proposal will be received with gratification by the teachers who have been looking forward so long to having their pensions raised to the level of those payable in other branches of the public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that everybody will join with Senator O'Connell in congratulating the Minister on having introduced this scheme, and thanking him on behalf of the country for doing it.  It pays a debt which the country owes to the national teachers by bringing their superannuation rights and gratuities into line with those of other servants of the public.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat amazed when I heard Senator O'Connell begin by saying that it was the end of the agitation, but, when he went on with his speech, it was evident that it was not the end, and that there are still a few things to be settled up with reference to those teachers who retired before 1950.  I think, like the teachers in Northern Ireland, they should get not only the improved pension terms which have recently been granted, but they should also be given the gratuities now accorded to their younger comrades.</P>
      <P>No matter how stringent our financial position may be, I think we must recognise the work these teachers have done and we must also recognise that for a long time they were underpaid, underpaid to such an extent that it constituted a disgrace.  The pensions that were based on this underpayment were really a shame.  The pensioned teachers certainly had a sound claim for better treatment and we are glad that their grievances have been to some extent remedied and that some of the wrong that has been done is being repaired.  Perhaps the Minister could now approach the Minister for Finance and induce him to give gratuities to all pensioned teachers, as is done in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the <Col N="672" /> case of women teachers who were obliged to retire at 60.  That was a very hard thing in the case of many women teachers.  It is hard on anyone at the age of 60, who is perfectly qualified to continue her service, to have to retire.  But the hardship is increased by the fact that compulsory retirement at 60 made it impossible for many of them to have the necessary years for full pension.  I know one old woman who was an M.A. and &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo;, and others also, who had to retire before getting the full pension. That was a grave injustice as between women and men, for the latter could stay on to 65.  The Minister would get a great deal of support from all the women if he would persuade the Minister for Finance to include such women in the gratuity scheme.  It would be an act of justice and I commend it to him as a conscientious individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the rank and file of the profession that has been so generously provided for now in the new pensions scheme introduced by the Minister, I would like wholeheartedly to endorse the remarks of Senator O'Connell in his comments on the terms of the scheme announced by the Minister.  For many years, Senator O'Connell ably piloted various measures brought before different Governments by the I.N.T.O. for the benefit of the profession and I would like to take this opportunity, as a teacher, to say how much I appreciate his actions and leadership during a long and troublesome period.  When all is said and done, as has been pointed out quite often, the national teachers are responsible for the education of the children of 90 per cent. of the people of the State.  It was neither fair nor equitable that they should be left so long in what was often called the &ldquo;Cinderella of the professions.&rdquo; Since the present Minister assumed office, he has unostentatiously gone out of his way, in the matter of emoluments for retired teachers neglected for years, to meet the reasonable demands of the profession.  As one of that profession in this Assembly, I would like to put on record my appreciation, on behalf of my colleagues and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With Senator O'Connell, I deplore <Col N="673" /> that some of the veterans, who served in many campaigns and some of whom suffered the scars of battle, have not been brought within the provisions of this very generous and liberal pension scheme.  Senator O'Connell has pointed out certain defects and I will not dilate further on them.  I am quite satisfied, from what the Minister has already done, that he is quite prepared to do even more, when and if the opportunity offers.  I speak on behalf of many teachers, whom I meet from time to time, in appreciation of what has been done, and we all hope that we may always prove worthy of it, in so far as our work as teachers is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a great interest in this matter for many years and I was glad to hear Senator O'Connell say that he appreciated what the Minister is doing now.  I am sure the teachers generally will appreciate it, knowing what a long period of agitation and failure there has been in this regard.  This Order before us is the third step taken by the present Government with regard to teachers' pensions. Teachers benefited to some degree from the general Pensions (Increase) Act, 1949, and they benefited also by an Order made by the Minister previously in 1949 to the extent of something like £135,000 in all.  This is the third step and, as has been pointed out, it is not a perfect step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teachers are in the peculiar position that great complexities and anomalies are involved.  They are not the employees of the State: they are appointed by the managers, but paid by the State.  For that reason, and because of various historical circumstances, there are anomalies, such as those to which Senator O'Connell referred, which could not all be corrected together.  This is an immense step forward.  I would like to see teachers who retired before 1st January, 1950, benefit, but while my sympathy is with those teachers I have also a great deal of sympathy with the Minister for Education, as I had experience myself of the difficulties of a Minister in coping with the Minister for Finance. I do not want to depict the Minister for Finance as an ogre.  As far as he is <Col N="674" /> concerned, everybody's goose is a swan and his business is to prove that it is not a swan at all but a goose.  It should be understood by people who want everything done at once that a very great amount has been done in the last two and a half years by the Minister for Education&mdash;a great deal more than was done in 30 previous years and certainly more than was done in the previous 26 years of native Government, with regard to teachers. Any Minister, and particularly the Minister for Education, has difficulties to encounter with his colleagues and with his Government in getting his own particular scheme preferred to the various other schemes, all of importance and all very ardently put forward by other Ministers.  While my sympathy is with people who do not come under this, that should not blind us to the fact that it is a very great achievement and the third step that has been taken with regard to pensions of national teachers.  That fact should be remembered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Senators for their very generous references to what we are trying to do for the teachers, by way of pension and lump sum.  If it has been possible in the last couple of years to do as much as has been done, by improving scales and pensions, I think it has only been possible to do it because of the increasing public opinion regarding the importance of education and the function of the teacher in relation to the general work of the country.</P>
      <P>It was not at all with a sense of security, I can assure Senator Mrs. Concannon, that I heard her reference to Senator O'Connell's mention that this was the end of a fight.  It will never end.  General public appreciation of the function of the teacher and of the importance of education in the modern world is growing and I have found that atmosphere very helpful in dealing with some of the financial points that arise in regard to teachers' problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes has indicated, in regard to some of the old teachers, that certain assistance has been given in various ways to those who retired before <Col N="675" /> 1946, under the general Pensions Act, and between 1946 and January, 1950, under the pensions scheme of 1948.  Senator Mrs. Concannon refers to certain things done in Northern Ireland. When I looked for information as to what it would cost to do here what was done in Northern Ireland, I did not believe the figures I got and I will quite appreciate the position if Senators do not exactly believe them either.  To do what the Senator asks for the older teachers would cost between £750,000 and £1,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Entirely for lump sum.  The Irish National Teachers' Organisation have been a little more modest and what they have asked for would cost only something like £430,000. When you consider that the general scheme which it has been possible to introduce for improving the salaries and pensions only comes to £750,000 a year&mdash;I am sure the Minister for Finance, or the Treasury as a corporate body, would be shocked by the word &ldquo;only&rdquo;&mdash;you can see how comparatively great such an amount would be to deal with old pension questions.</P>
      <P>When I was dealing with the 1948 scheme I think I pleaded that in the difficulties and problems with which one has to deal there are problems of to-day and to-morrow and it cripples one completely in one's efforts if one has to take the burdens of yesterday also on one's shoulders.  When the general matter of these pensions and salaries was being investigated no consultation or discussion that could in any way be reasonably carried out with the teachers' representatives was avoided.  The scheme was not ultimately put into its final shape without a consultation between the representatives of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, the Taoiseach, and certain members of the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as discussion and review of the situation were concerned we went the full length of the road and we were restricted only by the difficulty of finding finance.  It is all very well to hold <Col N="676" /> up the Minister for Finance as the villain of the piece.  But the Minister for Finance is just like anybody else; he deals with certain circumstances and he has no more control over the winds and the waves than has the farmer when he is doing his particular job.  He cannot always command a certain set of circumstances and, therefore, so far as the older pensioners are concerned, I have not been able to include anything additional for them in the present scheme.</P>
    <P>With reference to basing pensions on an average of three years, I cannot say that the scheme is completely logical in that respect.  It is not on a par with the Civil Service but, in the actual ultimate working out of the scheme as the years go on, it will have the particular effect desired.  I admit that will be the remnant of the fight that has still to go on.  I can see it disappearing. Certainly more awkward things have disappeared within the last few years.</P>
    <P>I dealt before with the pre-1934 position&mdash;that is the position of people who were non-contributory and who had no pension rights at all prior to 1934. They were granted two-third rights when the non-contributory scheme was brought into operation.  In respect of these pre-1934 years, which were not pensionable but have been made pensionable since, I do not think it would ever be possible to go back and make those years fully pensionable now.  On the question of the 1930 teachers and certain last years, I have to confess that when studying the history of educational happenings I missed that point.  But I imagine again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 5, sub-section (2), of the Limerick City Management Act, 1934, fixed the membership of Limerick City Council at 15, four being aldermen and the remainder councillors, and that membership can only be varied by legislation.</P>
      <P>A unanimous request was made to me by the Limerick City Council that the membership should be increased by two, and the request was based on the fact that the total area and population of the county borough had been increased.  A provisional order to extend the city boundaries was confirmed by the Oireachtas in March last. The provisional order followed a petition by the corporation for an extension of the city boundary on the ground that the amount of land available within the city was quite inadequate for city development.  The extension is all round the southern boundary and includes approximately 3,000 acres, and the population in the area is estimated at about 4,700. Accurate figures will not be available until the next census.  The population of the city before the extension was 42,987.  The population to member ratio is thus about 2,805 persons per member.</P>
      <P>In comparison with other county boroughs, Cork with a population of 75,631 and 21 members, has 3,588 persons per member; Dublin, population 506,635, 45 members, leaving 11,256 per member; Waterford, population 28,332, 15 members, or 1,882 per member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason to suggest that the membership of county boroughs should be in exact ratio to population or that an extension of a boundary necessarily involves an increase in membership.  Each case must be considered <Col N="678" /> on its own merits having regard to the views of the local authority. In this case, the character of the extension and the housing progress made and planned in the area warrant the increase sought by the city council.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the local government electorate, the increase of two members is exactly proportionate to the increased electorate for the new area. The new register for the old city contains 24,954 local government electors and there are 3,501 electors in the added area.</P>
    <P>The added area was situate partly in the North Limerick rural district electoral division and partly, in the South Limerick rural district electoral division. These two district electoral divisions were altered by taking from them the townlands and parts in the added area, and those townlands were grouped to form the Limerick rural district electoral division.</P>
    <P>The current register of electors which came into force on the 15th April last shows the Limerick rural district electoral division as being part of Limerick City and the electors will in future vote for Limerick City elections and not in the Bruff or Castleconnell county electoral areas for the county council elections.</P>
    <P>For local government elections the city forms one local electoral area.</P>
    <P>I consider the application of the city council a reasonable one and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I think there is very little necessity for discussion on this particular Bill since it comes as a request from the people in Limerick. It is quite obvious that a good deal needs to be done in connection with Limerick as well as in connection with other cities and provincial towns.  As far as the housing problem is concerned in cities like Limerick and in provincial towns, I think we are all in favour of giving every possible facility to the local authority in order that they will be in a position to do everything possible to provide houses for the people.  The only suggestion I have to make is that, in so far as the Minister has control, he should ensure that in city centres housing is not allowed to <Col N="679" /> fall into what can be described as derelict sites.</P>
      <P>In my opinion in many towns and cities considerable areas are let fall into what might be described as derelict sites.  The houses are condemned but they are left standing, occupying valuable space, while at the same time the local authority goes outside the city or town, as the case may be, to acquire land and build extra houses thereon.  I am not an architect; neither am I an engineer.</P>

I think it is right to say that it was due to the Minister's immediate predecessor that this boundary question was decided on, so far as the city and county are concerned.

I think that, since the boundary was extended to include 3,000 odd acres of the county, it is equitable that the people in the added area should have representation on the council.  I should like to sympathise with the people who are to be included within the city boundary if their rates should be increased.  I am glad that the Minister at least is giving them the chance of getting representation on the body which in future will control the rates they will be asked to pay.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for the reception which they have given to this Bill.  The point <Col N="680" /> made by Senator Quirke, in connection with derelict sites, may not be germane to the Bill which the House is now discussing, but it could arise on the Housing Bill which will be before the Seanad later this evening. I can assure the Senator that the point is not being lost sight of.  I am quite certain that the city council, which is to have two added members under this Bill, will be as greatly interested in that question as the 15 members who are there already.  I feel perfectly satisfied about that.  I can speak from long experience as a member of the Limerick City Council myself.  I am satisfied, too, that the request to add two members to the city council, so as to make the membership 17 instead of 15, is a reasonable one, since it has behind it the unanimous support of all Parties.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1950&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to apply the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, to the present financial year.  As Senators are aware, the 1946 Act applied to the two financial years 1946-47 and 1947-48, and has been continued since then by means of continuing Acts on the lines of the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that Senators are familiar with the principles underlying this measure.  The policy of relieving the farming community of part of the rate levy dates from the Local Government Act of 1898, under which a fixed grant of £599,011 was made each year for this purpose.  The amount of the grant was doubled in 1925, and was varied later by further enactments until it was stabilised in 1935-36 at the figure of <Col N="681" /> £1,870,000.  The grant remained stationary at this figure for 11 years, that is, up to and including the financial year 1945-46.</P>
    <P>The Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, came into operation in the financial year 1946-47 and made the fundamental change that instead of a grant of a fixed sum, the amount to be provided would vary automatically with variations in the general rate. Under that Act, the rate relief is given on the following basis:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  A primary allowance at the rate of three-fifths of the general rate on land valuations not exceeding £20, and the first £20 of higher valuations;</P>
    <P>(2)  a supplementary allowance of one-fifth of the general rate on the whole of the land valuation exceeding £20, and</P>
    <P>(3)  an employment allowance calculated at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the land valuation above £20, subject to the limitation that the allowance does not exceed £6 10s. in respect of each man at work.</P>
    <P>The effect of substituting this new method of calculating the amount of the grant was that, instead of the fixed sum of £1,870,000 which was paid in the preceding 11 years, the grant for the year 1946-47 increased to £2,910,378. Each year since then there has been a further increase, the figure for 1949-50 being £3,971,722.</P>
    <P>The extent of the rate relief afforded by the grant will be obvious when we consider that although the average gross rate in the £ in county health districts for the year 1949-50 was 22/7¾, the average net rate on agricultural land was 11/3½; or to put it in another way, the rates payable by farmers were slightly less than half what they would otherwise have been.</P>
    <P>The amount which will be payable by way of agricultural grant in the present financial year cannot be definitely ascertained until the last few months of the year, but as the average general rate in the £ in county health districts is about the same as last year's figure, I expect that the grant will be roughly equal to the figure for 1949-50, that is £3,971,722.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> The Bill now before the House does not contain any new principle.  It merely proposes to continue the agricultural grant on its existing basis for the present financial year.  As Senators are familiar with the principles on which this measure is based, and have accepted these principles on a number of occasions, I do not think it will be necessary for me to deal with the matter in any greater detail at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated in his closing remarks, the principle of this Bill has been accepted over a long period of years by this and the other House.  Therefore, I do not think there is any necessity for any long discussion on it, except to avail of the opportunity to mention one or two points.  The Minister has pointed out the great benefits, in the way of the remission of rates, which the Bill confers on farmers in general.  It provides relief, for example, to the extent of £6 10s. 0d. each for certain agricultural employees.  I should like to ask the Minister to bear in mind the burden of rates which falls on another section of the community, as well as the ever-increasing demands that are made on that section arising out of legislation introduced and passed by the Governments of the day.  I refer to those persons living in urban areas. So far as they are concerned, they get no remission of rates of any kind. From time to time legislation is passed by the Oireachtas, and Orders are made which have the effect of placing an increased burden on that class of ratepayer.  They get no assistance, and there is no relief for them in relation to the rates they pay.  As I have said, they get no remission of rates of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think no one will have very much criticism to offer in regard to this measure.  We all agree with it as far as it goes.  It is a Bill which, I think, every Senator can support. There is just one little criticism which I should like to make.  For a number of years, I made this criticism in the other House when this Bill came up there year after year.  Therefore, I feel that I cannot allow this opportunity <Col N="683" /> to pass without referring to the matter in the Seanad.  Even though this Bill provides relief in respect of certain employees engaged in agriculture, it is not, I suggest, an equitable arrangement inasmuch as the relief provided does not extend to all agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>Under the present arrangement, there is no provision for giving relief in respect of women workers in agriculture. In the county which I represent, a very large number of women are engaged in agriculture.  They are doing the same work as men and they are being paid the same wages.  I do not think that the arrangement under this Bill, in the matter of affording relief in respect of employees engaged in agriculture, can be said to be equitable until it is extended to include those women workers, always provided, of course, that the remuneration paid in the one case is the same as in the other, and that the women are not working for a lower wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the position of a small section of the farming community who live within boroughs or urban districts.  These farmers in some cases live four miles out from the town but they are still within the urban district.  They have to pay for light, sewerage and water but they enjoy none of these amenities.  On various occasions I have advocated that they should be treated on the same basis as farmers living in rural districts.  Some of them are probably engaged in milk production or perhaps in market gardening. It might be argued that they have within easy reach of them a better market than the farmer in the rural district proper but if they got the benefit of relief on their agricultural land, they could sell both their milk and their produce to the town worker on more favourable conditions and everybody in the town would benefit by that.  It is true that they are a small section of the community but, nevertheless, a section of the community whose interests have been overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> I have urged on various occasions under different Governments that people who live exclusively by farming, though they live in an urban district, should get the benefit of the relief on agricultural rates.  I hope that the Minister will bear these representations in mind and try to do something for these people.  Those living within the Galway borough district have to pay rates of about 32/- in the £ and in the urban district of Ballinasloe, which extends three or four miles out into the country, they pay 38/- in the £.  I think it is the highest urban rate in Ireland.  They have the benefit of neither light, water nor sewerage.  They reside in small thatched houses for the most part and they live exclusively by farming.  They are not, as I say, a big section of the community but nevertheless they are a section that have been overlooked by the Legislature in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. D. Burke Mr. D. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a small point to raise with regard to the employment allowance.  If a farmer happens to be unfortunate enough to lose one of his employees and is not able to replace him immediately, he forfeits the employment allowance for that year.  We all know that it may happen that a man in the employment of a farmer may decide to enter another occupation and leaves after giving a week's notice or it may be that a man may decide to go to England and leaves without giving any notice.  In both cases, the farmer is debarred from getting an allowance in respect of these men.  I think there should be some arrangement by which if the farmer got another man within a period of three or four weeks, he would get the relief less a deduction of one-twelfth in respect of the period when he had not a man in his employment.  He should not be debarred entirely from participating in the relief allowed for such employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke has made exactly the point I wanted to raise.  It is a matter that has come under my notice more than once.  Even where there is only a break of a few <Col N="685" /> days in some cases, the employer loses the benefit of the relief given on account of that particular man.  I do not think it is quite fair and I think there should be some arrangement whereby there would be a proportionate reduction for the short period during which the employer had not filled the vacancy but he certainly should not be deprived of relief for the whole year because of a short break in the employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire also to support the suggestion made by Senators Burke and O'Connell.  It is a matter that is of peculiar interest to County Limerick which is one of the largest dairying counties in the country and where men are employed for perhaps a period of ten or 11 months in the year. It might be possible to base the allowance on the amount paid in wages but, in any case, there should be an allowance for shorter periods than 12 months.  There should also be an allowance for women as sometimes they are employed almost exclusively for milking cows.  I should like also to support Senator Quinn's plea regarding farmers who live within city boundaries.  Owing to the development of motor traffic, these men have no great advantage over the farmer living miles outside an urban area.  The farmer living 15 or 16 miles outside a city will produce the very same commodities as the farmer living within the urban boundary is in the habit of producing and he can deliver them by lorry just as quickly as the man living within the city boundary.  The labour costs of the man living within the city boundary are also very considerable.  I think, therefore, that the man living exclusively by agriculture, although living within a city boundary, would be as fully entitled to relief in rates as farmers living outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, in support of the point raised by Senator Quinn, that this was a rather acute problem in two urban areas in County Cavan.  We had the position over a number of years that a few farmers residing in urban areas were not able to get the benefit of the relief on agricultural rates which was provided for <Col N="686" /> the rest of us.  I think the Minister will have to face this situation. Actually the people living in the two urban areas in Cavan got over the problem by deurbanising the towns and the net result is that relief will have to be paid to the farmers who reside in these towns.  I personally do not regard it as a happy development to see a small local community divesting themselves of their responsibilities and obligations in this way.  I think it would be much better to see a spirit amongst the people of our towns which showed that they had a certain pride in their towns and a certain readiness to work together for their betterment. There are many things that the local authority could do for them which will not be done for them by a county authority functioning as such, but if these communities decide that certain of their residents are denied benefits that are forthcoming to other sections of the agricultural community and are driven to take the step of deurbanising themselves, they cannot be blamed. At the same time I think it is an undesirable development.  The net result is that the agricultural grant will have to be increased in these counties on account of the demand that will be made by these people who are no longer living in an urban area since the towns have been deurbanised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister will have to face that, otherwise I think that the decision that was taken in these two urban areas, Cootehill and Belturbet&mdash;Belturbet was a very old borough&mdash;will be followed by other urban areas.  You will find that movement spreading and the net result will be that the agricultural grant will have to be increased everywhere to meet the additional demand.  As I say, I regard this de-urbanisation as undesirable.  I think it would be much better to see our people prepared to come together and assume all necessary obligations in regard to their local areas rather than divest themselves of that responsibility. We all like to see a spirit of citizenship developed amongst our people rather than see a development of the tendency which I have described. That is the situation confronting the Minister and if he does not deal with <Col N="687" /> it in one way he will have to deal with it in another.  I agree with Senator Quinn that it would be much better to amend the existing legislation to meet the point than that we should have towns deurbanised.  I do not know what the total cost would be.  I am speaking of urban areas.  I am not speaking of the point in regard to people living in close proximity to Dublin City.  That is a rather different problem, a much bigger and a much wider problem.  I do not understand that at all; I do the other.  I think it would be interesting for us if we could have some indication of the total cost to the Exchequer if people in urban areas got the same relief as farmers living outside them.  The Minister will have to meet this in one way if not in the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the points which have been raised but at the outset I would like to remind Senators that this is only a continuing Bill, not one which could make any serious reconstructions in order to give effect to the suggestions.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Baxter and Senator Quinn I would remind them that urban landowners are paying on reduced valuation and are not completely left out in the cold.  They pay on three-fifths the valuation of agricultural land.  With regard to the question of Cootehill and Belturbet the necessity for de-urbanisation was not mainly caused by the lack of agricultural grant, but was due to the fact that the buildings valuation did not enable services to be adequately provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The case of Belturbet is definitely due to the agricultural grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1947-48 the rate paid by farmers in the urban districts was twice that paid by farmers in the county health districts and in 1949 it was one and a half times so that the difference between the two is decreasing. They are not left completely without consideration in so far as their assessable valuation is only three-fifths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question raised by Senator Bennett is a very old question.  The <Col N="688" /> question of extending the employment allowance to ladies has been raised every time that the matter has been discussed, but I would hold out no hope of being able to do it now. The primary reason for not giving it to female workers is the difficulty in determining which is an agricultural worker and which is a domestic worker.  It is practically impossible in the case of a female relative, for instance, to determine whether she is whole time engaged in agricultural work and is not doing some domestic work as well.  It is difficult even in the case of a female employee not to mention a relative.  Although there may be a number in the county where Senator Bennett comes from it is a negligible figure over the country as a whole and it has not been considered wise or desirable to include female workers.</P>
    <P>On the point of continuous employment I should like to say that the principle underlying the Acts from the very first day was not that it was to be a subsidy to casual employment but rather that it was to be an inducement to farmers to keep their workers in continuous employment and not lay them off during the slack times.  Continuity is the chief plank on which the thing is based. The point was made by Senator Burke that a man who leaves his employment and gives a week's notice cannot be covered fully, but the gap in between is one that should be capable of being bridged in some shape or form, so long as it is the intention of the farmer to keep him in employment.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins referred to the ever-increasing demands on urban rate-payers but in this financial year it is a little less than in 1949-50.  The difference is a fraction of a penny.  State grants of all kinds including agricultural grants have increased out of proportion to the increase in the rates.  In 1939-40 the rates collected amounted to £6,510,000 while State grants were £4,734,000.  That goes on all along the table.  In 1949-50 rates collected were estimated at £10,900,000 while State grants were £13,649,000.  For last year we have definite figures and the rates collected were £9,500,000 and State grants were £10,749,000.  Even if the <Col N="689" /> rates have gone up State grants have increased by a bigger ratio.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with all the points which were raised, but this is merely a continuing Bill and I cannot hold out any hope of meeting all of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general purposes of this Bill are to remedy certain defects in existing housing legislation, to supplement the powers of local authorities, to amend the law regarding State assistance towards private enterprise housing and to confer a number of new powers on both the Minister and the local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is, I know, the wish of all Parties that the acceleration of the housing programme achieved up to the present should be maintained and, if possible, intensified.  The practical object of this Bill is to clear the way for this purpose and to provide a better legislative basis for that comprehensive expansion in operations which has been developing.</P>
      <P>In addition to suggestions put forward to me in Dáil Eireann from time to time, I have also discussed with many representative bodies, mainly local authorities, in the past year a considerable number of defects in the present housing code.  The present Bill is largely based on the experience thus gained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to explain first the provisions dealing with the matters administered primarily or directly by the Minister for Local Government. <Col N="690" /> The main items in this category relate to the making of State grants to private enterprise erecting or reconstructing houses.  The importance of private enterprise in the national housing effort has been recognised in successive Acts since 1924.  The Bill makes a number of important changes in the existing law dealing with this subject.</P>
    <P>Section 9 abolishes the prohibition on the payment of second grants towards reconstruction work, provided that 15 years have elapsed since the completion of erection or reconstruction of the house for which the first grant was given.  &ldquo;Reconstruction&rdquo; for the purposes of the second grant means the provision of a new roof or the increasing of the accommodation afforded by the house including, if required, the installation of water and sewerage facilities.  Works of ordinary maintenance will not be considered.</P>
    <P>A number of applications for second grants have been received in recent years and it is felt that a strong case exists for the removal of the existing restriction.  The Acts allowing reconstruction grants go back to 1924, and it is reasonable to assume that many houses built or reconstructed since then now need attention to prolong their habitability.  Reconstruction grants will not be paid at the end of 15 years as a matter of course and applications will be examined to ensure that the reconstruction is necessary to render the house more suitable for human habitation.</P>
    <P>Section 12 removes the statutory restriction in Section 5 (3) (e) of the 1932 Act on payment of a reconstruction grant unless, before reconstruction commences, the house was certified, by an officer appointed by the Minister, to be suitable for reconstruction.  The work may in future be certified after commencement.  The existing requirement causes administrative difficulties and hardships where applicants proceeded with work in ignorance of the law.  Adequate safeguards can be provided for administratively to cover this section.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill includes property which was the subject of an award under the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act, 1941, in the categories <Col N="691" /> for which grants under the Housing Acts will not be made available. Compensation payable under the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act, 1941, was made conditional on the owner erecting new buildings and it is desirable that State assistance in such cases should not be duplicated.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill raises from £35 to £50 the maximum aggregate of the rateable value of the agricultural holding of an applicant for a reconstruction grant.  Over 90 per cent. of the farming class will thus become eligible for these grants.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a new type of reconstruction grant in urban and rural areas.  In urban areas the grant will be available to occupiers of working-class dwellings not exceeding £12 valuation.  In rural areas it will be available to occupiers with a similar valuation limit not already eligible for the existing reconstruction grants on the grounds that they are not agricultural labourers or persons who derive their living solely or mainly from agriculture.</P>
    <P>The new eligible classes will include domestic servants, fishermen, craftsmen of all kinds, serving soldiers, nurses, midwives, teachers, local and State servants, etc.  The exclusion of these classes in the past undoubtedly created undesirable anomalies.  The cost will be met equally by the applicant, the local authority and the State, subject to the contribution of the local authority and the State not exceeding £80 each.  It will not be obligatory on the local authority to make a grant.  If they decline, the State will not withhold its own grant on this account, except in the four county boroughs and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  The general purpose is to forestall decay and to avert obsolescence. Obsolescence in towns might impose heavy future liabilities on both the State and local authorities and it is important that existing working-class houses should last as long as possible. The provision will, I hope, result in a reduction of capital expenditure on new housing.</P>
    <P>Under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, grants are payable to private <Col N="692" /> persons and public utility societies for the erection of houses for owner-occupation. That Act terminated grants for speculative building and replaced them by a system which requires a private person to enter into a contract for the erection of a house as a condition precedent to the payment of a grant.  At present, therefore, grants cannot be given for the purchase of a completed house; nor if the contract is entered into after the commencement of building operations.  It has been strongly represented that these restrictions adversely affect private building activities, and create serious difficulties and hardships.  The purchaser must enter into commitments when the only visual evidence of his house is represented by plans or drawings.  The builder must await individual orders before he can commence or continue operations.  He is thus compelled to develop a site in stages, with resultant delays in building programme and possible increases in cost.</P>
    <P>At present a grant cannot be transferred where an intending purchaser is unable to fulfil his contract.  The builder may be left with a completed house on his hands and the person for whom the house was intended may also be involved in serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>Under Section 6 of the Bill grants will in future be payable to persons purchasing new houses for their own occupation.  The prospective purchaser will thus be in a position to pick and choose in an open market and will be able to see the finished product before he decides to buy.  The builder can plan for full construction unhampered by uncertainty that grants will be available on eventual sale, if the houses comply with the necessary building standards.</P>
    <P>The present scales of grants for new houses will not be altered.  The maximum floor area of houses eligible for grants is being increased under Section 14 from 1,250 to 1,400 square feet. This extension will meet the requirements of large families.  Experience has shown that it is difficult to design a satisfactory house for the larger family within the existing limit of 1,250 square feet.  The new limit will hardly result in a wide extension of the <Col N="693" /> classes claiming grants.  It is felt rather that persons with large families in a position to build houses up to the existing maximum of 1,250 square feet will be enabled to purchase a reasonably larger type of house for the accommodation of their families.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill will enable housing authorities to make to any person erecting or purchasing a house in respect of which a grant is made under Section 16 of the Act of 1948 or Section 6 of the Bill, a grant not exceeding the amount of the grant paid by the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes that Irish nationals purchasing houses to which Section 6 relates will be exempt from payment of the higher rate of stamp duty under the Finance Acts.  The normal charge of £1 per cent. on the consideration will apply instead of £5 per cent. set out in the Finance Act of 1947.  Thus if the house costs £2,000 the stamp duty would be £20 only, instead of £100 as under existing law. The proposed relief will not apply to non-nationals.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill removes doubts about the validity of grants paid under Section 16 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, in circumstances where a house is occupied by the legal successor in title of an applicant who dies between the date of application for a grant and the completion of construction or reconstruction.  In so far as new houses are concerned, this difficulty will be resolved in future cases by the application of the provisions of Section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule abolishes limitations imposed by past Housing Acts on the aggregate amount of payments of housing grants.  These limitations have made it necessary in the past to seek recurrent legislative authority for extensions of the prescribed limits.  The present limit of £1,750,000 is fixed by Section 1 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1949.  The annual amounts to be expended in future will be subject to the control of the Dáil as they will form part of the annual Vote for the Department.</P>
    <P>At present the existing scales of grants apply to houses completed before the 1st April, 1952.  The Bill makes no change in this respect but <Col N="694" /> policy regarding the scales of grants applicable to houses completed after the existing terminal date will be placed before the Oireachtas in due course and in sufficient time to enable persons contemplating building after the 1st April, 1952, to know their position clearly.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Act of 1948 enabled grants to be paid in respect of houses commenced between 1st November, 1945, and 1st November, 1947.  This section was inserted at a last stage in the passage of the 1947 Bill, and it was inadvertently omitted at that time to provide for a remission of rates on these houses, such as was granted in every other case where a grant was made under the Housing Acts.  This omission is being rectified by Section 15 of this Bill.  Rates remissions are also proposed for new houses built under Section 6 of the Bill and also for reconstruction grant cases where no grant for such reconstruction is made by the housing authority.</P>
    <P>I now proceed to the provisions of the Bill which deal with matters primarily and directly dealt with by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 17 confers powers on local authorities to acquire land compulsorily for leasing or sale to individuals and public utility societies.  It has been suggested that local authorities already possess these powers but as the matter is not free from doubt the new section will remove any obscurities which deter local authorities from acquiring land for these purposes. Senators are doubtless aware of the high costs and difficulty of acquisition of suitable sites in most urban areas at present.  These factors have reacted unfavourably on the efforts of private individuals and public utility societies to provide houses.  The common-sense approach to this problem is to enable housing authorities to acquire and develop such lands as may be needed not only for their own housing operations but also for the needs of other classes, particularly those who are eligible for State grants and Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts loans.  This provision should facilitate better planning of general urban development and <Col N="695" /> should result in better balanced community settlements.</P>
    <P>Where lands acquired and cottages erected under the Labourers Acts are brought within an urban area as a result of boundary extensions, such lands and cottages may, under Section 22, be dealt with as if they had been provided by the urban district council under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  This will regularise points of procedure such as the selection of tenants for vacant houses of this class.  The right of an existing tenant to purchase a cottage under the Labourers Act, 1936, will, however, be safeguarded.  The powers contained in Section 25 of the Bill taken in conjunction with the provisions of Section 23 will achieve this end.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the Bill gives extended powers to rural authorities in dealing with lands acquired under the Labourers Acts.  Section 16 of the 1885 Labourers Act enables rural authorities to acquire lands to be used for allotments by agricultural labourers.  Such lands, however, must be held for all time for use as allotments.  It is felt that rural authorities should be allowed to use such lands for any of their powers under the Labourers Acts.  This discretion would be of particular importance in non-municipal towns where suitable sites for building are not always available.</P>
    <P>Section 28 of the Bill repeals the final sentence of Section 6 of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, which requires housing authorities acquiring land for the erection of labourers' cottages to &ldquo;avoid all interference with demesne and amenity of residence of the owner of the lands proposed to be taken or with any home farm or lands immediately adjoining and customarily occupied with such residence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These exemptions from compulsory acquisition have seriously interfered with the efforts of some housing authorities to secure sites.  The exemptions represent a special type of statutory protection of limited application not applying to the general class of agricultural holder in this country.  While this statutory protection is absolute in <Col N="696" /> rural areas the interpretation of the terms &ldquo;demesne&rdquo;, &ldquo;amenity of residence&rdquo; and &ldquo;home farm&rdquo; has caused much litigation which has not, however, clarified the position.</P>
    <P>Existing procedure for compulsory acquisition of land already contains adequate safeguards for the protection of rights of property owners.  Owners have a right to appeal to the Minister against local compulsory acquisition proposals.  The Minister can then hold a public local inquiry at which the owner can appear or be represented. No case now exists for the continuance of the type of privilege afforded under the 1883 Act.</P>
    <P>A similar protection of a less absolute type from compulsory acquisition by urban authorities is given by Section 9 of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, to every home farm, park, garden or pleasure ground required for the amenity or convenience of a dwelling-house. It is also proposed to repeal this section.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Bill gives a general power to the Minister to correct obvious mistakes in compulsory purchase orders under the Labourers Acts and to dispense with the services of notices in circumstances where the interests of the property owners will not be prejudiced.  This power already applies to orders made by urban authorities under Section 45 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>Section 17 will empower all housing authorities to provide houses for letting or for sale to classes other than the present &ldquo;working classes&rdquo; or &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; class.  These houses will be eligible for the grants applicable to private persons erecting new houses for their own occupation.  This type of house should not be provided by local authorities until the needs of the working classes and the agricultural labourer classes in their own districts are satisfied.  The question of providing for the most urgent and needy classes must, therefore, receive priority from local authorities.  Houses erected under this new provision should be self-supporting and should involve no financial loss to the local authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Section 27 of the Bill confers additional consequential powers on rural housing authorities for the provision of playgrounds, shops and other amenities in connection with rural housing.  These powers are already enjoyed by urban housing authorities in connection with their operations under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Bill will apply the provisions of Part II of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, to rural housing authorities, so as to enable county councils to deal effectively with unhealthy areas in non-municipal towns and villages.  This amendment will enable the clearance order procedure to operate in rural areas as well as in urban areas.  County councils are not at present empowered to make clearance orders dealing with unhealthy areas or to purchase compulsorily unfit property on the same terms as those applicable to urban housing authorities, that is, the estimated value of the site, less the cost of clearance. There is no valid reason for this restriction on the powers of rural housing authorities.  Conditions in many non-municipal towns are often as bad as those obtaining in urban areas and it is clearly desirable that rural authorities should be placed on the same footing as urban authorities in dealing with unhealthy areas.</P>
    <P>Under Section 24 of the Bill, rural housing authorities will be enabled to provide houses for letting to persons other than agricultural labourers living in rural areas, non-municipal towns, and, in some instances, in town commissioners' areas.  This extension is very necessary.  At present rural housing authorities can provide cottages only for persons who come within the extended definition of an agricultural labourer.  While this definition is undoubtedly wide, it does not embrace all types of workers, and categories such as serving soldiers, pensioners, midwives, etc., living in unincorporated towns and villages are not eligible for cottages.  This anomaly presents considerable difficulties in the larger non-municipal towns where persons of these classes are fairly considerable in number, and may be living in overcrowded conditions or in insanitary dwellings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> The proposed extension of the powers of rural housing authorities will enable equal consideration to be given to the housing needs of all classes of workers. The same rates of subsidy, payable in respect of cottages provided under the Labourers Acts, will apply to houses to be built under this provision.</P>
    <P>In Section 18, it is proposed to amend Section 30 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, to enable all urban housing authorities to provide reserved houses for occupation by persons of a particular class.  The 1948 Act restricted this power to county boroughs, boroughs and urban areas with a population of over 12,000.  The original intention of this section was to provide houses for classes such as newly-weds and aged couples, who might not require dwellings of the size normally required for larger family units.  In my opinion, this method of providing for the needs of newly-weds and aged couples represents an excellent and economical procedure and it should be extended to the other urban areas.  In fact, some councils in the areas at present not covered by the provision have expressed a desire to provide for these classes in this manner.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes certain amendments of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  There have been many criticisms of certain provisions of these Acts and some important amendments are warranted.  Section 32 amends the definition of the market value of the premises which forms the basis on which local authorities may make advances to applicants under the Acts.  At present the market value is related solely to the estimated value which the house would realise in an open sale.  This amendment will relate the market value of a new house to the reasonable cost of its construction. This will enable local authorities to give more liberal advances in the future, and, if builders keep prices at reasonable levels, there will be nothing to prevent the advances being fixed at percentages corresponding to equivalent proportions of the selling price. County councils will also be enabled to operate the Acts in urban areas where the urban councils are unable or unwilling to make advances.  This provision <Col N="699" /> is intended to cover the case of smaller urban districts with low valuations and slender resources.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to repeal sub-section 9 (4) of the Act of 1899, which prevents local authorities from operating the Act for five years following any financial year in which the loss under the Acts equals or exceeds the sum of one halfpenny in the £ in a county borough or one penny in the £ in an urban district.  This provision has operated unsatisfactorily in some urban areas and it is felt that there is no need for its retention in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 33 of the Bill removes any doubts on the powers of housing authorities to base their loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts on a provisional valuation basis, that is, the market value estimated at the time the plans for the house are submitted by the applicant or by the builder to the local authority.  It has been suggested that local authorities could fix a valuation for the purpose of the loan only when the house was completed.  Such an interpretation would lead to hardship and the matter is accordingly now being placed beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Section 34 of the Bill introduces the principle of a minimum cash contribution of 5 per cent. of the market value of the house to be made by the applicant out of his own resources. Thus, in the case of a house valued at, say, £1,400, the applicant will be expected to make a cash contribution of not less than £70.  The State grant, plus the loan to be made by the housing authority under the Act, should normally be sufficient to make up the balance of the purchase price, if the builder's price and the local authority's valuation show a reasonable correspondence with each other.</P>
    <P>Section 36 of the Bill will enable advances under the Acts to be made to joint proprietors.  Section 37 will enable the Minister to make regulations for the purposes of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  These amendments of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts are, in general, intended to promote the smoother working <Col N="700" /> of the Acts and to eliminate as far as possible the various causes of complaints which have been made in recent years, particularly in regard to the position of the borrower.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for the continuance in operation of the Labourers Acts for a period of five years expiring on 31st December, 1955.  The intention here is to avoid having to provide each year, as at present, in the Expiring Laws Act for the continuance of the 1883 Act.  It is hoped in the intervening period to effect a consolidation of the Labourers Acts and other enactments relating to housing.</P>
    <P>Finally, some further amendments of the Housing Acts of a miscellaneous type are included in the Bill.  It is proposed in Section 19 to extend the period in which the demolition or use otherwise than as dwellings of urban habitable houses, except with the permission of the local authority, is prohibited, from 31st December, 1950, to 31st December, 1955.  It is felt that, in view of the general shortage of houses, all proposals involving demolition or conversion for purposes other than use as dwellings should continue to be subject to control by housing authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill is intended to remedy a defect in existing legislation where it is not quite clear that, as a condition for payment of subsidy or grant, the existing requirement that appropriate rates of wages or conditions of labour generally recognised by trade unions shall be paid or observed, applies at all stages of the construction of a house.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill proposes to amend the definition of &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo; contained in Section 11 of the Housing (Amendment) Act of 1948. This definition, in practice, had been found to be defective in so far as local authorities had no power of control where the house was occupied by the owner and only one letting was made. The new definition will cover all cases where two or more dwellings are created.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill is likewise intended to remove difficulties that have been experienced by housing <Col N="701" /> authorities in the operation of the provisions of Section 12 of the Act of 1948, dealing with the control of multiple dwellings.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Bill amends sub-section 43 (6) of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.  Section 42 of the 1948 Act enables the Minister to confirm a compulsory purchase order without inquiry in so far as it relates to land to the acquisition of which no objection was made or to the acquisition of which an objection was made and subsequently withdrawn.  Sub-section 43 (6) of the 1948 Act deals with the time for the coming into operation of such an Order.  As it stands, it fixes a time for the coming into force of an Order made in a case where there is no objection; it makes no provision for the case of an Order made where an objection was lodged which was withdrawn. The purpose of this section is to make provision for this latter case.</P>
    <P>This completes my outline of the main features of the Bill which, as I have stated, is designed primarily to eliminate the more obvious defects in existing legislation, and to supplement and extend the existing powers and duties of all housing authorities.</P>
    <P>I feel assured that the passing of the Bill will be of considerable assistance in pressing forward the general campaign for better housing in the country, and its passage will be welcomed by all classes of the community who desire to participate in the national housing drive.  There is no need for me to elaborate on the benefits that will accrue to the country as a whole by the earliest possible solution of our housing problem.  These are well known to all of you and it is with confidence, therefore, that I recommend this measure to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of all Parties welcome a Bill of this kind.  They welcome any proposals that are put forward to solve this great national problem. Before going on to deal with the Bill, I should like to make a few short references to the Act at present in force.  From time to time many complaints are made as to the delay in the payment of grants under the existing Act.  I quite understand the difficulties <Col N="702" /> in the way of prompt payment in all cases but a considerable amount of delay would be eliminated if on the issue of the first certificate for part payment by the appointed officer to the Department payment could then be made.  Time is often wasted in other inquiries being carried out by the local government housing inspector for the various districts.  If there is a person known as the appointed officer, he will have authority to issue the approval certificate.  It is his job to approve of the site and to issue a certificate for payment.  On that certificate being issued to the Department, payment should be made as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>I make that suggestion for many reasons.  It would benefit the individual but it would also benefit utility societies, who have done an immense amount of good work in assisting the farmer in the building of his house and particularly in assisting the farmer, who for one reason or another was not in a position to get materials on credit, by issuing credit notes to the merchant.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Department can quite appreciate that if a society issues a number of credit notes for £100 or £200 to a local merchant in a country town, that merchant will soon be in the position of not being able to supply and building will be held up in the district.  In order to continue the confidence of the merchants in the societies and the societies' interest in proceeding with the work, I would appeal to the Minister to make arrangements whereby the first payment would be made as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the further point that some slight delay may be due to the fact that the appointed officers are not duly remunerated for the work they are expected to carry out.  A fee of £2 is allowed for the appointed officer for each house sanctioned.  First, the appointed officer has to inspect and approve of the site.  That entails one visit.  Having approved of the site and having given the O.K. to the applicant to go ahead with the erection of the house, he inspects the house when the roof is on so that he may issue the first certificate for part payment.  That is a second visit.  When the house is completed <Col N="703" /> he has again to visit and issue a final certificate for final payment. The appointed officer, in addition to making these three visits, has in almost every case to render assistance in filling up forms and has to help the applicant in every way as to the regulations governing the grant.  I know some of the persons holding these positions and I know that they have to hire a car in order to make these visits. It is quite possible that in view of the fact that they are not being paid enough for the job they will not be anxious to visit a particular area until there is a number of cases in the district and that in that way work that could be proceeding is held up.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Bill.  As I have said, we are all glad that any measure would be introduced that would expedite the provision of homes for the people.  I regret that a measure of this kind should be introduced at the tail-end of the session.  While the Minister has gone into great detail in explaining each section of the Bill, I would put it to the House that this Bill contains many sections that would require very careful examination by the Seanad before being passed.  In some cases&mdash;particularly in Section 17&mdash;it is giving very wide powers to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The main feature of the Bill, as the Minister has stated, is that power is given to make grants to the first purchaser of a new house.  I wonder if it is the best approach to this problem to make a grant to the person who is the first purchaser of a house or whether it would not have been better if a grant were given to the builder who erected the house.  I can quite understand that if that were done, probably the Minister would be accused of assisting and encouraging speculative builders.  In the long run, I suppose, it would be six of one and half a dozen of the other because in any case it will benefit the builder and it is the same price that the builders will charge for the house.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister for Local Government has succeeded, not in going the full distance, but in going a <Col N="704" /> good part of the way in getting a concession that this House and the other House failed to get from the Minister for Finance.  I refer to the reduction of the stamp duty to the original fee of 1 per cent. to the first purchaser of a house.</P>
    <P>The second important feature of the Bill is that power is given to local authorities to provide houses for persons other than working-class persons.  The Minister and the House will admit that local authorities throughout the country are at present and, I assume, will be for a considerable length of time, busily engaged and find it very difficult to complete the work of five or six years in providing houses for those people who come within the category of working-class people. The local authorities throughout the country have made a very fine contribution to the solution of this problem.  It does not matter, after all, what Government may be in power: the policy of providing homes for our people must go on.  The greater part of the burden of that work falls on the local authorities. Therefore, we should not allow this opportunity to pass without paying tribute to those persons who are certainly doing their part of the work. However, to place an additional burden on the local authorities and to say to them: &ldquo;In future it will be your duty not alone to provide houses for the working classes&mdash;that is, people who come within the definition of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and the Labourers Acts&mdash;but also to provide houses for every other class of persons who wish to avail of a house,&rdquo; might be all right when the local authorities would have the other problem solved.  I would welcome it in relation to one particular aspect.  I believe that if that had been carried out in the past&mdash;if the responsibility had been placed on local authorities to provide every class of person with a house and either to rent it or to sell it, as the case may be&mdash;we would probably have avoided many of the eyesores which have been erected in the building up of our towns and cities. If the work had been carried out under town-planning organisation I am sure the results would have been better.  Be <Col N="705" /> that as it may, the Bill now before us calls on the local authorities to take up this type of work.</P>
    <P>It goes one step further.  It gives power to the local authority to acquire land by compulsion, and not alone for the purpose of building houses for the working classes because the local authority, having acquired the land compulsorily to develop it and build houses on it, may let or lease these houses to persons in any walk of life. They may go further.  They may purchase the site and, having purchased or acquired the site compulsorily, they may turn that site over to a public utility society or even to an individual. There are grave dangers in the giving of these powers to a local authority. I do not want for one moment to suggest that every local authority will abuse such powers but abuse can enter into it.  I have in mind a case where a local authority acquired land for a particular purpose, namely, the erection of houses for the working classes.  The particular site was later sold by the local authority for another purpose. The person from whom that land was acquired compulsorily in the first instance was an ordinary worker.  The particular plot of land was a very valuable plot of land to him.  Had the second purchaser who purchased the land eventually from the local authority been compelled in the ordinary way to purchase that land in the open market the former owner would certainly have got a better price for it than he did get under the arbitration held in connection with the compulsory acquisition of that land.  After all, I suppose we are not all saints and scholars in this island at the moment.  It could happen that influence of one kind or another could be brought to bear on a particular local authority and more especially, probably, on the officers of a particular local authority to acquire a particular plot of land for building purposes &mdash;and that particular plot of land could be handed over to A, B or C to erect a house for his own accomodation.  I suggest that great care should be taken in a matter of this kind.  I am sure the local authorities in general will do so.</P>
    <P>However, I draw the attention of the Seanad to this particular section <Col N="706" /> so that it will not be allowed to pass without receiving every consideration. In that way, if there are dangers&mdash;the danger I see in it and which other Senators also may see, or some other danger&mdash;we will voice our opinion to the Minister and ensure that every care will be taken so that when we give the power to the local authority there will be no abuse of that power, as there could be abuse to my mind.</P>
    <P>The next provision is the extension of the payment of reconstruction grants.  I would plead with the Minister to shorten the period from 15 years to 12 years.  I have a number of communications from people who, if the term were shortened to 12 years, would come within the scope of these grants.  These people are very needy people and although they got a grant for reconstruction purposes some 15 or 16 years ago&mdash;in one instance it was a building grant&mdash;they were never in a position to complete the work.  They now feel that if the term were shortened to 12 years they would come within the scope of the provision and thereby be in a position to complete the work started some 15 years ago.  I quite understand that the provision the Minister is making is for certain cases where particular works were carried out under the original Act and that now it may be necessary to put on a new roof or to carry out certain other works which he has mentioned.  One of the most important features of the new Bill, though this does not affect the rural areas as much it it affects the towns and cities, refers to loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. In the memorandum which was circulated with the Bill the Minister explained that the definition of &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is being altered.  On a previous occasion we had a very long discussion in this House as to how one would arrive at the definition of &ldquo;market value.&rdquo; While this probably is a concession, I put it to the Minister that it is not a concession that is going to help the applicant for a loan.  It will help him at the moment, probably, to succeed in getting the sanction of the local authority or of the insurance company or of the building society or of the building organisation to which he may make his application.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> I do not think it will affect the building societies so much but where the local authority or the corporation, as the case may be, is considering making a grant to an individual they will not, in future, take into consideration the &ldquo;market value&rdquo; of the house but, instead, what would be regarded as the reasonable cost of the erection of the house, including all the legal expenses, and they will base the amount of money they are going to make available to that person by way of loan on the basis of what they consider to be the reasonable cost.  I admit that that is a help in that it is a help to the applicant to get more money.  However, it is also placing an additional burden on the applicant's shoulders because, having borrowed an increased sum of money to purchase the house, and thereby having to find less money himself, he will be compelled to pay a greater annuity for whatever term of years may apply and in that way you will be putting a greater burden on the applicant's shoulders.</P>
    <P>We have heard much in the past about what should or should not be the proper rate of interest charged in regard to housing.  In November or December, 1947, a motion was before Dáil Eireann which demanded that the rate of interest for housing should not be greater than 1¼ per cent.  I think the present Minister for Finance at one time gave expression to such a pious view.  I put it to the Minister now that he would be helping the particular type of person whom it is proposed to assist in this section if, instead of making available more money, he would make a lesser sum available at a reduced rate of interest.</P>
    <P>In bringing about the changes that are being brought about, from the market value to what the corporation of assessors might now think would be a reasonable cost, has the Minister taken into consideration the likelihood of this position arising&mdash;under present circumstances, I do not see any hope of it arising for a considerable time, but it may happen&mdash;that, if reductions in the cost of materials are brought about and you have a greater output <Col N="708" /> from labour and you find that housing costs in general are reduced, the persons who have acquired houses&mdash;and in this connection one must have regard to the basis on which the loans were issued and the fact that the value of houses, has depreciated&mdash;may find it difficult to meet the annuity and they may make up their minds to vacate the houses and leave them to the local authority?  The local authority will then find there will be a very different figure ascertained in regard to reasonable cost and probably they will have to face a heavy loss.</P>
    <P>I saw a position of that kind almost arising: in fact, it did take place in Galway and would have had a very serious effect were it not for the war coming along.  The war came and building was held up and, instead of being a burden, the particular houses became an asset to the local authority. But there was a period in which the local authority found it difficult to get applicants for particular houses from which loanees had gone, because they were unable to meet the charges.  That position could arise again very easily if a depression came or if materials and housing costs were reduced and people made up their minds to leave one house and go into another&mdash;to leave the dearer houses on the hands of the local authority.</P>
    <P>That bears relation to the provision made that the applicants will have to find only 5 per cent. of the total cost. That is going to encourage people to become the owners of their homes. But the same argument applies there again.  The point I made has relation to this.  I would much prefer, instead of making provision to give the applicant a greater amount, that steps would be taken to reduce the cost of housing and reduce the loan and have a lower rate of interest.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot within recent months, indeed, since the end of the war, about the high cost of building. Some hold the view that there is something wrong in the tenders sent in to local authorities, that the builders are making considerable profits, that the providers are charging unreasonable <Col N="709" /> prices for their materials, and that the workers are not giving of their best in output.  These are three, at least, of the contributing factors to the maintenance of the present high cost of building.  The Department is charged in respect of housing of this particular type, and is charged in particular with examining every tender and every contract sent up from a local authority.  I wonder if the officials have endeavoured to find out if there is any truth in some statements we hear made?  Has the Minister ever put it to the engineering Department: &ldquo;This is the general type of house we are building and I want you to go into the present-day costs of such a house and, taking into consideration local circumstances, ascertain the amount that that type of house can be built for in Galway, Roscommon, Sligo, Cork or Dublin and, having got that information, will you compare it with the tenders received?&rdquo;  If the tender is not in some reasonable way related to the estimate prepared by the engineers, then he should have an investigation.  The Department should not give out any tender until the officials are satisfied that the local authority and the community generally are getting good value for their money.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are making a big contribution, the rate payers in every town and city are making a big contribution, towards this housing problem.  I know that in many cases they are contributing to provide homes for people in better circumstances, people whose incomes are larger than their own.</P>
    <P>The next important point is rural housing.  We must admit that for one reason or another, particularly having regard to our past history and the conditions of our small farmers, we have slum problems in the rural areas as bad as there are in Dublin or any other of our cities.  While much is being said about the slums in the cities, very little is being done to remedy the bad conditions in many parts of rural Ireland. We complain about the flight from the land and emigration, but when one moves around the country districts and sees the condition of many of the houses in which our people <Col N="710" /> are living, one will wonder not alone why people are leaving but why people would live there at all.</P>
    <P>There is very little provision being made to help those people to have a proper home.  I know the conditions under every Housing Act; I know that a person in a position to build a house in a rural area will get a generous grant, but that is very little use to a man with five or six acres; to him a grant of £235 is of little or no avail. The local authority can, under this Bill, build a new house for him, but he must be in a position to pay a weekly rent.  At the moment his rent and rates for the year might probably not exceed £5, but if the local authority undertake the erection of a new home, even taking into consideration the grant the Government would make under this Bill, the rent of that house would be completely out of his reach.</P>
    <P>I made a suggestion some years ago and I make it again for what it is worth.  In the congested areas we have a particular problem.  I will take Connemara as an example, but the same problem exists in Donegal and Kerry.  The problem is that of providing new homes for the people there.  The Minister may reply: &ldquo;What about the Gaeltacht Housing Act&rdquo;?  The provisions of that Act are such that they will apply only in cases where the new house is a substitute for an existing house, and also they apply only where the Irish language is the spoken language of the home. Further, the Act makes no provision for a young man and a young girl in the Gaeltacht who wish to settle down and stay there.  They would not come under the Gaeltacht Housing Act because they are not erecting a home to substitute an existing home.</P>
    <P>The local government grants of £235 would not be sufficient for them, without some other assistance.  There is no use in telling them they can get a loan from the county council, as they would not be able to repay the loan.  There are other ways of meeting this.  The manager of Galway County Council made some very striking references to it some years ago.  The county council cannot engage in building labourers' <Col N="711" /> cottages there, for the simple reason that the people in many cases would not be in a position to pay the rent.</P>
    <P>It is a national problem to provide homes for some of these people.  The only solution I can offer to it is that the Minister would take power to arrange that where his inspector, together with the county medical officer of health, would recommend it, a special grant be made.  That would leave it in capable hands and at the same time would remove the red tape of Departments and probably help to solve the housing problem by also keeping many of our people in these districts.</P>
    <P>Many of the other matters to which I would like to refer are matters which probably would be better dealt with on the Committee Stage.  While there is much in the Bill to hold out hope to persons other than those who would come within the working class, and while the local authority may be in a position to provide houses for them, I note that in the Dáil the Minister qualified this by saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not intended that this type of house should be provided until a local authority has first satisfied the needs of the working classes and the agricultural labourer classes in their districts.  The question of providing for the most urgent and needy classes must receive priority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all agree with that, that the provision of houses for the working class must get priority.  That will take some time.  When we come to examine the provisions of this Bill, we find that the houses the local authority proposes to erect under the various sections of this Bill must be completed by 1952. I suggest that no local authority can avail of the particular sections which give them power to erect houses, either in the rural or urban areas, for other than the working class&mdash;because they will have the problem of providing houses for the working class to solve first.  They would need to have that solved to-morrow morning, before they could immediately go into the work of undertaking the other classes and <Col N="712" /> having the houses completed before the 31st March, 1952.</P>
    <P>In relation to this date, 31st March, 1952, this has happened in the 1948 Bill as well.  The Bill was brought in at the end of a session and did not get the careful consideration it might have got if brought in in the ordinary run of parliamentary business.  I would put it to the Minister and the Department that it is not a good thing to limit the period under which the various grants may be obtained to too short a period of years.  I feel there are people, whether it is draftsmen or someone else, drafting legislation of this kind dealing with rural Ireland, who have not sufficient knowledge of the conditions in rural Ireland in the making of these arrangements.  The erection of a house in rural Ireland by a farmer is not a work that is begun and ended just as it would be by a contractor up in Cabra or anywhere around the city.  It is probably undertaken in this way.  All the preliminary work of getting the application and seeing that everything is right is gone through, and the farmer will not start work until he is satisfied that everything is O.K. Having got the O.K. from the appointed inspector, he proceeds to draw the sand in his spare time, when he has the potatoes down, or in some other slack period.</P>
    <P>Then, in another slack period, he digs the foundations.  The whole work would take him from one to three years.  He cannot afford to do it in any other way.  He cannot afford, when the sun is shining, to go building his house and leave the turf in the bog or leave the hay uncut when it is ripe.  He must attend to his other farm duties and it will, of necessity, take a longer period for an individual farmer to erect a home for himself than it would take for a contractor to erect a number of houses in any town or city for a local authority.  When you confine him to a period of erecting a house inside a specified number of years, and when that fear is hanging over his head, as it is bound to be if he reads the regulations supplied to him, he says: &ldquo;I must have the house completed in 1952; I have no hope of <Col N="713" /> that and do not believe I would be able to do it, so there is no use in my starting.&rdquo;  I think a period fixed like that is too short.</P>
    <P>This is the second or third Housing Bill we have had in recent years, but we must have another, which will be more important, from the point of view of the local authority, than the one we are discussing now.  We know from the Budget statement, and from the statements made by the Minister for Finance, that the Transition Fund is to end on the 31st March.  That is the fund that we had so much discussion on here from time to time and out of which money is made available to the local authorities, in addition to the ordinary grants, in order to assist them to let the houses they are building now at a reasonable rent which will bear some relation to the rents of houses built prior to the war.</P>
    <P>We were promised by the Minister in the Dáil and by the Minister for Finance that new legislation would be introduced.  Some Senator, I think, guaranteed that legislation would be introduced in ample time to give the terms to the local authorities before the 31st March.  I put it to the Minister then and put it to the present Minister now&mdash;as, after all, he has more knowledge and is the responsible person&mdash;that it is very important that whatever legislation is going to be introduced or whatever financial provisions are being made to enable the local authorities to carry out the work, whether it is by increased grants or by a reduction in the grants, that knowledge should be conveyed to the local authorities at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>If the local authorities feel, as they do, that the Transition Fund will come to an end on the 31st March, they cannot draw up any scheme and will not be prepared to go ahead with any particular scheme, until they know exactly what financial assistance they are to get from the Government. I regret that the Minister did not find it possible to bring in a comprehensive Bill in which all these provisions would be made, not only for what is contained in this Bill, but for what I <Col N="714" /> refer to as being so important to local authorities.  I know that the State is making a great financial contribution to this problem and that, naturally enough, the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance are anxious to curtail or reduce where possible the contribution that is there, as they would be in regard to contributions of any other kind.</P>
    <P>I would impress upon the Minister the need to have regard to the local taxpayer and the capacity of the people to pay their rents.  We have the statement issued by the Galway County Council where they have adopted a differential rent system. With that I agree to a great extent, but, at the same time, when an ordinary worker, with what is to-day a very limited income, has to pay a rent fixed at something like 34/6 per week, it is a big part of the whole income of the family.  It forms a big part of the total income of the family and, when we take that into consideration, we see the difficulties confronting those who are endeavouring to provide houses for our people, and it is very important, therefore, that the local authorities should know exactly where they stand.</P>
    <P>In connection with the erection of houses by private persons, mistakes have been made in the past.  Certainly Galway has been unfortunate in that particular respect.  Private persons acquire a plot of ground, undertake to erect houses thereon and, having sold the houses to those anxious to acquire a home, leave undeveloped the remainder of the site; they have not provided roads, water or the other amenities that should be provided by anybody undertaking that particular type of work.  The result is that when the builders go away the local authorities are compelled subsequently to provide the amenities that should have been provided in the first instance by those who actually made money out of the development of the particular plot. I would like to see this Bill being availed of by local authorities to ensure that where sites are taken over and developed steps are taken to compel the speculative builder to develop the site properly by providing water, <Col N="715" /> roads, sewerage and all the other amenities, so that the burden will not subsequently fall upon the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I would like to raise on the Committee Stage.  I have drawn the Minister's attention to various aspects of the problem to which I think he should direct his attention. I refer him in particular to Section 17. I think he should give greater consideration to that particular section before we incorporate it in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EleanorButler" hpid="Miss Butler Miss Butler">
      <NameTxt>Miss Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on a very excellent Bill.  It is one which correlates many of the existing housing Acts and does away with many anomalies and difficulties which caused hardship in the past.  The Minister has pointed out that the main purpose of the Act is to maintain and speed up the housing programme.  Anybody interested in housing over the last few years must be extremely satisfied with the general lines of the housing programme and the progress that has been achieved up to date.  That is why most of us welcome this Bill.  It will undoubtedly have the effect of speeding up an already remarkably accelerated programme taking into consideration the short period of time that has elapsed since the end of the war and the difficulties which had to be overcome in relation to the arrears in the housing programme.  I think the progress has been quite remarkable and there is no doubt this Bill will speed up the remaining programme generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this can be regarded as the first measure which will give local authorities power to render the real service of housing to the community. By that I mean drawing a distinction between slum clearance and overcrowding which, generally speaking, has been the main work of local authorities up to date, and the actual provision of the service of housing to meet the needs of the community; that is housing to meet the normal increasing population, the normal demands of couples getting married and the replacing of those houses which become dilapidated.  For the first time we have a measure extending to local authorities <Col N="716" /> the power to provide houses for all classes and local authorities are for the first time undertaking in a serious way the service of housing the community as apart from slum clearance and overcrowding.</P>
    <P>In this country each successive Government has inherited a legacy of vast dimensions in regard to housing going back into the historical past.  We have inherited a legacy of housing needs all-important in conjunction with the financial resources of the country.  That is why I think it is an excellent thing now that aid should be given in almost equal proportions to private enterprise and to local authorities because in the particular circumstances of our time we need the co-operation and combined effort of both private and public enterprise in relation to housing.  We welcome these increased State grants.  I am glad the grant will be continued to the first purchaser because I think that is the only way of insuring that the benefit of the grant will accrue to the person who actually buys the house. We have all known of cases in recent years where, while we could not prove anything in a court of law, the benefit of the grant was not passed on to the purchaser.</P>
    <P>I think the changes suggested in the Bill are a great improvement.  There is one suggestion I would like to make to the Minister and I hope it will commend itself to him.  In cases where overcrowding is proved to the satisfaction of the local authority the full 15 years for the second grant should not be insisted upon.  There is a tendency on the part of the local authorities to give newly-weds a smaller house on the assumption that, if they have a large family, in a reasonable period of time, they will be moved to a larger house.  Taking the building programme by and large, it is obvious that it will take a considerable number of years to cope with the arrears and it is, therefore, reasonable to assume that it will not be possible in every case to transfer a family which has grown too large into a larger house.  If the principle of the second grant could be applied in such cases I think it would be a valuable inducement to them to erect an extra room themselves in order to relieve <Col N="717" /> their own overcrowding.  I have in mind, too, the problem that exists in many rural areas where a water supply is not available at present in a housing scheme or where the local authority for other reasons has not provided bathrooms.</P>
    <P>Sometimes one is laughed at for insisting that every house, irrespective of whether or not water is available, should have a bathroom, but it is at least something to have water &ldquo;laid off&rdquo; even if one cannot have water &ldquo;laid on&rdquo;.  It is very useful to have a waste pipe.  I think if the principle of the second grant could be applied to local authority houses where the tenant is prepared to provide a bathroom it would be an excellent idea. Very often where water is not available a rainwater tank could supply the needs of the family over a great part of the year.  I think, in this connection, that local authorities might even develop a standard plan of bathroom that could be built for £50 or thereabouts. It might be an inducement to the dwellers in rural areas to erect one for themselves.</P>
    <P>There is just one question I should like to ask on the subject of the acquisition of sites.  When local authorities acquire land for housing purposes, perhaps in an area outside their jurisdiction as such, I should like to know whether they also have power to acquire land for all purposes connected with a housing scheme, such as land for the approach roads, etc., so that they will not be left with a sort of cut-off area.  I hope that the powers for the acquisition of land for housing will be accompanied by an extension, or a revision, of the Planning Acts so as to give the necessary powers to deal adequately with questions of compensation, and not only compensation but also betterment.  I think that the extended provisions of this Bill should result in an increased building demand and that the Bill should be accompanied by more adequate planning provisions.  This is not the time to go into the actual powers which are required, but I do think that this Bill should be accompanied by a revision of the present planning powers, with extra powers to control all land by <Col N="718" /> local authorities as a further inducement to enable local authorities to overcome present difficulties.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the extension of the present housing standard by raising the space area from 1,250 to 1,400 square feet.  I think that is a very definite indication of the more spacious attitude of the Department on the whole question of housing standards.  I should like to think that that will be taken by local authorities as a headline for the whole country. I gathered from the remarks of the Minister that the 1,250 square feet house had proved to be inadequate in size for persons with large families desiring to build houses for themselves. Surely that can also be interpreted as an indication of the requirements of the larger families under local authority housing.  I am sorry that the figure of &ldquo;not less than 500 square feet&rdquo; is mentioned in the Bill at all.  It is regrettable that so many of our houses are already in the region of 700 square feet which, in my opinion, is quite inadequate for the normal sized family house in this country.  The minimum for houses in Great Britain is 900 square feet.  This lower standard has resulted in local authorities building far too many two-bedroom houses.  Anyone familiar with the general problem in this country knows that most tenants have large families, and that the two bedroom house is quite inadequate, because it does not allow for any segregation of the sexes, or for children in separate rooms if the parents are to have a room for themselves.  I hope that the more spacious standard in housing areas will be accompanied by a better standard of construction and design generally, and that the time is not far off when, at least in urban areas, such things as heating and hot water supplies, which are now considered luxuries, will be regarded as normal housing provisions.</P>
    <P>One of the most remarkable aspects of this Bill is the extension of the powers of local authorities to provide houses for all classes, either for letting or for purchase.  I think that is a landmark in social progress in this country. No doubt it should result in a more <Col N="719" /> balanced community.  One hopes that it will banish for ever the mistakes that were made in the past in providing isolated units for the working classes in such areas as Crumlin and Kimmage and in other parts of the country.  These isolated units were both unchristian and anti-social, however you regard them.  I hope that this power to provide houses for all classes will be used by the local authorities in such a way as to provide and plan for a balanced community, and not to provide houses for one class in one area, and for another class in another area.  If this provision is put into operation in the spirit in which it was mentioned by the Minister, it should provide a balanced community where you will have a mixture of all classes together.  If this policy could be insisted on by the Minister, in the first instance in sanctioning schemes, and by the co-operation of the local authorities in the second instance, then I think that the local authorities would find within a reasonable period of time that many of their difficulties in acquiring sites for housing schemes by agreement would have disappeared.</P>
    <P>One of the most lamentable things in this so-called Christian country is that when you try to acquire sites for the housing of the working classes, you find a strong body of objectors from all sides.  Recently, I heard of a case in an area where houses have not been built for 35 years.  The proposal was to erect a small number of houses which would, presumably, have been given to people living in the district. The residents of the district objected to the erection of working-class houses there.  At various meetings which they organised they said they would have no objection to the building of houses by private enterprise, or to the smaller type of subsidy house built by anybody except a local authority.  It is a very great satisfaction to see that power is being given to the local authority to break through that kind of prejudice.  It will, at least, be a more Christian approach.</P>
    <P>I hope also that this plan will break <Col N="720" /> down the snobbery there generally is about council houses and the stigma that attaches to council houses.  The extraordinary thing is that nine times out of ten the council housing schemes are far better designed and constructed than the private enterprise houses of relatively the same price and cost. Certainly, in the Dublin area, and in many other areas, I know that you can pick out the council houses from the private enterprise houses because of their superior design.</P>
    <P>The only regret I have in regard to that provision in the Bill is the suggestion that this power should not be availed of until the more urgent needs of the working classes, as a whole, are met.  I should like to say on that point that I think the provision of houses for all classes is urgent.  If the local authority can start by providing a small proportion of houses for other classes, they will be helping in this whole social problem to integrate our housing areas, and at the same time keeping down costs for certain sections of the community who undoubtedly were being exploited by private enterprise in many ways.  I should like to see local authorities empowered to build a certain small percentage of their total housing output for all classes.  I am thinking of Dublin City, particularly, where the building programme has gone up, within a very short time, to a point which is as high as ever it was in pre-war years of over 3,000 houses a year.  But, even at that rate, it will take 11 or 12 years to meet the requirements of the present housing shortage.  If we had to wait that period until the local authorities were in a position to build other houses, it would, I think, be a very great pity.</P>
    <P>I think that if local authorities were to build a number of suitable houses, properly designed and laid out, with all the necessary amenities, such as shopping, schools and recreation centres, they would be creating a very valuable asset which would bring them in some revenue, either in the form of rent or the purchase price of the houses, which would compensate for any deficits due to the number of tenants who could not pay an economic rent for their houses.  If the question <Col N="721" /> were properly approached, I feel that this power should enable local authorities to create a real asset by the provision of a more desirable type of houses for other classes.</P>
    <P>The only other point to which I wish to refer is the substitution of the term &ldquo;reasonable cost&rdquo; for &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in Part VII of the Bill.  I think this will have a very favourable effect on the cost of building generally because, when it has been in operation for a while, it will tend to the fixing of a more reasonable figure in tenders.  The term &ldquo;market value,&rdquo; as indicating the price that might be obtained at an open sale, was undoubtedly a cause of hardship to certain people who were dependent on grants and on loans obtained under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act in order to build houses for themselves.  There was very often the danger that because of a surplus of houses on offer, at a particular time, the market value might be less than the actual contract price.</P>
    <P>I feel that the cost of housing does not come within the scope of our discussion here to-night, but since it has been raised, and the term &ldquo;reasonable cost&rdquo; has been left to the discretion of the local authority to decide, I think that local authorities should seek to utilise that power in trying to reduce costs so that a person building by private enterprise will have the benefit of the &ldquo;reasonable cost&rdquo; provision. I think there are several ways in which that could be done; for instance, by extending the scheme for the purchase of materials in bulk to include houses built by private enterprise, subsidised houses, etc.  I feel, however, that at this hour it does not come within the scope of our discussion.</P>
    <P>Once again I should like to say what an excellent Bill this is.  It removes limitations of every sort&mdash;limitations of size, of cost or in regard to the type of persons catered for.  It is a definite indication that the State realises its responsibilities to provide a service in housing for the community and that it realises that housing is a national problem.  I only hope at this stage that, with the increased housing programme <Col N="722" /> which will undoubtedly result, if full advantage is taken of the many improvements in this Bill, in time, the Minister will see his way to introduce a really co-ordinated housing programme for the country by the establishment of a national housing authority which would, on a national scale, cope with the many difficult problems which local authorities at present are trying to resolve in their individual way, sometimes not quite satisfactorily.  Nowadays, with the complexity of the circumstances with which we have to contend, the urgency of the problem and the ever-present threat of another emergency, which might hold up housing indefinitely, the question of establishing a national housing authority calls for urgent consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is a hope that the Minister might be able to conclude to-night, I shall speak only for a few minutes.  There are a few points to which I would like to refer.  First and foremost, like other Senators, I welcome the Bill and the Minister also to the House.  I am satisfied that the Minister and his officials are making an honest effort in this Bill to end once and for all the housing problem in this country.  There is one point, however, with which I am not too pleased, and if it were possible I would like to see an amendment inserted to deal with it.  There is in this Bill power to provide houses for &ldquo;newly-weds&rdquo; and old people in the city. May I say that I would prefer to see houses provided for &ldquo;newly-weds&rdquo; down in Garristown rather than in the city, because if you want to keep people on the land you will have to try to keep them away from the city.  If an agricultural labourer wants to get married and to get a house for himself and his wife he is induced to come into the city where these houses are provided for &ldquo;newly-weds&rdquo;.  If he gets a job in the city you cannot get him to return to the land.  I certainly would give a preference to the agricultural labourer in the allocation of houses for &ldquo;newly-weds&rdquo;, but I would give him a special type of house away from the city and try to keep him on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> It is not often that I am in agreement with Senator Hawkins, but I found myself in agreement with a good deal of what he said this evening.  I do not agree that the grant should be given to the builder but, on the other hand, I feel that before loans are given under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, the local authority should itself build a specimen house and find out exactly what it cost.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that many unscrupulous contractors in this country have made well out of the housing scarcity. Anxious and all as I would be to see housing provided as speedily as possible for people who are in need, I think that the greed of these unscrupulous contractors should be curbed and that the local authority should find out for itself what was the actual cost of erecting a three-bedroomed house, because very often you will find a young couple in their anxiety to get a house ready to pay any price that may be demanded or to pay any rent or annuity that may be placed on the house.  If in later years they are blessed with a family, the income of the house remains the same with the result that they find that they are unable to meet their obligations in the way of rent or annuities.  I am satisfied that we have not yet reached a proper level of costs in connection with house building.  As proof of that, I might mention our experience in County Dublin.  In one area we have provided a particular type of labourer's cottage which costs £1,100, and at the present time we are getting the same type of cottage erected in another area for £810.  Neither the cost of labour nor the cost of material has come down.  Certainly trades-men's wages have not come down though, as Senator Hawkins suggested, they may be giving a greater output at the present time.  Certainly I am not pleased about the whole question of contracts.  There is too great a contrast between contractors' prices in certain places.</P>
    <P>There is nothing I have ever heard in this House or elsewhere with which I am so much in agreement as I am with the statement made by Senator <Col N="724" /> Miss Butler.  All the time I have been opposed to this idea of placing very large numbers of working class people with large families together. To show the genuineness of Senator Miss Butler's point, take, for instance, West Cabra; 2,500 houses have been erected, and you have two of the finest schools in the nation, a girls' school and a boys' school.  Nevertheless, there are hundreds of children who cannot get in.  To qualify for a house there the people had to have large families, and all had four or five children, with the result that two schools of their size cannot accommodate them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Should the corporation continue on that line, these schools in Cabra will be almost empty in 15 years' time because those children will have grown up and no other people will have married in the area because they will not have reached marriageable age. The schools which are not fit to accommodate all the children now will be surplus then.  I do not think the corporation is doing good for the Irish people by shoving together thousands of working-class people with families of four or five children.  The schools cannot accommodate them and they must pay so much to send them on the bus to school.  I would strongly recommend to the Minister the idea expounded by Senator Miss Butler because it is a good idea to mix the people.  Coarse elements may get into those houses, but if some are occupied by a good type they will raise the standard.</P>

      <P>Then I am satisfied.  I feel that the Bill is the honest endeavour of an honest Minister to solve the housing question.</P>

      <P>I rise first of all to welcome the Bill.  The only thing I will say about it is that it has been a long time on the road.  I do not know why the Bill or its main provisions might not have been passed ten years ago.</P>

      <P>Perhaps that has solved it.  The biggest thing in this Bill, I think, is the effort to get back what we used to have in pre-war days, namely, that a builder could put up a house which would be varied by experience and by the criticism of the prospective purchasers and when it was completed he could sell it to the purchaser who fancied it.  We have only got back to that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Government will take first things first, because I heard the Minister talking about housing, housing, housing.  I suppose it is rather an anomaly that the least part of a housing programme is the houses.  I do not know whether the Minister would agree, but he must be aware that a housing scheme has to be planned, the site has to be acquired and cleared and then the houses are built, and I would consider each of these four roughly equal&mdash;certainly in time. Comparing the present with pre-war days, we find that we have come to an attitude of mind which will not do.  In pre-war days a person could go anywhere practically and select a site with sewers, water, gas and possibly <Col N="726" /> electric light laid on and build a house, or, mind you, a terrace of houses, and there was no difficulty about it.  Now I am sorry to say the country has got to a stage when it is almost like a sucked orange.  Any considerable expansion in housing entails new sewers being laid on or bigger sewers being provided, water supply being laid on, either new mains or an increase of existing mains. Senator Hawkins referred to builders who put up houses and then left the roads and possibly even other amenities to be completed by the local authority, but I am afraid that we will have to alter our ideas and I would like to urge on the Minister with all the force I can that the Government&mdash;when I say the Government I mean the Government and the local authorities &mdash;should do the jobs nobody else can do.  Nobody else can lay sewers in a district that is capable of development or where houses are going to be put up.</P>
    <P>I read in this Bill that the local authority could either sell or let sites to people who wanted to erect houses. I can imagine somebody approaching a local authority for a site on which to build a house.  Do you know what that person would be told?  He would be told.  &ldquo;Go away; we have not got enough for ourselves.&rdquo;  That is part of the housing problem.  We have heard criticism of what is called ribbon development caused by people building along main roads, but we have got to remember that there is a frightful shortage of sites at present.</P>
