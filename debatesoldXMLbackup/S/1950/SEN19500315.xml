      <P>The ordinary procedure is that the Minister, apart from asking <Col N="818" /> for all stages of the Bill, makes at least a short statement as to the purpose of the Bill on Second Reading.  I am not particularly interested in Limerick or in Bray, but before I am asked to pass this Bill, I must have some reasons adduced by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm the two provisional Orders set out in the First and Second Schedules.  These Orders have no effect unless confirmed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The First Schedule contains the text of the City of Limerick (Extension of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1950. That Order proposes to add to the City of Limerick a contiguous part of the county of approximately 3,000 acres. The purpose of the extension of the city is to facilitate the development of the housing policy of the Limerick Corporation. It is reasonable that the houses built by a local authority should be within the area over which it has jurisdiction.  The petition of the corporation sought to have included in the city an area approximately 6,000 acres including a portion of County Clare.  The whole question was fully discussed at a public inquiry, and subsequently with representatives of the local authorities concerned.  On consideration of the whole question it appeared that the case for the inclusion of part of County Clare has not been established, and that the area sought to be taken from County Limerick was rather beyond the limit within which development might reasonably be expected to take place within the not too distant future.  The compromise has, I think, satisfied both parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other parts of the Order have in the main been taken from the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, as provided by the Limerick City Management Act, 1934.  Provision is made for the necessary consequential financial adjustments between the corporation and the county council, and for the payment to the county council of a sum in respect of increase of burden and for the loss of benefit occasioned as a consequence of the extension.  Provision is also made whereby the added area will not pay the full Limerick City <Col N="819" /> rate for a period of ten years.  In the interim the city rate will be adjusted as provided in Part II of the Schedule.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule contains the text of the Bray Urban District (Financial Relations) Order, 1950, and it proposes to amend the provisions of Article 1 (b) of the Bray (Financial Relations) Order, 1903.  The Order of 1903 exempted the Bray Urban District from contributing to the salary and pension of the county surveyor for County Wicklow.  At that time the Bray Council was responsible for all roads within the urban district but since 1927 all the main roads in the urban district have been maintained by the county council.  It is equitable, therefore, that the financial relations between the county council and the urban district should be altered in this respect.  The urban council considered the request of the county council for this alteration and stated that they will be agreeable to contribute towards the salary of the county engineer and the superannuation of the former county engineer.</P>
    <P>As the original adjustment was made by a Provisional Order confirmed by Parliament, it is necessary that any amendment be made by a Provisional Order confirmed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages to-day.</P>
    <P>Bill passed through Committee, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Remission of Rates) Bill, 1950&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as stated, in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with it, proposes to extend for a further two years, that is to 31st March, 1951, the period within which the erection, enlargement or improvement of certain residences must be completed in order to qualify for remission of two-thirds of the rates for five years.  No new principle is embodied in the Bill; the period over which rates remission will be given remains at five years, the same as it has been since the Local Government Act, 1927.  The Bill applies only to those residences for which State assistance is not provided and, therefore, it is of very limited scope and application.</P>
      <P>The amendment of the definition of the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; being effected in sub-section (1) of Section I is merely a drafting amendment, its purpose being to bring up to date the reference to the collective title of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, and thereby to exclude from the scope of the Rates Remission Acts residences in respect of which grants are paid under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts and the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation on this matter has always been on a temporary, short-time basis and at no time was an assurance given that the principle of remission would be either made permanent or continued beyond the periods stated in the various continuing Bills.  The period to which each renewing Bill applies is short, so that the Government may have an oportunity of reviewing the matter periodically and of deciding in the light of existing industrial and economic conditions whether retention of the concession is desirable.  However, I think it would be considered a breach of faith on our part if these Acts were discontinued without due warning, as no doubt there are people who have commenced building on the assumption that there would be a continuing Bill as in former years, extending the period to which the Acts apply beyond the date mentioned in the last continuing <Col N="821" /> Act.  Such people would feel aggrieved if this Bill were not passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time, Parliament is presented with a Bill of this nature.  As the Minister has said, the Bill is of a temporary nature on each occasion, but the time has arrived when the Government should make up their minds as to whether or not it is a good policy to give a remission of rates to persons who erect houses for their own occupation, and, if the principle is accepted, should introduce a permanent measure rather than measures of this kind from time to time.  The Minister is compelled, as it were, to bring this Bill before this and the other House because quite a number of people have begun the erection of houses, and, for one reason or another &mdash;reasons with which the Minister is very familiar&mdash;have not completed these houses within the specified time, and would not, therefore, be entitled to receive the State assistance, on the one hand, and the remission of rates, on the other, if this Bill were not passed That is not a position that should be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>Those engaged in providing homes for themselves should know what the State policy is over a longer period of time.  The time has arrived when we should have a permanent measure.  We should first agree as to whether the principle is a good one or not&mdash;the principle of giving a remission of rates to persons erecting or improving their homes&mdash;and whether it is one that should demand parliamentary assistance, the assistance here being the remission of rates over five years.  That principle has been accepted since the State was formed.  At one time, the remission was for 20 years, now in this case it is for five years.  If we accept the principle, we should be prepared to go a step further and when persons improve their places of business they should also get a remission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times, there has been serious condemnation of the present system.  It is held that where a person improves his house or place of business there is immediately a revaluation, resulting in an increase in rates. Remission is an inducement to people <Col N="822" /> to engage in improvements and it should be encouraged in every way, but while we are encouraging people to improve and develop their surroundings we are at the same time discouraging them, by the fact that when an inspection is made the valuation is increased by 100 or even 300 per cent. The time has arrived when we should have a permanent measure, rather than have a Bill like this coming up from time to time.  Those engaged in the building industry are uncertain now as to whether, if the house is not completed by a specified date, they will come within the regulations for remission.</P>
    <P>When we examine this in the light of rural Ireland, Senators from rural Ireland will agree with me that the farmer who undertakes the erection of his dwelling-house does that work in between his ordinary farm duties.  It may take two or three years to complete the building, particularly if there is any hold-up in supplies or skilled labour.  Having begun the work on the understanding that he is entitled to a State grant or subsidy and also a remission of rates, he finds that owing to circumstances over which he has absolutely no control&mdash;weather conditions may mean that he has to give longer time to the harvesting of his crops&mdash; he is not able to complete the building by 31st March in a particular year and he stands to lose the concessions which the Act provides, unless a continuing Bill is introduced.  That is a bad system.  Provision should be made over a longer period.  Concessions should also be given to people who carry out improvements to their business premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a simple Bill, in so far as it extends the time under the 1940 Act and it is probably unamendable by us and should be passed at once.  I have a great deal of sympathy with what Senator Hawkins has said and it is quite wise that, when the time is being extended, we should also continue the general principles involved. There is no such thing as an absolutely permanent measure, as any Act could be repealed.  I take it the Minister accepts the principle that, <Col N="823" /> though this Bill is for a short period, there is an obligation to give ample notice later on if it is not intended to continue it.  It is bad if citizens feel that, on a technical point, something they feel is bad faith is dealt out to them.  In that I am in complete agreement with what Senator Hawkins has said.</P>
      <P>I see a difficulty in devising permanent legislation immediately.  For good or evil, there is considerable restriction on building and the conditions which might obtain under a more permanent measure&mdash;which should be considered as soon as possible&mdash;may be different.  This is not the time when that could be considered in all its aspects.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senator in regard to business premises which are substantially improved.  It is in the interest of the community and of local authorities, when materials and labour are available, to see that our towns and cities are gradually rebuilt substantially. The first five or ten years, as everyone knows, when loans for rebuilding have to be paid off, form a difficult period and it is extremely hard to have to meet double rates at that time.  That may seem to be an overstatement, but I know cases, as Senator Hawkins does, which led to the rates being doubled.  It is to the interest of the country that we should increase the amount of building as soon as labour and materials are available. The Senator mentioned the grievance people feel when they make an improvement and their premises, taken apart from the others, have a new valuation placed on them&mdash;a valuation not representing merely the improvements but representing a revaluation of the entire premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out to him and the Minister that it does not stop there.  I know a case where a lady thought it would be wise to add a room to her house.  Whether she was justified or not is not the point.  In order to do this, she had to submit plans, if she was to get a licence and the plans had to be sent to the local authority. When she got the estimate she decided she had not enough money to do it, <Col N="824" /> but because the plans had gone in they came and revalued her house and added another £50.  She feels a serious grievance, and rightly so, as none of the other houses on that road were revalued. She got no benefit, as she only considered doing the improvement and asked the price of it.  I am informed that the technical position is that when plans are sent out, whether the work is done or not they are sent to the Valuation Office which has the right then to revalue the premises.  I hope there are not many cases like that.  This is not mere hearsay, as I know the lady and got the details and am satisfied that it is correct.  She feels she has a grievance against the State and I must confess to a great deal of sympathy with her.  Unless the improvements are substantial, there should not be a change in valuation, if it is not done for the whole district and is therefore fair all round.  If the improvements are substantial, regard should be had not to the revaluation of the premises but to the valuation of the additions. However, that does not arise immediately here, but it shows the importance of keeping the principle.  I think many of these matters would have to be dealt with in a permanent Bill.  The simplest and wisest way is to extend this for a shorter period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Denis Burke Mr. Denis Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Denis Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Hawkins and Senator Douglas in this. This is an extension of the 1940 Act. The previous legislation which set out this remission which the two Senators have spoken about, stressed the fact that this remission was given only in areas where there was no complete revision of valuation of all the hereditaments in that area.  It was a sort of shock, that someone living in the same hereditament as you had only half the amount to pay.  It was very specifically stated that if there was complete revaluation his two-thirds remission was not given in the case of business premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins does not make the point that it was the last Government which dropped the remission in the 1940 Act.  The case he is making of people having 200 and 300 per cent. increased valuations would not have arisen if that had not been dropped in 1940. <Col N="825" /> Maybe the Minister could see his way to bring in another small piece of legislation to relieve people who had their valuations substantially increased compared with other buildings in their own area, so as to give them the same concession as was there from 1925 to 1940.  If so, he would be meeting the request made by Deputy Sweetman in the Dáil when he raised this question. The feeling in the country would be in favour of removing a definite anomaly which is taking place all over the country to-day.</P>
    <P>The question of the revision of rates is one which it may be very difficult to approach at the moment.  We all hope that money may enhance in value and when it does it will have a tendency to reduce the letting value of premises and we may be able to fix a better and more permanent basis of valuation then than we can at the moment.  We are inclined to be rather static in considering the variation in the value of money.</P>
    <P>A short new Bill would protect people against the anomaly of having in the case of similar premises in similar areas, one paying two to three times what another pays, where some structural defect obliged them to do some repairs which brought them under the observation of the rate collector and the scrutiny of the Valuation Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended speaking in the same strain as the previous speakers, especially regarding the shortness of the extension to 1951. This remission of rates is an inducement and incentive to people to build their own houses but those who have read the debates on the subject feel that this will be the end of it.  It is extended only to 1951 and it is extended to that date in order that houses in course of completion at the present time would benefit.  It may not extend to houses built in future. If that point could be elucidated, it would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Urban authorities suffer most by the remission of rates.  I am subject to correction on this point but, as I understand it, county councils, in computing the amount they are to demand from the urban councils, compute the <Col N="826" /> full valuation of the houses and demand an appropriate rate whereas the urban authorities collect only one-third of the rates.  I am not very clear on the point but, if that is so, something should be done to secure that the county council could demand from the urban authority only the one-third rate which the urban authority can collect.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with remission of rates for those who intend building new houses.  It is an incentive and quite a good thing but I do not think that the small urban councils should be mulcted for the full amount when they are collecting only one-third.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill. What I want to say has been said by other Senators.  We all seem to be in agreement on this matter.  I desire to put forward other points.  In regard to this question of rates there is always a feeling, apparently, when a person rebuilds or improves business, that it is a sign of great prosperity.  That may sometimes be the case but it is not always the case.  It is very often a sign of great enterprise and willingness to take risks.  It is rather depressing, when a person has taken these risks and has, perhaps, borrowed the money from the bank that, in addition, he is mulcted for extra rates.  It is a very reasonable proposition that some period should be allowed to elapse during which there would not be any increase in rates which would give the person concerned a chance to deal with the extra commitments that he has undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusOFarrell" hpid="Mr. S. O'Farrell Mr. S. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pleasant to find, on a measure such as this, which is not contentious, that we can ramble a little outside the actual scope of the Bill and discuss, in this case, the general principle of rates remission and rates imposition.  I would appeal to the Minister, with Senator Honan and other Senators, that when he is considering permanent legislation he would deal with the anomalies and injustices that at present exist.  The value of this Bill is not the fact that it extends the remission of rates for another two years to a limited class of people building houses, but the fact that it gives <Col N="827" /> us an opportunity of drawing the Minister's attention to certain things which perhaps he can be induced to include in legislation in future.</P>
      <P>The difficulty I find with Bills is that you have to take them or leave them. Generally, you have to take them and it is resented if you make suggestions or criticise.  Whatever is in the Bill, that and that only is all you can deal with.  Very often what a Bill does not contain is the most important thing. One such thing has been mentioned here, that is, the revaluation of houses immediately they are improved.  There is an injustice in that and there is a bad tradition behind it.  It is the same idea as I think existed when the rack rent was imposed.  The minute an Irish person does anything to improve his own conditions or amenities by his own effort somebody comes down on him and says: &ldquo;You must not do it or you will be sorry for it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot understand it.  Take the case which has been mentioned by Senator Douglas, where a woman wanted to extend her house.  Probably it was a small house.  She wanted an additional room.  Plans were drawn.  The first thing the council thought about was, not whether the plans were good or bad but for how much more they were going to rook this woman.  Obviously, that was the intention of the local authority because they never bothered to see whether the room was built or not.  They merely put the file and the plans on the record and said: &ldquo;Let her build away but we will refer it to the rates department.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to call the Minister's attention to another matter.  Before I do so I want to say that we frequently hear about what the poor, the wage-earners, the agricultural labourers and the labourers in towns and cities are getting from the rates; that they are getting houses subsidised by the rates. This Bill reminds us that anybody who builds is getting a subsidy from the rates.  Let us be fair and say that. It is only the poor who get a subsidy from the rates when a corporation or a local authority build houses for them. In this case everybody covered by the Bill gets some form of subsidy from the <Col N="828" /> rates.  I do not begrudge it to these people but they are the very people who begrudge it to me if I happen to be living in a labourer's cottage.</P>
    <P>This is the matter to which I want to direct the Minister's attention: I could bring the Minister outside the city boundary, to County Dublin, to a housing scheme which complied with the local authority's housing regulations. The housing regulations stipulate that houses must not be built to a greater density than seven to the acre.  A building contractor takes a large tract of ground and builds the houses in blocks of four, the blocks being so close together that you could hardly elbow your way between.  In order to make it seven to the acre, he leaves tracts of ground to the extent of three or four acres lying here and there in the middle, neither gardens, parks, nor anything else.  They are breeding grounds for vermin and dumping grounds for rubbish.  The contractor complies with the regulation that over the whole scheme his houses are only seven to the acre.  He gets away with that.  He has less footpaths, less railings and less sewers to construct. He has put the back gardens up against each other with only a strand of wire dividing one row of houses from another.</P>
    <P>There is no back entrance to any of the houses.  To-day I saw men wheeling barrows of manure and carrying buckets of manure through halls three feet wide, through the kitchens, to the little gardens at the back of these houses.  That is because the county council was satisfied when the contractor complied with the letter of the law and not with the spirit.  In front of these houses there are spaces of four and five acres lying derelict. When the Minister is bringing in future legislation these difficulties should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>A great many people are certain that when the ground rent and the rates are fixed, the ground rent is fixed over the whole area.  The people living in these houses are paying ground rent for vacant derelict sites in front of their houses.  It would have been of more benefit to them if they had bigger gardens and back entrances although <Col N="829" /> it was an advantage to get remission of rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with remission of rates now.  I am saying that the remission of rates was an advantage but it was not as big an advantage and would not continue over as long a period as the provision of proper back entrances would have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have created some confusion when he said that it would be advisable that people building houses or those who would expect this remission should be given due notice of any intention to drop this system of remitting rates. Does the Minister visualise a decision in the near future to drop this scheme altogether?  If not, he might take the House and the country into his confidence and say that for a reasonable time this Bill will come before the House.  That would allay a good deal of the uneasiness.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins made a point as to the advisability of permanent legislation. The whole matter hinges on what the Minister has in mind.  Does he think that we ought to give up this system some time in the near future? Some of the difficulties arising out of this matter of remission of rates have been referred to.  In Galway City the urban authority is particularly hard hit.  I may not be quite correct in this but, to the best of my knowledge, the county council makes its demand on the gross valuation disregarding whether the property is occupied or unoccupied.  In due course, the urban authority gets its bill and has to pay on a valuation on which, in effect, it does not receive income.  That is a matter that the Minister should take cognisance of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, there is the question as to whether the initial valuation of houses is the real valuation or not.  It is felt that when houses are being valued initially, because of the remission of rates, they are valued unduly high in order to make up for some of the loss. I am not an expert.  I cannot say that that is so but it has been mentioned <Col N="830" /> more than once to me that it is so.  If it is so, a good many people are being very heavily mulcted, because of certain changes that have occurred recently, if their houses were valued on the high side initially because of the advantage they would get by the remission of rates.  As Senator Hawkins has mentioned, valuations have been very considerably increased within recent months.  That could be very serious for people.  Not alone must they pay off the loans but they must pay an increased rate and, in certain circumstances, there is an increase of income-tax and, probably, and increase in electricity rents.  One can see how serious the whole problem is.  Perhaps the Minister would take advantage of this occasion to clear up any doubts that may have arisen.  We would all appreciate that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, most people are in favour of some remission of rates, when improvements are carried out, in order to encourage people to do improvements, but, at the same time, the amount of the remission should be very carefully considered, because it is very desirable, when rates are being levied, that more, if possible, should be levied on people who are well off and less on people who are badly off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that the person who improves his house or business premises is not necessarily better off financially than the person who does not.  There are some people who, no matter how wealthy they might be, would not improve their premises and would prefer to spend their money in other ways.  When we give remissions of rates to certain people, it means that other people have to pay this amount, because the total amount needed by the local authority has to be raised in one way or another.  Before permanent legislation is brought in I would suggest that very serious consideration be given to ways and means of collecting the money needed by local authorities from people in proportion to their income, rather than in proportion to the size of their premises. At least part of the money required by the local authority, if not all, should be collected on the basis of the <Col N="831" /> income of the person concerned.  Often two people may have the same sized premises but one is much wealthier than the other.  A person with quite a small house and office or other premises may have a very large income, and yet pay a comparatively small amount in rates.  I agree that it is difficult to collect money in exact proportion to a person's income, as has been found in the case of income-tax, but I think it is an ideal at which we should aim, and therefore I would suggest to the Minister, and all concerned, that very careful consideration should be given to seeing how far more money could be collected from people with large incomes, in order to relieve the burden on people with small incomes. Many people pay a good deal in rates, although their incomes are extremely small, and it is a great hardship on them.  All these matters should be carefully considered as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I want to support the suggestion which has been made to the Minister that it is bad to have a Bill of this nature coming before the Seanad every year or every second year.  Something of a permanent nature should be brought in because this leaves people uncertain as to the possibilities of their getting a remission of rates.</P>
      <P>I should like to strike a new note and suggest to the Minister that he might consider the possibility of extending the period from five years with a view to helping some of the unfortunate boys and girls who are setting up homes after being married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in many cases is that these people can get no accommodation unless they are prepared to build or buy a house.  Nobody wants them.  If they go to landladies, in many cases they have to assure them that there will be no children of the marriage.  That has been known to happen.  They have to go to a slum or tenement or buy a new house.  That entails paying a deposit of anything from £150 to £300 or £400.  Furniture has to be bought as well and a remission of rates would be a big help in their efforts to set up a home.  Their rates are often fairly <Col N="832" /> high and a remission of, say, seven or ten years would be a great help.  Every Senator knows the position of people who come to him with problems about getting accommodation, particularly in urban areas.  It is very difficult for young people to get accommodation unless they are prepared to agree to impossible conditions.  They have to buy a house and borrow the deposit, which they have to pay back as well as the loan on the house.  Remission of rates would be a help and in the permanent legislation a longer period should be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a word or two to say because this is being accepted by both sides.  There is, however, a complaint from our friends on the left that it is bad that this system should continue, but if it is bad it has been bad for a very long time.  If there is instability, there has been the same instability over a number of years and I do not know why we should suddenly discover instability and dissatisfaction now.  I do not agree with Senator Ó Buachalla that people are perturbed or that there is a feeling of uneasiness about this.  People have to accept the situation as it is.  They know that a remission of rates has been the practice in the case of new buildings and they are satisfied.  I do not think there should be a suggestion that this policy is going to be altered.</P>
      <P>There is no necessity to call upon the Minister to make a declaration of faith in this policy because it has been continued and we have had no indication that it will be changed.  I think the policy is very wise.  The fundamental thing for us to do is to improve the country and its appearance, give the people new homes and give them a good appearance.  A remission of rates is a help and I believe that it is an encouragement and a policy which should be continued.  The question of tying ourselves up with permanent legislation is something that must presumably be carefully considered and I think we will all be satisfied as long as the policy which has been in operation over a period is continued from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that Senator Burke explains the whole story when he <Col N="833" /> speaks of the difference there may be between two people living side by side in houses with the same valuation.  The income of the owner of one house might be greater than the income of the owner of the other, but presumably he did not get away with all his wealth as the income-tax people found out how he stood.  If they pay the same amount of rates I would like to compare their income-tax payments.  At the same time, I agree that anybody who knows the system in operation cannot be perfectly satisfied that it is equitable.  Those of us who are on local authorities see all sorts of inequities in its operation such as the kind of case which Senator Burke cites.</P>
    <P>There is, I confess, a good deal of perturbation about the activities of the valuation office recently and the situation where you have a remission of rates on new buildings in one instance and, on the other hand, an increase of perhaps 200 or 300 per cent. in the valuation of another building where the rates are going up and where, as Senator Ó Buachalla said, the electricity charges are going up. There is something terribly inconsistent taking place.  I have come to the conclusion from stories I have heard that the valuation office must be completely manned by Fianna Fáil because this is something like what happened in an election many years back when a flood of demands for increased income-tax came out a day or two before the election. Some of the things that are happening are really grotesque.  One instance which was brought to my own notice was that of a man who has not increased his house by one inch but who has had his valuation increased by 300 per cent. because of improvements. When the responsible officer called&mdash;I presume he was such&mdash;the owner was not there, and when he came back again he still could not be found simply because he was living on a farm away from his business.  The officer said he would be there the next time and the owner got a demand for an increase of 300 per cent. in the valuation.  That does not make sense and is a discouragement to the policy which the Minister is pursuing.  There must be consistency.  The valuation side of the problem should compare with the policy <Col N="834" /> of the Minister for Local Government and he should see whether one branch of the administration is not undoing what the other branch is trying to do.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for saying that there is any uneasiness whatever among people who are building or who are going to build houses as to whether the policy will be continued or not.  In this country when a policy is in operation for a period, although there is a change of Government, people do not expect a change in that policy if it is a good one.  In this respect there has not been a change because this is a continuation of what was done.  If the plan was bad in the past it is not any worse now, and I think we should be satisfied with what the Minister is doing without a declaration of policy for a long period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion has ranged over a very great number of subjects while the Bill itself is strictly limited and confined.  Nevertheless I have received some fairly useful information. I was not ignorant of some of it but in some cases it has broadened my mind.  We are dealing with the extension of the Act giving a remission of rates on new residences. Since 1940 it has been extended from year to year, and the reason that it is not put on a longer term basis or made permanent is that it is necessary for the Government to have the subject under review from time to time.  The number of people availing of the remission of rates has declined and is a comparatively small number, but whether it is a small number or not, in equity and justice they are entitled to have notice if the remission of rates is going to be withdrawn.  There is no notion of withdrawing the remission of rates but it is necessary to keep the matter under review.  It has been so done since 1927.  In 1940, this remission was restricted to residences, while before that it extended to business. premises and factories.  It was felt, in the wisdom of the Legislature in 1940 and since, that the ratepayers should not be asked to contribute to anything except residences.  It does not apply to labourers' cottages or any houses built under the Working Classes Acts. Private grant houses get seven years <Col N="835" /> remission, while this is only five years. This is a remission of rates for houses which have not got grants and the number who do not avail of the grants is declining.  Everybody seems to try to keep within the 1,250 feet in order to qualify for the grants under the various Acts.  Those who are outside that get this remission of two-thirds for five years.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a good deal about the alleged vagaries of the Valuation Acts because the complaints have been coming fast and furious in connection with their operation in recent times, but I could not hold out much hope that I could do anything about that.  All we are doing here is remitting rates on the valuations as we found them.  Valuation is not my pigeon.  I know that there are certain anomalies and I think that Senator Douglas had the last word when he spoke of somebody who had his valuation increased because of a plan in an architect's office.</P>

      <P>That is like the story of the two tailors.  One said that he could measure a suit if he saw a man's shadow passing round a corner.  The other said that he could measure a suit if he saw the corner he had passed.  A plan is not necessary at all in an architect's office, not to mind the county engineer's office.  The local authority's rate collector can apply for revaluation of anybody's premises without any alteration or the submission of any plan and it is happening every other day.  John Blank wakes up to find that he has been revalued although he did not use a paint brush and he does not know who recommended him for this friendly visit from the Valuation Office.  So a plan is not necessary.  These things will probably find their own level, but they are matters in connection with which <Col N="836" /> I cannot give any promise or hold out any hope about what can be done at this juncture.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke spoke about valuations in Galway.  Revaluations have been taking place in Galway City, Ballina-sloe and Tuam, but not in the whole county, as was suggested.  There has not been a general revaluation in this case.  Senator O'Farrell was anxious to discuss other matters and he regretted that this Bill was limited in scope, but I am hoping to introduce in the very near future another Bill which will provide a greater opportunity of discussing the various points he and other Senators have in mind.  The Bill, a Housing Bill, is in draft, and the discussion of some anomalies which have been referred to here will be perfectly in order on it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (a), line 24, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; where it occurs secondly, and add &ldquo;derived from cereals grown in the State; and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably, the main objective of this Bill is to define the name &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; for the export market.  That is a very laudable and a very desirable object, but one wonders why the sole limitation in paragraph (a) should be the location of the distilling plant. That is one limitation&mdash;it has to be in the State.  The second limitation is that the whiskey must be obtained by distillation from a mash of malt and cereals.  The purpose of my amendment is quite clear.  The processor, the distiller, may be interested in having the advantage of the name &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; associated with his plant in this country, but it seems to me, more especially nowadays when it is popular to say: &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;&mdash;and I believe this is one of the weeks in which we say <Col N="837" />&ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;&mdash;that the phrase should apply equally to the manufacturer.  I suggest that some amendment in this form should be incorporated to ensure that the cereals used will be Irish grown cereals.</P>
    <P>If one looks back at recent history, one finds that, say, from 1928 until the disturbance caused by the war, considerable quantities of barley were imported into this country.  I do not claim for a moment that this barley was all imported for distillers' use, but considerable quantities were imported, and even since the war, if my memory serves me correctly, some sort of malt came from Chile in large quantities in 1937.  It seems to me desirable, when this country can produce the necessary cereals for making Irish whiskey, that there should be incorporated in the definition not only the location of the plant and the nature of the mash but also the provision that the cereals should come from this country.  Would I be in order in taking my three amendments together or had I better deal separately with them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>My second amendment is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (b), lines 28 and 29, to delete &ldquo;such as are ordinarily&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It seeks to delete this curious phrase which seems to be put in mainly for the purpose of excluding types of cereals which do not grow in this country. Why should we not specify the ones that do grow in this country?  My purpose is the same here&mdash;that Irish pot-still whiskey shall come from cereals grown in this country.  A time might come when it would be inconvenient for the distiller to be limited in that way, but it is interesting to note that, going back again to the inter-war period, the barley acreage from the 1930's went down continuously until the commencement of the war, with one small increase about 1936.  The barley acreage is to some extent in inverse ratio to the importation of barley by the brewers and distillers. Price, of course, was the whole difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> I do not know whether it is germane to the discussion, but there was a time when it was claimed that it was not possible to brew a satisfactory clear beer unless you used Californian barley which had ripened in the sunshine of California.  The interesting point is that the very moment Californian barely became more expensive than the home grown barely, the brewers were quite able to produce a clear beautiful beverage made from barley ripened by the sun in this country.  I maintain that it is all a question of price, and, that being so and our prices at present being comparable with world prices, I see no objection&mdash; if there are objections, I should like to hear them from the Minister&mdash;to extending the definition so as to ask not only the consumer but the manufacturer to buy Irish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Orpen's amendment which asks that Irish whiskey should be produced from Irish cereals.  Whether that point is bound up with other matters, I do not know, but it is very important, if we are producing Irish whiskey and selling it as Irish whiskey all over the world, that it should be Irish whiskey in every shape and form and should be produced from Irish grown cereals.  Large quantities of barley are left each year on the hands of the farmers and if the distillers were thinking as they ought to be thinking, they would be producing their whiskey from Irish barley rather than from imported malt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the object of this Bill is to provide a measure of protection for Irish distillers in practically the same way as protection was granted to the Scotch distillers some time ago and to enable them to compete and to have the benefit of the name as the Scotch distillers have in respect of their whiskey. I do not profess to know the technical side of it, but I am reliably informed that the Irish distillers are at present using Irish cereals, but it seems to me that if we are to make a condition in permanent legislation, in which this protection is given, depend entirely on a given circumstance, so that it will <Col N="839" /> become invalid in a year in which there might be a shortage, it would be a mistake.  The proper method of protecting Irish barley producers in relation to distillers is by means of a tariff or some other measure which may be decided on year by year.  I think it would defeat the main object of this Bill if we were to endeavour to deal with a matter by permanent legislation which can only be dealt with according to the circumstances from year to year. There might be an occasion on which it would be found to be necessary to import barley to maintain an important industry.  We have to remember that what is produced this year is not for sale this year, and that in distilling Irish whiskey we have to plan now for seven years ahead.  That is a very important fact which should not be overlooked. I think it would be a mistake if, in granting this request, which has been accepted all round as reasonable in principle, that we were to provide something in it prescribing that before any imported barley could possibly be used there would have to be new legislation. I think that would be a great mistake.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I expressed a doubt whether it was advisable to use the term &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; in the broad manner in which it is implied in this sub-section. I wonder to what extent the Minister has made inquiries as to whether there was any substance in the doubt I expressed?  I understand that in the manufacture of Scotch whisky the main ingredient is maize. I do not know whether that is true or not, but I am speaking of patent whiskey as distinct from pot still.  If it is true that whiskey can be derived from maize, then I do not know if there is anything to prevent anybody from coming into the country and establishing a distillery for the production of whiskey from that source.  If it could be described as Irish whiskey, should we go further, visualising the possibilities, and qualifying the term &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; by some further adjective?</P>

      <P>For instance, on the last occasion I used the word &ldquo;rye&rdquo; where rye was the main ingredient.  I raised the question whether if maize were to be the main ingredient, we should not stipulate that the term should be used, as well as the word whiskey, to indicate its main ingredients so as to avoid confusion and to make it clear to the public what exactly they were getting.  It is true that this must be largely a matter for the people in the trade and as I do not see any amendment from the Minister, I am wondering whether he would be able to indicate to us that the position is satisfactory as it is and how he arrived at that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that manufacturing distillers here in the main make whiskey from cereals grown in the country.  Now and again, say, where the fruit of the harvest is either lacking in quantity or quality, they do import, but very rarely, and if they do import, why tie them down here to a particular amount distilled in a particular year by the use of a special term?  The matter, as Senator Douglas says, can be met in another way.  There is no abuse practised by the distillers.  They do in the main procure the home grown product and it ought to be left to such time as people find that the products of the harvest here are not being used. That is my answer to the amendments tabled by Senator Orpen.  Senator Ó Buachalla has raised a different point from what he raised on the Second Reading.  I understood his question to be whether there was whiskey sold as Irish whiskey which was not in accordance with the definition of Irish whiskey&mdash;the definition covering all Irish whiskey legitimately produced in this country.  It may be that there are other spirits which are being foisted off on the public as Irish whiskey.  That is not attended to in this measure.  It would be a matter for the Food and Drugs Act where people could complain that they were not getting the article of the quality and description they require.  It might also be an offence under the Merchandise Marks Act but before I could say, I would have to have particulars of what the practice is.  The <Col N="841" /> Senator further asked us whether there was any whiskey produced by mixing, say Scotch, with some Irish and calling it Irish whiskey.  Again that is an offence under the Food and Drugs Act, and I think it could be caught here.  I think it would require some sort of analysis but I do not know whether some analysis would reveal the matter.  On the point raised now as to the use of maize, it is not likely that pot still whiskey will be produced from maize.</P>

      <P>Seeing that the amount of barley taken by the distillers on the average amounts to only one-twentieth of the total output of the country, the likelihood of a shortage as envisaged by Senator Douglas will not arise and unless the quality can be proved unsatisfactory the distillers will continue their practice of taking malting barley from our growers.  They have taken it in the past, on the whole, but one can envisage a time when some other country may have good barley cheap and we may have a return to dumping of Californian barley and the same claims made that it is better for this purpose.  We should protect the distiller and the good name of Irish whiskey, but we should also protect, as far as we can, the growers of barley and the maltsters.  The purpose of my amendment was to see if it was not possible to make Irish whiskey really Irish instead of merely something that was manufactured in Ireland.  If I could get an assurance from the Minister, I feel that the growers of malting barley would be very much relieved.</P>

      <P>This is an industry where the raw material is produced from the soil here.  When we export Irish whiskey, our kith and kin in America or elsewhere take it that they are purchasing whiskey made in Ireland from Irish cereals.  The Minister has informed us that the distillers are quite satisfied.  If he accepts that principle, all we have heard in recent years, about Irish industry building up to a standard, goes by the board and the only standard we must build up to is what the manufacturers themselves decide.  That is what the Minister puts before us to-night in his argument that the distillers are quite satisfied with this Bill.  Naturally they are.</P>
      <P>As Senator Orpen has pointed out, by the loophole left in this Bill, they will be in a position, should the occasion arise, to beat down the Irish barley growers to a price.  They can do that by buying imported barley, perhaps at a reduced price, and in that way sacrifice the Irish barley growers to their own advantage.</P>
      <P>The Minister's other excuse is that we may hit on a bad year, when it may not be possible to get a sufficient quantity of Irish barley or cereals that may be required.  Surely the Minister can take the Bill back from this House and on the Report Stage he can put into it a small section whereby he may take to himself the power to make regulations providing for such an eventuality as a bad year, or a bad harvest in cereal crops.  It is no excuse to put forward the two points that he has for refusing to accept this amendment&mdash; that the distillers are satisfied and that we may hit on a bad year.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the proposal in the amendment is to allow the barley in but to say that it will not be Irish whiskey when that barley is used.  In my opinion, the proper way is to deal with the definition of Irish whiskey on its merits and to stop the barley coming in if there is a danger.  The Minister and I do not believe that there is a danger but, if a danger arises, the proper way is to deal with it under an Act which will enable the Minister by a stroke of the pen to stop importation.  To do it by saying that it may come in and will be sold but cannot come under this definition seems to me an absurd way of dealing with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first read Senator Orpen's amendment I was inclined to agree with it because I thought that we should encourage as far as possible the protection of Irish farmers.  Since I heard Senator Douglas's speech, I am inclined to the view that it would be a serious thing to interfere with the industry to the extent that we would tie things up so that, in a bad year, when barley could not be harvested, the manufacture of whiskey could not continue or take its normal course.  As has been pointed out by Senator Douglas, whiskey manufactured to-day cannot be used tomorrow. Some people have tried it and found their mistake.  Whiskey must be allowed to mature over a long period.  We should be very slow to interfere with the existing industry. We should be very careful not to take any steps which would restrict in any way the manufacture of whiskey as at present carried out.  On the contrary, we should do whatever lies in our power to encourage the further development of Irish whiskey and the further export of Irish whiskey.  I think it was Senator Hawkins who said that the people of Irish descent in America would like to feel, when they are drinking Irish whiskey, that it is the produce of Irish soil.  That is so to a very great extent.  I believe that Irish distillers are inclined to use Irish barley in so far as it is possible rather than to import barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My education in the whiskey business <Col N="846" /> cost me a considerable amount of money.  The Minister's lack of knowledge of the whiskey business amazes me though he was paid for learning something about the whiskey business. I am surprised he does not know more about it.  In connection with the question as to whether it should be labelled pot still or not, I believe that provision should be made in a Bill of this kind to take the necessary precautions in regard to the development of the patent whiskey industry in this country.  The Minister and some Senators will remember that during the discussion on the Locke distillery before the Tribunal the question was discussed as to what the intention of the potential purchasers of that distillery was. It transpired that they had an idea at that time to use portion of the product of the distillery for the manufacture of what is called patent whiskey and that patent whiskey can be produced more quickly and can be put on sale more rapidly than pot-still whiskey.  If that could be done, our distillers should be encouraged to produce patent whiskey, provided it is good whiskey and provided that it can be matured to the satisfaction of experts&mdash;and surely we have plenty of experts, even in the Seanad, on whiskey.  In that way we could increase sales.</P>
    <P>I have been in a few countries.  Anyone who has travelled in America and various parts of the Continent will agree with me that it is amazing how difficult it is to get Irish whiskey.  I do not understand the reason for that. In practically any country one will find Scotch whiskey and, in some countries one will find Canadian rye whiskey and American rye whiskey.  If we developed the rye whiskey business here, we could give considerable encouragement to farmers in the poorer districts to produce a crop which it would pay them to grow.  I say that from the point of view of encouraging people in the poorer districts to grow a cash crop.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not we should encourage the use of maize for the production of whiskey.  I believe that whiskey can be produced from practically anything.  We should leave nothing undone to ensure that anything in the nature of home-made <Col N="847" /> whiskey&mdash;poteen&mdash;is not exported or that a mixture of that stuff is not exported under the label of Irish whiskey.  If that is exported, our chances of building up an export trade in Irish whiskey would be ruined overnight.</P>

      <P>I do not yield to anybody in my ignorance of whiskey.  Unlike Senator Quirke, my education about whiskey never cost me anything. I never got any education about it.  I would like to express my agreement with Senator Quirke in so far as he was talking about this particular amendment.  I think he went into a wider topic at the end.  What we are discussing here is a very old-established business.  People have been in the business for centuries in some cases. They are people who have maintained, we are told by experts, a very high standard and, who, presumably, know their own business and who have no tariff, subsidy or assistance of any kind from the State.  It is reasonable enough, when the State is subsidising or assisting in any way a particular industry that it should make conditions. That is not the case in this Bill.  The State is giving no tariff, subsidy or assistance of any kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Whiskey is merely used by the State as a source of considerable tax and, when these people know their own business, we as a House of Parliament should be very loth to interfere with their business. They want this definition for their own trade purposes, which brings us in revenue in this country and, if they could capture the export trade such as Senator Quirke has spoken about and which I heard a good deal about last October in Canada and New York, it would bring us in dollars.  They know their own business.  We should let them alone.  That is my impression and, most emphatically, we should not pass this particular amendment which, as Senator Douglas has indicated, does not mean assistance to the farmers but does mean that if foreign cereals are <Col N="848" /> used the product will not be called Irish whiskey.  The Minister has suggested, quite properly, that plenty of power exists, if we desire to use it at a particular moment, to prevent the importation of foreign barley.  That is quite a different matter altogether. We are dealing with people who know their own business; they are highly successful in it and are not asking anything from the State.  I think we should accept their views that this is the definition they want and not endeavour by this sort of amendment to tie them up to do something that is their normal practice already.  It is dangerous to make enactments about people's private business.  We may be trying to do good but it is not a good thing to do in this case or in any case if we can avoid it.</P>

      <P>Although I was reared in a public-house I do not know an awful lot about whiskey but I could not support the amendment as it is worded because Senator Orpen uses the words &ldquo;barley grown in the State&rdquo;. Ireland extends further than the State and if we used those words we would exclude what is proverbially very good whiskey, Coleraine whiskey from the Minister's own native town and the capital of my native county.  That could not be regarded as Irish whiskey and Bushmills whiskey could not be regarded as Irish whiskey.  I think we should remember in all our legislation that Irish soil covers the whole of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of intervening in this debate until I heard Senator Hayes saying very emphatically that the distillers were asking nothing from the State and that they have no protection or anything like that.  As a matter of fact, the distillers are getting a very valuable concession from the State, a name which has the <i>imprimatur</i> of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, I think the members of this and the other House are quite entitled to express disagreement, if they feel like it, with the definition given by the distillers.  Even granting that they may know their own business or that they have carried on a very successful <Col N="849" /> business, in some cases for well over 100 years, the fact is that this Bill will give to them the right to use that name by law.  Even the word &ldquo;whiskey&rdquo; is spelt differently from Scotch whisky and we are giving them the word &ldquo;whiskey&rdquo;.  Everybody, therefore, is entitled to express his view as to whether he agrees or disagrees with this definition.</P>
      <P>My first inclination, like that of Senator Quirke, was to support Senator Orpen's amendment, because primarily Irish whiskey is whiskey distilled in the main from barley grown in this country.  I know that a certain small amount of rye and other cereals is used in this distillation, but in the main it is barley grown in this country. One thing which I do not think was adverted to is the possibility of the whiskey distillers in making their agreements with the barley growers being able to say: &ldquo;If you do not agree to this price for malting barley, we will import barley&rdquo; and there is nothing in this Bill to prevent that.</P>

      <P>No matter what the Minister says, the fact is that Irish whiskey is a legal definition and if it is sold in America it will be known as a certain thing.  Irish whiskey has been built up because it is entirely different from Scotch whiskey.  There is absent from it the peaty taste which a lot of whiskey drinkers think a very great asset.  It would be very wrong for us to sell on the export market an ersatz Scotch whiskey.  We will stand on the merits of the whiskey which has been distilled here for over a century. It is for the House to give opinions as to how that can be maintained.  I am not prepared to accept as 100 per cent. accurate representations made by the parties who are principally concerned and because the Oireachtas is giving the <i>cachet,</i> the name Irish whiskey, to something, I think we are quite entitled, despite what Senator Hayes has said, to express our views on that matter.</P>

I recognise that everybody has the right to express his view, but I have also the right to say that we ought not to accept certain views.  It is not a question of right but a question of expendiency. I am not an authority on whiskey, but I take it that we are passing legislation for public reasons, affixing this label and giving certain powers for public reasons, for the public good and not for the good of the distillers.  We have the right to put in conditions; we have all kinds of rights, but it would be inadvisable for us to exercise all of them and I remain, Sir, unrepentantly of the opinion which I had before.</P>

I will now proceed to criticise Senator Hayes.  I was surprised that Senators Hayes, Ó Buachalla and Goulding did not suggest that we might be able to do something in connection with the export of whiskey to further the cause of the Irish language.  I am quite serious about that.  Anybody who knows anything about the whiskey business knows that when Irish whiskey goes abroad people get the bottle but do not see one word of Irish.  One distillery in all Ireland puts a couple of Irish words on their bottle, and that is Locke's distillery at Kilbeggan.  Other distilleries should follow their example and it would do good for the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the chorus of teetotallers who said that Irish whiskey was good enough to leave alone.  We should leave it alone and I disagree with the speakers who said that we are conferring something new on the distillers. We are not conferring anything on the distillers.  The reputation of Irish whiskey is there already.  We are doing nothing by this amendment to raise the status of Irish whiskey or to give it a higher status in this country or outside it.  What I object to in this amendment is, first of all, that it is an attempt to extend protection to barley for the benefit of the farmers under the guise that we are doing something to improve Irish whiskey.  It is merely an attempt to guarantee protection to the farmers for their barley. It is brought in under a Whiskey Bill, and it has no connection with whiskey. There never was a suggestion that our whiskey was not up to standard and was not made from Irish barley, and there is no reason in the future to fear that it will not continue to be made from barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment of this sort may give the impression that anything at all may go into the whiskey if the watchdogs <Col N="852" /> of the Seanad were not present to watch the dumping of the material into the vats and stills.  My great objection to all these things is that we are getting more and more into the idea of a police State.  We are putting people to watch people all the day.  The distilleries for hundreds of years have produced Irish whiskey, which anybody in Ireland who drinks, will drink, and which anybody abroad will be glad to get.  It has never had a bad word said about it, and it may be suggested now that the rubbish of the pigs' feeding stuff may be turned into whiskey if the Seanad does not stop it.  We, apparently, want more regulations so that more officials may be sent into every distillery to sit over the grain, to see when it goes into the vats, as well as when it comes out.  I think when we have honest men engaged in industry that we ought to leave them alone and allow them to conduct their industry as they have done in the past.</P>

He or she has the duty of giving expression to their views and if they feel very strongly on these views to try to get their colleagues to support them in giving full effect to whatever point of view they hold.  Those of us who have spoken in connection with this Bill have not done so because we hold anything <Col N="853" /> against the distillers.  I know, just as well as any other Senator, the long tradition behind the manufacture of Irish whiskey but at the same time we are not so foolish as not to admit that there has been bad Irish whiskey just as there has been bad Scotch whiskey or any other whiskey.</P>
      <P>The Minister in reply to Senator Hearne stated that everything he suggested was already there; that this Bill offered nothing as far as the distillers were concerned; that it did not give anything they had not got.  One is forced to ask what really is the purpose of the Bill.  Surely it does something. What was the necessity for its being introduced?  I should like the Minister to explain one point.  There is provision made here for a definition of Irish patent whiskey.  I would like to know is there such a whiskey being manufactured here at the moment, or is it proposed that in the near future a whiskey of that nature will be manufactured, and that this Bill is making provision for the manufacture of such a whiskey.</P>

Whiskeys, such as Canadian rye whiskey, contain well over 20 per cent rye, and, as I understand it, the first paragraph of the Bill was obviously to exclude a corn whiskey or a whiskey made from any other starches than are derived from cereals.  In other words, you are not going to make potato whiskey.  This amendment of mine is merely to prevent the making of a rye whiskey, but if anybody thinks it is desirable that it should be designated as such, so that there would be no question of a new rye whiskey coming in to interfere with the well-known ones which are ordinarily made from a very small percentage of rye, in the neighbourhood of 1 per cent., well and good.</P>

      <P>I understand now, that the Senator's amendment is, that if there is a percentage of rye of more than 20 per cent. that this word &ldquo;rye&rdquo; must appear in the name.  It also introduces the principle that this description containing the word &ldquo;rye&rdquo; must be applied to whiskeys that come from brews that have, say, 21 per cent. There is no compulsion on any manufacturer at the moment to use any of these terms.  In fact, a term used quite a lot is &ldquo;plain home-made spirits&rdquo;. With regard to the suggestion that we might have rye whiskey made here, I think it would be time enough to talk about that when it happens.  There is sometimes a small percentage of rye used, I understand, 2 or 2½ per cent., but nothing more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that the question of price would prevent the use of rye on any large scale, so I would ask the Senator to leave it over until it arises.  With regard to the suggestion that any <Col N="855" /> whiskey containing over 20 per cent. of rye should be labelled &ldquo;rye whiskey&rdquo; I think that would mean that we would have to have negotiations with other countries, because, under the United States Alcohol Administration, rye whiskey is defined as &ldquo;whiskey obtained from a mash of not less than 51½ per cent. rye,&rdquo; and if we were to put out whiskey here with the description of rye whiskey, the Americans certainly would not accept it, and as most of the export we are looking for is to America, it would introduce an unnecessary complication. The provision is unnecessary from the point of view of the whiskey we are producing here.  When we get to the production of spirits from rye, it will be time enough to come along with this amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to apologise to the House and to the Minister for not being present last week when this Bill was discussed.  I had another rather important meeting to attend, but, had I known that this Bill was coming on I should have been here, but I thought from the Order of Business that it probably would not come on before 4 o'clock.  I know that it is too late to suggest any amendments, and I do not propose to do so, but I want to put three matters to the Minister for his consideration, so that possibly when the Bill is being brought forward in the Dáil he may consider incorporating them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first relates to Sections 20 and 36 which are very similar and which deal with the removal from office of a <Col N="856" /> member of the board.  I am quite sure that no Minister would unreasonably remove a member of a board of this sort from office, and I am quite certain that the present Minister would do nothing of the sort.  Nevertheless, I think it is wrong to give any Minister the right to remove a member of a public body from office without very good reason and without some right of appeal.</P>

      <P>Section 25 provides that the board may pay to a member attending a meeting of the board, Committee or other committee of the board his travelling and subsistence expenses, and it sets out that the payment shall be in accordance with a scale approved by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The suggestion I wish to make is that certain members of the board should be paid more than travelling and subsistence expenses.  A number of professional people, doctors and so on, will be members of these boards, and my experience of similar bodies is that the attendance is very much more regular and better if the members receive a fee in addition to out-of-pocket expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very good precedent for the payment of a fee to members of a body such as this, in the case of the <Col N="857" /> General Medical Council, the General Registration Council, the Dental Board and so on.  I believe it would greatly improve the working of the board if the members, many of whom will be doctors in private practice, who, if they give up a day or an evening, are sacrificing their earnings&mdash;some may be employed by local bodies and they are in a rather different position from that of doctors engaged in private practice, who, if they are to do their duty conscientiously must sacrifice not merely their time and intelligence but their financial position&mdash;are paid a fee.</P>
    <P>The third point relates to the latter portion of sub-section (2) of Section 45, dealing with the case of nurses charged with some offence before the board.  It provides that in these proceedings &ldquo;the defendant shall have the opportunity of answering the allegations made against the defendant&rdquo;.  Section 46 (3) is similar, as applying to the case of midwives.  I raised this point before and I had the Minister's assurance that it did permit the accused nurse or midwife to be represented by solicitor or counsel, and, if that is so, I cannot see any objection to the inclusion of such a clause in the Bill.  As it reads, it does not suggest to the ordinary layman that anyone but the accused person has any right of audience at all.  In many cases, these are people who have not received very good education.  In most cases, they are fairly young and are under a very great strain in appearing on a grave charge before an impressive body such as a board or committee and are not in a position to do themselves justice. If their case could be presented by an experienced solicitor or counsel, it might be very different from what it will appear to be if the accused person has to try to defend herself.  There is, again, ample precedent in the case of the other disciplinary bodies I have mentioned.  I am throwing out these suggestions, not as amendments, but for the consideration of the Minister and I thank you, Sir, for having allowed me to say what I should have said a week ago.  Finally, I wish to congratulate the Minister on what I believe to be the very real improvements he has made in an excellent measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the making of further advances to Mianraí, Teoranta for work in the Slievardagh Coalfield.  Before explaining the necessity for this provision, I should like to review briefly the circumstances which led the State to intervene in the working of the anthracite coal deposits in this coalfield.  Senators are probably aware that before the war the Slievardagh Coalfield was examined in detail, at the expense of the State, by a firm of consulting engineers who estimated that the workable reserves of coal there were about 5,500,000 tons, and recommended that commercial working of the coal deposits should be undertaken.  I might say that since the consulting engineers made their estimate, more information has come to light which tends to suggest that the reserves of extractable coal there do not exceed 2,000,000 tons.  In any case, although the report by these engineers was available for inspection by interested persons for a number of years, no acceptable proposals for the commercial working of the coalfield were received from private interests. Shortly after the outbreak of war, supplies of imported coal became scarce, and an Act was pased setting up the Slievardagh Coalfield Company to develop and work the coalfield. Between the years 1941 and 1947, this company produced and sold about 78,000 tons of anthracite coal from an area known as Ballynunty.  The company lost money in the venture mainly because they were told to produce the maximum amount of coal in the shortest possible time, even though it was recognised that this policy might not be suitable from the point of view of long term development and might involve losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that the production of coal by Mianraí, Teoranta at Slievardagh as an emergency measure <Col N="859" /> during a period of scarcity ceased at the end of 1947, when the Minerals Company Act, 1947, became law.  That Act provides for the making of advances within a limit of £50,000 to Mianraí, Teoranta for the development and working of the coalfield.  By the beginning of 1948, the company were satisfied that the coal seam at Ballynunty, which they had been working during the war years, was hopelessly uneconomic and they decided, therefore, to abandon it.  The company submitted, however, proposals for the opening of a new mine near the village of Ballingarry.  They carried out boring operations designed to test the extent and quality of the coal in this part of the coalfield and obtained expert advice that there were indications of a substantial deposit of coal at Ballingarry, that the cost of bringing a mine there to full production of 100 tons of anthracite a day (i.e., about 25,000 tons a year) would be about £50,000, and that the proposition represented a fair mining risk.  The Government, having considered this proposal very carefully, decided to authorise Mianraí, Teoranta to commence work on the opening of the new mine.</P>
    <P>Before the company could commence work on the opening of the new mine, they had to clean up the old working at Ballynunty which they were abandoning. This involved the removal of some coal there, the rendering safe of shafts and tunnels for the prevention of accidents, and the transfer of machinery and buildings to the site of the new operations.  This work cost about £6,000, leaving a balance of £44,000 available under the Act of 1947 for work on the new mine which commenced on the 1st September, 1948.  It was estimated by the company that, through the use of machinery and buildings from the old workings, this balance of £44,000 would suffice because they expected that coal production from the new mine would commence in July, 1949, and that production would be stepped up to 250 tons a week by the end of 1949.  I regret to have to inform Senators that these expectations were not realised.  If they had been, the company would <Col N="860" /> have had revenue from the sale of coal by the end of 1949 to supplement the amount available under the statute for advances for the developing and working of the new mine.</P>
    <P>The plan of operations was to drive two tunnels a distance of about 750 feet through rock to reach the coal seams.  It was hoped to drive these tunnels at a rate of 40 feet per week, but, unfortunately, the company encountered extremely difficult and unfavourable conditions underground which slowed up actual rate of progress to about 17 feet a week.  Consequently, work on the tunnels leading to the coal took twice as long as had been expected, and it will be readily appreciated that the cost of the work was substantially increased because the company had to spend more money than they had estimated on wages, stores, explosives, etc., at a time when they had no receipts from the sale of coal.  In mining, it is of course difficult to foresee what the conditions will be like below the surface, but in this case the difficulties were unexpected because the company were relying on their experience in opening the old mine at Ballynunty where underground conditions were normal.  As a result of these difficulties, the company have informed me that the balance of the moneys available under the Act of 1947 will not be sufficient to enable them to bring the mine at Ballingarry to the point when they anticipate it will be profit-earning.  They have estimated that they will require the limit on advances laid down by that Act to be extended by a further £38,000 to enable them to meet the cost of work at the new mine until the 1st September, 1951, by which date they expect the mine will be self-supporting.  Part of this additional sum will be used to purchase capital equipment for the mine, including a coal washing plant costing about £10,000, the use of which would render more readily saleable the coal raised from the mine.</P>
    <P>The directors of the company have assured me that the expenditure of this further sum of £38,000 will suffice to bring the Ballingarry mine to the stage when it will be profit-earning. Production of coal has already reached 100 tons a week but it will <Col N="861" /> take the company about another year and a half to bring the mine to the stage of full production, when the output will be increased to about 500 tons a week.  I am sure that Senators will understand that until production on this scale has been reached and maintained over a period, it is difficult to be certain whether receipts from sales will exceed the over all cost of production so as to leave a margin of profit. The quality of the coal, prevailing wage rates, the cost of raw materials and the general supply position of anthracite are the main factors which will affect production costs and selling prices when the mine is in full production, and it will be appreciated that these factors cannot be determined precisely at present.  In the circumstances, I would not feel justified at this stage in assuring the House that the expenditure of this further sum of £38,000 will enable the company to put the Ballingarry mine on a profit-earning basis which would secure repayment of the advances made from the Exchequer. Indeed, I must stress that in this as in all mining undertakings, there is a large element of risk and I must point out that if there was a guarantee or even a reasonable expectation that profits could be earned by mining coal at Slievardagh, private enterprise would not be slow to undertake the work and the State would not be called upon to foot the Bill.  I am hopeful, however, that the expenditure of this further £38,000 will enable the company to bring the mine to the stage when receipts from the sale of coal will at least meet working costs.</P>
    <P>The position at present is that the company have spent so far about £44,000 on work at Ballingarry and that there are now no funds left, under the Act of 1947, which could be advanced to them to allow them to continue the work.  I need hardly say that I am disappointed that the company have not found it possible to keep within their original estimate of £50,000.  I regret having to ask the Oireachtas to provide this further sum of £38,000.  However, I feel that, since the circumstances which have given rise to this request for <Col N="862" /> extra funds are fortuitous, it is only reasonable to allow the company to complete the job it was given to do, particularly since anthracite coal is still in short supply and the indications are that it will stay scarce for a considerable time to come.  The only alternative to providing additional funds would be to close down completely the company's coal mining operations in the Slievardagh area.  I am not prepared to recommend this course, which would involve the loss of the money which has been expended already and would lead to considerable unemployment in the area.  There are at present about 85 men employed by Mianraí, Teoranta at Ballingarry and the company have stated that they will employ from 200 to 250 men when the mine is in full production.  For many of these men coal mining is the only source of employment, and if the mine were closed they would be deprived of their only chance of earning a livelihood near their homes and would probably be forced to emigrate. The Government have decided, therefore, that the approval of the Oireachtas should be sought for continuing work at Ballingarry and that additional funds within a limit of £38,000 should be advanced to the company for this purpose.  Section 2 of the Bill gives effect to this decision by substituting the words &ldquo;Eighty-eight thousand pounds&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;Fifty thousand pounds&rdquo; in Section 3 of the Minerals Company Act, 1947.  I may assure Senators that I will neglect no opportunity of impressing upon the company the necessity for conducting the operations at Ballingarry in the most efficient and economic manner possible so that the mine may be brought to the full production stage as soon as possible and at the smallest possible cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The remaining purpose of this Bill arises out of the minerals exploration work which is being carried out by Mianraí, Teoranta at the expense of the State.  I am advised that at present money may not be paid to the company under the Minerals Company Act, 1947, for the purchase of land and mineral rights.  Section 3 of this Bill <Col N="863" /> is designed to amend sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Act of 1947 to permit of the payment of money to the company for this purpose.  This amendment is necessary in order that the company may be enabled to purchase mineral rights, etc., in the areas where substantial expenditure is being incurred on exploratory work, and it is desirable that the company should have secure title in order that any benefits resulting from the exploratory work which is being carried out at State expense, may accrue to this State and not to private interests.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one other matter in connection with it.  The difficulties which occurred at Slievardagh were not anticipated.  The mining experts who examined the mine had surveyed it in detail, but it was found when the borings were made that the lie of the ground underneath was such that normal development was not possible according to ordinary recognised mining practice.  These difficulties necessitated much more exhaustive work and consequently exhausted the resources which the company had available.</P>

      <P>I feel slightly unhappy about this Bill.  I feel it a duty to express my views about it.  I cannot help feeling that the Parliamentary Secretary has no great hope of the furture of this enterprise.  It seems to me that the advice of the experts up to the present has all gone wrong, that the reports have been falsified by the course of events and that, even when it was at its best, when it was being worked regardless of cost, during the war, in order to add to the fuel supply, this mine never had a substantial chance of success even then. There does not seem to me, from what the Parliamentary Secretary said, to be any real foundation for the hope that in the future it will add very much to the fuel supply of the country, even in times of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain what the demand for anthracite in the country is, that cannot be met from other quarters, that justifies keeping going this essentially uneconomic proposition, which the Parliamentary Secretary himself has stated would not attract private investment or enterprise.  If anthracite was an essential commodity for Irish industry or any Irish purpose and could not be obtained elsewhere, then I could see justification for subsidising <Col N="866" /> this company in order to secure a supply.</P>
    <P>The other justification is the maintenance of people in employment.  If that is the justification for keeping this mine open, it seems to me a very weak one, for several reasons.  In the first place, keeping people in employment, stereotyping the existing pattern of employment, is not a justifiable end in itself.  When we are discussing the Transport Bill, that is one of the points which will be raised. Efforts to keep people in employment, regardless of the fact that their work is not producing any useful result, is very wasteful of national resources. To spend money in keeping people in employment does not seem to be justified, especially as I feel quite convinced from what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, that they would be only kept in employment for a comparatively short time and then, either the evil day will arrive when they will be unemployed, or else there will be another application for more public money to keep them employed still further.</P>
    <P>These are some of the doubts I have about this Bill.  I know the sum involved is not very great but, at the same time, we are here allocating public money and I cannot help feeling that the ordinary prudent businessman, faced with the situation which the Government is faced with in regard to this mine, would consider very seriously whether the wisest course would not be to cut losses, to liquidate the company and to close down the whole thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all have wished for a more glowing picture than that which has been presented to us by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Yet, we must examine the conditions under which this work was undertaken and the purpose for which it was undertaken. The original Bill provided for the setting up of a company to develop the coalfields of Tipperary.  At that time we were all enthusiastic.  We gave every encouragement to the then Minister to go ahead.  The instruction given to the company was to get the coal out at all costs.  Work of the nature of mining and the development <Col N="867" /> of mines involves a long-term policy. It would take many years to achieve proper working of a mine.  Time was against this company.  It was not the development of the mine so much as the production of the coal that counted.  I am sure that that has resulted in the undertaking not being the success it might have been if the people in charge gave more time to development of a proper nature.</P>
      <P>I feel that persons charged with the responsibility of preparing an estimate for work of this kind do untold harm to the whole future of mineral development if the estimate is not sufficient to carry out the work and I am afraid there is a tendency among people engaged in that type of work to prepare an estimate for a particular sum in the knowledge that it will not be sufficient to complete the work as they know they can come for a Supplementary Estimate and because the work has begun it would be bad policy to stop it.  It would have been much better if, at the outset, the demand had been for £88,000 rather than £50,000.  The company would be able to go ahead and plan better for the future in the knowledge that they had that amount of money which they now feel is essential.</P>

    <P>In regard to the development of Slievardagh coal mines, Senator George O'Brien has expressed the view that it is not good policy to keep something going just for the sake of keeping men in employment.  This is not exactly that; it is a proposal to develop some of our natural resources and we have heard a lot of that in the past.  I for one would advocate that we should go ahead more determinedly to find out what our natural resources are and once found we should develop them in the shortest possible time.  If we are not prepared to do that there is little use in talking about ending unemployment.  Much play is being made at the present time on the view that unemployment will be ended just by the large undertaking of house building.  Some day, I hope sooner rather than later, the building industry which is one of our biggest industries at the moment will cease to <Col N="868" /> be the great source of employment for our people which it is at the moment. If we do not develop our resources we must export the people engaged in that industry and there will be no question of finding employment for them.</P>
    <P>When this company was formed it was not the intention of the Government that is should go into active production but that it should explore our natural resources.  While the Parliamentary Secretary has made a case for a further demand of £38,000, I should like to know how much money is available to the company for the work for which it was established apart from the £38,000 for Slievardagh coal mines.  We must bear in mind that the idea was to develop this coalfield to the point when it could be put on the open market and an attempt was made to hand it over to private enterprise.  That was the principle underlying our whole development policy and that is the policy for which the company was first established: to explore mineral resources, develop them to the point where you could show them to prospective investors and say &ldquo;Here is something you can carry on.  You can give employment, you can buy it from the State and run it as a private concern.&rdquo; There was no idea that our resources should be developed on a nationalised system at all.  We have reached the point when we know that we are about to provide an additional £38,000 for the further development of the coal mines but we do not know how much money is at the disposal of the company for the purpose for which it was set up.</P>
    <P>We know that when the economy axe was first raised it was on this company that it fell most heavily. Prior to and during the general election every Party which now composes the Government was competing one with the other as to who was most going to advance the development of the resources of this country.  The first step in that direction was to withdraw the £85,000 which was made available for mineral exploration. Second thoughts are often best and later on the Government decided to <Col N="869" /> allow the company to proceed to a limited extent, but as far as I can find out we have been given no information as to the amount of money at its disposal to continue its work.  Is it proposed to make available the £85,000 which was taken away at the outset?</P>

      <P>When we read this Bill it reminds us that the Government must do all its planning in view of the possibility of a world war.  There is that fear and it is the first duty of the Government to realise that we may be a besieged garrison and that there is a double duty upon them to develop whatever resources are needed to keep us going.  When the last war broke out we had to improvise means to supply ourselves with fuel and it would be very foolish of the Government to let a few thousand pounds count against an endeavour to increase the supply of anthracite and other minerals which may be of vital necessity within a measurable period. For that reason I welcome this Bill and I was sorry to hear my colleague in the university, a distinguished economist, Senator Professor George O'Brien, deprecating its use as a method of giving employment.  We must realise that if we are to develop our mines&mdash;and it may be necessary to develop our mines if war breaks out and we are thrown, as we were before, on our own resources&mdash;we must have skilled men to work the mines.  If for the sake of a few thousand pounds we stop the development which the Bill furthers, we might be very sorry if all our miners had left the country.  A prudent Government&mdash;and I commend the prudence of the Government in this case&mdash;is bound to take the steps implicit in this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on the fact that he has introduced it.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this Bill.  We have heard in the past many adverse comments on the spending of money on mineral exploitation and the ascertaining of our mineral resources.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce asks us to spend £38,000 on a really serious effort to show that there is a type of first-class anthracite <Col N="870" /> which is required for the country in Arigna, even it happened that the project was not a success, it does at least prove that the Government is in earnest and is prepared to make the effort to show to the people of the country that if we have mineral resources they will be developed and that money will not in all cases be a bar to their exploitation.</P>
      <P>I believe the Slievardagh project will be a success.  The type of coal coming out of Slievardagh is of very good quality and the project, I understand, will give employment to several hundred people when it is properly exploited.  That is a very desirable thing in peace time, as well as in war time.  I think it would be a very sorry day if the Minister should say, for the sake of £30,000, if there are minerals in Slievardagh, or in some other part of the country, that we are not going to see they are there.  I think it would be a penny wise and pound foolish policy.  I want to congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on coming here and asking us for that sum.  He will be able to show to the people that he has courage in exploiting our national resources.  Mining, and anything of that nature, is always risky.  If it is going to be done by the State, the State must take some of the risks that business people took in the past.  The old merchant adventurers were the people who were supposed to do that in the past, and they got a bit of extra profit, or even suffered a loss if they were not successful.  If this is being handed over to the State, the State must have the courage to take the risk and to do the things that are necessary.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that the Minister is seeking these powers.  I think we have to look at this project just as we have looked at the supply of other forms of native fuel during the crisis years.  I do not think this is one of the propositions that can be looked at purely from a commercial point of view.  I would go so far as to hope that he may in the future, find himself in the position of coming to ask for moneys such as these, for development in other parts of the country.  In saying that, we have to <Col N="871" /> remember that these moneys are being spent on labour in a district which badly needs it.  The money is spent on wages so the national loss is not as big as it would appear on a survey of the figures themselves.  Having said that, I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to throw light on two rather important points connected with this mining proposition.  There is a big demand for anthracite.  I speak subject to correction, but I think anthracite coal is being imported.  Is there some peculiar reason in this particular area why the anthracite costs an abnormal sum to produce?  Is there some peculiar formation that makes the use of modern machinery less efficient and less economical than obtains in these other sources of anthracite from abroad?  I just ask these questions so the House will be informed, because on the face of it, with the demand for a thing, with a natural supply of that thing, and with the availability of modern machinery, it would suggest that we should be able to produce this coal at a competitive price and without loss.  I am accepting, for the time being, the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that we cannot do that.  That is why I am supporting his Bill and hope that the House will vote this money.  I think the House would be interested, however, in hearing his reply to the two points I have raised.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>In the old days, one of the great things that inspired people to take part in the national movement was, of course, to secure the freedom of our country.  The other was the development of the resources of the country.  In the development of the resources of the country we were not to a great extent concerned with what we were going to lose.  We were prepared to take chances; in fact, we were prepared to take chances to secure everything that this country has gained.  It was a surprise to me, certainly, to hear a person of the status of Senator George O'Brien refer to wastage&mdash;I think that is what we might call it&mdash;of money in attempting to develop the resources of our own country. Senator Summerfield referred to <Col N="872" /> the question of modern machinery.  So far as I can remember, when these mines were developed during the war modern machinery was not available. Perhaps, if the machinery of the type required were available at that time, the loss which was shown in the development, and I do not think it was a terrific loss, might not have been there at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary, introducing this Bill, told us that in the beginning it was estimated that there were 5,000,000 tons of anthracite available in that area for the use of the people of this country, and later the estimate was reduced to somewhere in the region of 2,000,000, and that in the Ballynunty district only about 75,000 tons have been raised.  I suppose Senator O'Brien is an expert in one direction.  Probably, he is not right on all occasions.  Whoever the experts were who decided on 5,000,000 tons, in the first instance, maybe they are right in their estimate now of 2,000,000. Since anthracite is being used in increasing quantities as the years pass, and since we have no great resources of coal in the country, I think we should go all out to develop mining until we can get using that quantity in full measure.  Now, £20,000, £40,000 or £50,000 seems to me to make very little difference where 2,000,000 tons of coal are concerned.  The only regret I have is that this Government, when it got power, dropped for a time, at any rate, until they had wiser counsel, I suppose, the allocation of money which had been provided for the purpose of the development of these mines.  The question of providing work for unemployed people, in my opinion, is one of the most important duties of the Government in this country.  The area in which these mines are situated contains a very poor population of people who must rely on employment.  I think any moneys spent on giving employment to these people is well spent.  It is better to give it to them in the form of attempting to develop our resources, than to give it to them as dole, because they will have to get it either way, if these people are not to leave the country.  The loss to the country of these people if they had to leave would be far greater than the sum which this Bill provides to give them <Col N="873" /> employment, and to enable us to develop our natural resources.</P>

      <P>I hope that the activities of the Department will not be confined entirely to coal and anthracite.  There are many other minerals in the country that can be highly developed.  During the war we had the phosphate mines down in County Clare which practically saved the agricultural industry during those years.  It was a private enterprise from the start; then part of it was taken over by the Government and things drifted on until the war had finished.  Then, there was a dispute, which I will not refer to, between the Government and the previous owners and the whole thing has been let drop now.  Should another war ensue at any time&mdash;nobody knows when that may be &mdash;it is a pity to leave it go derelict after serving the country so well during a period of great need.  Of course, there is foreign stuff coming in which may be better but when you cannot get better it is very good to have the next best thing.  In that way, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department will take all minerals into consideration that may be of good service to this country in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here when the Parliamentary Secretary was introducing this Bill, but I listened to the Minister in the Dáil and what struck me then was that both the present Minister and the former Minister, Deputy Lemass, were agreed that the development so far was one which had taken place not in normal conditions, but in conditions in which fuel was very necessary.  To use a western expression which is used to describe something which has not been well done, it was &ldquo;proughing&rdquo;.  The Minister made a very guarded statement.  He said that the Government felt they were justified in asking for this further expenditure and had good hopes of the development becoming a paying proposition in time. It is the policy of all Parties to encourage local industries in rural and urban districts throughout the country <Col N="874" /> and that is another reason why this expenditure is justified.</P>
      <P>A Senator talked about the disemployment of 85 men.  That is serious, but, so far as my experience goes, I think we are inclined to exaggerate this problem of unemployment because I do not know of anyone who is anxious and willing to work who cannot get profitable employment. I am afraid we are getting a little bit pettish in that respect.  During the emergency, when bicycle tyres were scarce, there were a great many complaints about people having to walk long distances to work.  That time has passed and bicycles and tyres are plentiful and to cycle a few miles to work is not a very big task.  It would be well if the Minister used the opportunity of the passage of this Bill to give a direction that he expects good value for the money which is to be expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One good reason why this proposal should be supported is that in the case of another emergency it would be a great advantage to have the mine developed.  We can all recall the last emergency when the getting of essential materials was not a matter of money or price.  No matter how much money you had at the time, if you had not certain vital materials, you were in danger of a crisis.  If the time comes again when it would be necessary to have fuel, even though the working of the mine would not be a commercial proposition, it would be a great advantage to have the development work finished and the mine ready for working as a stand-by.  At all events, the proposed work should leave it in a better condition than it was when the last emergency began.  You would have only to go in and get whatever coal you could.  The great trouble before, as the Minister said, was that, as the work went on, unforeseen difficulties arose instead of coal.  That is why I suggest that the Minister should give a direction, as regards this sum of money to be spent now, that he expects, and that the Seanad and Dáil expect better and more efficient development from the amount to be spent compared pound for pound with what has been spent in the past.  The company are <Col N="875" /> being placed in the happy position of having up-to-date machinery and it will be only reasonable to expect greater progress now in view of the amount of money that has already been spent on this mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill which sets up this organisation for Slievardagh was enacted it was understood that the proposition was to explore and exploit the possibility of mining development, and not to engage in actual mining operations in any particular place.  This amending Bill merely authorises the alteration of the original Act which enables the State to expend certain sums in the development of Slievardagh.  It provides that £38,000 can be spent.  It is well to refer to the fact that this company is not doing what it was intended to do.  I have listened to different viewpoints on this measure in regard to the economics of working a particular mine in Tipperary.  One viewpoint was that there should be some regard to the economic production of coal in the area, and another was that the cardinal principle to be observed was the giving of employment. I am prepared to argue that there is some in-between&mdash;a kind of balance&mdash;between the two viewpoints. There must be some regard for the economics of the production of coal in that particular area.  I do suggest that this scheme is not really a relief scheme.  If it were, then the fundamental outlook would be the giving of employment and anything else would be only a secondary consideration. But, it is not a relief scheme.  While it may be a scheme that would not attract or encourage private business people, it may be the type of scheme in which the risks are so great that you will not get adequate capital development from private business men.  We were given to understand that the company was to develop the mines in the hope of selling them to private individuals or to business people in the hope that they would be carried on as private enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would have to be some regard <Col N="876" /> to the cost of production at some stage in that, because if the State were to continue to subsidise the production of coal in one particular case it would be really giving a subsidy per ton on the output and there would have to be some regard to the cost of producing that coal in other parts of the country, or if that particular coal is not obtainable in any other part of the country, the costs of imported fuel would have to be taken into consideration in view of the fact that there might be other industries which could secure a more economic return.  I am not suggesting that I am hostile in any way to further development under this scheme.  I believe it is a good thing that the money should be voted by the State to develop the mining operations but the point with which I am inclined to disagree is that the scheme is confined to one particular enterprise.  When the company was first established it was to exploit resources generally.  That brings me to the fact that I cannot see any plan by the company for development in the Arigna area, an area about which I know a good deal.</P>
    <P>There has been a desire by many speakers for more information, as to the general prospects, the depth of the seam and if the production in Tipperary is to be reasonably economic.  In Arigna, prior to the war, Córas Iompair Éireann used to have Welsh coal at a siding to fuel the engines that would carry away the Arigna coal where the production was not very great.  The war came and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, quite rightly, in the national interest put his foot down and said that the people who had been the users of coal from Arigna could not get it.  Local institutions had tried to keep those mines open by giving them as much business as possible, otherwise there would be no mines operating in Arigna at all. During the emergency, the Department decided that the Pigeon House, the sugar company, Córas Iompair Éireann, and so on, were of such national importance that they had to get that output.  As a result, those who had kept the mines going at Arigna under normal conditions could not get supplies.  Many fuel plants had <Col N="877" /> been designed for that type of coal and it was found uneconomic to use alternative fuel.</P>
    <P>We are now past the emergency and the real scarcity.  I wonder if this company intends to develop only in Tipperary.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give some indication of the future plans.  Is there any plan for mineral exploitation?  Is there any indication of a proper survey to develop the Arigna mines, with a view to selling them back when developed, as private interests?</P>
    <P>Many individuals and companies have been operating on similar lines to Tipperary, as it was when the State took over, lines that could hardly be regarded as a modern approach to mining.  The emergency conditions prevented the import of machinery and proper development work in Tipperary and the lack of capital was also a factor.  I believe there is great scope for development.  It may be argued that the standard and quality in Arigna area does not make it economic for Córas Iompair Éireann, the sugar company and others to use Arigna coal on a large scale.  However, that condition of affairs was brought about because of the emphasis on output by the Department of Industry and Commerce. As a result, the workers were paid on piece time rates and because they were paid more wages they were prepared to put out black stones as if it were coal.  An odd incident like that does not prove that the quality of the coal at Arigna was bad.  I am so convinced of that that I would welcome an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that there will be a proper survey of the coalfield in the area as well as in Tipperary.  Since the coal in Tipperary is to be subsidised in the national interest, is there any reason why there should not be development on similar lines in other areas where coal is available for extraction?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">
      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some information about the development work carried on by what was the Minerals Exploration Company and is now a section of the present company. <Col N="878" /> I understand exploration is going on on a limited scale in the Avoca area-Are they still blocking out and investigating the copper sulphide deposits, or are they thinking more on the lines of the pyrites, or what is being done in the mineralised zone?  From what one has heard about the Tipperary coalfield for which this extra sum of money is being asked, it appears that not only have special difficulties cropped up in developing the deposit but the deposit itself appears to suffer from being rather friable.  I understand that the coal easily breaks up into small pieces. I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary can say whether hard anthracite coal of this nature, if washed and curshed, can be used in a pulverised fuel furnace.  If so, it seems that this friable coal could have a use, but I do not know if it produces the flame necessary for the pulverised type of fuel furnace.</P>
      <P>Those of us who use hard coal in the heat storage cooker find that the bugbear of dust would rather indicate that the losses in using this Slievardagh coal in such cookers would be great. Why did the original estimate for this mine prove to be insufficient to cover the cost of operations there?  We understand the one shaft was sunk and, presumably, following borings or the indication of borings, now another is to be sunk.  Are the seams seriously faulty, or what is the trouble?  When you are developing a mineral area, if you are an ordinary limited liability company you say as little as possible about what is happening, but I wonder if it is right, when it is a State mine, that you should carry on in exactly the same way and give the bare minimum of information.  I believe that it might serve a useful purpose if the Dáil and Seanad were given a little more information in regard to what was being done in these areas than we have had.</P>

      <P>Senator Orpen has talked about Avoca.  They are building a tunnel there.  Pyrites were obtained during the war.  It was picked by hand, which is a very expensive method and which would not pay for the particular purpose for which it was <Col N="879" /> used, that is, for making artificial manure.  I understand from those who know something about mining that mining for that particular ore could not be done on a profitable scale.  I understand that there are zinc and lead available there.  On advice, they are sinking a shaft and will then make a tunnel so as to work from the bottom instead of from the top.  Some experts claim that that is not the most profitable way to do it.  Other experts contend that that it is the proper way to do it.  Not being an expert, I just have to listen to both sides.  The Government have to do likewise.  There is expenditure involved but, if minerals can be produced, the cost of development is a very small thing compared with the profits that may accrue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained at the outset of this debate, the purpose of this measure is to provide additional money for the working at Slievardagh. I agree with the views expressed by Senators that it is regrettable that the money originally voted was insufficient to meet the expenses up to the present and which will be incurred if the plan which the company are operating is brought to a conclusion.  Unfortunately, the workings at the coalfield proved more difficult and more expensive than was originally anticipated. It may be that the original estimate was conservative and, to that extent, Senator Hawkins' view, that in a matter of this kind it would be more satisfactory if the company erred on the side of generosity rather than in the manner in which they did, could get general support.  But at the time the mining operations started there it was expected that the seam would not prove so difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of the coal in Slievardagh is good but the seam is narrow and there is the further problem that it runs rather differently from the normal way that seams run in other coalfields, inasmuch as that borings have to be made at intervals and cannot be continued, in some cases, without fresh borings being made.  These are all technical matters and an expression of opinion from myself or <Col N="880" /> from Senators will not help the company in a matter of that kind.</P>
    <P>I understand from the company that the increased expenditure is due entirely to unforeseen difficulties&mdash; difficulties which the company did not anticipate would arise when the original scheme was adopted and which have added considerably to the cost.</P>
    <P>There is, I believe, a good deal in what Senator George O'Brien said on this matter.  He expressed the view that merely spending money for the purpose of providing employment on an undertaking of this nature is not good national economy.  However, in this matter the fact that considerable expenditure has already been incurred and plant and equipment have been put into operation and that the quality of the coal which has been tested is of a high grade warrants the assumption that it would be even worse economy to abandon the present operations.  It is also true that if the present high consumption demand for anthracite continues, any anthracite that can be produced in this country will find a ready market.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla mentioned the question of Welsh coal or Welsh anthracite and asked how the price compared with Irish anthracite.  At the present time the Welsh anthracite is cheaper but the demand for anthracite is so high that any anthracite that is available here has found ready sale.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the rate of production from the mine at Slievardagh will be increased to the level which the company anticipate by the time they anticipate it.  But, if it is, and if the present operations prove satisfactory, then the company assured the Minister that the quality of the anthracite will be such as will make it an economic proposition.  If this operation were to start <i>de noro</i>, the Dáil and Seanad would have to consider carefully whether the expenditure was warranted or not.  In this particular case, considerable expenditure has already been incurred and to abandon the work now, when it seems from the progress of the operations there that it would be possible to <Col N="881" /> produce coal of high quality and at an economic price, would not be good economy.  I think we are justified in asking the Legislature to continue the legislation and to provide additional sums of money.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield asked why the costs of the anthracite produced there are higher than elsewhere.  The difficulties I have averted to have all contributed to the higher costs.  The difficulty in working the seam cuased by the uneven lie of the seam&mdash;I do not know what is the techinical description of it&mdash;has caused the company considerable concern and has contributed to the higher cost.  That, I think, is the only reason why the original estimate has not been fulfilled. Some Senators, in particular Senator O'Reilly, asked what has been done about other coalfields, mainly Arigna. Development of these coalfields is being conducted by private enterprise and at the present time there is no intention of this company embarking on further development.</P>
    <P>The other sphere of operation which the company has is Avoca and there they are exploring the mines to see the quality and quantity of whatever minerals are available.  That scheme, which it is hoped will end in two years, will enable the company to come to a definite conclusion on the minerals available in Avoca and the practicability of working them on an economic basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>One word to clear a misunderstanding.  I think I was slightly misunderstood by some members of the Seanad.  It has been suggested owing to what I said that I was not in favour of expenditure on the development of Irish natural resources. That is entirely and absolutely wrong. <Col N="882" /> I am in favour of the expenditure of a great deal more money than has been spent on the intelligent development of all our resources, agricultural, industrial, mineral and otherwise.  I did not oppose the Bill; I simply questioned it, not because it is a Bill to spend money on natural resources, but because it is a Bill to spend money on a development project which according to the Parliamentary Secretary himself had already been proved to be rather uneconomic and which, if it were to be started afresh, it would be very doubtful if the money would be justified.  There is no question of research; it is a question of carrying on a business the past record of which has not been particularly satisfactory.  I want to clear my position: of course I am in favour of research but I do not think that the money voted this evening will be devoted to research.</P>
      <P>There is another point on which I should like to make my position clear. Senator Mrs. Concannon stated that in war time it might be advisable to have supplies of skilled men in the country and with that I agree.  I do conceive that this particular type of skilled employment might be worth keeping in existence in the country although keeping men in employment is not merely an end in itself.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question in connection with the amount of money being allocated for this proposal.  I am, of course, very pleased to see the amount increased from £50,000 to £88,000 but why was it not increased to several times that amount?  Some people may disagree with me; I am certain they will.  The argument has been put up that anthracite coal is available in other countries, but my attitude on that is the same as is has been for a number of years.  Twenty-four or five years ago a number of us went up to that area and subscribed £20 each to get this started.  I am not saying that we financed the mines but at that time £20 was an awful lot of money to us.  According to the reports of the specialists 2,000,000 tons are available.  Some of the people who <Col N="883" /> were regarded as experts said 5,000,000 tons&mdash;I forget what group of experts. Some said that there was no coal while one fellow said there was and he was the best expert of the lot.  If it is a wise policy to develop the mines in wartime when coal is scarce, I suggest that now is the time to go ahead, not during a war, as, from what the Minister said in the Dáil, the coal is there. We do not know when another war is likely to start and it would be too late to start increasing the output when a war begins.  Now is the time for the Minister to take the necessary steps to ensure that machinery will be put in and that it is the proper type of machinery to turn out 2,000,000 tons in a reasonably short time so that if a war starts we will not be in the position we were in before when people were going around with lumps of coal in their pockets.</P>

One million tons of anthracite would keep the women of Ireland quiet for a long time and if we had a few thousand tons in the hard winters we had in the past and that we may have in the future it would be very much better than some of the money which they tell us is useless.</P>

      <P>On Senator Quirke's point, £38,000 is the sum the company estimates will be required in order to make the production of coal an economic proposition, £28,000 for development work and £10,000 for a washing machine to wash the coal when it is produced.  As to the question of producing large quantities, the company themselves estimate that <Col N="884" /> that money would be sufficient to put it into economic production.  If that is so I do not think there is any case for giving them more money.  If the Senator can sell coal we have plenty in the Park and we will avail of his services to get rid of it.</P>

      <P>Speaking on the Second Reading, I was anxious to have some information from the Parliamentary Secretary.  This section of the Bill provides an additional £38,000 for the development of the particular mines referred to.  There are also other operations in which this company is engaged, and while we might be interested and very anxious to see this particular scheme a success, I think the majority of us here would be much more interested to hear that the company would go ahead with the work for which it was first established and set up.  I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us some information, as to what sum of money is at their disposal for the carrying out of the particular works, other than this. I know we are providing £38,000 but I am not aware of what other funds they have at their disposal to continue the operations for which they were set up.  In connection with the suggestion about the development of these particular coalfields, I think it was Senator J.T. O'Farrell, who said they could be developed by private enterprise. They have been there for quite a long time, and neither the trade union organisation of which Senator O'Farrell is a member, nor any of the other organisations throughout the country, nor any private individual came along to develop them.  As a matter of fact, when the company had established the fact that there was coal there, and had it developed to a point, and when this concern was put on the market for sale, none of the private enterprise we hear so much about came along to purchase it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>In addition to this money, I thought I explained that we were also making provision by way of grant for exploratory work in Avoca to ascertain what minerals are there, and <Col N="886" /> it is expected that the operations will take two years.  For that work there is a grant which is, of course, not repayable because of the nature of the work.  It is of an exploratory nature and it is not anticipated, until the investigations are complete, that any minerals will yield a revenue, if minerals are discovered there in large quantities.  There is a grant of £120,000.  That work is expected to last for a period of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Parliamentary Secretary that I was quite serious when I suggested the amount should be increased, though some people here may not think so.  I think I know as much, in fact, I think I know more, about those mines than most people in this House.  I have been down in the mines.  I have been in several mines in that district and I have been in mines in Wales.  I do not mind admitting here, between ourselves, that there is a tremendous difference and that £38,000 is really only a very small sum to deal with the proposition which has to be dealt with in that area.  As I say, I have been down in these mines, and while the workers in that area at the present time are more than pleased, and more than willing to work under the conditions obtaining there now, I do not mind telling the Parliamentary Secretary or telling anybody else, that the conditions under which men are working down there can be very considerably improved and, in my opinion, should be very considerably improved. Anybody who knows anything about expenditure on mining or excavation will know that this sum will last a very short time and go a very short way to meet the situation which exists down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the war, I understand that something like 70,000 tons were taken out of the three mines down there.  In order to get down in these mines you have practically to go on your knees which meant that the workers were working under conditions under which you could not get the best results.  I believe a considerable sum of money can be spent advantageously, not alone in what might be called prospecting or <Col N="887" /> investigating what might be got in other areas, but in improving the situation in areas where coal is already being mined.  I believe the money should be spent.  I am quite serious when I say we should have several times the amount of money asked by the company.  Naturally, the company are influenced by the attitude of the Government in what is called economy. To my mind, it is false economy.  It is losing the ship for the ha'porth of tar, as they said long ago.  I wish to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that now is the time to develop these mines to the fullest and, if at any time it were found that coal from these mines was not necessary, it would be the easiest thing in the world to store it.  It would be an excellent position to be in, to know that, if a time came when coal could not be got elsewhere, it could be got from our mines.  My attitude on the question of providing a market for our coal is the attitude of a protectionist.  I believe a market should be made available no matter at what price coal can be got elsewhere.  The same applies to Castle-comer and the Swan.  No matter what Government comes in here from time to time, I believe it should be the duty of that Government to provide a suitable market at an economic price, which would enable the workers to get a decent wage, and which will ensure the production of coal when the time comes in which we need fuel in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I made myself clear on this, but the company is already working there and whatever coal is produced is sold.  In addition, they anticipate that it would take £38,000&mdash;£28,000 is for development and £10,000 is for a washing machine which is regarded as essential in order to market the coal in good condition.  I do not think anyone would seriously contend that they should be told: &ldquo;You can have all the money you want, even though you do not want to spend it.&rdquo;  The company anticipates that the £28,000, which they consider will be necessary in order to develop the mine to an economic stage, is sufficient.  I hope it will be.  If it <Col N="888" /> is not sufficient, then the matter will have to be reconsidered, but it is estimated at the moment that the £28,000 for development and £10,000 for the machine will be sufficient.  On the question of the possibility of working the mine which Senator Quirke refers to, that is one of the difficulties.  The company abandoned the work at Ballynunty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The particular operation at Slievardagh is difficult, but the company, from an analysis of the coal, are in a position to say that it is of good quality.  Apparently, however, the lie of the ground, or whatever the technical term is for the formation of the minerals, is such that the seam is narrow and it is not easy to extract the coal.  That was responsible for the original estimate of £50,000 being insufficient to bring the mine up to full economic production. I believe the amount now being made available is reasonable, in view of the company's estimate, and I feel that any suggestion that it should be increased, in the absence of information or expert advice, would be a misuse of public money.  The Seanad can rest assured that the sum of money now being provided is sufficient to meet the company's estimate of the expenditure which will be incurred between now and September, 1951, when the mine is expected to be in full production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the acquisition of land and I should like to have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that in the case of land being acquired from local people, the market value will be taken into consideration.  That matter is being dealt with in another Bill before the Oireachtas at the moment, but I cannot quite see how the market value is to be arrived at.  In that area, the Ballingarry-Slievardagh area, right <Col N="889" /> over the hill, the average farm is fairly small.  If a farmer has 30 acres and it is necessary to acquire ten or 15 acres from that farmer, I suggest it would not be fair and would not be good policy from the Land Commission, or, if you like, the national point of view, to acquire that land on the basis of a flat rate.  Some people here would say that it is very poor land, but in fact it is not, although it looks very poor. Wherever there is coal under the ground, the land over it looks cold, but if you take away half that man's farm it is very hard to compensate him adequately.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is in that area another problem in connection with what are called basset mines.  I do not know how to spell the word, but I have been hearing about them for many years and I think I am right in my pronunciation. In that area, people have been mining coal in their own backyards and fields for a long number of years.  The law says they have no right to do it but it has been going on, as everybody knows, for so many years that these people now have something which amounts to a squatter's right. Some of the legal men may be able to provide a better term.  The fact is that these people have not only been providing coal for themselves but have been able to get sufficient coal to enable them to sell a little around the district.  We all know that that is not allowed under the Minerals Acts.  It is breaking the law, but if the law continues to be broken, for 25, 30 or 40 years openly, I think the fact should be taken into consideration in connection with the acquisition of land.  I do not say that the land should not be acquired or that a man should be allowed to continue to work a basset mine, to work a little on the outcrop, to the detriment of the main mining proposition, but the Government should be liberal in the matter of the compensation paid to such people.</P>

      <P>The point which the Senator makes applies where land is acquired by the company in order to extend or continue development.  In such cases, it is generally acquired by agreement and on terms which are <Col N="890" /> usually satisfactory to both parties. In the absence of agreement, there is provision under the Acquisition of Land Act, 1919, for arbitration and I think the conditions laid down have generally proved satisfactory.  In default of agreement, an arbitrator is appointed and both parties appear before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very thing I was afraid of.  These Acts are, to my mind, out of date because the conditions obtaining at the time were not the same as the conditions which obtain at present.  It is all very well to say that the land can be acquired by agreement.  I think I am right in saying that if you were to seek to acquire the land by agreement, in half the cases down there the next war will be over and done with before you will reach agreement.  Agreement possibly will be reached finally and the Parliamentary Secretary may live to see it, but some of us who are a little older will have gone to the happy hunting grounds before it is reached.  The alternative is to go back to this out of date legislation and have arbitration.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that when the arbitration court has finished and when a certain price has been decided on, there will still be a few words to be said around the table in the back kitchen or in the publichouse before it will be finally settled.  As a matter of policy, the Government should take the line that they want to get this thing done quickly and satisfactorily and want to get it done in such a way as will ensure the goodwill of everybody in the district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey) Daniel Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before asking the House to accept the principle of this measure I propose to outline in a few words the sequence of events which led to its introduction.  Shortly after taking up office, I was informed by the then chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann that the company had incurred a loss of over £800,000 in 1947 and that he then estimated that the loss for 1948 would be £1,250,000&mdash;in fact this estimate proved to be somewhat too low as the deficit actually incurred on the year's working was £1,400,000.</P>
      <P>The measures which the company considered necessary to remedy the position included:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Dismissal of 2,500 men by reductions in maintenance;</P>
      <P>(2)  closing down of branch lines, involving further disemployment, possibly amounting to 1,000 men;</P>
      <P>(3)  increasing fares to road and rail passengers and raising freight charges on road and rail;</P>
      <P>(4)  Restriction on privately operated road transport.</P>
      <P>These proposals were so drastic that they could not be accepted by any Minister without the fullest investigation.</P>
      <P>At the same time, capital commitments totalling no less than £17,250,000 had been entered into or were about to be incurred by the company.  It did not appear to me that the programme planned was necessary, nor was it shown to my satisfaction that if it were carried out the concern would be put on a self-supporting basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, having considered the matter, came to the conclusion that the affairs of the company should be fully investigated, and, as Senators are aware, the Government succeeded in securing the services of Sir James <Col N="892" /> Milne, an acknowledged authority on transport administration for the task which, with the collaboration of a team which included experts in all branches of transport, he completed with commendable despatch.  The task which Sir James undertook was that of examining and reviewing the position of rail, road and canal transport, and of reporting on the steps it might be necessary or desirable to take to secure:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the greatest measure of co-ordination of rail, road and canal transport;</P>
    <P>(b)  the restoration of the financial position of the public transport companies; and</P>
    <P>(c)  the most efficient and economical transport system.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to take up the time of the House by outlining in detail the recommendations of Sir James Milne's Report which was made public in December, 1948.  In order, however, that Senators may be enabled to appreciate fully the issues involved, and the reasons underlying the approach to the problem, embodied in this measure, it is necessary that I should give briefly an account of some of the main conclusions arrived at by Sir James and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>The experts considered that the services provided by Córas Iompair Éireann are the backbone of the present public services and that those services form the natural foundation for future development.  They felt that it was wrong in principle that the affairs of such a large undertaking should devolve almost entirely on the shoulders of one individual, the Chairman; they recommended that two additional Government nominees should be appointed and that the board as a whole should be made responsible for the administration of the company's affairs, reserving only to the Government directors the right to veto capital expenditure.  The functions and operations of the various departments in the company were examined in detail, and many recommendations for improvements in organisation were made.  The report was severely critical of the policy of the Board of <Col N="893" /> Córas Iompair Éireann and the control it exercised, particularly in the matter of capital expenditure, and the findings confirmed the doubts present in the minds of the Minister for Finance and myself as regards the wisdom or necessity of undertaking the projected capital developments.</P>
    <P>The proposal to proceed with the erection of a central bus station at Store Street will provide Senators with an illustration of the policy and procedure which were so unfavourably commented on in the report.  The need for a central bus station is unquestioned, but the central bus station at Store Street would occupy only the ground floor of the building.  Above it have been erected five storeys of new offices for the staff of the company. The cost of the bus station might be anything from £100,000 to £150,000, but the cost of this new building now in progress (including the new offices for the company) is estimated at £850,000; and with furnishings, fittings, etc. the final cost may be nearer to the £1,000,000 mark.  I feel that the offices at present occupied by the company's staffs, and, indeed, I am so advised, are reasonably adequate and satisfactory for their purpose.  The decision of the company to provide these new offices involved the company in a million pounds of capital which, even if it were available, could be better spent on the provision of better carriages and wagons on the railway system and to put more omnibuses on the streets.</P>
    <P>Other capital projects condemned in the report included the proposed introduction of diesel-electric locomotives, the plan for elaborate and costly chassis maintenance and body-building shops at Broadstone, the Inchicore chassis factory, the proposal for a spring shop at Inchicore, and the plan for reconstruction of Limerick Junction Station.  A project of which Sir James Milne was not aware was the proposal to build a six-storey luxury hotel at Glengarriff.  Land had been acquired and tenders for building invited.  The lowest tender for the shell of the building was £507,000 and this was accepted by the company.  It was estimated that the hotel, when completed, would cost <Col N="894" /> approximately £1,000,000.  The board, however, decided before the Milne investigation, to abandon the project, but not before an expenditure of £35,000 had been incurred.</P>
    <P>The condemenation of this huge programme for capital expenditure created the gravest doubts in the minds of the Government as to the feasibility of permitting the board, as then constituted. to continue to control the company's activities, and consequently it was decided to change the Government's representative on the board.  This was done on the 18th February, 1949, and the retiring chairman was compensated in accordance with the terms of a contract he had made with the company.</P>
    <P>At the same time it was announced that the Government proposed to introduce legislation to provide for:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The acquisition of the public transport systems other than the Great Northern Railway Company;</P>
    <P>(2)  the appointment by the Government of a transport board;</P>
    <P>(3)  the provision of compensation for stockholders, and</P>
    <P>(4)  the making of arrangements to ensure that dismissals of staff on grounds of redundancy would not take place.</P>
    <P>The present Bill, Sir, is to give effect to this decision, and the main purpose of the Bill is to bring under public ownership the undertakings of Córas Iompair Éireann and the Grand Canal Company for the control of which a new board to be called Córas Iompair Éireann will be set up.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of Córas Iompair Éireann and the Grand Canal Company constitutes a further step in the process of unification which began with the amalgamations effected by the Railways Act, 1924.  This measure is the logical outcome of the developments in transport in this country since the foundation of the State.  When the Transport Act, 1944, was introduced, its sponsors claimed that it would lead to economical and efficient transport services.  It is now generally accepted that the combination of private ownership and semi-State control has not <Col N="895" /> achieved these results.  The division of ownership and effectual control could be satisfactory neither to the nominal owners of the undertaking nor to the Government whose responsibility it was to ensure that the public interest was served.</P>
    <P>Transport is a vital public service, of concern to every individual in the State and intimately affecting every phase of the economic life of the country.  We all know that the task of providing a national transport system in this country under modern conditions has proved to be beyond the scope of private enterprise and also that the compromise between State ownership and private enterprise has not been successful.  It is the Government's duty to ensure that such an important service is carried on as effectively and as efficiently as possible.  We have come to the conclusion that the discharge of that duty demands State ownership of public transport.  That conclusion has already been reached in many other countries.  We have the example of countries such as France, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Belgium.  In Britain also a solution of the transport problem is being sought through the medium of a Government appointed Transport Commission.</P>
    <P>Of the company's created capital, some £13,000,000 debenture stock is guaranteed by the Government as to principal and interest, while the common stock amounts to £3,500,000. For the protection of its interests in the company, the previous Government gave to the chairman in the 1944 Act special powers, but, as will have been seen, the results have not been satisfactory. Sir James Milne has recommended that two additional Government representatives should be added to the board and that the only additional power given to Government directors should be a veto on capital expenditure.  This would still leave the Government representatives in a minority on the board, despite the preponderance of Government participation in the finances of the undertaking. This position would not be a satisfactory one from the point of view of the taxpayer or the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> The Bill provides for the establishment of a board consisting of not less than three nor more than seven members, including the chairman.  The members of the board will be appointed by the Government.  It is proposed that appointments will be for a period not exceeding five years, but that members will be eligible for reappointment. The terms and conditions of office and the remuneration of members will be fixed by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the Government that a small board is most likely to yield the best prospects of efficient organisation. For this reason they have decided on a maximum of seven&mdash;the same number as the Electricity Supply Board.  The overriding powers of the chairman under the 1944 Act are abolished.  A member of the board may be removed from office on stated grounds.  In such cases, the Bill requires that a statement shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas giving the grounds for removal.  It is proposed that the members of the board may not also be members of either House of the Oireachtas.  The superannuation provisions for the board are similar to those for the members of the Electricity Supply Board, but provision is made to enable the present chairman, if he is appointed chairman of the new board, to reckon his service with the State and with local authorities for pension purposes, as is provided for in the case of a civil servant transferring to a local authority.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that the existing name Córas Iompair Éireann should be retained.  The fact that Córas Iompair Éireann denotes the Irish transport system is only now becoming fully appreciated abroad. The name has not been in use for very long and a change would tend to create confusion.  There is the further consideration that a change would involve considerable expenditure in printing, altering signs and names on vehicles, and in many other ways.  In all the circumstances and having considered various alternatives, the Government decided that they would not be justified in making a change.  For convenience, the existing company is referred to as <Col N="897" /> Córas Iompair Éireann (1945) throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>The duties of the new board are set out in Section 15 of the Bill as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To provide or secure or promote the provision of an efficient, economical, convenient and properly integrated system of public transport for passengers and merchandise by rail, road and water, with due regard to safety of operation, the encouragement of national economic development and the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment for its employees...and for that purpose to improve in such manner as it considers necessary transport facilities so as to provide for the needs of the public, agriculture, commerce and industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The board will also have the duty of conducting its undertaking so that as soon as possible, and taking one year with another, its revenue will be sufficient to meet outgoings.</P>
    <P>It will be the aim of the board to provide the highest degree of service at the lowest charges compatible with meeting costs.  There is, as many Senators know, a good deal of loose talk about &ldquo;cheap transport&rdquo; and a tendency to ignore the fact that transport charges must depend, to a great degree, on the extent to which the services are supported and to the cost of providing them.  Fixed expenses constitute a large proportion of railway costs and a fall in the traffic means a rise in the average unit of cost for the conveyance of the remainder.  I anticipate that the new board will find many ways of achieving economies.  We know that there is scope for achieving a greater degree of technical standardisation, and for the introduction of more efficient methods.  Duplicate services can be eliminated; and there are good prospects for the development of touring services, for which there is a popular demand, not only by our own people but by tourists, with consequential intake of foreign currency.  These measures can only mature slowly and they will call for the greatest organising, managerial and technical skill, for the whole-hearted co-operation of the <Col N="898" /> staff, and for the active encouragement and goodwill of the public.</P>
    <P>The powers of the board are contained in Section 13.  These have been set out in detail and at some length, as we are anxious that the board will not be impeded in their operations by legal or technical difficulties.  The powers given to the board are wide, as they are bound to be, having regard to the extent of the tasks they are called upon to undertake.  In the present transitional period, and particularly having regard to the negotiations concerning the future of the cross-Border companies, it is difficult to foresee all contingencies.  For this reason a special provision is included under which additional powers may be conferred on the board by ministerial Order.  Such Order would require to be confirmed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I now come to the terms of compensation proposed for shareholders and stockholders of the acquired companies. As the House is aware, these were announced last May.  It is proposed that compensation shall be effected by the issue of transport stock which will be guaranteed by the State as to principal and interest.  Transport stock will be a gilt-edged investment, combining security of capital with an assured income.  The Government gave the fullest consideration to the question of compensation and at their request dealings in transport stock of the companies concerned were suspended to avoid possible speculation.  In settling the terms of exchange, the Government had regard to the claims of the stockholders on the one hand and to the rights of the community on the other.  It is not surprising, I think, that the proposals in the Bill have been criticised in some quarters as being too niggardly and in others as being over-generous.</P>
    <P>The capital of Córas Iompair Éireann comprises approximately £13,000,000 guaranteed debenture stock and £3,500,000 common stock.  The debenture stock will be exchanged for the same nominal amount of guaranteed transport stock at the same rates of interest and redeemable in the same periods as the debenture stock for <Col N="899" /> which it is substituted.  The details are set out in the White Paper which was circulated to Senators last October. The debenture holders will, therefore, be in exactly the same position as regards capital security and income as they are at present.  In dealing with the debenture stock, the Government is doing no more and no less than honouring the guarantees given to the debenture holders under existing legislation. In addition, the new board will be liable under Section 23 (4) (a) to repay the advance of £2,464,000 made to Córas Iompair Éireann (1945) for capital purposes under the Supplementary Estimate taken on the 30th November last.  It is proposed that the common stock of Córas Iompair Éireann will be converted on the basis of £80 of 3 per cent. guaranteed transport stock for every £100 of common stock.  The common stockholders will thus receive a guaranteed income equivalent to about 2½ per cent. on their present holdings at their nominal value and they will have the assurance of being able to redeem their holdings of transport stock in full in 1975-85.  This rate of compensation is based on the average of the highest and lowest of the stock exchange quotations in each month in the three years 1945-1947.</P>
    <P>The capital of the Grand Canal Company comprises £36,000 of 3 per cent. irredeemable debenture stock; £332,950 of 3 per cent. non-cumulative preference shares and £332,950 ordinary shares.  The Bill proposes to convert all these holdings, totalling £702,500 into 3 per cent. guaranteed transport stock on a £1 for £1 basis.  As far as the debenture stock is concerned, no one will, I think, question the Government's decision.  Debenture stock is in a class apart from share capital.  It is really a loan, and the holders of debenture stock are creditors with a first charge on all the assets of the undertaking.  Conversion at par merely preserves the existing loan at its nominal value.  The interest on this debenture stock has always been paid in full by the Grand Canal Company.</P>
    <P>As there are very few dealings in Grand Canal Company shares, the stock exchange quotations could not be <Col N="900" /> regarded as a reasonable basis of acquisition.  We found that the general level of market quotations for the three years 1945-47 was actually higher for the ordinary than for the preference shares.</P>
    <P>The dividend of 3 per cent. on the preference shares has been paid each year since before 1922 up to and including 1948, while the dividend on the ordinary shares has averaged almost 3 per cent. over the ten years to 31st December, 1948.  The company is in a relatively sound financial position.  In addition to its canal, it owns valuable property.  Apart altogether from revenue from the carrying trade, the company derives a substantial income from rents.  The company contended that even if they discontinued transport services they could earn dividends as a property-holding concern.  The fact remains that the Grand Canal Company is a solvent undertaking with an excellent dividend record extending over many years.  To offer the preference and ordinary shareholders of that concern compensation at less than par would, in my view, be unreasonable.  I do not believe, on the other hand, that the shareholders have any ground for complaint.  Their income will be assured and their capital position fully protected.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the existing statutory controls on charging powers will not apply to the board.  Control of railway charging powers by the State or by State-appointed tribunals dates from the last century.  When railway systems began to expand, about 100 years ago, it was deemed necessary to impose restraints in regard to rates and fares.  These were designed to secure fair play for all transport users and to ensure that the interests of the community were not prejudiced by excessive charging designed to produce exorbitant profits. In this connection, it must be remembered that at that time railways enjoyed an effective monopoly in the transport field.  Conditions to-day are different.  The large-scale development of road transport has destroyed forever the monopoly position of railway undertakings and has turned profits into losses.  The case for these restrictive <Col N="901" /> controls is, therefore, no longer so strong as it was formerly.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1922 maximum railway charges in this country were fixed by the British Board of Trade and confirmed by statute.  Legislation was enacted during the first world war empowering the appropriate Ministry to authorise from time to time increases in railway charges.  That position remained until the passage of the Railways Act, 1924.  The Railways Tribunal 1924, established the Railway Tribunal whose functions included the settlement of rates and charges&mdash;both maxima and minima&mdash;and the hearing of applications for alteration of rates. The Railway Tribunal was abolished by the Transport Act, 1944, which invested the Minister for Industry and Commerce with power to fix maximum rates and charges.  This power was never exercised in regard to road merchandise rates.  Railway companies were free to vary their charges within the statutory maxima approved by the Minister under the Act.  It is the view of this complex matter in the hands direct and business-like course is to leave this complex matter in the hands of the members of the board who, with the detailed knowledge that will be available to them and the technical advice that they can command, will be the best qualified to determine the level of charges from time to time.  My belief is that a State-owned corporation of the kind we propose in this Bill, charged with the duty of providing an essential public service, should be invested with the greatest possible degree of autonomy, both commercial and financial, to enable it to carry on its business economically and successfully and without interference in its day-to-day management.  It will be the board's duty to fix its rates and charges equitably over the various classes of traffics.  It will have to direct its energies towards a solution of that most complex of all charging problems, the determination of the relationship between rail and road rates so as to attract towards each form of transport the maximum volume of traffic of the kind for which the form is best suited and equipped.</P>
    <P>In that way only can the full benefits <Col N="902" /> of a policy of co-ordination be attained. The powers of the board in regard to charges will be conditioned and governed by factors which, in my view, are a much more potent deterrent to excessive charging than any ministerial controls such as have existed in the past.  In the first place, there will be the powerful influence of public opinion to which a State board will naturally give full attention; in the second place, there is the competition from licensed hauliers and from traders carrying their own goods which will also provide an effective independent check on the charging policies of the new undertaking.  Thirdly, there is the sensitivity of traffics to alterations in rates.  In transport operations as in other activities the point is quickly reached at which increased charges result in loss of business which can rarely, if ever, be recaptured.  Finally, there is the legislative provision which will still remain which requires the undertaking to afford all reasonable facilities for traffic, and prohibits any particular class of traffic.  This does not preclude the company from quoting special rates where there is a substantial new traffic and in fact they have cooperated in this way with a number of our new industries.</P>
    <P>The question of branch railway lines constitutes one of the most thorny of all transport problems in this country, and the difficulties are accentuated by the intense controversy which the mere mention of the problem invariably provokes. On this occasion I trust that this House, with the experience of transport developments over the last 25 years, will approach the problem dispassionately and consider whether the course proposed in the Bill is not the best in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>First, let us consider what has been the position in the past.  Before the passage of the Railways Act, 1933, railway companies were perfectly free to close down branch lines except in those cases in which the legislation under which a particular line had been constructed provided otherwise.  Between 1922 and 1933 services were discontinued in whole or in part on nine <Col N="903" /> branch lines, of which eight belonged to the Great Southern Railways Company. The Acts under which these lines were constructed did not require that they should be kept open for traffic, and the company, accordingly, exercised its rights to close them down.  The Railways Act, 1933, provided that no line could be closed down except under the authority of an Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, alternative road services to be provided, and any staff displaced to be compensated.  Fourteen such Orders were made by my predecessor in office between 1933 and 1945, of which eight relate to lines now owned by Córas Iompair Éireann.  In 1944 an Emergency Powers Order was made which authorised the temporary discontinuance of rail services in view of the fuel scarcity then prevailing. This Order will cease to have any application after the enactment of the Bill which is now before the Seanad. Services on many branch lines were suspended at varying periods during the emergency and, in the spring of 1947, during the acute fuel crisis, services on many branch lines were temporarily discontinued.  The services on a number of lines were subsequently restored but there are still a good many lines which are only open for live-stock fairs or for heavy seasonal traffic. That, then, is the general position in regard to branch lines up to the present.</P>
    <P>The only departure from existing legislation now proposed is that the responsibility for making orders authorising the closing of branch lines owned by the board will not in future lie with the Minister for Industry and Commerce but will devolve on a new Transport Tribunal to be set up under the Bill.  The Tribunal will consist of not less than three or more than five members including the chairman, all of whom will be appointed by the Government.  The provisions in relation to the tenure of office of members of the tribunal, removal from office and remuneration are similar to those applicable to members of the board.</P>
    <P>In my view, the proposals in the Bill represent a desirable change and a <Col N="904" /> considerable improvement on the present position.  It will, I think, be appreciated that a Minister must inevitably be subject to influences from which an independent tribunal of the kind proposed in the Bill will be immune. It is wholly undesirable that political considerations should affect a question which should be judged by reference only to the public interest and to the economic factors involved.</P>
    <P>The board will be precluded from terminating services for passengers or merchandise except under an order made by the tribunal.  Public notice of any proposal to close lines must be given and an opportunity afforded interested parties to submit objections to the tribunal.  If no objections are made, the tribunal will be required to make the order for which the board has applied.  If objections are received, the tribunal, after hearing the objectors and the board, may either refuse to make the order, or may make the order with any modifications which they consider necessary.  As I have already indicated, the Emergency Powers Order under which various branch line services were temporarily discontinued will cease to have effect on the enactment of this measure. Services at present suspended under the Emergency Powers Order must either be restored or the board must bring the matter before the tribunal and go through the procedure laid down in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will also be empowered to release the board from its statutory obligations to keep open for traffic, any canal or part of a canal which has not been used for public navigation for at least three years.  In that case, also, public notice will be required and interested parties will be afforded an opportunity of making representations to the tribunal.  The remaining function of the tribunal will be to advise the Minister on any transport matter which he may refer to them.</P>
    <P>The financial provisions relating to the board are dealt with in Part V of the Bill.  The board is authorised to issue transport stock for the purpose of providing money for carrying out permanent works, for the redemption of transport stock, for the acquisition <Col N="905" /> of any other transport undertaking, and for other purposes for which capital moneys are properly applicable. The aggregate stock which may be issued for any purpose of capital works and for other purposes, excluding the redemption of transport stock and the acquisition of other undertakings, is £7,000,000.  This is the figure which was suggested in the Milne Report as the further capital which would be necessary for development purposes.  The Bill provides for the guarantee by the State of all transport stock as to principal and interest.  Issues of stock, except the substituted stock, will require the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, given with the approval of the Minister for Finance.  The terms and conditions as regards interest and redemption of such issues are subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance, and it is required that annual statements of stock issues shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Bill also makes provision for the establishment of a fund for the redemption of transport stock.</P>
    <P>The board will be required to keep all proper and usual accounts, and to furnish any further accounts or information which may be required.  The audited accounts and the auditor's report will be presented to the Oireachtas. The appointment of the auditor is subject to the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The Government decision of February, 1949, regarding redundancy is implemented in Part VI.  The Bill provides that the services of permanent employees, or of temporary employees with not less than three years' continuous service, shall not be dispensed with on grounds of redundancy.  Any redundancy which may exist will be met through normal wastage.  Some cases may arise where no suitable alternative employment can be found for redundant workers, in which case provision is made for the payment of compensation. These provisions cover the case of any employee whose office may be abolished due to the amalgamation of the companies, and also provide for compensation for worsening of conditions on certain transfers.  Similiar provision is <Col N="906" /> made for employees for whom no alternative employment is available or who suffer a worsening of conditions on the closing of a railway line or the termination of canal services.  The existing superannuation schemes are being continued in the Bill and there is power to make new schemes or to revise existing ones.  The House will, I think, appreciate that the staff provisions in the Bill are quite exceptional. I think it can safely be said that never in the reorganisation of any industry have the workers received more consideration than they are receiving under this Bill.  The company, Córas Iompair Éireann is being given a new lease of life, and an opportunity of adjusting its affairs in such a way that it can be run in the future on a sound economic basis.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that the workers, given this unprecedented measure of security, will co-operate wholeheartedly in the attainment of our common objective.  The success of this nationalised undertaking is in their own interests; it also lies largely in their own hands.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the main provisions of the Bill.  The remaining provisions are, in the main, re-enactments of existing legislation which is being applied to the board.  If there are any matters which Senators wish to raise on these, I suggest that they can be discussed in Committee.</P>
    <P>I am recommending this measure to the Seanad as I recommended it to the Dáil, in the belief that it will enable an organisation to be set up which can be used to make the transport system of this country economical and efficient.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in introducing the Transport Bill of 1949, made a fairly long statement, a statement which, I think, was remarkable in that he succeeded in giving us the minimum of information with regard to the reasons which caused him to bring in the Bill. I appreciate the time he spent in drawing our attention to the various clauses in the Bill, but I think that not alone were we entitled but members of the other House were entitled, to a full and objective examination of the history, the recent history, of Irish transport, and particularly of Córas Iompair Éireann.  The Minister talked about the loss of £800,000 incurred in 1947 and left it at that.  He talked of the loss in 1948 of almost £1,500,000 and left it at that, leaving us to interpret it almost any way we liked. It seems to me from what the Minister has said&mdash;and he has said nothing here that he did not say in the Dáil; I thought that out of the discussions in the Dáil some new matters would have arisen, as certainly they did, and that he would have given us a somewhat different review of the position&mdash; that the Bill rests on two props.  One of these props is the dislike of the Minister and some of his colleagues of the board of Córas Iompair Éireann, and particularly of the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, and the other, an equally wobbly prop, in my opinion, the Milne Report.  The Minister relies specifically on that particular report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think when the Minister was introducing the Bill he should have examined the reasons why the board of Córas Iompair Éireann did not succeed in making a success of the undertaking, that is to say, did not make a success of the undertaking to the extent that we visualised and <Col N="908" /> hoped for when the 1944 Bill was before us.  The Minister, I hold, should go into these things fully&mdash;there should be no question of economy of time.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to examine this as he should, and I do not know of any matter that has come before the Dáil or Seanad since the State was established of greater importance, of greater consequence, than this question of transport, and if it took the Minister a month to introduce this Bill, I think he was bound to do that.  He has not done so.  These reasons should be given, and not alone should they be given but they should be given fully and should be given truthfully, because not alone is the economic well being of the State in question, but the characters of men who have tried to serve this country well have been assailed because of the manner in which the Bill has been introduced and the type of speech with which it has been introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator be good enough to say when the characters of the men were assailed, and by whom?</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>And by whom.  I propose to show that in the course of my remarks and I would ask the Minister to be patient.  He could force me to make certain statements immediately, but they would not be in their proper order.  I would ask him, not alone so far as I am concerned, but so far as others in the Seanad are concerned, to allow us to make our speeches in our own way.  He will have his chance to reply.  We will not have a further chance to reply.  He can make a note of these things and can refute any charges we may make, and, if apology is called for, I hope it will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the justifications for this Bill is a series of proposals made by the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  These <Col N="909" /> proposals the Minister has read out to us to-night.  Fortunately, we have them already to our hand, so that we have not got to paraphrase them, nor do we have to exert ourselves unduly in making notes of them.  These proposals are set down in column 45, Volume 118 (1) of the Official Debates, and, according to the Minister they are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Dismissal of 2,500 men by reductions in maintenance;</P>
    <P>(2)  closing down of branch lines, involving further disemployment possibly amounting to 1,000 men;</P>
    <P>(3)  increasing fares to road and rail passengers and raising freight charges on road and rail;</P>
    <P>(4)  restriction on privately operated road transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated to us that these proposals were so drastic that they caused him very grave uneasiness. In fact, they were so drastic that they stunned him.  He then went on to assert that he was presented with a table of capital schemes that could not be justified.  These I do not intend to read out because they are set out in full detail at the same reference.</P>
    <P>The next step in the Minister's case for this Bill, as I hinted a moment ago, was an attack on the competence and on the integrity of the chairman and of the board.  For this he relied on the statement of a certain gentleman. This statement appears in Volume 118 (1) at column 50.  The Minister there says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the literature relating to the affairs of this State and its public utilities, this paragraph will surely rank as a masterpiece of understatement. When one reads the detailed examination of the huge, unnecessary capital commitments entered into by the board, in the absence in nearly every case of reports and advice from the various technical officers of the company, one cannot but be struck by the restraint which has tempered the objectivity of Sir James Milne and his colleagues.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> What is the meaning of that statement? Is it not reasonable to conclude that it means, first, that the investigator did not state the truth fully?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the literature relating to the affairs of this State and its public utilities this paragraph will surely rank as a masterpiece of understatement&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>The second charge in it is that the capital commintments were unnecessary, and the third that important schemes were entered into, were undertaken and were negotiated without reports and without advice from technical officers. Now, Sir, these statements are either true or false.  They were given as reasons for the introduction of this Bill; not alone were they given as reasons for the introduction of this Bill, but they were given as grave reasons for the introduction of this Bill.  The Minister, no doubt, disliked and dislikes the chairman and the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Perhaps he has good reason for disliking the chairman, but I venture to say that this dislike of the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann is not just because the chairman and the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann have failed in their duty.  However, the next step&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was going to say that the next step in this Transport Bill was to have an investigation of the affairs of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Of course, the terms of reference are there. It might be argued that that is not the precise reference given to this committee of investigation.  Nevertheless, Sir, it is not unreasonable to say that this was an investigation into the affairs of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Outsiders, as the House will remember, were brought in.  Some of us began to think that, perhaps, now we were going to hear of these amazing scandals to which the electorate was treated up and down the country during the elections.  I thought myself, that now we were going to get something that would stun us.  I do not know why we could not have got Irish investigators to inquire into this matter.  We have very eminent accountants and we have men here who would be capable of carrying out an investigation of this kind.  However, the investigation was carried out in a most unusual style.  I wonder, Sir, would I be in order in describing it as having been carried out in the best pip-squeak style.  The men who were to be pilloried were not to be asked to explain their actions, they were not to be asked to explain their conduct, and they were not to be allowed to answer whatever charges might be levelled against them.  One paragraph appears in this document, the Milne Report.  I think it is a pity that it was not placed at the head of the report.  It is paragraph 497 on page 71 of the report. It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No discussion of the changes in policy and organisation proposed in this report has taken place with the board of directors or officers of the company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I looked forward to the Milne Report with great interest.  I was interested in it from an academic point of view, but I was also interested in it in a national way.  There are good things in that report, valuable things in that report, but there are things in it which are not accurate, and there are things that are ridiculous, to say the least of it.  I know that the Minister paid a <Col N="913" /> very glowing tribute to the authors of this report.  His tribute, I think, is worth mentioning.  It occurs in column 46 of Volume 1, No. 118:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We were extremely fortunate in securing the services of one of the greatest experts in road and rail administration.  Sir James Milne is an Irishman who, in a career of high attainments, had attained the position of general manager of the Great Western Railway in England in 1929 and held that position until the railway was nationalised...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not mind paying a tribute to Sir James Milne.  I do not mind paying a tribute to the other investigators, all of whom were a former this or a former that or the other.  One was a former vice-president of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company, another a former general manager and, for a time, director of the Hayes Wharf Cartage group, and so on, and these men were former members of some body associated with British transport.  This report is their product and the Minister tells us that they influenced him very much.  But I wonder why they did not make a success of the British railways which, in due course, failed to such a considerable extent that they had eventually to be nationalised.</P>
    <P>I am glad Sir James Milne is the great authority on transport that the Minister says and I am glad he is Irish.  I hope he is so Irish that he insisted on his Irish republican citizenship when the test came.  I wish him long life to enjoy his pensions and I wish him success in whatever other investigations he may undertake, but may I express this hope, Sir, that when he undertakes investigations again when he meets gentlemen he will know how to treat them as gentlemen, that when he comes to inquire into the affairs of responsible citizens, that at least he will understand that it is his duty to consult with these people and before his report is issued to ask them if they have any comment to make, and that he will attend to that comment?</P>
    <P>The Minister thanked Sir James Milne for the work that was done and for such a comprehensive report.  By <Col N="914" /> all means let him thank him, but, as far as I am concerned, I fail to see what great work has been done for which they should be thanked, and I fail to see where the comprehensive report is.  This Bill by its title is directed towards a solution of the Irish transport problem.  There is a problem, we know.  It has been there for a long time, but from his statement we know that the Minister has not told us in precise terms what the problem is, unless, as I have indicated, it is to get rid of the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann and of the board.  Is there a problem apart from that?  If there is, why did the Minister not state it?  That is my big quarrel with the Minister.  Why did he not indicate it?  Why did he not indicate to us how he visualises it? Or how he visualises it may be solved? The Minister is no fool.  He is one of the gentlemen who had a plan for everything.  He could reduce taxation by millions.  He could solve the emigration problem overnight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He had a plan for the repatriation of sterling assets, and a plan for bigger and better transport services and for cheaper transport services.  He reminded us to-night that there is a lot of nonsense talked about cheaper transport services. I wonder when did he discover that?  Am I unreasonable, or are my colleagues unreasonable, in asking that the Minister should have given us more complete and sound reasons for the introduction of this Bill than he has given?  Are we unreasonable in expecting that he would have spent some time in a consideration before us of the transport problem?  Are we unreasonable in having expected of him that he would have given us the Government views and his own views on the problem and how it might be overcome?  There is a problem, but the Minister has not faced up to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not go into the history of Irish railways.  There are some volumes on the matter that Senators would <Col N="915" /> have done well to look into.  The story of Irish railways is a very depressing one.  They were planned in the 19th century.  Commissions, many commissions, were appointed to investigate them.  Time and time again, as a result of the deliberations of these commissions, appeals were made for State assistance.  On occasions appeals were made to the State to take them over.  The Minister has indicated that the aim of the railways in the past was to make profits and pay dividends. Whether that was wrong or otherwise we will not discuss now.  The railways did pay a dividend over a considerable period, notwithstanding all their difficulties.  Some of the dividends paid in the post-World War I years were, I think, paid out of a special compensation that was paid to the Irish railways for the use made by the British Government of these railways during the war period or in part of the war period.  The payment of these dividends clearly conceals the difficulties that were developing in Irish railways.  I do not think it unreasonable to have expected the Minister to have examined that for us, to have indicated that this is not a problem of 1947 or 1948, that this is not a problem, the failure to solve which can properly be laid, as it has been laid, at the door of the ex-chairman and the present Board of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>After World War I the difficulty was accentuated.  About 1928, the motor was established as a transport competitor. What I mean to convey is that the motor made its appearance on a large scale.  War research and war development led to that.  Demobilisation and the payment of gratuities added to the problem of the railways.  Discharged soldiers used their gratuities to buy lorries.  I think that on occasions the British Government facilitated the soldiers by giving them old army lorries in lieu of gratuities. We had then the extraordinary expansion in hire purchase business, which made it easy for people to get lorries and motors generally. Senators will remember, especially here in Dublin, the phenomonal rise in road transport in the years between <Col N="916" /> 1928 and 1933.  Senators will remember the extraordinary growth of one particular company, a particular omnibus company in and around Dublin.</P>
    <P>One man stands out among all those engaged in transport at that time&mdash; whether it was rail transport, tramways or road transport.  This man was one of the directors of this Dublin bus company.  He was its driving force. He was imaginative.  He was a trained professional accountant.  I remember the time well.  The general statement in this city regarding that man was that he had transport in his blood.  I remember many businessmen say that he was a man of great character, a tremendous worker, industrious, progressive, kind and considerate.  Above all, young and old, when they spoke of that man, said: &ldquo;He is as straight as a die.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Dublin tramways company ran into difficulties.  Men long experienced in transport recognised the ability, the character and the worth of this man. I think I am quite in order in mentioning his name.  He was none other than A. P. Reynolds, the target of one of the filthiest campaigns that has ever been waged by Christians against another man.  I do not think that anything is filthier than a campaign to injure the character of another.  Men well trained in transport sought the services of Mr. Reynolds.  He joined the Dublin Transport Company. Dublin people in particular will remember the success he made of the city's transport.  Stockholders were rewarded and felt happy and I think I am right in saying, notwithstanding the charge that was made against him in this House not very long ago, that the workers of Dublin had reason to thank him for what he did for them.  He improved conditions of employment and secured advantages in service for them.</P>
    <P>Mr. Reynolds in due course was invited to join the Great Southern Railways Company.  When he joined that company, what did he inherit? If we knew what Mr. Reynolds inherited we would know the transport problem.  In the first place, I think it will be agreed that the layout of Irish railways is defective.  They were <Col N="917" /> planned, they were visualised, at a time when there was a substantial population in the country and when there were hopes that the population decline would be arrested.</P>
    <P>The railways have had to face that problem of a declining population. They had to face the problem of declining trade; in other words, a decline in the density of traffic.  Mr. Reynolds had to contend with the neglect of capital equipment over a long, long time, dating since World War No. 1, dating from the time that the British Government took over those railways. He had to contend with the fact that much of the gear, much of the plant, much of the stock of the railways was obsolete.  It is admitted on all sides that for absence of standardisation in gear it would be hard to find an equal of the Irish railway service.  Traffic was never very dense here, but it was becoming less so with the passing of the years.  What traffic there was when Mr. Reynolds came to the helm, much of it was being filched from it through the operations of other undertakings. Time and again, railway authorities&mdash; the chairman of the Great Northern Railway, Lord Glenavy; the chairman and stockholders of the Great Southern Railways&mdash;referred to the fact that the cream of the traffic was being taken from the railways and was going on to the roads, leaving the railways with nothing more than the skim.</P>
    <P>Following on a committee of inquiry established in 1938, it was realised that a further effort would have to be made to save the railways and to solve the transport problem.  I think that it was this report&mdash;though I am not sure&mdash;that eventually led to the 1944 Transport Act under which Córas Iompair Éireann, the subject of this Bill, was founded.</P>
    <P>The next aspect of the problem developed as a consequence of the war. The problems arising out of the war were, among other things, the scarcity of fuel, the scarcity of oil, the scarcity of stores of all kinds, the inability to get essential repairs done, the lack of a heavy industry in the country capable of meeting the requirements of an organisation like Córas Iompair Éireann.  Added to this was the corollary&mdash;rising costs of all kinds, not <Col N="918" /> excluding wages.  On top of that, we had again a period of declining traffics. These were the difficulties that Mr. Reynolds had to face.  These constitute the problem of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>Again, let me stress, my quarrel with the Minister is that he should have been more frank with both Houses and should have brought to the notice of the Oireachtas and of the country the existence of these difficulties, difficulties that any man, no matter who he might be, or any board, no matter how constituted, would have to contend with, and the utter impossibility, in the circumstances in which we were placed, of surmounting those difficulties to the extent that we could have retrieved the fortunes of Córas Iompair Éireann in the way that we visualised at one time that they would be retrieved.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that suggestions were made that if we took certain action many of the scarcities from which we were suffering would cease. Some of the Minister's friends, indeed, advised us that we should take these steps.  The scarcities might be eased, I do not know, but they might be eased if we paid the price.  The Minister's memory is as long as mine and he will hardly dispute this, whatever he may say about other things, that some of his colleagues advised us and did their level best to get us to pay that price. That price would have been the abandonment of our neutrality, a price that the Irish people would not pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In 1945, we got the Transport Act and Córas Iompair Éireann.  The experience of the previous 20 years undoubtedly influenced the provisions of that Act.  I have no doubt that the experience of the management of the railways between the war years 1939 and 1944 must have considerably influenced the framers of that Act.  I remember that Section 10 (1) (b) of that Act gave me particular satisfaction&mdash;the Minister probably remembers it&mdash;where we authorised Córas Iompair Éireann to engage in certain activities ancillary to transport, one of the provisions that the Minister has thought fit to delete but one that I hope he will see his way to alter.  A slight alteration would make an enormous difference.</P>
      <P>This Bill of 1949 was designed to replace the 1944 legislation.  May I ask whether Córas Iompair Éireann failed to achieve what was expected of it?  If we leave out the difficulties with which Córas Iompair Éireann had to contend we have to concede that it did fail.  If we take these difficulties into account, then neither the 1944 legislation nor the chairman nor the company can be charged with having failed.</P>
      <P>It has been said that the company was bankrupt when the present Minister took over.  &ldquo;We have a company that is insolvent,&rdquo; said a certain Deputy, with, I presume, the Minister's approval.  Was the company insolvent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator sees any considerable difference, let him choose the term that suits him.  I do not think Sir James Milne would agree because Sir James Milne indicated that Córas Iompair Éireann out of its own resources was in a position to raise something like £3,500,000 for capital purposes.  If that is an indication of insolvency, I do not accept it.  If the company had run into somewhat greater difficulties than it should have run into, then I make this charge, that it did so because of the action of the <Col N="920" /> Minister in preventing it taking the normal reasonable steps that it should have been allowed to take to raise the revenue that was required to enable it to meet immediate commitments. Nevertheless, in 1945-1946, the company held firm.  The Milne Report deals extensively with the organisation.  I do not intend to discuss that.  I say there is much in that portion of the report that is valuable but I think it is true that reorganisation was tackled in Córas Iompair Éireann.  Not as much was done as we would like but about as much was done as could be done in all the circumstances, whether that applies to the filling of higher posts in the service or to other matters.</P>
      <P>Taking things by and large, there was always the hope that things would soon ease, that supplies would ease, that prices would stabilise and that before very long the company would be able to get its programme of reorganisation under way.  As we all know, 1947 proved a very exceptional year.  Difficulties arose in that year that were far beyond the power of the chairman or of the board to control or to influence.  In all fairness, in all equity, the Minister in dealing with that year, which showed the first great loss in Córas Iompair Éireann, should have been a little bit more frank and should have faced up to the difficulties with which the company had to contend.  We know that because of the shortage of fuel the railways were ineffective for in or about three months of that year.  We know that a long bus strike took place during that year.  We know that a phenomenal rise in wages took place in that year, a rise which, as the figures will show, was greater than the loss incurred by the company for the whole year.  We know, we admit, that Córas Iompair Éireann did not solve the transport problem, although we have to admit also that the main aspect of the problem that has not been solved is that of the railways.  This is a problem mainly of revenue.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest that this is a case where the Senator would be better advised to help himself first?  What are the sources of the company's revenue?  I think that the Minister should have adverted to these matters.  There is no use in his coming in here and saying: &ldquo;This is a matter for the new board, I am not competent to deal with that.&rdquo;  We know that the Minister, any Minister in any country, must rely a good deal on the higher officials of his Department for information, for analysis and for guidance.  I do not think there is any Civil Service in the world as competent as the Irish Civil Service and, I think, if the Minister had wanted it, his advisers would have examined for him, would have helped him to see these problems and analyse them in their presentation to the Oireachtas and the people of the country in order that they might understand fully what was the cause of the trouble.</P>

      <P>I am suggesting that the Minister has not discussed certain matters for us as the highest authority responsible for industry and commerce, including transport, in the State.  What are the sources of the company's revenue?  From the railway: passengers, fares, freight; from road transport: again passengers and freight; catering: hotels, dining-cars and so on; miscellaneous receipts: rents, transfer fees and so on, an item that is insignificant.  The position is that the road services are paying; the passenger services are paying; the freight services are paying, although they are not paying on a very great scale.  From the financial returns we know also that the catering business undertaken by the company has paid and the railway alone remains a loser. The point then is: what is to be done about the railways?  Does the Minister see what factors will bring about a favourable change in their regard? Can he suggest what might be done? My quarrel with the Minister is that I am not prepared to accept from him the statement that these are matters for the board.  These are all matters <Col N="922" /> of policy, matters for which his Department is properly responsible, matters on which we should be given information, matters on which we should be given his ideas, matters on which he should indicate to us the steps to be taken and the lines to be followed to bring about a solution of that problem, the problem of the railways.</P>

      <P>Let me say that I have come to the stage where I and everybody else should completely ignore Senator Baxter.  If he cannot restrain himself while other people are speaking the least he might do is to withdraw from the Chamber.  Various courses would be open, for instance to reduce railway charges and so attract traffic.  What would be the consequence of that?  It is not enough for the Minister to say that the matter of freight adjustment is a very delicate one.  We did not want Sir James Milne to tell us that; we did not want the Minister to tell us that; we know that for a long, long time.  There are mountains of books on railway economics and every one of them stresses that particular difficulty.  Does the Minister visualise how adjustments might be made or is he up against a stone wall? We might increase charges for freight. What would be the consequence of this?  The more he examines it the more he will come up against the difficulty. I would not have blamed him if, having examined and analysed the problem, he said &ldquo;You can see now how difficult it is&rdquo;, but to have presented the case to us as he did and leave the impression that this was all a matter of mishandling of the transport company by the ex-chairman and the board is, I hold, grossly unfair. Does he see a possibility of increasing the total volume of traffic in any way by which the railways would be assured of a fair share of that traffic?  It might be done in two ways.  There might be a considerable expansion of industry with sufficient going to the railways to enable them to pay, or he might have to face up to the issue of whether it would not be advisable further to control the activities of private carriers.  I am not saying that he should do it.</P>

      <P>I hope to present the Minister with something positive before long, but I am pointing out that it was his duty to have faced these issues and discussed them with us.  If he were sincere, no matter what the consequences, he would have undertaken an examination of these issues and when he had finished that examination even if he had to say: &ldquo;You see my difficulty, we have no solution at the moment&rdquo;, we would have been patient, and one result that would have emerged is that people who have been grievously injured would have got something like a fair crack of the whip. There are other factors which I might mention but I do not think I need delay much longer on them.  I am sorry that time is going but I do not intend to rush.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further aspect of the problem that the Minister might have considered was the possibility of having permanently to pay a subsidy to the railways.  If he had examined the problem, all these matters would have come before him. He would have seen all these matters, and he would, if he were fair to the Dáil, and if he were fair to the Seanad, have discussed them for us, and indicated to us his views on them.  What is the charge against Córas Iompair Éireann?  What is the charge against Mr. Reynolds and the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann?  The charge is no more than this, that they faced up to the problems, and they had the courage to tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce what they considered to be the difficulty, and they had the courage to make certain proposals to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and in the state of legislation, and in all fairness, it was the duty of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have examined these proposals, one by one, to explain why they should not be allowed to go on with them, or why they should be allowed to go on with their proposals.  However, the Minister brought in a body of experts to advise him.  You will remember that Córas Iompair Éireann shocked him.  How did some of the Milne recommendations <Col N="924" /> affect him?  He does not seem to have become upset at all.  Córas Iompair Éireann, he says, proposed the reduction in staff.  It was a frightful thing. Might I say this, Sir, that I would have enough confidence in the Fianna Fáil Government, if it were in power, and the proposal was made for a reduction in staff, that they would have examined calmly that proposal, and if they felt that there should be a reduction in staff they would have faced the issue, and they would have taken their medicine?</P>

      <P>I will make this statement, that if the proposal had come before Deputy Seán Lemass, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, that 3,500 men should have been sent away, I am certain that he would have refused to agree to it.  He would have found a means whereby every man if he had to go would have been adequately compensated or suitable alternative employment would have been found for him.  But what did Sir James Milne&mdash;this great expert on whom the Minister for Industry and Commerce relied&mdash;suggest?  In paragraph 449 Sir James Milne has this to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The progressive increase in staff establishment since 1945 requires close investigation, as it is one of the contributing factors which has led to the company's present financial difficulties.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Would it be unfair if I paraphrased that to say that Sir James Milne suggested that there should be a reduction in staff?  But, in case I do him an injustice, paragraph 450 goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The principal increases in the staff establishments are the subject of comment as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) Drivers, Firemen and Cleaners.  The staff employed is excessive in relation to the engine hours worked and the increase <Col N="925" /> since 1945 does not appear to have been justified.  It is understood that staff not immediately required have been retained pending decision as to the future scope of railway operations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say in Section B:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There has been an increase of staff in all traffic grades, particularly those of goods porters and checker. Since traffic has not increased and services have not been expanded, these additions to the staff do not appear to have been warranted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to deal with road freight staff and he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Vehicles licensed in 1948 were 42 per cent. more than in 1945, which explains the increase in drivers. There were more trailers in use in 1948, accounting for the relatively larger increase in the number of helpers.  The proposed reduction in the fleet of vehicles should enable a considerable reduction in staff to be effected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 451 also deals with the reduction in staff.  The Seanad will note that Córas Iompair Éireann had made a proposal that would have involved a reduction in staff.  The Minister has estimated for us what the number is, but there is a difference between it and what the Milne Report suggests; just this difference: the Milne Report has not indicated what the reduction should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we have another paragraph which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;After making every allowance for the factors enumerated, there is clearly scope for staff economies.  An over-all reduction of at least 5 per cent. in staff establishment should be possible, which would produce a saving of more than £300,000 per annum.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sir James Milne does not say approximately, but &ldquo;more than £300,000 per annum.&rdquo;  Statisticians are not used to framing their conclusions in terms as <Col N="926" /> loose as this.  He should have indicated to us £300,000, plus some little margin for error one way or the other, but merely to leave it at &ldquo;more than £300,000&rdquo; is hardly fair to us.  In paragraph 452, you will remember the relevancy of all this.  Córas Iompair Éireann frightened the Minister almost to death when it suggested a reduction in staff, but Sir James Milne has been offered the thanks of the Minister for suggesting the same thing.  In paragraph 452 he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is suggested that the co-operation of the unions should be sought in a detailed review with the object of reducing staff to the level required for efficient operation.  Such a reduction is as much in the interest of the staff as of the management, as, if the company is handicapped by an excessive establishment, it cannot hope to maintain the high standard of wages or to meet effectively the competition of the trader using his own vehicle.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Supposing there were 10,000, that is not the point.  That they should suggest a reduction in staff caused him worry, anxiety, and angered him.  Sir James Milne does the same thing, but Sir James Milne gets thanks for it.  The Minister said one of the reasons why he brought in this Bill was that Córas Iompair Éireann recommended the closing of branch lines.  On <Col N="927" /> page 43 of this report, there is a comment by Sir James Milne that I might mention; page 43, paragraph 229:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is understood that there is a considerable number of stations and lines which are so situated that they do not afford ready access to the local inhabitants whose needs could be better served by a road service to some other station.  Clearly, if this be so, there can be no justification <Col N="928" /> for the retention of such stations and lines, and they should be closed.&rdquo;</P>
