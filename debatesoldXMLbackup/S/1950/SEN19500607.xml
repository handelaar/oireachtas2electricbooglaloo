      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to secure that the necessary water storage will be provided so that the Electricity Supply Board can proceed with the full development of the Erne hydro-electric scheme.  It is proposed to authorise the board to make an agreement with the Ministry of Finance, Northern Ireland, in the terms of the draft scheduled to the Bill and to make any supplemental agreement or agreements that may be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Electricity Supply Board have been proceeding for some time past with the partial development works on the Erne. The Erne hydro-electric scheme was <Col N="210" /> approved in 1945 by an Order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act of 1945.  The scheme approved by this Order covered the first stage of development.  It entailed the construction in County Donegal of two reservoirs and two power stations and, while in itself the scheme was complete for the first stage of development, allowance was made for the extension which will be practicale under the agreement in the schedule.</P>
    <P>These works in County Donegal which have been initiated and are in progress are estimated to cost a total of £4,346,000, of which £3,100,000 will be required for the civil construction works (including compensation) and £1,246,000 will be required for mechanical and electrical plant.  As already stated, there are two power stations under construction: one known as the Cliff Station and the other known as the Cathaleen's Falls Station.  The first stage of development at the Cliff Station will provide a 10,000 kw. generating set and it is expected that power will be available from this set in three or four months.  At Cathaleen's Falls the first stage will give two sets each of 22,000 kw. capacity and power is expected to be available from the first of these sets by the mid-summer of 1951 and from the second set by the end of 1951.  In a year of average rainfall these three sets, at the completion of the stage of partial development, will provide an annual output of electricity amounting to about 150 million units.</P>
    <P>The partial scheme to which reference has been made is known as a &ldquo;run of the river&rdquo; development, that is to say, it utilises the uncontrolled flow of the river as it arrives, naturally, from Upper and Lower Loughs Erne.  With an uncontrolled flow there is excessive wastage of water during times of flood and, if the maximum development is be obtained, the flood waters must be controlled and conserved for use in generating power during periods of low flow.  Storage must be provided and for this purpose certain works will be undertaken in County Fermanagh and on the Border.  These works are described in the draft agreement; they <Col N="211" /> include the removal of existing sluices on the River Erne at Belleek so that the levels of the loughs may be controlled from sluices incorporated in the board's dam at Cliff Station; the deepening of the River Erne from Belleek up to its outlet from Lower Lough Erne, i.e., over a distance of about four miles; the construction of sluices across the River Erne, just down-stream from Enniskillen, to prevent the level of Upper Lough Erne falling below a water level of 150 ft. O.D.; the construction of a new road bridge over the River Erne at Belleek, and removal of the existing bridge, as the river will have to be widened at this site.  All these works are in County Fermanagh except those connected with the removal of the sluices and the road bridge at Belleek, which are partly in County Fermanagh and partly in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>To achieve the advantages of the full development scheme, co-operation between the Electricity Supply Board and the Ministry of Finance of Northern Ireland will be necessary in the execution of the works and in the control of the water levels of the loughs.  Negotiations for the purpose of reaching agreement on the many issues, technical and otherwise, which arose were conducted between the interested parties and I am glad to say that they were conducted in a most co-operative spirit and a result has been achieved, of which the agreement in the schedule is the outcome.  I must pay tribute to all those concerned on both side who contributed towards this highly satisfactory conclusion and I am sure that the House will wish to join in that tribute.  A complementary measure has been introduced in the Northern Parliament so that legislative authority to execute the agreement will be obtained on both sides.</P>
    <P>The works which will be carried out under the agreement by the Northern Ministry of Finance will ensure the efficient working of the three generating sets being constructed in the first stage of development.  Without these works, the production of power would be somewhat intermittent and continuity of output could only be <Col N="212" /> obtained by the erection of an auxiliary steam plant.  The Fermanagh works will not only ensure continuity of supply but will increase by one-third the number of units which can be generated in the three sets now being constructed and will, in addition, enable a second generating set of 10,000 k.w. capacity to be installed at the Cliff station.  The total capacity of the Erne station at the completion of the full development will be 230 million units.  The total cost to the Electricity Supply Board of the full development is estimated at £6,346,000 or £2,000,000 more than the figure I have already given as the cost of partial development.  The extra sum of £2,000,000 includes provision for a payment of £750,000 which it is estimated will have to be made by the Electricity Supply Board to the Northern Ministry of Finance in respect of the works to be executed under the agreement.</P>
    <P>The additional output of electricity amounting to 230 million units a year from the Erne scheme will make a substantial contribution to the ever-growing demand which it is anticipated will continue for some years. The number of units of electricity sold by the board in 1938 was 244 millions, in 1941 was 345 millions, in 1946 was 379 millions, and in 1948, 492 millions. Last year it had gone up to 569 millions.  The Electricity Supply Board have estimated that by the year 1955 the demand for supply will be of the order of 1,400 million units a year.  By that time it is anticipated that the generating capacity of the stations now in production and the new stations, steam and hydro, under construction or in contemplation, will be of the order of 1,354 million units.</P>
    <P>From our point of view the measure before the House has no significant drainage interest.  Under the Bill the drainage board is to be dissolved.  The Drainage and Improvement of Lands (Ireland) Act, 1863, was the authority for the constitution of the Lough and River Erne drainage district and until the summer of 1940 the district was managed by a drainage board elected annually by the owners of the improved lands as provided in the Act. An important function of the board was <Col N="213" /> to operate the sluice gates at Belleek in a manner that would maintain the upper and lower lakes at the levels established under the final award made by the Commissioners of Public Works in 1891.  The drainage board resigned in June, 1940, and has not functioned since then, but in March, 1941, an arrangement was arrived at between the Commissioners of Public Works and the Northern Ministry of Finance under which the sluices are being operated under the joint control of their respective engineers.  The cost is shared by the commissioners and the Ministry in proportion to the annual value of the benefit derived from the original scheme by the lands on each side of the Border.  Our share of the cost is one-eighth and provision for the sum required, which in the current year is £73, is made in the Public Works and Buildings Vote.  The existing arrangement for the joint control of the Belleek sluices will be continued under Section 8 of the Bill until the present sluices are removed and the new system of control comes into operation under the terms of the draft agreement.  The works which will be carried out to provide the extra water storage under the Erne hydro-electric scheme, including the improvement of the outfall channel from the lower lake between Roscor and Belleek will, it is expected, relieve from ordinary summer and harvest flooding the area served by the original drainage and navigation scheme.</P>
    <P>The draft agreement in the Schedule to the Bill is largely of a technical character and deals with the works which I have already described, the method of controlling the water levels, financial matters arising from the construction of the works, arbitration, and some minor matters.  It is proposed that the Ministry of Finance.  Belfast, shall act as agent for the Electricity Supply Board in carrying out the works in County Fermanagh and shall seek the necessary legislative authority from the Northern Parliament for interference with property resulting from the works and for the periodic variation of the levels of the loughs and other necessary consequential purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>All who read the debate on this matter in the other House can anticipate that the debate in this House will be what we all welcome here, a non-controversial debate. In the other House, the various Parties to this agreement were congratulated and I hope the same thing will happen here.  I think this is a very creditable performance that in a matter of this kind agreement can be got on both sides of the Border and it just goes to show that if we could finally convince the people on the other side of the Border&mdash;convince, in other words, the minority&mdash;that their best interests would be served by co-operation with the majority on this side of the Border, I believe we could get over the one outstanding obstacle to the complete independence of the country, that is, the Border.</P>
      <P>While congratulating the people on both sides in arriving at this understanding, I do not think anybody will accuse me of being over generous when I say that congratulations should also be included for this agreement for the man who initiated this business as far back as 1945, that is, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Seán Lemass.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is any harm to give credit where credit is due and there is another group of people who I think ought to be congratulated&mdash;it is very seldom that they get any pats on the back&mdash;the staff and general personnel of the Electricity Supply Board.  I think it is only right that these people from the top down to the ordinary workers should be congratulated and given credit because, human nature being what it is, most of us like to get a little credit when we feel we are entitled to it&mdash;some of us try to get credit for things that we had nothing to do with at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the scheme will do a lot of good to both sides of the Border and to the country as a whole.  When the scheme is in effective operation in the years ahead people on both sides looking back will say &ldquo;Was it not a pity that we did not co-operate with our fellow countrymen at that time and go the whole way.&rdquo;  What could be done in a small matter such as is dealt <Col N="215" /> with in the Bill could also be done in bigger matters if the people concerned could only be big enough and realise it was for the common good.</P>
    <P>I believe that the actual scheme will serve a very useful purpose.  There is a growing demand for electricity all over the country.  Particularly in the rural areas people are clamouring for electric current and in the provincial towns also it will supply a long felt need.  Anything which works towards the development of our natural resources is a good project.  The alternative to the development of our natural electricity supply is to be to a great extent dependent on outside supplies for power.  In the past even in some of our big power stations we continued to use imported materials, imported coal, imported crude oil, imported petrol and things of that kind.  It is quite evident to anybody looking at the situation as it exists that in case of a serious emergency the only sensible policy for any country placed as ours is is to depend on its own resources.  I believe that this is a very valuable contribution towards the development of our resources.  If this policy continues as it has done in the past we will find ourselves in years to come&mdash;and not too many years ahead &mdash;when we will be as independent as it is possible to make us of outside supplies in case of emergency.</P>
    <P>Some people are inclined to underestimate the importance of a scheme such as this; they believe that it is merely for the benefit of big cities. That, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, is not quite so.  Just as the Poulaphouca scheme has been an advantage, so also will this and any future scheme be an addition to the general pool of electric current in the country.  I believe that it will go a long way towards solving many of our problems not the least of which is the flight from our land.  Travelling through the country as I have done consistently over a number of years I am quite convinced that the flight from the land about which we hear so much can and will be considerably checked by the advance of electricity into the rural areas.  I remember a <Col N="216" /> good many of years ago when speaking on this subject in this House I said that electric light in the farmer's yard would make all the difference in the world.  I think a good few people at that time thought I was talking nonsense but I am more convinced than ever that electricity on the farm is of the utmost importance not alone from the economic point of view such as the development of machinery but that it will go a long way towards getting people more settled on the farms. It will not alone benefit the men who will be working machinery outside for grinding and sawing and so on but the women in their own houses will have the things which make life a little easier for the people in the cities.</P>
    <P>I think that a Bill of this kind should have the support of all sections in the House and we on this side will do everything we can to speed it through.  We will let the Parliamentary Secretary have as many stages as he wants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my friend Senator Quirke that this Bill is a matter of very great importance and represents a great step forward.  It is, as he has pointed out, an example of unity of view and continuity of purpose between different Governments here.  The first stages of the Erne drainage and development scheme and co-operation between our Electricity Supply Board and the northern Ministry were undertaken by the last Government under the last Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Seán Lemass.  It has shown as I said that there is considerable unity of view and continuity of purpose between Governments here and that that unity can be extended for economic reasons not only between Governments in this State but between Governments on this and the other side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I recall that and give due credit I am bound to recall also that when the present Minister for Finance made one of the most remarkable speeches ever made in the Dáil introducing the first Electricity Bill some 25 years ago that particular measure was then opposed very vigorously by a <Col N="217" /> great variety of people.  Some of the opposition was well intentioned; some was merely stupid; a great deal arose from political malice, but the events that have taken place since that first introduction 25 years ago have proved that the authors of the Shannon scheme were right.  Not alone were they right from the point of view of the Twenty-Six Counties but they builded better than they knew, and made a sure foundation and were right from the point of view of the whole 32 counties.  In dealing with this scheme and with this particular Bill and its vital and extreme importance the name of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. McGilligan, should be mentioned.  By a happy coincidence it has been introduced here and in the other House by a Parliamentary Secretary whose father, Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, was the then Head of the Government and Mr. McGilligan's leader.</P>
    <P>The Shannon scheme had the effect also that apart from its actual work it made this State and the whole of Ireland electricity-minded, which is a very important aspect of that type of work. It aimed at producing 130 million units annually and the Parliamentary Secretary has told us that that will be increased nearly ten-fold by 1955 so what Senator Quirke said was absolutely true: when you give people electricity and give them a taste for it the taste grows and consumption increases.</P>
    <P>Remembering the speeches on the Shannon scheme, I read some of the leading articles in Belfast on this matter and I must say that I found them most interesting.  The <i>Northern Whig</i> on the 17th May said that this particular measure was an example of eminent commonsense by both Governments. I think one could add, an example of eminent commonsense by both Parliaments.  It proves also&mdash;even if it was as one newspaper in Belfast put it, merely from enlightened self-interest&mdash;that Irishmen can meet together, face problems and deal with complicated details without a hitch.</P>
    <P>As we are on that, I would like to add my views to what the Parliamentary Secretary and Senator Quirke have said by way of compliment to the <Col N="218" /> staffs of the Electricity Supply Board, who conducted those very delicate negotiations, very delicate and very detailed negotiations over the last five years.  From what one can hear, and from what one sees in the Bill, and sees in the debates in the Parliament in Belfast, the officials on the other side of the Border representing the Northern Government were, apparently equally co-operative.  It should be said, also, as has been said in Belfast, that this measure is only a beginning.  A complete inter-connection of the net-work of the Electricity Supply Board, and the net-work in Northern Ireland would mean the solution of a great many rural electrification problems, on both sides of the Border.  There can be no economic supply for Donegal, I think, except through Derry and, I understand, that the supply would be given to Derry from a station on this side of the Border.  There has been a statement, that further co-operation and further negotiations will be necessary.  Our electricity relies, in the main, upon native sources, either water, in the main, or else peat.  We shall have plenty of electricity in the winter when, perhaps, coal is scarce in the North.  On the other hand, in the summer, when we may be short, we can get a supply from the North from their ordinary fuel stations. The Minister for Finance, Major Sinclair, in Northern Ireland, said that the Bill held out promise of a substantial measure of solution of a problem that was more than a century old, namely, the problem of the drainage of the River Erne.  He indicated that Northern Ireland is spending £340,000, which would be thrown away, and useless, and would bear no fruit at all, except for the existence of our hydro-electric undertaking to co-operate with that drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>The <i>Northern Whig</i> spoke of the co-operative spirit in which this matter had been carried out, and said that that co-operative spirit was laudable, and can be pursued without yielding any principles on either side about Irish unity.  One will be inclined to agree.  There is no use in reading into this Bill, despite the co-operation <Col N="219" /> that has preceded it, and which we hope will continue, something which, in fact, is not there.  Wishful thinking is attractive, but it is a rather unprofitable business.  It is, at the same time, true that knowledge gained by individuals through personal contacts is always good, and will always act as a solvent to prejudice, misunderstanding, and hatred.  We ourselves know that that is so, in political matters and in our own political operations. Where enlightened self-interest comes in, personal contacts of that kind are the surest method of breaking down barriers of feeling and misunderstanding. Such personal contacts, having such negotiations upon matters on which we are in agreement, where our interests coincide, seem to me to be more profitable than long range oratorical artillery and impassioned speeches which often seem to be directed at the wrong target.  I would like to say, in conclusion, that the Parliamentary Secretary has had the privilege of bringing in a very important measure, one which shows a beginning. May I quote&mdash;it may seem strange, but as people have been creating precedents, perhaps, we ought to keep on creating them&mdash;I do not know if the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> has been quoted with approbation, ever, in this House or the other House since 1922.  In a leading article of May 17th it stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As an example of co-operation it is admirable, and should have fruitful consequences.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The leading article goes on to praise the scheme, and to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing that has been said should distract our attention from the scheme itself and the opportunities it affords to both sides for continued co-operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, we should remember, that continued co-operation will take place, and that it will take place on a hardheaded business basis of enlightened self-interest, on the basis that we seek for the things we agree upon, rather than the things we do not agree upon. <Col N="220" /> If it does, we will be doing excellent work for all Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the previous speakers in congratulating all those who have been responsible for the agreement which is before us in this Bill.  I think it is one of the most hopeful things that has happened in quite a long time, and I believe, personally, that it has done more towards bringing about an eventual agreement between North and South than, as Senator Hayes has pointed out, all those speeches and newspaper articles that we see and hear from time to time.  Indeed, I believe, that as far as a solution of our national problem is concerned the speech-makers, at least some of them, in any case, and those who write the leading articles in the political newspapers are doing more harm than good. I hope to see this spirit of co-operation extended into other fields.  This country is too small really to work economically in two water-tight compartments, two divisions&mdash;North and South.  There are many fields in which this co-operation can be made effective; for instance, transport, and by the way, I think it was significant that only a few days ago, the Manager of the Great Northern Railway was also appointed Manager of Córas Iompair Éireann.  That is bound, in itself, to make for co-operation in our transport system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That, as Senator Baxter says, is of great importance also.  Then, there is the field of sport, and many other activities, in which this co-operation can be made effective. As far as the Bill before us is concerned, there is very little to be said, except to commend it to the House.  I agree, with Senator Quirke and Senator Hayes, that we should really be proud that this agreement has been made and we should congratulate all those who are concerned in bringing the agreement about.  There is nothing much to be said, except to give the measure before the House our blessing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisIreland" hpid="Mr. Ireland Mr. Ireland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ireland</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as a red letter day when, speaking as an inhabitant of the Six Counties, I find the Irish Seanad dealing with the matter that directly affects all Ireland.  I have read the Bill with interest.  It makes a nice point that it is an agreement with a Minister with an address in County Down, and a board with an address in Lower Fitzwilliam Street, but I think the people of Ireland will insist in regarding this as an agreement between two Governments, and I think they will be right.  Unfortunately, I fear there are many Deputies and Senators who, while they fiercely insist that Ireland consists of 32 counties, sometimes lose sight of that fact in the intricacies of legislation.  I was pointing out recently in this House, that in the matter of engineering, one of the great centres of the world is situated in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Cathaoirleach will permit me to say a word or two on the framework surrounding the Bill before I come to the Bill itself.  I am always being asked down here, or I used to be: &ldquo;When are you coming in with us?&rdquo; and I always insisted on replying: &ldquo;There is no such thing as our being swallowed up by you people. What will happen will be a coming together of two things to produce something entirely different from what we have now.&rdquo;  I think we begin to see the truth of that in dealing with this Bill, because this, believe me, is the only way in which any progress can be made&mdash;by agreement between the two sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am more interested in this general principle underlying the Bill than I am in the intricacies of the Bill.  It is not a very intricate thing&mdash;there may be one or two points that I should like to have clarified later on&mdash;but at this stage we ought to underline the principle which underlies it.  Senator O'Connell has just mentioned something which I intended to mention&mdash; the appointment of one general manager for the railway systems of both ends of the country.  Another one I can think of which runs parallel with the principle in the Bill is the establishment of a planetarium in Armagh, with contributions from both Governments. <Col N="222" /> That, I think, was possibly the first instance of this principle, and, if we cannot agree about the study of the stars, it would be a curious thing.  If it did not tax the patience of the Cathaoirleach, I could go on to mention another sphere where co-operation, I hope, will come.  We are cooperating in this matter for the good of us all and the good of Ireland, but there is another point at which I think we shall have to co-operate, not only for the good of Ireland but for the good of Western Europe, that is, the defence of this country.  However, that is for another occasion.</P>
    <P>At the moment, we are dealing with electricity and drainage, with something which will simultaneously drain land in the Six Counties and distribute electric light and power in parts of the Twenty-Six Counties where such light and power are badly needed.  I say that all the more feelingly because I am living in a little house in Donegal, and, if there were electricity there, I would buy it to-morrow, so that I feel it personally.  If anything simultaneously drains land in the Six Counties and distributes power and light in the Twenty-Six Counties, I think we can hail it without any equivocation.  That is really all I have to say.  I merely want to underline the principle by means of which we can go forward towards the unity of the country.  I welcome the Bill both for its own sake and as a foreshadowing of the shape of things to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be considered unsuitable that a voice like mine which still retains the Doric accents of its native County Derry should be heard in the discussion of a Bill of this kind and in congratulation of the Parliamentary Secretary for having introduced it.  Those of us whose roots are deep in the Six Counties&mdash;my own are deep there through generations&mdash;cannot but welcome anything that obliterates, even to a certain extent, the Border.  We who were born and have our roots in the Six Counties rejoice that Partition to some extent has been abolished by this Bill and I was very glad that Senator Hayes reminded us that it was a Six County man, the present <Col N="223" /> Minister for Finance, who made us all electricity-minded.  We owe a great debt to that Minister for having had the courage and foresight to harness the Shannon.  There was, I am sorry to say, a good deal of opposition at the time, but that has been nearly forgotten now and those who were opposed to it are now most enthusiastic about it.</P>
      <P>My particular interest in the Bill and in the electrification of Ireland concerns itself with the women.  Everybody will admit that there is no greater friend to women in their arduous labours than electricity.  For a long time, the attitude adopted towards the work of women was one of being prepared to let her plod away through all sorts of impossible conditions, but the women are rebelling against that and are not going to stand it any longer.  Unfortunately, the result is a terrific emigration of young marriageable women.  We must consider the provision of electrified homes in our land division activities, and, if we give the women a proper chance of being trained to run these homes and help their husbands in their farming work, we will go a long way to make this country what God meant it to be.  We have the most fertile land on earth, and, in spite of what people may say, we have the best climate on earth.  Our main industry is agriculture and we will get no distance with our agriculture, unless we harness women's energies to help the men.  For that reason, I welcome the Young Farmers' clubs and the part which they assign to women in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When an old farmer in America was asked about this, he talked about a woman's time being hens' time.  He did not believe in any such thing as the production of eggs by any means other than the hen.  In the same way, women's work did not count at all.  We must get rid of that and give women all the help we can.  It is by the electrification of rural life that we can affirm that objective.  At the same time, the spread of electricity will do a great deal for local small industries. There is a very interesting book which I have read called &ldquo;The Making of France,&rdquo; which shows that the real <Col N="224" /> stability of France was due to the small industries made possible by the power derived from the various streams, and if we can get our small industries in the homes with the use of electricity, it will do a great deal to make our economy sounder than it is.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Mrs. Concannon and Senator Ireland, I suppose anyone from the province of Ulster would approach this Bill from probably a different angle from that of some of our Southern colleagues.  The sentimental attraction of a measure like this for us is something that it is not easy to put into words.  This Bill reveals in very clearly defined language the fact that Ireland is one and that the 32 counties of Ireland, harnessed and working together, can do something for the people of Ireland that can never be done for Ireland or any part of it, if you attempt it as between the six north-eastern counties of Ulster and Britain.  This physical achievement is something that could not be done, except by the people of Ireland working together.</P>
      <P>True it is that the waters of Monaghan, Leitrim and Cavan have to join and flow through Fermanagh and out through Donegal to the sea in order to make this Bill a possibility and to create the machinery which will be brought into existence under it.  We welcome what it proposes and what it undertakes.  We hope&mdash;I especially hope&mdash;that this partial development&mdash; and to me this is only the partial development of the Erne scheme&mdash;will be continued, until we see the ultimate development, for electricity purposes, of all the waters in the Erne basin.  I agree with Senator Hayes and the others who spoke in commending the spirit of realism with which this problem has been approached by the people on both sides of the Border.  It is a sign that we are down to earth and prepared to face the possibility of working together and utilising the resources that God has placed at our disposal to harness and utilise for our betterment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will do two good things at the same time.  It will provide machinery <Col N="225" /> to develop additional electric current which the country badly needs and in doing that good work it will carry out excavations which will be very beneficial to the people of County Fermanagh from the point of view of drainage.  Probably, of the 32 counties, there is not a county so badly in need of drainage as County Fermanagh. The work will show itself on the lands of Fermanagh to an extent undreamed of even by their greatest optimists&mdash; and I speak with some knowledge, probably more than any other person in this House, of what the land in Fermanagh is like.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that the plan was to control sluices along a watercourse of four miles and one of the main concerns was to prevent the Upper Lough Erne falling below a level of 150 feet.  I am sure there were considerable misgivings with some of the people of Fermanagh, especially in the town of Enniskillen, about the possible consequences of an undertaking such as this.  Anyone who knows the town of Enniskillen and its very beautiful surroundings would appreciate the concern of the people of Enniskillen about the consequences that might follow a very considerable fall in the water level above the town.</P>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give consideration in his Department, or between it and the Board of Works, to the possibility of developing this scheme over a far greater area than that contemplated under this Bill.  The Bill provides for storage in the two lakes in County Fermanagh but I do not think that the distance in miles covered by these works in Fermanagh would be anything like half, perhaps not a third, of the total mileage distance of the Erne basin proper.  This extends away over a wide area in County Cavan, into County Monaghan, and partly into County Longford and County Leitrim. I suggest that, just as the imagination of the present Minister for Finance, in other days when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, conceived and carried into execution the Shannon scheme, this approach to the Erne electricity scheme should be equally imaginative. If we are to develop electricity <Col N="226" /> to the extent the country needs and is demanding and will continue to demand, it will be absolutely necessary to make provision for greater storage than is being done under this Bill.  In Cavan, in the Erne basin, there are many lakes where storage could be provided in a season like the present and during the dry summer months, that would ensure our electricity supplies and make us absolutely independent of outside sources.  If the engineering problems were examined and the task undertaken, we could build up a tremendous storage capacity in the Lough Gowna and Lough Oughter drainage districts.  Equally along the Annalee into County Monaghan there is storage, as there is along the Woodford Canal through Cavan and Leitrim and away back into the mountains of Cavan, the waters from which find their way through the many tributaries of the Erne into the sea.</P>
    <P>How a native of these areas will look upon this scheme is to some extent conditioned by the possibility of the drainage results that may flow from the development of electricity on the Erne. Undoubtedly, from the point of view of drainage, Fermanagh will benefit considerably, but all over Cavan and the counties of which I speak no drainage works can be undertaken without taking account of the conditions lower down on the Erne and over the Erne and on the Erne lakes.  Conditions in Fermanagh up to the present have been a handicap on us on this side of the Border in making any great effort for drainage there.  The Erne drainage comprises the largest area needing drainage in the whole country and a great area of this is in my county.  So, while approving and supporting and welcoming warmly this measure, I believe there must be an imaginative approach to the further development of electrical current from the waters of the Erne.  That can be ensured very effectively by studying the possibilities over many counties on our own side of the Border.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave figures indicating that, last year, our consumption of electricity was 569 million units while it is estimated that the consumption in 1955 may be 1,400 million units.  From my <Col N="227" /> own experience, it is quite clear that, as people get a taste of the value of electricity, the demand will grow.  At present we can make no reasonable prognostication as to what the consumption may be five years hence. While there is power going to waste, which our own people are competent to harness, our technicians should concentrate on that.</P>
    <P>In addition to the development of the electricity which our large rivers can provide for us, there are all over the country fairly large streams from our mountainsides that, by a little expenditure, could be harnessed to give a considerable addition to the resources at present available.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary that along with the many other great developments which are being undertaken by his Government at the moment there should be a fresh survey of our total electricity resources in a way in which I think it is not now being undertaken.  I feel that money invested in an undertaking like this is money well spent.  It is to be hoped that all those who supported this measure and who complimented those concerned in it and who helped to put it into the shape of a Bill, or whose activities at an earlier stage enabled this measure to be presented will be equally co-operative when the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues go to the country and ask the people to put their money in this 32-county undertaking and that they will give it all the support it is possible to give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators from all sides of the House for the co-operative manner in which they have discussed this measure.  I think the discussion here reflected the spirit which was in evidence in the Dáil and makes it obvious to everyone that the agreement which has been reached between the Electricity Supply Board and the Northern Minister for Finance is welcomed by all the people of the country.  I would like to join in the tributes paid here to the officers of the Electricity Supply Board, the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the officials of the Board of Works who contributed to the agreement as well as the officials from the Ministry of Finance in Northern Ireland.  The measure holds out hope of co-operation in further matters in the future.  It is, as has been described, an example of how enlightened self-interest compels people who differ on other matters, to reach agreement on matters which result in mutual benefits.  The conclusion which may be drawn from the agreement reached in this case is obvious&mdash;that the economic welfare of the country depends on the country being operated as a unit.  I believe that the co-operation which has been achieved can be extended to other spheres.  It may be unwise to read too much into the measure before the House or, as Senator Hayes described it, to indulge in wishful thinking, but this country is a geographical entity, a small homogeneous unit, and as such should be regarded by anyone who has its interests at heart.  I believe that from the national just as from the economic point of view ultimately wisdom will prevail and that the spirit which animated all concerned in reaching an agreement for the drainage of the river Erne and the erection of power stations to supply electricity will confer further benefits on the Irish people on both sides of the Border. Whether we give credit to the politicians concerned or not, I think we may <Col N="230" /> assume that the politicians on both sides of the Border are interested in the betterment of the people they represent. For that reason the fact that it has been possible to get agreement on this question is a ground for confidence in the ability of the people on both sides of the Border to work together on matters which may prove of material benefit if not other benefit to the people.</P>
      <P>The fact that the first stage of the development which was described as a partial development can be extended by additional generating sets is highly satisfactory.  It means that the original estimated output of 150,000,000 units will be increased to 230,000,000 units. The figures I gave at the outset show that the demand for electricity is more substantial and it is anticipated that it will continue to grow for many years ahead.  As well as providing additional electrical current and the benefits which will be conferred on the lands drained as a result of the works which are to be carried out on the Upper and Lower Loch Erne and in Belleek, I believe that this measure will prove beneficial to the people in the northeast portion of the country as well as to the people in Donegal, Cavan and the adjoining areas.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the House again for the tributes paid to the officials and to the Ministers concerned in this and in previous Governments. I would also like to say that I regard it as a privilege to have the responsibility of piloting this measure through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to give me any information on this section, but there is provision here that outstanding arrears of rents and rate charges shall cease from the passing of this Bill.  That is very fine as far as it goes, but some years ago in this drainage area there was very considerable and expensive legislation which went to the Supreme Court and left undischarged liabilities which are the responsibility of the ratepayers in the area.  It was extended to Cavan and into Leitrim, and if Senator O'Reilly were here he would be able to tell us all about it because his council is very deeply involved to the extent of many hundreds of pounds.  I do not think this section completely clears up the situation although it specifically indicates that all liability on the shoulders of the ratepayers will be discharged.  I do not know what the result of the passing of the Bill will be, but the section will not cover completely their discharged liabilities. They must be borne by somebody, probably by the ratepayers of Leitrim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets aside the award of 1891 made by the commissioners.  Under that award the ratepayers in certain counties affected by the drainage and navigation board were liable through a rate for maintenance, and in order to wind up the navigation board so that the new scheme to operate the drainage may be put into effect it is necessary to set aside the award.  Under that award, a drainage rate will no longer be levied on the persons concerned, and that includes, not merely current rates but accrued liabilities.  It may be, from what Senator Baxter says, that some persons have incurred expenses, possibly legal expenses.  That is a matter for the people concerned, but in so far as the ratepayers or the persons whose lands were affected by the drainage <Col N="233" /> board are concerned, they will no longer be liable for rates in respect of the drainage, and that includes arrears for any liabilities accrued in the past.</P>

      <P>I feel, that when you are going so far as to remit liabilities for rates, that it would be unfortunate that there should still remain some liabilities arising out of the legislation, as it was, and that they should still be undischarged.  That is the issue, as far as I recall it, after some years now.  There was litigation in Belfast, as well as here, arising out of this whole matter.  You are going to leave some people, I am afraid, very disappointed. I do not know; if I were to give some time to this, I should probably try to see how we could do something to clear up the obligations that still remain as a result of the legislation of 1891 which you are now repealing, but you still leave a burden.</P>

      <P>It seems to me, that we should have some statement from the Parliamentary Secretary as to why <Col N="234" /> this particular bridge must be removed. It happens to be a bridge of considerable interest historically, and as a monument of some interest, it would be desirable that some reason should be given why its removal is necessary. I presume it is because the channel there has to be widened to carry about three times as much water as it carries at present, but I think we ought to have an authoritative statement on that, because here a unique bridge is to be destroyed or abolished for no apparent reason.  It happened recently in the neighbourhood of Dublin, that one of the oldest and most interesting bridges in the country had to be abolished because of a hydro-electric development.  I think it should always be stressed, when we have to remove these interesting relics of the past, why it is necessary.  I notice that the rather less interesting bridge at Roscor where a channel is necessary is to be underpinned, but that is all.</P>

      <P>The Sugar (Control of Import) Act, 1936, empowers the Government to prohibit, by Order, the importation of sugar except under licence. Import licences may be granted to the sugar company only.  The first prohibition Order on the importation of sugar was made in May, 1936, and since that time the importation of sugar has been regulated by an annual prohibition Order.  The current prohibition Order, which is the 15th Order of the series, prohibits the importation of sugar during the period from the 1st May, 1950, to the 30th April, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Sugar (Control of Import) Act, 1936, provides that every prohibition Order shall cease to have effect at the expiration of six months from the date thereof unless the Order has been approved by Resolution of the Oireachtas passed before the expiration <Col N="236" /> of the said six months.  The current Order was made on the 21st April, 1950, and consequently, it will require to be confirmed not later than the 20th October, 1950.</P>
    <P>There is exemption from the prohibition in the case of:&mdash;(a) sugar not exceeding 14 lbs. in weight which is intended for the personal use of the importer or of his household; and (b) samples of sugar.</P>
    <P>It is provided under Section 7 (4) of the Sugar (Control of Import) Act, 1936, that a fee at the rate appointed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall be paid in respect of every licence which is issued authorising the importation of sugar. The object of this provision is to ensure that the sugar company, which is the sole licensee, shall not make any profit on the sale of the imported sugar.  Accordingly, the aim has been to appoint a fee which would be equal to the difference between (a) the amount realised by the company on the sale of imported sugar, and (b) the amount expended by the company on the purchase and handling of the sugar.</P>
    <P>In normal times, when sugar was freely available in the world markets, it was necessary to restrict imports in the interests of the sugar factories. The annual demand is at the rate of about 100,000 tons and our factories produced 88,700 tons in 1949.  It is necessary, therefore, in the ordinary way to import sugar and the arrangement under which it may be imported only by the sugar company enables a uniform price to be maintained.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could clear up a difficulty in the minds of a lot of people.  As he rightly stated, the purpose of prohibiting the import of sugar was to protect the sugar factories. There were periods recently when sugar purchased outside was more costly than the home-manufactured sugar.  The position seems to vary from day to day and according to the type of sugar.  If we could have a statement as to whether imported sugar to-day is dearer than the sugar we can produce ourselves, it might have a good effect on the consumer to realise that people growing beet in this country were growing it at a lower total cost in sugar compared with the price at which foreign stuff could be obtained.  We have had some statements in this regard and it would be interesting to find out what the position to-day is in the light of the fact that the sugar company is asking for the right to be the sole importer. I think the public are entitled to know what the price position is, that is, not only what it has to pay for sugar but what it ultimately receives from the sale of that sugar here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 1948, the imported sugar was cheaper than the home sugar.  Since then, the imported sugar is dearer.  It varies according to individual consignments.  It is not possible to give a definite price, which would rule for the entire imports, but, since 1948, the imported sugar price <Col N="238" /> has been higher than that of the homegrown sugar.</P>

      <P>That the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company (General Meetings) Order, 1950, proposed to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and laid in draft before Seanad Éireann on the 31st day of May, 1950, under sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company are subject to a peculiar disability in regard to the holding of general meetings and preparation of accounts.  Unlike other commercial concerns, the company are obliged, by the Alliance and Dublin Gas Act, 1866, to prepare accounts on a half-yearly basis and to hold general meetings twice a year, and they have asked that an Order should be made under the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, relieving them of this obligation.  I am satisfied that the procedure laid down in the Act of 1866 which serves no useful purpose, is outmoded, and that there is no reason for continuing to impose on the company an obligation which does not apply to other commercial undertakings, and which involves the company in an annual expenditure of the order of £3,000.</P>
      <P>Under existing procedure, it is necessary for the company to hold a general meeting to approve of the payment of half-yearly dividends, but under the draft Order now before the House, the company will be able to follow the normal practice of commercial concerns and declare interim dividends, subject to ratification at the annual general meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Gas Regulation Act of 1920 altered the method wherby statutory gas undertakings were obliged to secure their powers by way of private Act or provisional Order, and provided instead that powers could be secured by a special Order approved by a <Col N="239" /> resolution of both Houses.  The procedure, as now laid down, requires that the draft Order be prepared by the gas undertaking, and that full publicity of the intention to apply for the Order and of the contents of the draft be given by notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and local newspapers.  Notification must also be given to the State and to private interests involved.  One month is given for the lodging of objections, the subsequent stages being dealt with in accordance with the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.  No objections were lodged in this case, and I, therefore, submit the draft for the approval of the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Where an officer or employee of the society is appointed to a situation in the Civil Service pursuant to the provisions of sub-section (1) of this section, he shall be appointed within a grade at least as favourable, having regard to existing rights and salary scale, as his or her existing grade in the society's service.</P>
      <P>The section makes provision for the transfer of present employees on both the indoor and outdoor staff of the National Health Insurance Society to the Civil Service.  The Minister has given a guarantee that the transfer will not worsen the position of any of the persons concerned, but, despite that promise, it is quite possible that a person transferred into the Government service may find that there is not in that service a grade comparable with that from which he has been transferred. There might thereby be created in the minds of these people a sense of injustice and they cannot be expected to give loyal service, or to be as enthusiastic for the change over, as would be the case if the Minister accepted the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> I have no doubt the Minister's intention at the present time is to give the same status, as far as possible, to every transferred employee.  That may be all very well until it comes to giving effect to the terms of the Bill.  In doing that, the Minister's wishes may not apply to a very large portion of those concerned. The House knows the Minister is not in a position to direct the particular grade or service into which these people may be taken.  This matter was referred to on the Second Stage, and the Minister gave his views then. While accepting the promise he made, I should be very much more pleased to see the amendment incorporated in the Bill, so as to give these people a safeguard or a guarantee that they would get such a fair deal as I feel sure the Minister would like to give them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact, I do not think there is any real difference between Senator Hawkins and myself as to what will happen the staff of the National Health Insurance Society. This amendment seeks to give them a statutory guarantee, that they will be appointed &ldquo;within a grade at least as favourable, having regard to existing rights and salary scale as his or her existing grade in the society's service.&rdquo; I made the position perfectly clear.  So far as the staff is concerned they will be taken over at salaries not less than what they have; their tenure will be no weaker than it is; and those who are pensionable will, in fact, get better pensions schemes than they have now.  In fact, a substantial number of the staff on the clerical and administrative side will be assimilated to appropriate Civil Service grades, and that assimilation will mean that they will get an increase in salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the staff of the society is concerned, I tell the House, as I told the staff privately and through the Dáil, that with what is going to happen they are not going to suffer any injury.  They know clearly that they will suffer no loss or reduction in pensions, wages, or salaries but, in fact, an improvement in pensions where they are pensionable officers, with a tenure from the State instead of tenure from a private company, and <Col N="241" /> for many of them increases in existing salaries.  That assurance has been conveyed to them by the Government and I think all sections in the Dáil, and I presume the same in the Seanad, desire that these people would be treated fairly.  No one is proposing to worsen their position.</P>
    <P>I say to Senator Hawkins that I know of no other body of employees, whether working for the State or for any other authority, that have a guarantee given in the name of the Government, and by a possible alternative Government, that nobody wants to worsen their position.  Could anybody feel happier than that?  I know of no other class in the community with such an assurance.  From the first day that they apply for assimilation they have not to concern themselves with any real worry about a statutory guarantee.  I do not think it is necessary to give that statutory guarantee.  Let me put this to Senator Hawkins.  There are people who have been in the Civil Service since this State was set up in 1922. They have 28 years' service but no statutory guarantee about existing salaries or wages, and no statutory guarantee about existing wages or rights, whatever they might be.</P>
    <P>The position in this amendment is that I should give a statutory guarantee to people who are being taken into the Civil Service for the first time, and with one week's service that they are to get a statutory guarantee, while such statutory guarantee is being denied to many others in the Civil Service with 28 years' service.  I think everybody will agree, if they look at the matter dispassionately, and in an unbiassed way, that it is highly undesirable to create within the Civil Service another class which imagines that it has rights superior to the rest of the Civil Service.  What will happen in the next couple of months is that those people who are taken over, so far as they are employed on work analogous to that identifiable with the Civil Service grade into which they are assimilated, will be civil servants, and that their rights will be whatever rights go with their grading and their assignment to particular Civil Service grades.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> What is their future to be in the particular class of the Civil Service to which they are assigned?  When they go into the Civil Service they will presumably become members of staff organisations, and whatever grievances arise from time to time can be represented by whatever organisation they are in through the Departmental Conciliation Council and, if necessary, taken to the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  Now we get to this condition, that nobody's conditions will be worsened, and that a substantial number will have their positions bettered. They are getting a new tenure from the State, a new guarantee given through the Houses of Parliament. They will be assimilated into the Civil Service and will have staff organisations to represent them.  If they have grievances they can go to the Departmental Conciliation Council and also to the Civil Service Arbitration Board.</P>
    <P>From every point of view, I think Senator Hawkins will agree, on reflection, that these people are very well safeguarded and have, probably, got more safeguards than any other class that I know of, having regard to the fact that they are coming into the State service, and not being transferred to a body outside State control, where their future might be linked in some tenuous way with the fortunes of an organisation less solid and less consolidated than the State.  I suggest to Senator Hawkins that we are, in fact, doing, but not by means of statutory guarantee, what he seeks to achieve in the amendment.  I think the Senator can take my word that the assimilation and grading will be all over in a couple of months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear that the Minister has overlooked the most important feature in the &ldquo;taking over,&rdquo; when he attempts to compare, and to give to the House an outline of the conditions in which former employees of the National Health Society will find themselves when they are taken over as civil servants.  This is not a bankrupt concern but a wealthy organisation which had £6,500,000 invested.  It had a future before it, as we can assume that it is one of the societies which would carry <Col N="243" /> on for many years.  Therefore, the employees had a guarantee of employment, with good conditions and provision for a pension fund, inside the framework of their own organisation.</P>
      <P>When the Minister draws a parallel with civil servants, he overlooks the fact that those who join the Civil Service do so voluntarily, of their own free will.  It may be that it was the only avenue of employment open to many of them at the time, but they are there of their own free will.  On the other hand, the employees of the National Health Insurance Society are being taken over and they should be given the guarantees, which should be incorporated in the Bill, to ensure that their position and status will not be worsened in any way by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I happen to have been associated for a short time with this society.  I was a member of the negotiating committee which settled the wage claim of the members of the staff last November.  Settlement was reached on a basis which was agreeable to the staff as a whole and accepted unanimously by their trade union. During these negotiations it was quite evident that what the staff wanted was to approach as nearly as possible to the position which they would occupy when they would be taken over under this scheme.  They knew it was about to come; it was in the offing, although it was not mentioned specifically at any time during the salary negotiations. The agreement fixed rates as nearly as practicable to what they would get in similar circumstances when taken over. I think that the staff were very well satisfied with what happened on that occasion.  The staff have not approached me or, as far as I know, any member of the committee of management&mdash;Senator Clarkin and myself are members of the committee&mdash;with any sense of grievance about the transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should inform Senator Hawkins that there was a fairly constant leakage from the staff into the Civil Service. It was the greatest cause of leakage. <Col N="244" /> They were anxious to get into the Civil Service, so I do not think there will be any grievance.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to say why he says their pension rights would be better.  They have a non-contributory pension and are entitled to two-thirds of their salary on full service.  There is another point I would like him to explain; that is, whether the existing marriage gratuity regulations will continue in the Civil Service.  I am not sure, but I think the marriage gratuity operating in the society at the moment is rather better in some ways than that which operates in the Civil Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us any indication as to the numbers of people coming into the Civil Service who will get this increase in salary which he mentioned a few moments ago?  About what percentage of the staff will be involved in that increase? If I understood the Minister correctly, he said that numbers of the people to be taken over will come into the Civil Service on a better scale of salary than they enjoy at the moment. That could be true of a dozen or of 100.  I wonder what percentage of the staff will benefit on transfer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Connell is right in pointing out to Senator Hawkins that, far from the staff not desiring to become civil servants, quite a substantial number of them do from time to time.  The society recruits staff.  Many of the people they recruit have competed also in the Civil Service examinations.  Employment in the society may turn up first and, on the principle that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, they start with the society.  In due course, the result of the Civil Service examination is promulgated and they see they are successful, whereupon they promptly give notice to the society that this is an opportunity too good to miss, they leave the society and go into the Civil Service.  That is the common pattern of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does Senator Hawkins fear that there will be a complete transformation in the feelings of the staff and that from now onward they will detest the Civil Service?  The whole pattern has <Col N="245" /> been one of praying that the day will come when they would be high on the list of successful candidates for the Civil Service.  There is no fear at all that any single member of the staff has any horror of becoming a civil servant. It is not with horror but with enthusiasm that they are approaching this proposition.  I suggest to the Senator that the assurances to the staff give them no reason to apprehend that they would be treated in any unfair way. Not only on my own behalf but on behalf of the Government I can give that assurance.  I hope to effect the assimilation to the Civil Service grades even before the transfer takes place, so that they will know what happens. Senator Hawkins is really pushing an open door.  What he wishes to achieve is really an accomplished fact.</P>
    <P>I cannot give Senator Ó Buachalla the percentage of the staff which will secure increases.  He may take it, in a general way&mdash;and Senator O'Connell's speech underlines what I am saying&mdash;that when the staff organisations last negotiated with the committee of management a certain agreement was arrived at.  The staff were then striving to get Civil Service standards of remuneration, but they did not get them.  In some instances they came very close.  In other instances there was probably a difference of £40 to £70 between the maximum of their grade in the society and the maximum of what could be regarded as a comparable grade in the Civil Service.  They never actually got what they claimed they were worthy of having regard to the salaries of appropriate Civil Service grades.  Now when they are taken over the intention is to assimilate them into these grades and in no circumstances will they get less than they are now getting with the society.  In all cases there will be in fact a gain to a greater or lesser extent on their being taken over and assimilated into the appropriate Civil Service grade.  The extent of the gain will depend on how near they now are to the present appropriate Civil Service scale of salary for the grade into which they will be assimilated.</P>
    <P>On the question of pensions the position at the moment is that female <Col N="246" /> National Health Insurance Society employees will, on transfer to the Civil Service, be entitled to calculate their superannuation under the 1909 Civil Service Superannuation Act.  In other words they will get on retirement a pension based on one-eightieth for each year's salary plus a lump sum based on one-thirtieth for each year's service up to a maximum of 45 thirtieths. In addition they will get a gratuity on marriage, having served six years, of one month's salary for each year of service whereas in the case of the National Health Insurance Society the gratuity was at the rate of 6 per cent. of the salary for each year of service.  So you will see at retirement for marriage purposes the gratuity in the Civil Service is better than in the case of the National Health Insurance Society.  Let me say here that no female civil servant to-day can get a pension based on one-eightieth and a lump sum since their superannuation comes under the 1889 Act which provides for a pension at the rate of one-twentieth of salary for each year of service.  Women civil servants for more than a quarter of a century have been trying to get a pension scheme based on one-eightieth of salary plus a lump sum of one thirtieth.  The female employees of the National Health Society when they come into the Department of Social Welfare will be the first civil servants to get that new superannuation scheme and to that extent they will be in a better position than other women civil servants. I think that what is being done in this case will determine the pattern of future legislation in its application to women civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister made that explanation about pensions because there was some doubt about the matter.  I hope that the scheme which he has outlined will be applied to other civil servants and to those outside the Civil Service whose pensions are based on Civil Service terms.  I should have said when I spoke earlier that the demands put forward by the union at the time that the negotiations were in progress were that these employees should be given the same rates as female civil servants.</P>

It ought to be easy to get the figures relating to the different grades with the salaries applicable to those grades and then the Minister should be able to indicate the corresponding grades in the Civil Service into which these people will be transferred, the rate of salary obtaining in that grade and the number of people and the amount of money involved.

      <P>I would like to have some clarification on what is to happen the present pension fund of the society.  The Minister has given the figure as something in the neighbourhood of £120,000.  Will the payments on retirement or gratuities to the employees of the National Health Insurance Society come from investments from this fund or does it mean that the fund will be taken over by the Department of Finance and that in future the payments made in pensions or gratuities will be made from sums provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I am at a difficulty to try and find out what exactly is going to happen to the pensions fund and in the same way what is going to happen to the entire funds of the society.  You have on the one hand the employees being taken over as civil servants and their pensions and all other payments to them will be provided by the Oireachtas. When the comprehensive scheme comes along provision will be made for an increased payment of contributions by employer and employee and I am at a loss to know how the Minister is going to divide up or allocate the present funds of the society so that the persons who subscribed them will benefit from these particular funds.</P>

      <P>While my natural tendency is always to safeguard the wage earner or the salary earner, I am not convinced that there is any need for the amendment put forward by Senator Hawkins and even if I thought there was a need I do not think it would be an improvement on the Bill as it stands.  All he asks is that a person shall be appointed within a grade at least as favourable.  &ldquo;At least as favourable&rdquo; means not less favourable; it does not indicate that there would be any improvement and I think that the Bill, as drafted, indicates that there can be no worsening of the standard of either salaries or pensions.  Section 7, sub-section (1), stipulates that whatever payments have been made by an employee of the society, he shall be deemed to have been paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas throughout his service. If you are paying for 20 years and come into the Civil Service, you are eligible for pension as if you had been 20 years in the Civil Service.  Sub-section (2) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a person who is appointed to a situation in the Civil Service... was... a member of the pension fund, such situation shall be a permanent situation and such of his service under the society... shall be treated as established service for the purpose of the Superannuation Acts.</P>

    <P>I can imagine a case&mdash;I do not know what number there would be&mdash;of a person coming into the Civil Service after 20 years' service and getting the same pension rights as the civil servant <Col N="249" /> with 20 years' service, but a civil servant with 20 years' service would be receiving a higher salary than a person who had been employed by the society for that number of years.  I am not saying that it would happen in every case.  The Bill seems to indicate, however, that nobody's condition will be worsened.  Every year in the service of the society will count as service in the Civil Service and will entitle the person to payment and pension similar to the pension payable on a similar period of service in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I would not like to be too rigid and insist that everyone who is taken over should be kept at exactly the same sort of work as they were doing.  If a person becomes a civil servant he is liable to be transferred from one Department to another.  If you make the thing too rigid, you will find that somebody who has been dealing with national health insurance and nothing else will raise an objection and for the rest of his period in the Civil Service must deal with national health contributions and nothing else.</P>
    <P>If I thought that Senator Hawkins's amendment would improve the Bill I would support it, but I do not honestly think it would.  It only commits the Minister and his successors to putting these people into a job which is no worse, but they will, under the Bill as it stands, get a status and a job no lower than the one they have at present because their own organisation ensures that they are not to be lowered in the social or the salary scale.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 attempts to make provision for those transferred servants who may feel a sense of grievance that they have not been allocated to the equivalent of the position they occupied in the society. In order that they may have a court of appeal, I suggest that the Minister should be empowered to appoint a committee, the chairman being appointed by himself with a member of the trade union to which the person belonged before he became a civil servant and a member appointed by the Minister for Finance who, after all, has the final say regarding appointment to grades in the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There again, I think, with regard to the realities of this transfer, there is not much difference between us.  I have said sufficient, I think, to indicate that nobody is going to get a raw deal and that everybody is going to be treated fairly.  I do not think there is any concern or worry in the minds of the staff that they will not get a fair crack of the whip as far as this transfer is concerned.  I want to transfer these people inculcating into their minds at the time of transfer a feeling that they will be fairly treated. In that way you get the best and most satisfactory service.  On transfer, they become members of the Civil Service, that is, certain clerical grades in the National Health Insurance Society will be assimilated into clerical grades in the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that day, their old identity, their old classification is gone; they are clerical officers in the Civil Service with all the rights of the clerical officer class in the Civil Service.  They have the right to participate in any benefits that come to the clerical officer class in the Civil Service.  Looking at this question as Minister or stepping down from that position and looking at it from the point of view of a trade union adviser, I would say to the staff of the National Health Insurance Society that it would be better from their own point of view not to try to develop a separateness, an exclusiveness, from the rest of their own class in the Civil Service. They should play with their own team and not merely that but play for their own team.  Instead of trying to <Col N="251" /> find remedies here or there for illusory injustices which may never arise, they should pull with the rest of their own grade in the Civil Service and endeavour to improve conditions for the entire class.  In that philosophy, I think, they will find more dividends than in trying to create for themselves an exclusiveness which can have no durability whatever and which would be impossible permanently to maintain and which is more likely to beget enmity towards them than goodwill. At all events, if at any time after transfer to the Civil Service, they have any grievance, I have said to them &ldquo;If you feel that the transfer is operating in such a way as to chaff on you&mdash;not to cause any burdensome injustice&mdash;to the extent that you feel you are not getting a fair deal, I will make the Assistant Secretary of my Department available to see you at any time to try to iron out any little difficulties.  If that fails, I will make my secretary available to see you and if that fails, I will see you myself.&rdquo;  Is not all that evidence of somebody actuated by goodwill towards the staff which is being transferred?  I suggest to Senator Hawkins that in all that he has abundant evidence that there is no ground for fear, even remotely, of injustice for any of the National Health Insurance Society staff.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind that even supposing faith in all these things collapses, there is still the Civil Service Arbitration Board to which they can take their case and get an independent judgement, the Minister having no right to weight the scales against them.  I ask Senator Hawkins if he knows of anybody better circumstanced?  I do not.</P>

      <P>The remedy the Senator proposes would not be very satisfactory to the servant.  He would not be helped by having the Minister for Finance on the committee.  I would keep him out as much as possible and I think that any civil servant who had a grievance would do better to go to his own Minister than to bring the Minister for Finance into it.  In any case it would be two against one if that committee were set up.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>() An officer or employee of the society may before the transfer day resign his position under the society, and where such officer or employee had paid into the pension fund regular contributions he may apply to the committee of management to be retired on pension and the committee with the consent of the Minister may retire such officer or employee and add such number of years of service for pension purposes as they think fit but in any case not more than ten such years; the resulting increased charge on the fund not to cause any increase in the Exchequer contribution to the fund.</P>
      <P>Up to the present we have been dealing with persons who are taken over to the Civil Service and this amendment proposes to make provision for those employees who, for one reason or another, are not anxious to become civil servants and who are already members of the pension fund of the National Health Insurance Society.  It is usual when a person retires before completing his total years of service that the board or organisation concerned is empowered to show their appreciation of his services by adding years to bring him up to the full pension or as near as possible to the full pension.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree, I am sure, that no matter what inducements or how well he might paint the picture to persons, to become civil servants, that in the National Health Insurance Society at present there are persons who could not, and will not, avail of the transfer to become a civil servant. If they did, it would deprive them of some of the freedom that they now enjoy.</P>

      <P>For instance, there are agents throughout the country who are engaged in quite a number of activities apart from being national health insurance agents, and if the <Col N="253" /> strict rules of the Civil Service are enforced quite a number of these agents will be compelled to break their connections with organisations, with public life in some cases, that they have built up over a number of years. Apart from all that, it is quite possible that, for family reasons or any one of a number of reasons, there may be one, two or three persons in the employment of the National Health Insurance Society at the moment who do not wish to become civil servants and, if that is so, provision should be made to give them the benefits which they would have got had the society been allowed to continue and had not been taken over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed to provide pensions for persons who contribute regularly to the pension fund.  If I accepted this amendment to give them pensions after ten or 20 years, they would get nothing at all, because they do not contribute to any pension fund, and the amendment falls on that.  I take it that Senator Hawkins is not standing over the amendment but that he wants to argue the merits of the case as to whether we should allow people to retire from the service of the society and pay them pensions.  We can probably deal with the position from that standpoint. Again, let us take the background against which we must consider this Bill.  Where pensions or compensation have been provided in the past on the retirement of staff in the main, in fact, entirely, I think I can say, it has been where the amalgamation or transfer of staff brough about redundancy or brought about loss of employment. Consequently, if you are taking over people whom you are likely to render redundant or likely to have no further need for their services you promptly <Col N="254" /> said to them: &ldquo;You can go, I do not want you, and I propose to pay you a certain pension.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that way you got rid of your liability to the person concerned.  Very often, what you did was to put a person of middle age or perhaps less than middle age out of employment, give him a small pension, and leave the person concerned to find how best he could get another job in a highly competitive labour market.  This is a different approach to the problem.  In this case, I do not propose to render anybody redundant or to sack anybody. I propose to take them all over, and to provide them with their wages and salary each week.  I will find work for them, but I am not going to make anybody redundant.  I am not going to dismiss anybody, because of the transfer, so from that standpoint, I am guaranteeing the people their existing wages and salaries.  There is no doubt they are going to get it, not the slightest.  Is it wise as a matter of national policy?  This is not a vast empire, and this is not the wealthiest country in the world.  Is it desirable that we should give people of 22, 23 or 24 years of age, and up to 30 years of age the right to retire, rather than serve the Government of the people, and give them pensions, also?  Now, if we are going to start a brigade of pensioners of 22, 24 and 26 years of age where are we going to draw the line?  Does anybody think that is promoting the national wellbeing, to permit a number of people for whom good employment is available with definite guarantees, to permit them to say: &ldquo;Oh, I do not want that employment at all.  Write me a cheque for my pension.  I will go off and look for another job, and if I get one at the same rate as I had, then, at least, I will have as good a job as the one I had, and I will have codded the State out of an annual pension for the rest of my life&rdquo;?  I see nothing in these economics to commend them to me.  I do not think we ought facilitate people like that.  Here, I am offering regular well paid employment to these people, in the main. There is no question of being paid off. They do not suffer from the fear of losing their employment or their wages <Col N="255" /> if it is wet or if it is snowing.  No matter what the weather is, no matter what the ups and downs of life are for the ordinary people in the country, these people will get a week's wages or a month's salary.  That is what a lot of people have not got in this country.  That is what a whole lot of people cannot count on with certainty in this country.  These people can. Are we to say: &ldquo;We do not want to hurt your feelings.  The last thing we would have is to ask you to work under duress and, instead, we will ask you to go off and get a job somewhere else, and we will give you pensions to soothe you while you are looking for it&rdquo;? Should we, on the other hand, say to these people: &ldquo;You will be better off, the nation will be better off, and your family will be better off, if you just learn to work regularly, and enthusiastically, in the service of the State. You have guaranteed permanent employment and a guarantee of your wages or salary, each week or month.&rdquo; I think the latter approach is the best. I think we are on the slippery slope if we contemplate a situation in which a person can merely decide he does not want to work and that he can then get a pension.</P>
    <P>With all the things we have tried to do with legislation, we have not yet hit that low-water mark, and I think we should try to keep away from it, as far as possible.  Not only are these people getting guarantees, to which I adverted on a previous amendment, but I am divesting myself completely of any power to make one of them redundant or to dismiss one of them. Not only am I giving them definite guarantees, but I am divesting myself of any power to displace a single one of them.  As if that were not going far enough, Senator Hawkins suggests that they should be given a pension as well.  That, I suggest, is putting it on with a trowel.  We ought to draw the line in this matter and say: &ldquo;There is decent honest work for you.  Take it and be glad you have it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the previous amendment, the Minister convinced the House that a majority of the employees of the society were eagerly and <Col N="256" /> anxiously longing for the day when they would become civil servants.  We accepted that the majority were prepared to be transferred, but here again it is not a question of the entire 600 employees or former employees, as they will be, but a possibly very small number of persons who have given long years of service to the society and who do not find it possible to come into the new scheme of things.  In these cases, the Minister should be prepared to agree to give the committee of management power to give them pensions on retirement, provided they are satisfied that those resigning have good and sufficient reasons for doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In putting down his amendment Senator Hawkins gave us an opportunity of considering the general principle concerning pensions. Although the Minister has assured us that practically the entire staff of 600 of the National Health Insurance Society are eager and anxious to become civil servants, with such an amendment as this in the Bill I think the sluice gates of the water in Lough Erne would not stop all the people who would want to go out on pension.  The granting of pensions to young people is a bad policy.  You would have the same thing happening under this Bill as happened under Article 10, all sorts of people wanting to get out on pension, and taking advantage of such an opportunity to compete for jobs after wards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can imagine that if every young woman in the National Health Insurance Society to-day had the opportunity of going out on pension, with ten years added service, and if she had been ten years there, she would still be in &ldquo;the thirties,&rdquo; you would have a queue of young men outside the office asking her &ldquo;Have you resigned yet&rdquo;?  or &ldquo;When are you going out on pension&rdquo;?  Such young women would be forced to go out on pension. If you accept the principle, which I do not, that everybody should have ten years added to their service for refusing to work, how could you conscientiously <Col N="257" /> refuse giving ten years' additional service to people who want to go on working?</P>
    <P>If you take the ten years mentioned for the 600 people, and give each of them the right to claim for working or not, an additional ten years service, you would make 6,000 years pensionable, not one hour of which anybody worked.  If such was suggested outside there would be a hullabaloo.  To add 6,000 years' service merely for the sake of giving people additional pensions seems to me to be a very bad policy. I think this question of pensions has gone too far in this country.  I know that some people for special reasons when the Service was being set up were admitted to the Civil Service and had years added on.  If everybody had the right to claim added years also when going out of the service, it would be hardly worth while going through the formality of taking up the job.</P>

      <P>I am delighted at the conversion of Senator Hawkins to the trade union movement.  I should like to impress on Senator Hawkins this fact, that all those who are to be transferred now belong to the one trade union, of which I am a member. We have heard of no protest from the trade union that there was any injustice when these people were to be transferred.  I would remind Senator Hawkins that some 13 or 14 years ago, when there was another amalgamation and transfer of officers, the attitude of the then Government, which the Senator supported and still supports, was entirely different. It did not give half the protection or the security that is being given by this Bill.  When the Minister, who is now dealing with this Bill, proposed an amendment to give security and some protection to agents brought into the amalgamated company then, he was out-voted.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to see the conversion of Senator Hawkins.  If an injustice were being done to the agents, the trade unions would have taken the matter up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some things I would like to see embodied in the Bill, but the trade union has accepted the Minister's word and is satisfied, and once the <Col N="258" /> trade union has done that, I am satisfied. I would ask Senator Hawkins to withdraw the amendment.</P>

The members of the House will understand that having followed a trade for quite a number of years it was hardly possible to be occupied in such a way without being a member of a trade union organisation.  I have been as strong and steadfast a supporter of trade unionism and trade union principles as Senator Tunney.  I do not wish to prolong the proceedings of the House except in relation to the matters contained in the Bill, but sometimes one is tempted off the straight and narrow path.  If Senator Tunney has a complaint as to what happened 13 or 14 years ago, when private concerns were amalgamated into what is still more or less a private concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if the complaint were valid at that time, it still is an argument in support of my amendment.  Senator Tunney says they were compelled.  We are compelling, now, the employees of the society to become civil servants, just as Senator Tunney and his colleagues who were originally employed by individual insurance companies were compelled to become members of one insurance company.</P>

I think Senator Tunney is rather mixed up in his anxiety to support something to which my present amendment has no relation. My present amendment is not for those persons taken over but rather for those who, for one reason or another, cannot and will not be transferred as ordinary employees of the society so as to become civil servants.</P>

      <P>What is the position with regard to the actuarial valuation? I noticed from the proceedings <Col N="260" /> in the Dáil that there was a certain amount of ambiguity in the Minister's replies to the points raised on that matter.  Is it the intention to present us in due course with an actuarial valuation?  I hope it is.  I would point out in the case of a business or partnership being dissolved a special account is prepared to show the position at the time of dissolution.  We have the same in regard to companies and it is only fair that in regard to this society we should be given a full and comprehensive view of its position at the time of the transfer.  I expect that the necessary data is available for such a valuation and I think it is only reasonable to ask that the valuation should be carried out and carried out as early as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 of the 1942 Act provides for a quinquennial actuarial review of the finances of the society.  The purpose of that was to ascertain the amount that would be available for additional benefits in the subsequent five years.  The position at the moment is that the last review took place on 31st December, 1943, and you are working on the actuarial review made available as a result of that actuarial examination.  That examination was carried out for the purpose of ascertaining what money would be available by way of additional benefits or which could be available. In this Bill we are providing that the sum available for additional benefits is set down in that statutory form and, therefore, there is no question that that money will be available, if needs be, until 1952.  We are safe, therefore, under this Bill in making the necessary provision for additional benefits up to 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is that in the meantime and before the period for additional benefits under this Bill expires a comprehensive scheme will be introduced. Senators will have observed from the White Paper that statutory provision will be made to provide for the allocation of moneys for additional benefits so long as these additional benefits are administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  We are making the same provision for additional benefits until 1952 and provision <Col N="261" /> will also be made under the comprehensive scheme for these benefits.</P>
    <P>When this matter was discussed in the Dáil it was discussed from the point that Deputies wanted to get an actuarial view of the relationship of the society to the comprehensive scheme.  The comprehensive scheme has already been actuarially costed. In so far as Senator Ó Buachalla wants information, I undertake to make available to Deputies and Senators every scrap of information I have available, but when you get it you will be no wiser, because the White Paper scheme has been costed and you can get the figures there.  So far as the actuarial review is concerned, it need not in the future be undertaken for the purposes for which it was undertaken in the past, namely, to ascertain what moneys would be available for additional benefits.  These benefits are being provided in this Bill and they will be part and parcel of the comprehensive scheme when it is introduced.  As I said, I would be only too glad to make all information available.</P>

      <P>I am not doubting the Minister's intentions or his ability to make additional benefits available, but I do think we are not unreasonable in asking that this last actuarial valuation of the society be made and that its results be published. It is quite true to say that by the time we get it it would have no practical value, that the whole scheme will have been changed.  I accept all that, but I think in view of the peculiar circumstances of this Bill, and the transfer of the National Health Society, and of the criticisms of one kind and another, it is only fair that the Minister should cause that valuation to be made.  If the Minister were to argue that there would be no point in making it because of the expense involved, then there would be some point in his argument, but I would not accept it.  I think if this valuation were to cost £1,000 or £10,000 in the special circumstances, it would be money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's offer to make available figures relating to stocks and shares and other securities <Col N="262" /> held by the society, but these would be of very little use.  The Minister knows that to make an actuarial investigation is a serious matter which can only be carried out by men of great experience. While I appreciate the Minister's offer to make the figures available, all I can say is that they would be of very little value to me.  I do ask the Minister most sincerely to reconsider this matter, and I think that in all fairness this valuation should be carried out showing the position of the society at the time of its dissolution: that we should get at this dissolution its final balance sheet.</P>

    <P>The next one is due to take place in respect of the valuation as at 31st December, 1948.  It takes approximately three years after the date before you can get a complete actuarial view.  It takes two years to assemble the data for the actuary.  The 1943 valuation was based on the position as at 31st December, 1943; it was November, 1945, two years afterwards approximately, before the material was assembled and presented to the actuary.  That is not because the job was long-fingered but because an enormous amount of detailed work is involved and it must absorb somebody's time.  It takes a year before the work is completed by the actuary.  If you want an actuarial examination of 1948 under the 1942 Act it will be the end of 1951 before you will get the report and when you get the report by the end of 1951 the comprehensive scheme in all likelihood will be in operation and the actuarial report will be of no value whatever because all the information you want about the assets of the society such as they are will be available to you in other forms.  Even suppose you get that actuarial review at December, 1948, before you can get a review of the position in 1949-50 you <Col N="263" /> will have to spend two years assembling the data and allow the actuary another year.  If you want the position of the society in 1950 you must sit down and content yourself with a situation where it will be two years later before you get the figures.  The figures will be meaningless in the circumstances and of no value.  If I thought that they would be of any value I would be anxious to undertake it, but to divert staff to make long and involved calculations for two years in order to assemble the material and to employ an actuary to make an actuarial review and produce the figures would be no use to anybody.  Any information I have and any information which Senators want I will undertake to give and I will tie myself to that promise now so that it can be recalled when we are discussing the comprehensive scheme.  I hope that you will have dealt with the comprehensive scheme and enacted it long before you would be likely to get an actuarial review from the actuary.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's explanation of the difficulties but nevertheless I am not satisfied. The Minister says that it would take two years to assemble the data.  Suppose it does&mdash;since 1948 the two years have almost run.  I know very little about the internal running of the society but I did have occasion to inspect it and my conclusion about it was&mdash;and it is the opinion of investigators of office organisation and routine&mdash;that it must be one of the most efficiently run institutions in this country.  With the staff and their experience and with the machinery available there should be no very great difficulty in gathering the data necessary for the valuation.  My own feeling is that if the society had been working in a normal way that material and data would be available by now. I have regard to the fact that it takes over a year to carry out the actual calculations and I agree that it is a very tedious and exacting job but I am also satisfied that it would be possible for the actuary to carry out his investigation in less than 12 months. Even if it did take 12 months I think <Col N="264" /> we should still go ahead and present that valuation for 1948.  Assuming that the comprehensive scheme will be in force I think that in view of all the circumstances it is only reasonable since this society is being wound up that we should be given this final valuation.</P>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister said that it would seem to follow that there should be a valuation for the two years 1949 and 1950 and that there would be no point in having such a valuation made.  I do not think there is any necessity for a valuation for 1949 and 1950.  What I am concerned with is the quinquennial valuation which we should get for the year 1948.  I still feel that the Minister does not quite realise the importance of the matter and the necessity of having the valuation made for the five years in question and made public.  I again appeal to him to reconsider this matter.  1949 and 1950 will not be of any particular interest to me or anybody who is interested in these matters but we are genuinely interested in the conduct of the affairs of the society and the position of the society as at the 31st December, 1948.  Again let me express the hope that the Minister will see his way to having the valuation carried out and presented to us as early as possible.</P>

      <P>I am one who has no belief whatever in the value of actuarial investigations.  I am one of the heretics because of long experience of the result of such examinations. When I am told by an actuary that a fund with millions of money is insolvent I wonder what is meant by actuarial investigation.  Actuarial investigation is something different from a statement of assets and liabilities at a particular date.  It is not a balance sheet.  It is what is going to happen in the future to a particular fund.  It is largely in the nature of guesswork about what is to happen.  It is scientific guesswork if you could have such a thing.  The actuary has to assemble a lot of data and say if this happens or if that happens what will happen to the fund.  We should know what at a particular date are the assets of the fund, the amount of money in the <Col N="265" /> kitty, if you like, and not what is going to happen, if and when something, that is not likely to happen at all, will happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Ó Buachalla misconceives the position. The actual purpose of the actuarial review provided for in the 1942 Act was to see how much money could be made available for additional benefits, having regard to the pattern of expenditure over the previous five years.  The only purpose was to see what amount could be made available for additional benefits.  We have solved that problem in a very easy way.  We say that there is a sum of money provided here for these additional benefits for the next two years, and before the two years expire there will be provision made under the comprehensive scheme; so that provision is being made for the continuity of payments for additional benefits under this Bill, and will be made under the comprehensive scheme.  Why, then, switch staff which is urgently needed to work on the comprehensive scheme, and to integrate the society into the Department, to the task of collating statistics regarding membership, which will involve the expenditure of a considerable amount of time and, consequently, money in producing figures which are of no use to anybody, because the only purpose is to find out how much you could expend on additional benefits?  We are providing for that expenditure under this Bill, and in the comprehensive scheme.  I say this to Senator Ó Buachalla&mdash;I hope this year to produce the first Departmental Report on the work of my Department and, incidentally, a review of the finances of the National Health Insurance Society and, probably, the Senator will get more information in an up-to-date publication of that kind, than he will get by giving him information when it is of no value to him, information on what the finances of the society were five years before.  I think he will get all the information he wants in that Departmental Report in due course, in a matter of a few months, I think. <Col N="266" /> Clearly, there is no purpose in undertaking an actuarial examination for a particular purpose, when we have served that purpose, by the provision of the necessary sum of money for additional benefits in the Bill.</P>

What I would be very anxious to know is, that when we get a line on the new benefits, we should be able to see to what extent the society, if it were to operate under the old way, would fall short of the new scheme.  I think that there is nothing unreasonable in asking for information that will enable us to make a comparison.  The Minister says that he will make available benefits as good as would be made available under the old scheme.  I suggest he cannot make any such statement, in all fairness, since he does not know what we could make available under the old scheme, unless the quinquennial valuation is carried out in the way I was suggesting.</P>

      <P>Section 21 empowers the Minister to make payments out of the funds in respect of the acquisition of lands, premises, furniture or equipment, but that a payment shall not be made under sub-section (1) on or after the 1st day of July, 1954, save with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The first point I should like to have clarified by the Minister is why 1954.  The section empowers the Minister to spend the funds of the society on certain purposes, the acquisition of premises and so forth. It empowers him to do so, without the consent or without any obligation to consult or refer the matter to any other Minister, but on or after the 1st July, 1954, he divests himself of such powers.  For any transaction carried out after that date the consent of the Minister for Finance is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early sections of the Bill, we made provision for the Minister to make over the fund, and the fund is to be placed in charge of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance is empowered to invest the moneys, and he has an obligation to make available to the society the necessary finances to carry out its obligations to the insured persons.  There is no other Department of State that I am aware of or no other Minister in this State that can undertake expenditure without the prior consent of the Minister for Finance.  I should like to have, without detaining the House very long in the matter, some explanation from the Minister as to the reasons why he has taken on himself this responsibility; why he is prepared to divest <Col N="268" /> himself of this authority after the 1st July, 1954.  Finally, under sub-section (8), the section shall be deemed to come into operation on the 1st of July, 1949. If the Minister replies briefly to the points made, I think we will have a clearer indication of what the Minister is doing under the section.  Has there already been some expenditure undertaken and is the Minister now providing the payment out of the society's funds that he is taking over?</P>

      <P>In several amendments to this Bill and, particularly, in this amendment, Senator Hawkins is endeavouring to protect people who have not asked him to protect them, and who do not seem to need any protection from anybody.  He is now taking on the biggest task of all.  He is endeavouring to protect the Minister for Finance.  This is the first time I ever heard anybody in this House endeavouring to defend the Department of Finance, and endeavouring to say that the Department of Finance was getting less than it was entitled to. It should be remembered that this provision to which the consent of the Minister for Finance is not required is a temporary one.  It applies only for a special period of five years, without the consent of the Minister for Finance, and his Department has already approved of the terms of the Bill.  Now, what Senator Hawkins is saying is, that the Department of Finance erred in that particular respect, and that they should leave the provision here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With their knowledge of all the circumstances, the fullest possible knowledge&mdash;and I speak with some experience&mdash;what the Department does not ask you and find out about you is really not worth telling anybody.  The Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance know all about the circumstances, and, having investigated these circumstances, they have allowed this Bill to be put forward in this form, waiving the Minister's claim to give consent to certain things over a period of five years.  I have the greatest possible faith in the Department of Finance, apart from the Minister or any Minister.  My experience is that the Department is an unvarying <Col N="269" /> quantity, no matter what the name of the Minister or of his Party.  If, in this instance, they have agreed to do a particular thing, I do not know why we should set out to impose a responsibility on them which, in their judgment, they need not undertake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that Senator Hawkins would see an element of liberation in this section and would congratulate me on it.  If there is one gag with which Senators and Deputies are familiar, it is the gag about trying to get a decision from the Department of Finance.  How often have we, as Senators and in our various capacities, ranted about the difficulty of getting decisions?  How often have we expressed views that, if there were not so much red or green tape, the job could be done very much more quickly? This is a simple matter-of-fact approach to a realistic problem.  We want to acquire and equip the Store Street premises.  We want to enter into contracts to complete the Store Street premises.  If we have to consult every other Department which is remotely connected with Store Street and go to the Department of Finance with every 2½d. tender for any particular fitting or type of fitting or any work done, Store Street will not be acquired and equipped in the next ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to acquire these premises quickly and I want to complete the premises and equip them quickly because they are required for the accommodation of the staff in the Department in order to get on with the comprehensive scheme and to have a machine capable of administering it.  I despair absolutely of trying to complete and equip the premises, if I have to go to the Department of Finance to have every single proposal X-rayed and double X-rayed by that Department, with a litany of questions on every simple proposition put to them by people who have not grown up with the problem and to whom the acquisition of Store Street is one of 1,000,000 other tasks and who cannot be familiar with them all.  This proposition, therefore, is to allow us to purchase and <Col N="270" /> equip Store Street within a certain period.  Bear this in mind: the five-year period was put in as a period during which we felt all the work in connection with it would be cleared up. I hope to clear it up in a much shorter period and to shed this power which I want only for the limited functions set out in the section.  Getting the power, I want to utilise it speedily and to complete the job of purchasing and equipping the Store Street premises.</P>
    <P>It may be said that we should not buy and equip the Store Street premises.  That is one point of view, but, if it is decided to purchase and equip the place, surely we ought to get on with the job as quickly as possible.  This is a device to enable that to happen.  Senator Hawkins is concerned about protecting the Minister for Finance in this matter.  This Bill was approved by the Government and it was approved by the Department of Finance.  To that extent, therefore, the Minister for Finance has consented to the exercising by the Minister for Social Welfare of these powers for this limited purpose over a period of five years.  In other words, the Minister for Finance is perfectly satisfied that the Minister for Social Welfare will act prudently in this matter, and it is on that understanding that these powers are there for this limited function.  To that extent, it may be said that the Minister for Finance has been consulted in the matter.</P>
    <P>At all events, if we do want to get on with this job and to finish it, surely the thing to do is to give the Minister responsible for the Department the power to complete the job in the shortest possible time.  That is what this section is intended to do.  If we want to hamper the acquisition and equipment of the premises we can impose the obligation of going to the Department of Finance on every single matter and then Store Street five years hence will be very much like the Store Street of to-day.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that in this section the Minister is given a blank cheque from the Minister for Finance in respect of the expenditure of certain moneys and the doing of <Col N="271" /> certain things.  It is so seldom that people get blank cheques from the Department of Finance that I suggest to Senator Hawkins that he should withdraw this amendment which seeks to give the Minister for Finance the final word in the spending of this money.  There seems to be an element of appeal and urgency in the Minister's remarks.  He says it would take ten years to complete certain contracts if all the green and red tape had to be gone through.  It might happen that there would be a change of Government before the Store Street premises are completed and the present Minister might never occupy them.  I think there is a sinister villainy in the amendment by Senator Hawkins, in that he wants to create a position whereby the present Minister might never occupy these premises, and, having regard to the decisions he took in relation to it, I am sure that there is a desire on his part to preside in Store Street.  For that reason, I ask Senator Hawkins to withdraw his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Hayes says, the whole question will probably arise on the next amendment.  Senator Hayes suggested that I was making an attempt to defend people who did not require anybody to defend them. I will put it this way to the Minister and to the Seanad: I am attempting to defend the national health insured workers, of whom I am one myself.  It is their money, their fund, which is being taken over and it is their blank cheque which is being issued to the Minister, as Senator O'Reilly has pointed out.  It is not money provided by the Oireachtas.  It is money accumulated to the credit of the national health insured workers, and it is in their interests and on their behalf that I speak.  It is because I want to ensure so far as I can that before any of that money is expended <Col N="272" /> there will be the closest investigation and a decision by more than one person, and particularly a decision by somebody other than the Minister into whose custody and care the money is being transferred.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to say: &ldquo;We are going to purchase a particular building and we are going to do a particular job.&rdquo;  If the Minister gives a guarantee that he will extract from the Minister for Finance the sum required, as he should, for the purpose of acquiring premises suitable to house this new Department I will have no objection, if the Minister for Finance is prepared to give the Minister for Social Welfare a blank cheque and to say to him: &ldquo;Acquire for yourself and the Department the best and biggest accommodation you can get in the city.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am surprised at the attitude of Senator Tunney, who was so long a member of a trade union organisation consisting of insured workers in general.  I am surprised that he would not join in support of a demand that if some of this money has to be spent it should at least be spent under proper care and supervision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>() Payment shall not be made out of the fund for the purchase or acquisition or in respect of expenditure by the Minister on the acquisition of premises the property of Córas Iompair Éireann at Store Street planned and partly completed by Córas Iompair Éireann as a central bus terminus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already, on the previous amendment, elicited some little information from the Minister.  We now know that sub-section (2), which provides that a payment shall not be paid under sub-section (1) on or after the 1st July, 1954, save with the consent of the Minister for Finance, is for the <Col N="273" /> purpose of ensuring that Store Street may be purchased and equipped by that date.  The purpose of this section is to give power to the Minister to acquire a particular building.  I doubt if, from the reading of the section, members of either House would be aware of what particular building is in question or whether the Minister proposes to erect a new building. However, the Minister himself told us on the Second Stage, and quite definitely a few moments ago, that the purpose of the section is to purchase the building erected by Córas Iompair Éireann as a central bus station in Store Street.  There are three or four very important aspects of this whole matter.  There is, firstly, the fact that we have given power to the Minister to take over £6,500,000 of national health insurance funds.  On a rough estimate, £1,000,000 of that money is to be spent on acquiring in Store Street a building erected for a totally different purpose.  On the last occasion, the Minister said that Córas Iompair Éireann had decided to sell Store Street.  I should like to get some information from the Minister on that point, and I am sure it is available, because this matter must have got very close consideration and negotiations must have been entered upon.  Yet nobody seems to know at the moment what has been done or what progress has been made.  I do not want to go into the merits or demerits of Store Street as against Smithfield.  That question does not enter into the discussion at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter before us is whether we approve of the proposal contained in the section to empower the Minister to purchase this building. I think the building is unsuitable for the purpose for which the Minister proposes to acquire it.  It was erected at the outset for a totally different purpose.  Nobody has carried out an inspection of the building, but I am sure the Minister and the officers of his Department must know that there is almost as large a part of it under ground level as there is over ground, that the building was designed to <Col N="274" /> serve as a bus terminus, and that a considerable sum of money must be spent to bring it into conformity with the requirements of the Minister as headquarters for his Department.  It was decided some years ago that a central bus station was essential, and protests were made in this House, and in the other House on many occasions, in connection with the existing accommodation for bus passengers.  The Minister, as was pointed out on the last occasion, occupies an important position, and being Minister for Social Welfare, I am sure that the question of catering for the public at large is just as much a matter of his responsibility as catering for the relatively small section of the community who will be transferred to his care under this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The public at large are very interested, and I am sure would voice their opinion in a most emphatic way in connection with this matter were an opportunity presented to them to do so.  Now that it is proposed that the Minister should acquire these premises, we should have from him a very clear statement as to the estimated cost of erecting the building to the specification of Córas Iompair Éireann and what the estimated cost of adapting the building to his requirements will be.  Is he prepared to issue a blank cheque to Córas Iompair Éireann to complete the building, or is the work of adapting it to his requirements going to be carried out by the same architect, the same engineer and the same contractors? These are all matters which the Minister should make very clear to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another consideration to which I think I drew the attention of the Minister on the last occasion is that we are dealing here with the fund of a very small section of the people who will benefit by the comprehensive social security scheme or who will come under the control, as it were, of the Minister for Social Welfare.  Because that small section happens to be a <Col N="275" /> prosperous section, because of the fact that they had £6,500,000 in investments&mdash;whether these investments are in black India, darkest Africa or in British securities elsewhere, does not matter so long as the moneys are there; if they were not there I do not think we would have this Bill before us tonight&mdash;a proposal is now made that the moneys of this society be utilised for the purpose of acquiring a building for the Department of Social Welfare. On the Second Reading the Minister suggested that it would be much better to have the moneys of the society invested in bricks and mortar here at home rather than in British securities. He went further and guaranteed that if the moneys were so invested, the society's funds would not suffer a loss as a result and that provision would be made for paying the same rate of interest on the money as would have been paid on it from the original investments.  If the Minister can explain to me or to the House what benefit a transaction of that kind is to the Exchequer I shall be very glad to hear it.  I am sure that if the Minister for Finance set about providing the £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 that may be necessary to secure accommodation for the Department, by erecting a new building or by acquiring some suitable premises, the Minister for Finance would secure that money at a much cheaper rate of interest from the community as a whole than the rate that will now have to be paid on the moneys of the National Health Insurance Society to ensure that they will earn as much by way of refund from the Minister for Finance, as they would earn if they were invested abroad.</P>
    <P>The only difference is that the £1,000,000 is there to be withdrawn and the Minister for Finance will have to raise the extra £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 that may be necessary.  I feel very strongly in this matter.  I do not think it is right in principle to utilise the funds of this society for the purpose of acquiring the necessary accommodation for the Department of Social Welfare; secondly, I do not think it is right to deprive the travelling public <Col N="276" /> of the facilities they require.  Other speakers may wish to go into the question of the original decision to erect this building.  I do not intend to do that since it might lead to a very prolonged discussion.  I do press upon the Minister the acceptance of this amendment. If a building is necessary, there is ample space available elsewhere on which to erect that building.  It is not even necessary that the building should be in Dublin, as I have already pointed out.  Even at the eleventh hour, I appeal to the Minister to give serious reconsideration to the step he is taking, with a view to depriving the travelling public of facilities to which they have long been entitled, and also to the question of utilising the society's funds for the purpose of supplying accommodation for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>Much play has been made in this discussion upon the fact that this money belongs to the contributors. That is so.  But nobody has shown how the contributors will lose as a result of the taking over of this fund.  May I point out that it is not the first fund that has been taken over, and not by this Government?  Other funds of £2,000,000 and £3,000,000 were taken over in the past.  I do not think that the people interested in those funds lost anything.  I do not think the people now will lose anything. Remember, the power which the contributors have over this fund is a limited power.  If the contributors met together in the Phoenix Park to-morrow, they could have no say in the disposal of the fund, because it is under the control of the Government and the National Health Insurance Society works within limits imposed by the Government.  Objection is taken to erecting a suitable building and taking the money out of the funds for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Banking concerns, industrial companies and commercial firms put their money into buildings and those buildings are always shown in the balance sheet as a valuable asset.  Even if £1,000,000 is used in the adaptation of this particular building, it will still be an asset to the credit of the fund, if <Col N="277" /> the fund is there, and to the credit of the Government.  It will not be thrown into the Liffey.  Nobody has shown that the contributors will lose as a result of this action.  I wonder would the same objection be taken if the Minister were to spend £1,000,000 in erecting new buildings in Merrion Street or Merrion Square.  Is the real objection the fact that the money is being used in adapting this particular building? It must be admitted that some building is necessary.  It must be admitted that money will have to be spent in providing some building.  To me it does not matter a great deal whether that money is taken out of this particular fund or out of the pockets of the taxpayers. I do not think there is any real substance in the objection since it has not been shown to me that anybody will lose as a result of this action.</P>

      <P>Section 21, which we have partly discussed, empowers the Minister to spend money on acquiring premises.  This amendment seeks to limit him by excluding one particular building.  This amendment lays it down: &ldquo;You can buy any premises anywhere you like, but this you must not touch.&rdquo;  I shall not argue whether or not it is an ideal building for this purpose.  Suppose the Minister does not buy this particular building.  What will happen to it?  Are there any other buyers in the market?  Is there any guarantee that it will even be used for its original purpose?  Will it be left lying there, like an unfinished symphony?</P>
      <P>It has been said that a building is best suited for the thing it was designed to serve.  That may be, but a great many of the buildings around us to-day were not designed for the purpose they now serve.  Leinster House was never designed to house an Irish Parliament.  The Irish Parliament buildings were never designed originally to house the Bank of Ireland.  The Georgian mansions were never designed to house tenement dwellers in Dublin. The morgue was never intended to be the Abbey Theatre or Conciliation Hall to be a newspaper office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go on and give you a long list of buildings converted and adapted through the years which admirably <Col N="278" /> serve the purpose for which they were adapted.  This building might be converted to a bus station if there was somebody with sufficient money to buy it over and use it as a bus station.  I do not want to see the Store Street premises left unfinished as a monument to somebody's lack of vision.  A private company undertook to build a building somewhere; I shall not say where nor for what purpose.  They had not enough money to finish it and they left it so.  We have no power to compel any company to buy that building.</P>
    <P>Now, accommodation must be procured somewhere.  Is it worse to spend money buying a building half completed than to start from the ground up and build another?  The fact that the Minister might be debarred from buying this building, if we pass this amendment and the Dáil agrees, would not reconvert it back to its original purpose.  There is no guarantee that it would.  There is no hope that if it is not used for the purpose for which it could be used it will be used for any other purpose.  Mention has been made of how much is underground and how much is over the ground.  I do not know, but I am sure it will be possible to utilise most of the premises as offices since that is the purpose for which it was originally designed.</P>

      <P>Senator Tunney mentions the Custom House.  I do not know whether the Custom House was originally designed to look after old age pensions.  This building in Store Street was designed and intended to house a clerical staff of 800.  Surely it can be used for a staff of 1,000 and the portion which was not intended originally for staff can be adapted to accommodate them.  I have not heard any arguments&mdash;I shall not enter into a discussion as to the merits or demerits of a bus station&mdash;that would <Col N="279" /> indicate to me that this is not as good a bargain as one could get under the circumstances and that, having been acquired, it will not turn out to be as good a building as one could get in any other way.</P>

I appreciate the merciful tenderness with which the Minister handled me in his reply, but I would have appreciated it even more had he been good enough not merely to dispute the facts but to refute them.  May I ask him now for a clear statement on some of the points I raised then?  As far as I am concerned, it is relevant to the voting on this amendment.  I think it is closely relevant to what my constituents and the public at large would like to read in the paper to-morrow about the discussion of the Bill.  First of all, is it a fact or is it not a fact that the public will lose £10,000 a year income by converting these premises into offices?  Secondly, is it a fact or is it not a fact that 800 people could easily be accommodated in the upper part of the building, leaving the rest of the building for its original purpose &mdash;the 200 other civil servants who will need accommodation being easily accommodated elsewhere in the city? They must be working somewhere at the moment and I do not see why they could not stay there for a little while longer.  Thirdly, is it a fact or is it not a fact that the Smithfield site&mdash;&mdash;</P>

To come back to what I was saying, has the Minister considered or has he not considered the compromise which I suggested at our last meeting?  I submit that that is relevant to this amendment.  I should like to receive a definite reply to that question.  The Minister stated last Wednesday that Córas Iompair Éireann does not want the Store Street premises and cannot pay for them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The negotiations commenced with Córas Iompair Éireann only after they decided that the premises were for sale.  We did not covet the premises.  They were not able to complete the premises and they said that in any case they did not want them.  It was only then that we said: &ldquo;If that is the position, we will negotiate to purchase the premises because we need a central headquarters.&rdquo; Now the question arises as to whether these premises are suitable. We are satisfied, after having surveyed the accommodation requirements of the Department and after having ascertained the number of staff that will have to be accommodated, that the Store Street building in its entirety will accommodate the staff of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because it will accommodate the staff of the Department and because there are invested funds which can be utilised to purchase the premises that we decided to proceed with negotiations to acquire them. The question of when or where a bus depot should be provided or as to who should provide it is not a matter for this Bill and is not a matter for me.  With the utmost sympathy for the bus-travelling community, I have no <Col N="285" /> power to erect a bus depot or to make Córas Iompair Éireann proceed with the construction of the present building and to pay for it when it is constructed.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford asks what would happen if we did not purchase the building.  I do not know.  I presume it would remain there as an aesthetic companion to the gasometer.  Then all the artists would write letters to the <i>Irish Times</i> and the editor would write himself away lamenting that this companion piece was not completed as one of Ireland's 1950 art creations.  My simple position in connection with Store Street is that we want a building and that this is a suitable building.  If we do not buy it, it will be a rookery, a monument to those who ordered it and could not complete it.  We propose to buy it and to convert it.  I understand that the adaptation of the building will not cost very much money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said to Senator Hawkins that some adaptation would be necessary.  In consultation with the architect, we are satisfied that it will not be very costly.  In any case, we will be able to dispense with some of the refinements which were contemplated by Córas Iompair Éireann and that will go against the cost of the adaptation.  Therefore, one need not contemplate any extensive expenditure on adaptation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple question is&mdash;Is this a <Col N="286" /> good bargain from the point of view of the Department of Social Welfare and will it do the job we have in mind?  We think it will.  Bear in mind, when talking about invested moneys of the national health insurance fund, that Árus Brugha, the present headquarters of the society, was purchased out of moneys provided from the national health insurance funds.  It turned out to be a good investment and I hope, in time, Store Street will be an equally successful investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the limits within which we are allowed to travel on this amendment, the Minister has failed to make a case for the purchase of Store Street.  If completed by Córas Iompair Éireann the building would be completed out of funds provided by the taxpayer or the people of this country.  There is no use in suggesting that if the present proposal is not carried out, there will be an unfinished monument left to 1950.  If such a monument were to be left there, uncompleted, it would be a monument to a political campaign carried out in the last general election.  The whole position in which we find ourselves in connection with Store Street and many other undertakings arises from that campaign.</P>
      <P>The money to complete the building, whether it is expended by the Minister for Social Welfare for his Department or by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the purpose for which it was originally intended, will come out of the pockets of the people.  In this case it will come out of the pockets of a certain section of the people who have contributed to a fund to provide benefits for themselves.  If the members here were free to give expression to their views and to record their opinions by a vote in this House, they would indicate that it is bad national policy that because of statements made, sometimes without due regard to their seriousness or without a sense of responsibility or a sense of ever being in a position to give effect to them, people should be forced into a position such as we have to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister argues that Árus Brugha was purchased out of the funds <Col N="287" /> of the society when the society was co-ordinated in 1933.  That is correct; but that building was purchased to house the employees of the society and not to house the civil servants of a big Department.  There is that vast difference.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell suggests that if a bank proposes to build they put the value of the building against their assets.  It will be very poor consolation to insured workers if they find in the balance sheet of the National Health Insurance Society, on the credit side, £2,000,000 investment in Store Street while at the same time if increases are to be given under the comprehensive insurance scheme they will come by way of increased contributions. The question, as the Minister said, has been argued both here and in the other House.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to record that it is not true to say that Córas Iompair Éireann proposed to abandon the building or offered the building for sale.  I have yet failed to elicit, either from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Social Welfare or any person connected with that organisation when the decision was made.  It is quite possible that, if the building were offered to the public for sale in the morning, a buyer would be found for it who would convert it to some other purpose.  A decision was made. The company were forced into the position of abandoning the building.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in the Dáil on another occasion that Córas Iompair Éireann were to complete the building and, having completed it to the satisfaction and the requirements of the Department of Social Welfare, the Department were to take over this building and the matter of cost would be arranged.  If Córas Iompair Éireann are in a position to complete the building to the satisfaction, and to meet the requirements of, the Department, then, having got that far, and with the possibility of an income arising from the facilities that would be there &mdash;cinemas and restaurants and so forth &mdash;it would be a paying proposition, together with supplying accommodation <Col N="288" /> for the clerical staff and supplying the public with a long-felt want.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell asked would I object to the expenditure of this money in erecting a building in Merrion Square or elsewhere.  I would object to the expenditure of the society's funds in erecting a building for the Department of Social Welfare because, while the Department may require a building, I think it is the duty and the responsibility of the Department to provide that building and not to fall back on one single unit to finance the whole undertaking.</P>

      <P>The Minister stressed over and over again that the reason this building is available to him for purchase is that Córas Iompair Éireann were unable to complete it for themselves and they do not want it.  I wish to have it on record that I dispute that statement.  I would like to repeat, if I could, what Senator Hawkins said. I never saw proof of that statement&mdash; we had nothing save the Minister's word.  Córas Iompair Éireann has Government backing.  If it wishes to complete the building, I believe it could do so.  The old Córas Iompair Éireann and the present Córas Iompair Éireann were to a certain extent subject to Government direction and I believe the change in view with regard to the completion of this building occurred with the change of Government. I have not any doubt of that. If another Government were in power this building would be completed and it would be an addition to Dublin and the purpose for which it was being erected would be achieved.  I protest against the conversion of this building into anything but what it was originally planned for.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that the Store Street structure was offered by the company to the Government.  I am not satisfied that that was so and I would like the Minister to inform us when and by what means this structure was so offered. <Col N="290" /> The Minister should back up that statement by informing the House when and how the offer was made.  It is a matter in which the public and the members of this House are interested.</P>
      <P>I am very annoyed with the Minister &mdash;probably he did not intend to make the statement&mdash;because of what he said about Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash; that Córas Iompair Éireann was a bankrupt concern and could not finish that particular structure.  He started by saying &ldquo;company&rdquo; but he did not stick to that and he introduced &ldquo;Córas Iompair Éireann.&rdquo;  There are people who have an interest in Córas Iompair Éireann, irrespective of whether it is semi-nationalised or completely nationalised.  It is not a good thing to hear a Minister destroying the reputation of a company or doing damage to the reputation of an important transport undertaking.  I am not suggesting the Minister deliberately did it, but he certainly did so by accident.</P>
      <P>I could not refrain from saying that if Córas Iompair Éireann did find itself in financial difficulties in regard to many of its activities, including the completion of this building, its reputation should not have been assailed in such a manner.  Irrespective of where a building of this nature should be, I think it will be agreed that there is a definite need for a building of the type for which the Store Street building was planned.</P>

      <P>Is this not an amendment to prevent the Department from acquiring a particular building for its own purpose and is not the Senator going completely outside the ruling given by the Cathaoirleach?  We discussed all this on the Transport Bill. The Minister for Social Welfare has no power whatever in this matter, and no amendment could possibly be proposed to this Bill which would turn Store Street or any other building into a bus station.  There is no power in this Bill to do it and no amendment could be suggested which would do it. Therefore, in accordance with the ruling already given, the Senator cannot follow the line he is taking; he is bringing us back to the Transport Bill, where we had a division, and we decided this point.</P>

I should like to have the facts. As the Minister made that statement at least three times, I am sure he will not have any objection to give the fullest information to the House.  I did not intend to make any statement which might be a reflex of the debate on the Transport Bill.  If I erred in that respect, it is because people who are better parliamentarians than I, and who have more experience, went along that road, and it was a road I thought I could usefully follow up.  I thought I was merely paraphrasing the Minister's statement; perhaps I was not doing so very correctly.  I would welcome a statement from the Minister as to when the offer was made and under what circumstances.

      <P>If the Senator wants to have a chat about this, I suggest that he had better go to the Kings-bridge and interview the general manager or the chairman and find out when they decided to sell it and why, and also when they thought of negotiating with us about it.  The plain fact of the matter is that there have been negotiations between Córas Iompair Éireann and the Department of Social Welfare with a view to the acquisition of this building.  These negotiations will, I anticipate, be brought to a conclusion at an early date.  What does the Senator think Córas Iompair Éireann are negotiating with us about? The fact that these negotiations are taking place indicate clearly that they propose to sell the Store Street building to us.  The negotiations are on that basis.  Why Córas Iompair Éireann decided to do that is a matter for Córas Iompair Éireann.  We simply came into the negotiations when they had decided the premises were for sale, firstly, because they do not want it and, secondly, because they could not pay for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised that the Minister should take up that attitude with Senator O'Reilly.  Surely, he does not suggest that if anyone were to knock at the door of Córas Iompair Éireann and say, &ldquo;I want to see the secretary or general manager to-morrow morning to discuss with him what led up to the proposed sale of the Store Street premises to the Department of Social Welfare,&rdquo; that he is going to get a definite answer.  I suggest, with all respect, that if Senator O'Reilly, or any other Senator, were to attempt to elicit information of that kind from the railway authorities, he would be thrown out&mdash;that is if he had been let in at all. I would not blame the people in Córas Iompair Éireann for not letting him in. There is no use in trying to side track the thing in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great number of people in this country believe that what is being <Col N="293" /> proposed here is really a terrible mistake.  We, on this side of the House, believe that.  There are people on the other side of the House who, no matter what they say to the contrary, also believe it.  As I say, a great many people believe this is a terrible mistake and that it is an attempt to justify speeches that have been made in the past.  That may be a rather strong statement for me to make, but I believe it to be true.  The Minister says that negotiations are taking place between Córas Iompair Éireann and the Department of Social Welfare and that if Córas Iompair Éireann did not want to get rid of the premises, that the negotiations would not be taking place.  I would like to ask the Minister who made the first move.  Did the Córas Iompair Éireann authorities approach the Minister and say to him: &ldquo;Now, we would like very much to get rid of the Store Street premises; we believe it was a terrible mistake to build it and so would your Department please consider the possibility of taking it off our hands&rdquo;.  If the Minister could tell us that that is so, it would change my attitude.  To suggest that any information we want on a matter of this kind can only be got by rapping at the door at Kings-bridge and saying to the general <Col N="294" /> manager or secretary: &ldquo;The Táiniste sent me up to get an answer to the following questions; I am in a terrible hurry, as the Seanad is waiting to get the information&rdquo;, is not to take a question of this kind in a serious way. The Minister should take the House a little more seriously than that.</P>

      <P>Before Section 22 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Any officer or employee of the society may before the transfer day resign his position with the society, and may apply to the committee of management for compensation for loss of his office and the committee may if they are satisfied that such officer or employee had good and sufficient reason for so resigning grant with the consent of the Minister compensation at the rate of one month's salary as at the date of his resignation for each year of his service with the society.</P>
      <P>(2)  The society is hereby empowered to provide that the total amount of compensation under this section may be paid out of the funds provided for the administration of benefits and no contribution shall be payable under Section 3 of the Act of 1911 out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas in respect of such compensation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slight difference.  This proposes that where an employee does not wish to be taken over and where the committee of management are satisfied that the reasons given by the person are good and sufficient for his resignation, they may be empowered to grant him compensation for loss of office at the rate of one month's salary for every clear year of service.  I think that is the usual system in the Civil Service.  We have argued this on the other amendments in regard to pension rights.  This proposes to make provision for those who may not be entitled to a pension.  The Minister has serious objection to any person being put on pension.  He must agree that, where a person has given <Col N="296" /> service to the society and is not prepared to go over to the Civil Service, some compensation should be made to him.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go into the whole question of persons employed as agents in rural districts and what their functions will be when we get the new scheme.  We may have an opportunity of debating that when the new Bill is before us.  The Minister is quite aware that many agents throughout the country are and have been engaged in public life, some even as members of this or the other House or as members of local authorities.  I mentioned earlier to-day that by transferring such persons to the Civil Service you are depriving them of certain rights they now enjoy.  This is one of the rights I had in mind.  You are taking these people into the Civil Service without their consent, by an Act of the Oireachtas, and depriving them of the right they enjoy at present of offering themselves as candidates before the public as members of local authorities or of either House of the Oireachtas.  If there are such persons&mdash;as there are up and down the country&mdash;and for that reason or for any other good reason in the opinion of the society they are prepared to allow them to accept their resignation, I say that, having given such good service to the society in the past, having built up an efficient organisation, and with the knowledge that there is such a huge sum to the credit of the society, the least they would expect from the Minister is compensation as suggested in this amendment, which I would not say is too generous.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Senator Hawkins sees that this proposition is not a practical one?  The committee of management will disappear, I believe, within the next month or so. Then where will they be?  Apart from that, I have some grave doubts that the committee of management would undertake that responsibility.  It would be hard to satisfy them, as I know them, that anyone who is offered a chance of going over to the Civil Service should be compensated because he says he would not go. <Col N="297" /> However, I am looking at it principally from the practical point of view, that the committee of management will not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that the committee of management will exist until the transfer date on which the Minister takes over the functions of the society.  The agents and employees, with the knowledge of the provisions of this Bill and what it means to them, will have an opportunity prior to that date of tendering their resignation to the committee and the committee could then examine it in the light of their knowledge of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Senator Hawkins had some difficulty when he came to draft this amendment. According to the amendment he wants to provide compensation for the loss of office.  There is nobody losing office unless by his own free will.  A person might decide that he will not work in the Department of Social Welfare but he is not losing office by any regulations of mine or any of the provisions of this Bill.  Instead he is being offered good regular employment and conditions with a regular income for working in the Department on transfer from the National Health Insurance Society. Are we seriously to contemplate that with that offer of work available we will say to the person concerned: &ldquo;If you don't want to work there we will compensate you and give you one month's salary for every year of service&rdquo;? Is there any precedent for that?  Under the 1933 National Health Insurance Act which set up the present society it was provided that if an offer of employment was made to a member of the staff of the former society that offer of employment carried the same implication that a person did not qualify for compensation if he did not accept the employment. Here in this case the staff are being offered employment and there is no loss of money so far as they are concerned but there surely is no case to suggest, that if a person did not like working in the Department, that they should be paid compensation.  Is there any case for paying compensation to any person just because they do not like to work for the Department of Social Welfare? <Col N="298" /> This seems to be a case of the Brewster millions being enacted into social legislation. I put it to Senator Hawkins that from his point of view and from the national point of view, the best advice he could give members of the society is to go and work while they are able to work and be glad to be transferred under such good conditions.  So far as I am concerned and so far as the provisions of this Bill go there is no question of anybody losing office and if people will not take the employment offered simply because they do not want to work in the Department there should be no question of giving them compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made reference on more than one occasion to the fact that he is not depriving anyone of employment.  We appreciate that, but he referred to the fact that the staffs of the present society were taken over from the former societies. They were taken over into civilian employment, but in this case by transferring them and making them civil servants, they are depriving them of many rights.  Many of these people were 45 years and over and if such people feel that a transfer into the Civil Service is not suitable for them and deprives them of rights which they presently enjoy and therefore they do not want to become civil servants, I feel that those people should be compensated. Some of these people, for instance, engage in public life as members of local authorities and under the new arrangement they would not be permitted to continue as such after transfer.  That might be the type of life from which they did not wish to change.</P>

      <P>So far as those members of local authorities are concerned, while I do not propose to put any provisions in the Bill which would provide statutory rights, I propose to make inquiries as to the number of persons so concerned and we may be able to deal with the matter of preserving these rights for them, but that does not apply to membership of the Dáil or Seanad.  It can be done by administrative action and is not a statutory function.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister should go further.  If there are a number of people who are members of the Dáil and Seanad and who are likely to be transferred I do not think they should be excluded from any benefits just because they happen to be members of the Dáil or Seanad.  I believe that any man who loses his employment because of Government action should be compensated.  To say that a man has the option of going into the Civil Service and should not be compensated just because he will not work in the Department is not a fair way to put the matter.  To put it simply, a man who will not transfer because he would not be able to continue membership of local bodies or of the Dáil or Seanad in certain circumstances, should be compensated. It was not a question of giving compensation to men of 21 or 22 years, for there for very few of that category in either House.  It was really a question of men of 45 years and over.  I think if there any at all they must be around the 50-mark and I suggest that the Minister should include them in any provision he intends to make.</P>

      <P>Is there not an old prohibition under the Electoral Act prohibiting members of the Defence Forces and temporary and permanent civil servants from being members of the Dáil or Seanad?  You cannot, under the Electoral Act, be a member of the Civil Service and a member of the Dáil or Seanad.  That is the position, and the Minister would need, therefore, to amend the Electoral Act if he wants to make an employee of the National Health Insurance Society who becomes a civil servant eligible for the Dáil or Seanad.  That is asking a very great deal indeed.  The Minister suggests that when such people are members of local bodies he could, by an administrative act, let them continue, but to make a civil servant eligible for the Dáil or Seanad involves a very big principle.  As a matter of fact, we considered putting down a motion on the fact that the general tendency in legislation is to take more people under the State and exclude more people from eligibility for the Dáil or Seanad.  This would be a piecemeal example.  It would be very difficult for the Minister to amend the Electoral Act so as to allow people who are employed in the National Health Insurance Society and who go into the Civil Service to be members of the Dáil or Seanad.  It would be impossible.</P>

      <P>One or two at the most. <Col N="301" /> I do not know, as a matter of fact, whether these members give personal service as agents.  I am quite sure that a Deputy who comes up to Dublin on a Monday for a Dáil sitting on Tuesday and goes home on Friday is not working as a national health insurance agent, or else pretty bad service is being rendered.  I imagine that the person concerned would be the holder of the agency, but that in fact he is not performing the duties of the post.  He certainly could not do so if he were required to be in Dublin for the purpose of attending the House.  To that extent one cannot look at this from the point of view of an agent who is deprived of his position.  The agent concerned does not render personal service in respect of his appointment.</P>

      <P>The Minister is very well served by Senator Hayes.  I do not want to fly off the handle; I do not do it very often, but when I do I am <Col N="302" /> serious.  What I wanted to get at was: when a man was appointed to those jobs was it not understood that they were not whole-time jobs?  I know several around the country and some of them run little shops, while others own a few acres and work them.  In my judgment, the payment they were getting could not support them.  The Minister said that they cannot work whole-time at their job, but the same thing might be said of school teachers. When a school teacher comes up to the Seanad or Dáil he does not close up his school; he gets someone else to run it, and I think it would not be impossible to get a man in a town who could run an office of that kind for three or four days of the week.  We should not take the line on this that we have taken on other measures of allowing ourselves to drift into the idea that only the chosen few can become members of this House and the other House and that those who do must pay the penalty.  I am not suggesting that a man should be allowed to remain in the job and at the same time remain a member of this or the other House, but in the specific circumstances and in view of the fact that as the Minister says there are only one or two who would come under the heading at all, I suggest that in all fairness those people should be given the option of getting in or getting out, and if they decide to get out they should be compensated. We should not have a whole lot of controversy or say that because a man is a member of the Seanad or Dáil he is one of the untouchables.  We have too much of that.</P>

I will offer a job there to anybody who is an agent at the moment, but he must realise that another Act disqualifies him from membership of the Dáil or Seanad if he takes that job.  That is not a matter for me to remedy, but I am prepared to continue his services as an agent.</P>

I do not care what side he is on.  Would the Minister go so far as to say that if a man, having seriously considered the matter, decided to stay a member of the Seanad or Dáil, as soon as he failed to be a member of the Seanad or Dáil he would still be offered his employment in the Department of Social Welfare?</P>

      <P>I have listened to this debate with great interest and all I can say is that I think it a most outrageous imposition on anybody, not to speak of Deputies and Senators, that he should be compelled to become a civil servant or join the unemployed.  Once you become a civil servant, you are tied down by certain regulations and your soul, as it were, must be kept in subjection. I would not be a civil servant under any Government for anything. Let us have freedom first.  Possibly it is a very nice job, but your freedom is gone.  In the case of the boys or girls who enter the Civil Service through an examination, they do so of their own free will, but I think that it is outrageous that any person should be compulsorily sent into a slave job&mdash; I use the word &ldquo;slave&rdquo; as referring to the mind and not in the physical sense.  It is a most outrageous tyranny to compel people, young or old, to become civil servants, if they do not want to, or to join the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the points made by Senator Hayes and Senator Quirke have brought clearly to the <Col N="304" /> minds of Senators the necessity for some provision in relation to the persons I have in mind.  You are depriving certain members of the staff of this society of rights which they now enjoy.  I appreciate that an amendment of other Acts for which this Minister has no responsibility is involved in this matter, but the proposal I put before the House in this amendment is quite simple.  We will all agree that a person now holding a position with the society, whether as an agent or as any other officer, who has a right to offer himself as a candidate for this or the other House has the chance of becoming not only a member of either House, but of becoming a Minister, or even Taoiseach, and quite possibly in the ranks of the 600 persons employed there are people who are capable of holding these offices, if elected.  We are depriving them of that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine to say that we are offering them secure positions in the Civil Service.  In the case of a young person who voluntarily decides to enter the Civil Service and to adopt a Civil Service career, it is his own decision, but when you compel persons who have led a particular type of life, who are interested in a particular mode of life and who are probably interested in the national and political life of the country to do so, you deprive them of their opportunities.  That is only one side of the matter.  There are other reasons, such as family ties, small businesses in which they are engaged and so on, for which they would not feel justified in entering the service.  No matter how glowing a picture the Minister may paint with regard to conditions of employment and pension rights, there is a large section of the people of the country who would not enter the Civil Service, if, to-morrow morning, the doors were thrown wide open to them to enter without any examination, as there are others who would rush to break down the doors in order to get in, but who would be doing that of their own free will.  Senator Quirke put a proposal to the Minister that, where persons who are members of this or the other House, or of any local authority, might be compelled by the regulations to relinquish their posts <Col N="305" /> while members of this or the other House, in the event of their ceasing to be members, they should be entitled to re-employment in their former posts which they lost through being transferred to the Civil Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is possible to provide for that in this Bill. Quite clearly, the Department of Finance, which is the authority for the recruitment of staff to the Civil Service, would have to be consulted, but I will have the point examined, and, if the Senator wishes, I will discuss the matter with him or with those members of the Dáil or Seanad who are affected by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are at most only two or three persons whom Senators have in mind, would it not have been simpler to specify these people and the compensation to which they were entitled, as has been done in other measures?  An amendment of this sort could not be confined to two or three people:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any officer or employee of the society may, before the transfer date, resign his position with the society ... for good and sufficient reasons.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The good and sufficient reasons mentioned in the case of the particular unmentioned number are that, if they remain in the society, they cannot continue as members of the Dáil or Seanad, but the same applies to every other employee.  If they remain in the society and are transferred to the Civil Service, they cannot become members of the Dáil or Seanad.  They undergo exactly the same disability and suffer the same penalty, and there is no proposal whatever to compensate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it affects only two or three people, or half a dozen people who at present are members of the Dáil or Seanad and are thereby debarred from coming under the terms of the Bill, it would have been easier to put a clause <Col N="306" /> in the Bill or to draft a different sort of amendment setting out that this particular provision does not apply to them or that compensation will be allowed in the case of temporary agents who, because of their position in public life, cannot be taken over. An amendment of this sort, however, though it is well intentioned&mdash;and I agree that there is a principle involved and that there are certain people who will suffer because they must choose between remaining in public life or being taken over into the Civil Service&mdash;would not provide for the exceptional cases, and there should be some way of providing for these cases.  The intention is to provide for exceptional cases, but the amendment is wide enough to be taken advantage of by the whole 600 employees.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be as well to make it clear that most of these agents who are employed, in the rural areas especially&mdash;excepting those employed in the cities and large urban centres&mdash;are part-time agents, with other jobs of one kind or another, as Senator Quirke has said.  As I understand it, they will be taken over, but they will still be part-time servants, just as there are part-time postmen and part-time servants in other capacities. They will still be able to carry on their other businesses&mdash;their shops, their insurance work or whatever they may be engaged in.  There will be no interference with their activities in that respect.  Some of them may be county councillors or members of other local bodies, and the Minister says that he is inquiring into the position and he may be able to deal with these people administratively.  The only question then that would arise would be that in respect of the person who wished to be a member of the Dáil or Seanad, or who is a member of the Dáil or Seanad at the moment, and, as has been explained, the Minister has no power whatever to say: &ldquo;You may be a member of the Dáil or Seanad and, at the same time, a part-time agent&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with another point.  When I said that the Department of Finance would have to be consulted, that was in reply to the point raised by Senator Quirke: would the person have a kind of right to go into the Civil Service if at any time he ceased to be a member of the Dáil or Seanad?  That is a right which might not be exercised for ten or 15 years and, therefore, he would not be transferred under this Bill.  The Department of Finance would have to be consulted on a matter of that kind.  If, however, it was the desire to provide compensation, other than cash compensation, for the one or two persons who are members of the Dáil and who may be affected adversely by this Bill, whatever is done will have to be done before the transfer date.  In other words, if we desire to compensate them by assigning one or two posts to the members of the families concerned, the resignations would have to take place almost immediately, and the <Col N="309" /> society would be asked to appoint a member of the family in lieu of the person who is a Deputy.  I guarantee to have the matter examined myself by consulting the wishes of the one or two persons concerned in the matter.</P>

      <P>It is not often that <Col N="311" /> one takes farewell of a Bill of this character with any degree of sentimentality, but I have some such feeling now, because I was one of the three original trustees who took over from the committee of management which had carried out the preliminary work. They did their work very well.  My fellow-trustees were ex-Senator Foran and Dr. Rowlette.  We had the honour to be the first trustees of the society and, for that reason, I feel some responsibility in the matter of answering certain suggestions that were made during the debate about the investments of the society.  I said that I approach this with some sentiment. Indeed, I feel like Grattan on a famous occasion when he said that he watched over the cradle of Irish freedom and wept over its doom.</P>
      <P>I feel that I watched over the cradle of the unified society; now I feel as if I am being asked to take part in its execution and the confiscation of some of its goods and possessions for a purpose for which they were never intended.  I refer to the use of this £1,000,000 of National Health Insurance Society funds, the property of the members of the society, for the purpose of purchasing and completing Store Street.  That is a purpose of which a good many of them may not be in favour.  Senator Dr. O'Connell said that they would not have an opportunity of expressing their sentiments on it.  But they are part of the general public.  There is a genuine feeling about the taking over of Store Street and, since that feeling is pretty general, I think it is most regrettable that this £1,000,000 of the society's carefully nurtured investments should be used in that direction.  I feel that the moral implications of spending money while it is still in the possession of its legal owners are not such as we can readily condone.  I have a conscientious objection to passing this Bill in order to make that possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister advanced certain arguments in favour of the case he was making for the application of this £1,000,000 towards the purchase and completion of Store Street.  He drew a certain analogy.  It reminded me of <Col N="312" /> the fact that Árus Brugha was originally purchased by the provisional committee on behalf of the committee out of society funds.  That was right. That was quite legitimate and natural because the building was for their own use.  I would like to remind the Minister courteously that the step he proposes to take is quite different.  He proposes to devote the £1,000,000 towards providing accommodation for the Department of Social Welfare.  The point he made does not carry conviction. I am more concerned, however, with the innuendoes made with regard to the investments of the society.  For nine years I was a trustee of the unified society.  We had charge of the bulk of the investments.  We were real trustees.  I believe that subsequent trustees waived their right in that respect and did not exercise that particular function.  I and my fellow-trustees had the power to invest the money.  We had frequent meetings with our brokers.  We had frequent consultations.  The Minister talked about investing the funds in Nigeria, in darkest Africa, in the territory of Seretse Khama and in the production of ground-nuts.  Our policy was deliberately framed on quite different lines.  From the beginning we determined that every penny of the society's money that could be repatriated should be repatriated.  At the end, I think there was just one small amount outstanding of Bank of England stock. Gradually we got rid of all our external investments and we used the repatriated assets for the purpose of doing good both to the members of the society, who were the real owners of the money, and to the Irish nation. In that we had the inspiration of our wonderful chairman, Dr. Dignan.  I would like to remind the House of a very interesting occurrence.  When war broke out and everybody was a little panicky about finance, Dr. Dignan suggested that we should meet the Minister for Finance at the time, the present Uachtarán.  He was not available; but Dr. Dignan and my fellow-trustees, together with our able secretary, Mr. Rory Henderson, had the opportunity of meeting Mr. McElligott, Secretary of the Department of Finance.  He gave us a good <Col N="313" /> deal of time, examined all our investments and congratulated us on the prudence we had shown.  I think that should be borne in mind.  So long as the trustees of the National Health Insurance Society had the power, they administered the affairs of the society most competently.  The Minister was kind enough to furnish us with a memorandum.  So long as we had charge of the society, there was no such thing as investing the money in ground-nut schemes.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate a tribute was paid to the management of the society.  I am sure that, subsequent to my having my connection with it so summarily and unfortunately cut, my successors were just as concerned as we were; indeed, they so proved themselves in the running of the society, and the proof of that is that the investments of the society are so sound to-day.  I think the success of the society in the past was mainly due to one man, Dr. Dignan. I hate to bring his name into the discussion since it has been hurled from every political platform and been the subject of a cheap, party warfare across the floor of the other House. I have no wish to do that.  But before this Bill passes into the limbo of forgotten things, I would like people to realise what a truly great man he is. He devoted untold labour to the work and interest of the society.  He had a very mixed pack to guide.  The management committee consisted of a chairman, nominated by the Government, three trustees nominated by the Government, three representatives of employers nominated by the Government, representatives of the trade unions and elected personnel representing the insured members.  They came from different parts of the country.  They had a different political outlook and different social affiliations.  They might have been a very hard team to drive, but we were fortunate in having this great chairman, who put before us the objects for which we should strive.  In all his advice there was one end and one aim; that was the interests of the insured persons.  We did what we could for the staffs, and we had a most loyal and devoted staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> His lordship worked them very hard, and all of us very hard, but the response was magnificent.  Even when he was doing all that there was the cruellest setback.  A paragraph appeared one day in a leading morning newspaper to the effect that the affairs of the society were not going well and that his Lordship, the Bishop of Clonfert, was chairman and then it was suggested that another would take over.  We could never trace the origin of that paragraph, but it was a most outrageous thing for a newspaper to print.  Then, after Dr. Rowlette's regrettable death, we got the idea that the Department had some feelings that we were very extravagant people and that we spent money uselessly.  We had the great advantage of having Mr. Keady, one of the greatest personalities in national health insurance in the world.  To our great advantage he took the place of the late Dr. Rowlette.  He was a man of tremendous ability, of great honesty and insight.  We asked him to look over the affairs of the society.  He did so and he had to admit that it was being run most efficiently and most economically.  Many a time the Bishop would prevent the expenditure of a penny when he could, unless it was absolutely necessary.  He was most careful of the funds of the society. Mr. Keady is a man of great honesty. He admitted at a meeting that he had had ideas that we were an extravagant society.  He discovered, however, that when he went through everything, he was wrong in his ideas and he gave us the greatest praise for the way in which the financial affairs of the society were managed.  That was a great satisfaction to us all.  I think that most of everything we did was due to the Bishop.  I could not describe what an inspiration he was.  Every member of the committee of management venerated and loved him.</P>
    <P>We all came from different parts of the country and we all had our different political opinions but we left these differences of political opinion outside in O'Connell Street before we entered the committee room.  In the committee room we differed and it was one of those committees where you <Col N="315" /> could differ and differ with the chairman. I have often differed with the chairman on most important points but he was such a great man that, even though certain matters were very dear to him he would respect our different opinions.  He knew our opinions were honest.  Therefore we were a very happy team.  It was rather pathetic that after eight or nine years his Lordship said: &ldquo;I did not feel those years passing.  I must have been very happy.&rdquo; We were indeed all very happy.  I wish I could convey all that I personally owe both to his Lordship and to my fellow trustee for what I learned from them and from the other members of the committee of management&mdash; Labour men, employers and industrialists. We all learned something from each other.  I do not think I ever spent more educative years.  I came from writing books at my desk and I did not know a great deal about public business.  My education was advanced during those nine years and I consider that they were the most fruitful years of my life.  For that reason, I should like to say farewell to the society and I hope that in the days to come the work of the National Health Insurance Society will be done as well as it was done under Dr. Dignan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the tribute which has been paid by Senator Mrs. Concannon to the trustees and the committee of management of the National Health Insurance Society, not merely the existing trustees of the committee of management but all those who, since 1933, have served the society with such conspicuous ability.  I think there is no doubt that the society was well and efficiently served by the committee of management and by the officers and staff of the society.  All helped, and indeed vied with one another to make the society the efficient organisation it is to-day.  All can, I think, feel satisfied that they have made, each according to his own ability and resources, a contribution to the development of the society and have, by that development, helped to hasten <Col N="316" /> the day when the society is now undergoing a transformation so that it may fulfil a bigger and still more useful part in assisting those workers who have got to be covered against sickness, and who are not able to make adequate provision to insulate themselves against the financial hardships inseparable even from short periods of sickness.</P>
      <P>The passing of old institutions like this is naturally an occasion for regret because round their names cling all kinds of memories.  Notwithstanding the revolutionary times in which we live, and the constant world-wide eruptions which we experience there is still always to be found a pang of regret at the passing of anything or any organisation with whose activities we have become familiar.  The society, however, has one consolation. The members of the staff and the committee of management will have one consolation, namely, that if the society is disappearing as a society, it is only disappearing so that it may take on new functions, so that it may attain a new and a higher status. Those who have served it in the past and who are serving it to-day, can feel satisfied that the part which the society will play in the future of comprehensive social security in this country will be one in conformity with the aims and aspirations of many of those who served on the staff and on the committee of management of the society.  Senator Mrs. Concannon can, therefore, feel that if the society is leaving its old form it is for the purpose of taking on a new form with new and higher responsibilities, and I feel sure that the efficiency which has characterised it since its advent in 1933, will stand it in good stead in respect of the tasks which it will have to discharge in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the society's moneys are concerned, I should like to assure Senator Mrs. Concannon that every penny of the funds of the National Health Insurance Society is being used in the form of investments on behalf of the society. What will happen in connection with the Store Street premises is that certain <Col N="317" /> moneys which are invested in foreign investments to-day will be liquidated and will be invested in Store Street.  I would emphasise that not less than the amount of dividends which these investments bring in to-day will be brought in on the new investment in the Store Street building. Therefore, the fund and the insured contributors will not lose one brass farthing on that transaction.  The same amount of dividends will be provided in the future as is provided to-day.  For that reason, I should like Senator Mrs. Concannon, who has taken a very deep interest in the society, to feel assured that nothing is happening which will in any way do violence to her high sense of financial rectitude.  I think I speak for the whole House in paying that tribute not only to the existing committee of management staff but to all those who, in various ways, have helped to make the society the worth-while organisation which it is to-day.</P>

All that the passing of this motion means is that the President may sign this Bill and that therefore it will become law five days earlier than otherwise might happen.  No explanation has been given as to the grave necessity for this Bill becoming law five days earlier than it would in normal course. There may be a reason, but it has not been given.  I do not want to institute a debate on it, but I do want to register <Col N="318" /> a protest against what I think is an altogether improper use of the Constitution in invoking certain sections of the Constitution to have this Bill, for which, as far as I can see, there is no urgent necessity, five days earlier.  All that it means is that the President will be authorised to sign it and it may become law five days earlier than it would if this motion were not passed. No reason has been given and I do not think any adequate reason can be given for the earlier signature requested in the motion.</P>

      <P>The position is that an election of a new committee of management is due to take place on the 15th of this month.  Normally the machine should be going into action for that election.  We have provided in the Bill that the existing committee of management will continue in office until the society is transferred.  In the meantime this other machine is being geared up and will go into action. We want the President's signature to the Bill so that it may become law and so that we may intimate to the electors that this election will not take place. We could take a chance and do that as both Houses have passed the Bill, but it would conform more correctly to normal procedure if we were to get the President's signature before that intimation was conveyed to the electors. If the Senator offers very strong objection, I will not press the matter, but there is that convenience and there is avoidance of expense in not letting the machine go into action when, in fact, it cannot do any useful work.</P>

      <P>The explanation given by the Minister entirely satisfies me. I was not aware that an election under existing law must take place on the 15th of this month.  In view of the fact <Col N="319" /> that this is the 7th, the Bill could not be signed until, at the very earliest, the 12th.  The interval would be very short.  Therefore, the reason given is entirely sound.  May I say that I was not aware of that reason and I wanted <Col N="320" /> some explanation as to the necessity for putting down the motion?</P>
