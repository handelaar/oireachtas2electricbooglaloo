      <P>It is proposed to take the Finance Bill in Committee and at 7 o'clock to take motion No. 2 in my name regarding the Garda Síochána Pensions Order.  It is not thought that that will take long and we would like if possible to take the Trade Union Bill which passed through all its stages in the Dáil this morning, so the proposal is, if there is no objection, after the Garda Síochána motion to take the Trade Union Bill.  If there is an objection, of course it will not be proceeded with.  I take it that there will be no time for anything but the Finance Bill and these things.</P>

      <P>The following are the recommendations referred to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Before Section 2, in page 3, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (4) of Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1932 (No. 20 of 1932) shall be construed and have effect as if the words &ldquo;one hundred and fifty pounds&rdquo; were substituted therein for the words &ldquo;one hundred pounds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>2.  Before Section 2, in page 3, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1936 (No. 31 of 1936) shall be construed and have effect as if the words &ldquo;ninety pounds&rdquo; were substituted therein for the words &ldquo;sixty pounds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>3.  Before Section 2, in page 3, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1947 (No. 15 of 1947) shall be construed and have effect as if the words &ldquo;three hundred pounds&rdquo; were substituted therein for the words &ldquo;two hundred and sixty pounds&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;one hundred and sixty pounds&rdquo; substituted therein for the words &ldquo;one hundred and forty pounds&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move recommendation No. 1.  There was a time not very many years ago when one would be inclined to relate a debate on income-tax to a very small section of our people, but that time has long passed.  The number of people who pay income-tax and who come under the scrutiny of the Revenue Commissioners is ever increasing.  During the last 12 months an additional 21,000 people have been brought under their careful scrutiny and must pay income-tax. When, in 1947, provision was made to give an increase in the allowances, many members of this House considered that the provisions were not as generous as they should be and the then Senator Duffy, acting on behalf of the Labour Party, put down an amendment much on the lines of the amendments I have put before the House to increase the allowance for married persons from £260 to £300. <Col N="507" /> Senator Hayes on that occasion was not satisfied that Senator Duffy gave the whole case, but he also approved of the amendment and gave it his support.  That was back in 1947.</P>
    <P>Since then many changes have come about and the arguments put forward on that occasion certainly hold good to-day and greater support can be given to them.  We know that there has been an increase in the cost of living and that expenses in general have risen; rates have risen; for the family man educational charges have increased and increases in many ways have been brought about owing to Government action.  On the other hand we have the estimate made by the Minister in 1947.  The amount of money collected in 1947-48 was about £12,000,000; in 1948-49 it had risen to £14,000,000; the Minister estimates that the sum he will collect under the heading of income-tax this year will be no less than £16,000,000.  That being so and as there was an overestimation last year of over £1,000,000, I agree with the Minister's statement here on the last day that the best policy that can be pursued by any Government is to leave as much money as possible in the people's pockets to be utilised in their own way.  This is one way the Minister can give effect to the policy he put before us.  In the collecting of moneys from one section of the people for re-distribution to another section a considerable loss is entailed and if the Minister holds strongly to the view which he expressed he has an opportunity of giving effect to that policy by accepting these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Hawkins when he says that the position is much the same as it was in 1947 and I feel a certain amount of satisfaction&mdash; though not very great &mdash; in knowing that the arguments which I and others made then converted him although he did not show it at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position simply is that I do not believe there is a member of this or the other House who would not like to see each of these changes made and that a very strong case can be made <Col N="508" /> for them I have not the slightest doubt, but the practical difficulty is that, even in the Dáil, it is not practical politics to upset the balance of the Budget.  In a revising chamber it is completely impossible, because obviously these changes cannot be made without adjusting changes which would increase taxation and which would be out of order in our House.  Therefore, we can only make recommendations which would reduce the total.  These are very proper matters which should be brought forward.  It is proper that these recommendations should be ventilated from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have been continually and with very little effect urging the present Minister and his predecessors to set up a committee which would be able to go into the effect of certain changes which are necessary in the income-tax. Obviously, if that were done, it would be done as distinct and apart from the Budget of the year and if adopted, when the Minister came to formulate his Budget, he would have to base taxation giving whatever yield would be required after whatever changes had been made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first recommendation, I think that, under present conditions, it would be a very nice thing if we could increase the £100; but I think it would be very much better if you had graduated income-tax up to a certain figure, and if the amount paid by persons who just come over the limit was less than 3/3.  I should have liked to have seen something like 1/- for the first £50 or £75, increasing to 3/-, then to 4/6, up to 6/6, because I believe it would be fairer, having regard to the need for some easement for the lower income classes.  Part of the problem arises from the fact that wages have been substantially inceased in money, but not necessarily, and in some cases not at all, in earning power.  The result is that the first £100 over £140, which, when it was fixed, was an adequate and fairly reasonable provision, now comes very hard on certain persons.  It is much more so in the case of married people, but I think it is quite obvious, as I imagine Senator Hawkins recognises, <Col N="509" /> that, whereas we can debate this and make suggestions, it would be quite futile for us to attempt to pass an amendment of this kind, because the result of doing so would be that the total amount of the Budget would not be realised, and for that reason it could not be accepted.  Nevertheless, the Senator is quite right in bringing the matter forward.  Sooner or later, some Government will have to consider seriously the effect on the lower-income classes.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom cuidiú leis an moladh seo atá curtha síos ag an Seanadóir Ó hEacháin.  Ní dóigh liom gur gá cur leis an méid atá ráite aige ar a son.  Bhí mé ag súil nuair a bhí an Bille seo sa Dáil go labhródh duine éigin de na Teachtaí atá ansin thar ceann lucht oibre ar son an lucht oibre agus ar son na niarratas atá curtha isteach acu ar an fhaoiseamh atá i gceist againn.  Ar an dóigh chéanna, bhí díomá orm an tseachtain seo caite nuair a bhí an Bille seo ós ár gcóir toisc nach raibh aon duine atá anseo thar ceann lucht oibre adéarfadh focal ar son na gceardchumann agus cumainn eile a chuir iarratas isteach go tráthúil chuig an Aire ag iarraidh laghdú.</P>
      <P>Ní dóigh liom gur iarratas míréasúnta é seo ar an Aire.  Sílim go bhfuair sé fógra réasúnta go mbeadh daoine ag éileamh laghduithe mar atá i gceist againn.  An tseachtain seo caite, rinne mé tagairt do thuarascáil a bhí ar cheann de na páipéirí nuachta agus ba léir ón tuarascáil sin go raibh na ceard-chumainn go láidir ag éileamh faoiseamh mar atá i gceist againn.  Ar an slí chéanna tá fhios againn, an tseachtain seo caite ag comhdháil cheard-chumainn amháin, go raibh rúin ós cóir na comhdhála sin ag iarraidh faoiseamh nó liúntas mar atá i gceist againn anseo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support very strongly these recommendations. I was rather surprised when the Finance Bill was before the Dáil that those Deputies who are supposed to represent directly labour interests had nothing very much to say on the matters covered by these recommendations. I was equally surprised last week when this Bill came before the House that none of the Senators <Col N="510" /> who are supposed directly to represent labour interests had anything to say on these important matters.  It is idle on the part of Senator Douglas to say that at this hour it is unreasonable to ask for allowances such as those suggested in the recommendations.  Last week, I referred to a report which appeared in a certain newspaper just before the Budget that two trade union congresses, the Trade Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions, had submitted memoranda to the Minister asking for certain reliefs in the matter of the amount chargeable at half the standard rate or at a lower rate.  I may also mention, if this report is correct, that the association which represents the various professional bodies in Dublin had submitted a memorandum asking for reliefs on the same lines.</P>
    <P>I know that, according to one of the Galway papers, this matter was of some concern to the labour congress held there last week, the annual conference of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  Two motions were tabled there, one by the Galway branch, asking for a revision of the income-tax allowances in accordance with the decreased purchasing power of money and the other from the Drogheda branch which sought to have the personal allowance raised to £240 for single persons and to £350 for married persons.  What I want to stress is the fact that this matter was drawn in good time to the attention of the Minister, before the Budget was introduced. I want to stress also that this Budget has caused, and is causing, a good deal of anxiety to people in the country, notwithstanding what was said on the other side last week in praise of it.  I hope the Minister will see his way to consider these recommendations and to make available this year some measure of relief for people, who, as Senator Hawkins pointed out, are suffering severely because of the changes in the value of money, the rise in the cost of living and the rise in the cost of many items not included in the cost of living, but which are essential if people are to live at all.  I support these recommendations and hope that the Minister will meet us to some extent, at any rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody likes to be taxed, and it is only natural that any proposal of this kind which proposes to reduce the burden on individuals should receive a certain amount of sympathy.  I think everybody in the House, not excluding the Minister himself, would have a certain amount of sympathy with them. I might remind Senator Ó Buachalla that, long before he entered politics, I, in another capacity, was in the habit of moving motions somewhat on these lines in the other House.  As I have said, these recommendations are such as to appeal to anyone who is affected by them, but we might also look at it from this point of view, that income-tax, properly administered and with everybody paying his fair share, is about as fair a tax as can be put on the people. We have to consider also, as Senator Douglas has said, that the Minister has put a Book of Estimates before us &mdash; the bill is undoubtedly huge &mdash; and unless and until it can be shown how the total of those Estimates can be reduced, the Minister must find the money.  If he does not find it in this way, he will have to find it in some other way which may not be as satisfactory to all concerned as the method of collecting it through income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Senator Ó Buachalla who said on the last occasion that, because we on this side were not voting against the Finance Bill, we must, therefore, be satisfied with it.  We are by no means satisfied with it.  We would like it if the Minister could see his way to adopt these and other recommendations made to him, but we recognise the difficulties of his position.  We must be realists and understand that the money has to be found in this way or in some other less satisfactory way. I support the point made by Senator Douglas &mdash; it is a point which I made last year and on other occasions &mdash; that the time has come when the whole income-tax code should be reformed and simplified.  If the Revenue Commissioners could find some means of collecting all the income-tax legally due, many of us would get off much more lightly than we do.  The man with the fixed wage or salary cannot escape on any pretext, but there are <Col N="512" /> others who undoubtedly do not pay the full tax for which they are legally liable.  There are ways and means of finding loopholes in the regulations through which people who can afford it much better than those with fixed salaries or wages can find their way and thus escape their legal liability. We would all like to see these recommendations adopted and I would join with other Senators in pressing the Minister to consider them when formulating his next Budget and to have regard to the arguments put up not merely on this occasion but on many other occasions by people on both sides here and in the other House as to the necessity for introducing reliefs of this kind.</P>
    <P>In the North of Ireland and in England, they have a pay-as-you-earn system which seems to give a good deal of satisfaction to wage-earners especially, and perhaps the Minister would explain why it has not been adopted here, and if he proposes to adopt it, and also if he would tell us what are the advantages and the disadvantages of the system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the cost is a matter primarily for the Government, but I think all members of the House will agree with the principle in the amendments.  The case the Minister might make is that quite a number of people have got increases in their wages since 1947.  That is true, but the very fact that certain increases have been given has brought a number of people, who would not otherwise be brought in, within the income-tax code, such as tradesmen, and they form the greater part of that 21,000 persons who have been brought within the income-tax code in the last year or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> Senator Michael Hayes, in 1947, speaking to Senator Duffy's amendment, said that he was prepared to go much further at that time and he proposed that the allowances should bear some relation to national health insurance. The figure would then be, instead of the £300 that I now propose, £500. I do not wish to detain the House in putting the case.  We all know, as Senator Ó Buachalla has pointed out, that various trade union congresses and organisations throughout the country have issued a warning to the Government that they propose to seek an increase in wages.  Deputy Larkin, the spokesman of the Labour Party in the other House, has put the position very clearly and definitely before the Minister, that demands are being made and that the demands must be met. He suggested that the Government should take steps to meet the demands now or otherwise bring about a very drastic reduction in the cost of living. One of the means by which that demand can be met to a small degree is by giving the benefits that I ask for in these amendments.</P>
    <P>We would like that the Minister would avail of the occasion presented to him to give us the Government's view.  What action do they propose to take?  Do they propose to take immediate steps to bring about that reduction in the cost of living that the Labour organisations and leaders demand?  Do they propose to take steps to meet the demand for increased wages?  I suggest one or other must be done.  I think Senator Mrs. Concannon drew the attention of the House to the position at present existing in Galway.  Will that position extend throughout the country?  Will workers be forced into a position to fight, to organise general strikes or local strikes in order to get what they consider their just demands in view of the rise in the cost of living?  If the Government will face up to their responsibilities, they will either have to sanction the demands made by Labour leaders and congresses or take immediate steps to bring about that reduction in the cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the only <Col N="514" /> alternative?  What about the Senator's own alternative, to peg wages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this discussion should widen itself out into a question about the cost of living because I think that is something that should be discussed separately and which would carry us very far.  The Minister suggests, for example, that Senator Hawkins, when he was supporting a Government, had a scheme for keeping down the cost of living, which was to peg wages.  Another scheme for keeping down the cost of living is reducing the price of milk and the price of butter and the price of beef to the farmers.  I do not know whether Senator Hawkins would suggest that for his own constituents. Anyhow, it is not open to us to discuss all these particular alternatives now, except to indicate that that is the kind of discussion you would have to have if you were going to talk about the cost of living.</P>
      <P>As far as these amendments are concerned, it has been suggested that I supported similar amendments, or even more drastic amendments, in 1947.  That is so, and I was quite right, and I do not suggest that Senator Hawkins is doing anything wrong now in putting these amendments down.  I know that the arguments for doing this thing, if it can be done, are perfectly sound.  I know that arguments can be made, as Senator Hawkins has made them, and indeed, other arguments can be made, and it is reasonable that they should be talked about.  But, all the arguments that can be made now were just as valid in 1947, 1946 and 1933.  They were all just as valid all the time, but Senator Hawkins and his colleagues took the view, and they were quite entitled to take it then, that they were supporting a Government, and would support a budget as a whole. They did that and there was nothing else they could have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, those who support a Government in office have to look at a budget as a whole and, as well as looking at it as a whole, also have to look to the general performance of the Minister for Finance and <Col N="515" /> the Government of which he is a member.  Here we have recommendations which would make a gap, a breach, so to speak, in the Minister's Budget.  The breach, he has indicated, would amount to £2,250,000.  Incidentally, that figure proves that we get our income-tax, not from the rich at all, but from the comparatively poor &mdash; a very important point to remember. There is no rich person left, apparently, to milk for the purpose of distributing the largesse you get from him to other people.  But, while we have power, if we were foolish enough to use it, to make recommendations like these, which would make a gap in the Minister's Budget, we have no power, as Senator Douglas has pointed out, to take any steps to fill the gap.  We are not bound to suggest steps to fill the gap &mdash; that is, if steps can fill a gap; I do not think they can &mdash; but we have no power to suggest any method by which the breach could be filled.  We are obliged, therefore, to take the Budget as a whole.</P>
    <P>We may influence the Minister by pointing out to him that this would be a good thing to do.  There are many other things that would be good things to do but we are also convinced of this, that we have a much better chance of getting these steps taken, in order to get reliefs for income-tax payers, by keeping this Minister in office than by defeating him on the Finance Bill.  For that reason, I think we should support him and I think there can be no doubt at all about it that that is the correct thing for us to do, in the interest of the income-tax payers and in the interest of relief for the people, of which the Minister has already given a considerable amount.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Connell with regard to people who escape income-tax. The people on fixed incomes, as I have been all my life, never escape at all.  I think since 1922 there have been fewer people escaping than prior to that.  As far as I know, the cost of living, about which there has been all this talk, has not gone up since 1948.  In any event, these proposals are desirable, but they are desirable in their own time.  The Minister cannot <Col N="516" /> be expected to do everything at the same time.  We must take this Budget as a whole.  Therefore, it is my intention to vote against these recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody would find fault with Senator Hayes for voting against these recommendations, but I do find fault with him for trying to justify an attitude which is diametrically opposed to the attitude he took when a similar question was under debate in this House some time ago.  I must say that I was quite pleased &mdash; agreeably surprised would describe my feelings &mdash; that Senator Hawkins's three amendments were received in a manner which could be described as not ungenerous by speakers on the other side of the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins was very conservative in his statements in support of his amendments.  When a similar amendment was under discussion before, Deputy Aiken was then Minister for Finance.  While Opposition speakers might accuse Deputy Aiken of many things, I do not think anybody would accuse him of being a man of very many words or of using ten words where one would do, but when an amendment was proposed by Senator Duffy and supported by Senator Hayes, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken, went to very considerable rounds to explain to the House why he could not accept the amendment. Here we have a Minister who comes to the House, sits down casually, listens to the speeches made by Senator Hawkins, Senator Ó Buachalla and Senators who generally support the Government, and he allows the thing to go by default and does not think it worth his while to say a few words in explanation as to why he could not accept the amendments.  If for no other reason &mdash; and there are several other reasons &mdash; I will vote for the amendments.  I will insist on a division, if for no other reason than the lack of courtesy on the part of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the suggestion made by Senator O'Connell as to the system of pay-as-you-earn.  I think <Col N="517" /> the Minister might consider the advisability, in present circumstances, of introducing that system next year, when, we hope, he will occupy the same position.</P>
      <P>We have at times demands for all kinds of extra public services and amenities.  All these services must be paid for.  The Minister has to get his money somewhere.  If the Budget is of a character which means that wage earners in particular would be able to meet their commitments, no more can be said about it, but there are cases of hardship and in this connection I would mention one case of hardship that the Minister might consider.  I refer to the case of widowers who have children over 16 or 17 years of age and who are not allowed any relief for a housekeeper.  That is a very grave injustice to many of these people who, because of the position they occupy, in banks, warehouses, etc., must keep up appearances and who, because their children are over 16, do not get income-tax relief because they cannot say that they have a housekeeper in charge of their children.  I would ask the Minister to give that matter sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is about to be put to a division, we had better all explain our positions.  I would support these recommendations if they were put forward as recommendations. They are not put forward as recommendations on which the Minister may act in future.  They are put forward as amendments to the Finance Bill.  If I thought that the purpose of them was to benefit the workers, and that that was the sole purpose, I would be more in sympathy with the people who moved them than I am when I suspect, and almost believe, that the only purpose of them is to reduce the revenue in the way they suggest doing it.  I would have no objection to reducing the revenue if I knew what the reduced revenue would be spent on.  What services will the Government reduce if the Government get £2,250,000 less to spend next year?  Where will they practise the economies?  The proposers of these amendments have not stated it.  Will they cut food subsidies?  What will they cut?  Social services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> They could hardly hit the rich by cutting any more of their expenditure. They must hit the poor.  I can speak on income-tax impartially, as probably the only Senator who has no taxable income.  I do not pay a penny income-tax. Some of the tears being shed for the poor seem to be crocodile tears. Let the sympathy be for those below the income-tax limit.  Will this proposal benefit them?  It will benefit the comparatively well-to-do section of the wage earners, who have not got enough, but it leaves out those below the income-tax level.  While aiming at benefiting some wage earners, the benefit you give to them will also go to the rich above that, who will get the same concessions on their earned income as the poor man on the weekly wage.</P>
    <P>This could have been some recommendation to the Minister for consideration next year.  The Minister should then consider a revision of the whole income-tax system.  We cannot force him to reduce the revenue now by £2,250,000.  It could be reduced in other ways than by this amendment. We all believe the allowances should be more generous and give more relief to those on lower wages and salaries. We have not the power to increase taxation, and the only recommendation we can make is to reduce taxation by this means.  If we do that, the Government's expenditure must be cut, and that will hurt the poor rather than the rich.  If the proposer could give an alternative proposal for raising revenue, probably we could support it.  The only alternative I can think of would be an increase in supertax and corporation profits tax. I wonder if the proposer would go that far and say that what is to aid the poor you should take from the rich.</P>

One Minister could reduce it by £10,000,000, another could reduce it by 30 per cent.  There is no point in declaring that he is not the Government, as his supporters and those who oppose him have now come to the conclusion that there is only one Party in the Government, call it by what name you may.

      <P>I suppose this is the most popular motion that has come before the Seanad.  Unlike Senator O'Farrell, if I were consulting my own interests I would be behind him.  I would remind the Labour Party of a similar resolution which they put down.  That has been stressed by Senator Hawkins and Senator Ó Buachalla.  I was not a member of the House at the time and have no record as to what attitude they adopted.  I would like Fianna Fáil to tell us whether they wholeheartedly supported the Labour resolution then and if not, why not?  They have taunted us with supporting a resolution in 1947, but it is as well to ask them what attitude they took up on our motion in 1947. The position is very different from what it was then.  We were faced then with standstill Orders of every description. Wages were pegged.  In my county the workers' wages have been increased since 1947, or since the present Government came in, by almost 100 per cent.  Widows' and orphans' and old age pensions have been increased.  It is very nice to put down a motion of this kind, and when <Col N="521" /> the Minister says it would cost £2,250,000 it is something we do not like to hear and are not in a position to face.  It is a very popular resolution and one which we could readily support, but if the Opposition is putting forward the case against the Labour Party they should say what attitude they took when we put down that motion.</P>

It is very hard to understand what one of the resolutions means on technical calculations regarding children's allowances.  The stamp duty resolution would cost £480,000, so the whole four would cost something short of £2,750,000.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Buachalla says it is idle for Senator Douglas to say anything. I wonder how idle it is for Fianna Fáil Senators to feel that by an act of repentance like this they can wipe out the whole recent past.  The converted sinner is a very pious man, but the sinner who shows a certain amount of repentance is always a pious humbug.  Let us take the background.  In 1930-31 income-tax was running 3/- in the £.  The reduced rate of 1/6 was chargeable on the first £225 of income. In the last three months of 1931, the 3/- was raised to 3/6.  Fianna Fáil took charge in 1932 and then increased the 3/6 rate to 5/-. and lowered the income on which the reduced rate was chargeable to £100.  So 1/6 was put on in their first year and the income on which the reduced rate was chargeable was brought down from £225 to £100 and at £100 it has stood ever since.  Income-tax went up to the 5/-, came down a bit and then went up again until it reached 7/6 between 1941 and 1946.  It was reduced to 6/6 in 1946-47; in the Finance (No. 2) Act of 1947 arrangements were made to have it put back to 7/- for 1948-49 and then I took 6d. off last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as personal allowances are <Col N="522" /> concerned, in 1920, they stood at £225 for married persons and £135 for others.  The first Fianna Fáil Budget reduced the single allowance from £135 to £125 in their first year and in 1939 they reduced the married allowance from £225 to £220; and the allowance for others from £135 to £125 to £120.  Thus they remained until 1947 when they became £260 for married persons and £140 for others and now it is proposed to increase them.</P>
    <P>As far as children's allowances are concerned, the history was that they ran at £36 for the first child and £27 for the second, third and subsequent children.  In 1932 they became £50, and in 1936 they were raised to £60. In 1944 a change was made to fit in with the family allowances scheme, and they became £60 for the first child, £60 for the second child, and £43 for third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed to make these tremendous changes, and on this point Senator O'Connell said that he does not wholeheartedly accept the present Budget, but that it is better than what might have been given.  People who complain about it should think what they would have if Fianna Fáil were still in control: 7/- income-tax rate, no change in the allowances and wages pegged, because that was the intention.  Of course, that is one way of forcing down the cost of living.  A statement was made quite openly by the then Taoiseach on the 20th October, 1947, at a meeting in Tipperary, and recently we have discovered legislation which was prepared to peg wages, only for the uncomfortable feeling produced by the three by-elections which led to the general election, which produced a still more uncomfortable feeling.  We would have had income-tax at 7/-, the allowances as they were, and wages pegged. Workers would not have the complaint that some people have suggested that because their wages have increased they have actually come to the point of being assessed for a few pounds income-tax.  If people think that that other result would have been desirable they know the way to get that result &mdash; support Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell said that it was <Col N="523" /> only proper that the people who suggested these vast remissions at this late stage in the financial year, when preparations have been made, should themselves suggest an alternative.  He went on himself to suggest that surtax or supertax might do it, but even if surtax rates were doubled, I do not think that the sum would be sufficient for the first, second and third recommendations. One thing, however, was mentioned by Senator Ó Buachalla&mdash; by misadventure I should say because I think it is a thing that Fianna Fáil would like to keep away from &mdash; the excess corporation profits tax.  It would bring in £3,000,000 in a full year, but Fianna Fáil threw that away.  One wonders when the thing was drawing money in in that way that they failed to keep it up and give these allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained the difficulties.  Once it has been remitted, it takes two years to go up to its full height.  There seems to be a certain amount of support in this House for it, because recently, when we were talking about wear and tear allowances which would, incidentally, cost £800,000, I was asked to give that £800,000 for industry, and no doubt Senator Ó Buachalla would like to support that.  Now I am asked to reimpose the excess corporation profits tax.  Why did Fianna Fáil not think of that when the tax was running smoothly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the people require some relaxation in having their personal allowances increased and in the other matters which were dealt with here.  I am told that Senator Ó Buachalla brought that to my notice in good time before the Budget.  That is a simple <Col N="524" /> sort of argument.  To bring a thing to a person's notice does not automatically mean that it will be accepted.  If that were so, we would have seen a vast change in Fianna Fáil days when people made up their minds that it was not worth while to put suggestions to Fianna Fáil, because it only meant that the tax weapon would be sharpened against those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that there would be acceptance of the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more consistent with the Senator's line of conduct if it had not been accepted. When the people who brought that to my notice did bring it to my notice, I explained the situation in 1948 when we came in with a certain programme which we had definitely accepted and spoken of on platforms.  The lives of many people had been painfully distorted by the operations of the Government which was in power for 16 years.  We saw that work, that bad pattern being fixed which caused very severe suffering to certain groups in the community and we had a plan to put those things in order.  The people on the lowest level, old age pensioners, widows and orphans, and people like that, merited our attention first, and they got it first.  After them came people to whom there were contractual obligations, people with whom contracts had been broken in a most scandalous manner by the last Government, State servants of various kinds, civil servants, Guards, Army people and eventually teachers.  We thought that we had to take those in our stride next.  At the same time we thought it possible to give a general relief to the community by removing certain taxes. One tax that had given rise to the most serious comment during the General Election of 1948 was the tax on beer and tobacco.  That general relief was given to the community but it caused a loss to the Exchequer of a considerable amount of money&mdash; £6,000,000.  After that, we found it possible to give a reduction of 6d. in the income-tax.  I did suggest to my colleagues in the Government that we should give no general remission but give some increase in allowances and <Col N="525" /> do some of the things which have been spoken of here but we found that those things would be too costly.  The amount of money at our disposal would only allow of the general relief which was also the lesser relief of giving 6d. to the whole community.</P>
      <P>That included the middle class, the professional workers, what are called the white-collar brigade.  They are recognised as having suffered next in intensity to the old age pensioners and low-living group of the community who are forced to live at a low standard of life.  I have made a promise to the association of professional workers, the people living on a fixed income, that at the earliest possible opportunity I will mark them out for very early priority for relief in taxation, and I hope to get that done at the earliest possible date.  These things, however, have to be taken step by step and I suggest that Senator O'Connell does not put the thing too enthusiastically when he says that he does not accept this Budget wholeheartedly but that at least it is better than others that could have been brought in.  The Senator can hope that there will be even better ones ahead.</P>
      <P>I deny entirely the basis of the argument of Fianna Fáil with regard to this.  The value of money has not changed since February, 1948.  There has been no rise in the cost of living or in what are called essentials outside the cost of living.  At least nowadays there is no deliberate interference with those who calculate the cost-of-living figure as there was in the autumn of 1947 when the trade journal carried a statement that the Government had ordered that the figures should be made up omitting certain things which, if they were put in, would clearly raise the cost-of-living figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is only one other thing I have to answer.  Senator O'Connell has asked me to deal with what is known as pay-as-you-earn.  I am glad, Sir, that you have said that this can only be referred to in a passing way.  It has been mentioned in this House and in the Dáil before, but I cannot say that I have given it a complete examination because I have never been pressed to the point which would require a complete <Col N="526" /> examination to be made.  It is not a scheme which is accepted too enthusiastically where it is in operation elsewhere.  It does mean a fair amount of administrative costs and whereas that cost might easily be borne in a country like England, with a much greater number of industrial and factory workers, here it would be relatively more severe.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am going to mention something which may be used against me hereafter.  Workers in England who get a reduction in their wages weekly or monthly, are apt to regard the net sum as their wage.  Luckily people in this country still regard the gross sum as their wage and that is good psychology from my point of view.</P>

      <P>I am very well pleased with the response my amendment has got in the House and I am certainly very pleased to see that Senator O'Connell has now joined the crusade with his colleague, Deputy Burke, who has put before the House, and I suppose before the country, the new form of joy through taxpaying.  It is, I am sure, one that the Minister for Finance might very well take up.</P>
      <P>Questions have been asked about putting motions or amendments of this kind before the House without at the same time counting the cost or, having counted the cost, without presenting a scheme for meeting that cost.  We were asked whether we stand for placing all the burden on one section of the people having relieved another. If we saw a shipwreck, we might not be able to save all the occupants but I think it would be very bad form if it were within our power to save or relieve even a small section and we did not immediately set about doing it.</P>

As I said on another occasion, the very occupation I followed demanded, whether I liked it or not, that I should be.  I have been in this House since 1938 on the Labour panel and I think I have as much right <Col N="527" /> to give expression to the views of the Labour Party as one who has failed on every occasion and who only got in as a nominee of the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>When it is suggested that I had an ulterior motive in putting down these recommendations, the people who make such accusations should be prepared to take what is coming to them.  With regard to whether we stand for the withdrawal of assistance to widows and orphans, I should like to tell Senator O'Farrell and other Senators, and particularly the Minister, whose Government on one occasion in 1931 went out of office rather than increase the pensions payable to the people for whom they have so much sympathy now, that it was the Fianna Fáil Government which introduced widows' and orphans' pensions, family allowances and all the other social services about which we hear so much, and to which there was so much opposition in this and in the other House.  The recommendations which I have put before the House propose to give relief to the type of person whom the Minister and members of the House would, I am sure, like to see being relieved.  The first recommends that the first £100 of taxable income on which half the standard rate is now payable should be raised to £150; the second deals with an increase in the allowances in respect of children, and the third is very clear and explains itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in repetition of many of the speeches he has made here, tells us that he gave relief in taxation, and he brings us back to the emergency Budget of 1947.  We all know the particular circumstances in which that Budget was introduced and the purposes for which it was introduced. <Col N="528" /> We know that the moneys collected under the taxes imposed in that Budget were collected and utilised for the purpose of reducing the cost of living by giving increased subsidies on bread, butter and other commodities. We know also that one of the first actions of the Minister was to remove those subsidies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not entirely, but to a great extent.  If the Minister looks back on his Budget statement of last year he will find that he saved something in the region of £3,000,000 by a manipulation of the sums made available for food subsidies.  If that is not so, why is it that we have two-price commodities to-day?  Circumstances then changed and we reached a position in which it was no longer necessary to continue the subsidies on fuel and other essentials which had to be subsidised during the emergency.  The Minister and the House will concede that, apart from the rationed commodities, part of which are subsidised, the persons whom I propose to relieve are the very people who are compelled to purchase the various items of food which are now unsubsidised, such as flour, bread, tea, sugar and other commodities, and for them the cost of living has increased.  The Minister talks about interference in the compiling of the cost-of-living figure.  All that any member of the House need do is to ask any housewife or any person whose responsibility it is to cater for a household whether for the money at her command every week she can get more essentials to-day than she could in 1947.  When she can say that she can, I will agree that the cost of living has been reduced.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2, in page 3, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the case of a dwellinghouse, the owner or tenant, as the case may be, who has incurred the cost of maintenance, repairs and insurance of the house shall be entitled, on making a claim for the purpose, to repayment of the amount of the tax assessed on the amount of the cost of such maintenance, repairs and insurance.</P>
      <P>There is little need to dwell at length on this recommendation.  The State has made, and is making, very generous contributions in order to assist persons anxious to become owners of their homes.  Provision is made to empower local authorities to erect houses for the working classes, and very large free grants are made available to those persons who undertake the erection of houses for themselves, when they are in a position to do.  Provision is also made available by the way of loan facilities, but when it comes to the point of purchasing a house the procedure is the very reverse.  While we make provision to assist persons to keep their homes in repair, and in a proper state of maintenance, I suggest that the Minister should give very careful consideration to this recommendation, especially from the point of view of encouraging occupiers to keep their homes in good repair, by making some concession in this respect and also encouraging employment in certain trades.</P>
      <P>The point of view was put forward here some time ago that, because of high costs and no provision for assistance in that direction, numbers of people were not now carrying out repairs annually, especially on larger houses.  If the Minister could see his way to make some concession by way of encouragement for such persons, I think it would be a worthy gesture.</P>

      <P>The idea that a person occupying a house should get relief for repairs by way of income-tax is a <Col N="531" /> sound one.  For a long time it was recognised by law, and when I first paid income-tax on a house I owned, I remember being allowed one-sixth of the valuation for repairs.  On a house with a valuation of £24 it meant with the income-tax allowance, £20 annually, as there was an allowance of one-sixth or £4 for repairs.  I think it was the Fianna Fáil Government removed that concession, and subsequently they did what was worse, by compelling the owner to pay income-tax on five-fourths of the valuation, so that a man whose valuation was £24 previously and who paid income-tax on £20, found himself eventually under Fianna Fáil dispensation paying tax on £30.  I think that was a very bad arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that, to some extent, it was mixed up with the whole question of valuation.  Senator Hawkins is right when he stated that all Parties in the State regard it as desirable that people should, if possible, own their houses.  At present people are taxed on something that they have not got. They should be taxed on the value of a house, and if taxed on a figure deducted from a gross figure, as well as repairs, they are certainly inequitably taxed.  It is true that people get the minimum repairs done now, and getting the minimum repairs done means that the actual capital of the country is decreasing in value.  The cost of repairs is extraordinarily high now, because tradesmen's wages are high, but if repairs are to be done properly it is better to employ craftsmen. More employment would be given if some allowance was made for the cost of repairs.  Whether the recommendation as it stands is feasible, practicable, or capable of being properly administered, I am not sure. The arrangement that existed before Fianna Fáil removed it, of allowing a certain amount on the valuation for repairs by way of relief of income-tax, had some merit.  While I realise that the Minister would not accept the recommendation, particularly in its present form, there can be no doubt that the matter is worthy of consideration when preparing the Budget, if possible to allow something off for <Col N="532" /> repairs that have been carried out. While I realise that the Minister will not accept this amendment, particularly in its present form, I think there can be no doubt at all that one of the matters worthy of consideration in framing a Budget, if it were possible to do it, would be to allow something off for repairs which have been done. That is particularly the case now, on account of the cost, and it is particularly the case also because it is to the interest of the Minister for Finance and to the interest of the local authority and the State that the property in the State should be maintained in the best possible kind of preservation. So, there is an argument for taking some kind of action of the nature suggested in the amendment, whatever may be said about the amendment itself as it is on the paper.</P>

Támuid ar fad ar aon intinn go luíonn an bhróg go han-dian ar únaerí tithe le blianta gairide anuas go háirithe, mar gheall ar chomh mór agus atá costas deisithe tithe imithe i méid. Mar gheall ar chomh hárd agus atá na costais, tá go leor daoine ag déanamh faillí ina ndualgaisí maidir leis na tithe in a gcónaíonn siad.  Tá na tithe ag dul ó mhaith.  Mar adúirt an Seanadóir O hAodha, ní maith an rud é ó thaobh an Stáit, ní maith an rud é ó thaobh na ndaoine.  Tá fhios ag an Seanad gur luacháladh tithe ins go leor áiteanna ar fud na tíre le dhá bhliain anuas. Tá aithne agam ar fhear amháin as Corcaigh a bhí ag caint liom ar an gceist seo le gairid.  Dúirt sé liom nach ndearna sé tada ar a theach maidir le deisiú, péinteáil, ná eile.  Luacháladh na tithe in aice leis ach níor hardaíodh an luacháil ar a theach oiread agus pingin amháin.  Níl aon mhíniú aige air sin beag ná mór ach gur mar gheall air nach ndearna sé tada leis an teach a choinneáil i gceart.

Ní ceart dearmad a dhéanamh air seo.  In éindigh le cáin a íoc ar an mbreis luachála sin, caithfimíd cáin ioncaim a íoc ar an luacháil nua atá déanta le gairid agus is dóigh liom, ar an abhar sin amháin, go mba cheart go bhfaigheadh tithe, a luacháladh le gairid, liúntas thar aon tithe eile.  Ní bheinn ag iarraidh liúntas le haghaidh dreama ar leith.  An t-iarratas atá i gceist san moladh, tá sé réasúnta mar iarrtar é le haghaidh an dreama fré chéile.</P>
    <P>There is very little more to be said on this matter except to refer to a point made by Senator Hayes that there was a time not long ago when we did get an allowance of one-fourth of the poor law valuation.  It is true that in due course the valuation for tax purposes was increased to five-fourths. Now the position is, for instance in Galway, that we have had a revaluation.  Many people in Galway do not know why their houses have been revalued.  I understand that the tax on five-fourths of that revaluation is demanded.  That seems to be very unfair.  I do not want to make an appeal for any particular section.  I think an allowance ought to be made to house owners in general, but, apart from that, there is a good claim to be made on behalf of people whose houses have been recently revalued, that they should not have to pay income-tax on five-fourths of the new valuation.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for the Minister to find money for this, that and the other. I attempted on the last recommendations to point out how he himself suggested he might get money, but here, at any rate, is a case where he ought to go out of his way, even on the ground of human improvements, to provide relief for the people mentioned in the recommendation.</P>
    <P>I referred in Irish to the case of a friend of mine who mentioned recently to me the revaluation that took place in Cork.  He pointed out to me that his premises were not revalued and the only reason he could give was that he had neglected the general maintenance of his house.  The other <Col N="534" /> houses in the district had their valuations raised.  His contention was that he got clear because he had failed to carry out necessary repairs and maintenance whereas the other people were industrious, looked after their premises and spent their money on them. They were rewarded by an increase in valuation and, I expect, for many of them, an increase in income-tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested last week, when he was replying to some of the points raised in the debate, that he had not raised taxation.  I can say that I am one person at any rate who has to pay more income-tax, because my house has been revalued.  If the Minister does not think that that is an increase in taxation, he is welcome to explain it in any way he likes, but I still maintain that my taxation has been increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a somewhat difficult matter.  The suggestion that has been made is one, of course, that could not be accepted at this late stage of finance proceedings, because it is not possible to measure what this would cost.  To start off with, the terms of the amendment are that &ldquo;the owner or tenant who has incurred the cost of maintenance, repairs and insurance shall be entitled....&rdquo;  I do not know why &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; is put in there.  It is only the owner of property who is liable to income-tax.  The income-tax for which the owner, in the end, is responsible sometimes is collected through the tenant, but he has a right to recovery.  In fact, effectively, he does not pay.  Effectively, he does not pay.  That is a defect in the recommendation, which could be amended by leaving out the word &ldquo;tenant&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the recommendation generally is concerned, I am advised that the income-tax on a dwellinghouse is charged by reference to five-fourths of the valuation.  That was a device introduced in 1935.  The valuation is based on an estimate of the rent for which, taking one year with another, the property in its actual state might reasonably be let from year to year, but that is after allowance has been made for the probable annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses to maintain the property.  It may be said that due allowance has been made for the cost of repairs before the valuation is put on the house.  I am not dealing with the exceptional case of an area where revaluation has taken place.  It may be said there that, <i>vis-á-vis</i> other people in the community, there had been special impositions put on those people.  That is outside my control, and the only way it can be amended is by having differential rates applying to different areas.  I do not <Col N="536" /> suppose I would be invited to adopt that course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the special conditions under which the valuation took place.  In general, valuations on which assessments to income-tax under Schedule A are based are considerably below the net rents yielded by house property under present day conditions, so that a property owner who is assessed on five-fourths of the valuation is being charged on a basis which is almost invariably very much lower than the actual rent for which the house might be let, as diminished by the cost of repairs, etc.  If you take a house of £28 valuation, the Schedule A assessment at five-fourths is £35 and income-tax is payable on £35.  The rent of such a house is taken to be £150 which I think is not an unfair letting rent.  If the average outlay on repairs, insurance and maintenance were £20 and one takes rates into consideration, say £36, that is £56.  Subtracting it from £150, which would be the reasonable gross rent, the net rent would be £94.  Therefore, even in respect of such a house and after allowing for rates and an average amount for repairs, the comparison is between £94 which would be the real net rent of the house and £35 on which the person is asked to pay.  The person gets a net income of £94 and is actually charged on £35.</P>

I cannot accept this, as it would require a good deal of examination to find out how it would run and what the loss to the Exchequer would be.  It might be considerable and it cannot be brought into the arrangements for the present year.</P>
      <P>Again, to refer back to the time when the five-fourths was put on, the then Minister for Finance, talking about this tax being a small charge, said it was like the grain of mustard seed he hoped would grow into luxurious trees under which, he said, &ldquo;a happier Minister than I might sit some day to catch the glittering prizes as they fall.&rdquo;  That was Deputy MacEntee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering whether the Minister had a case in mind, until he came to the figures.  In one particular house I have in mind, the poor law valuation is exactly the same, £28.  For the purpose of Schedule A it is valued at £35 and the tax is payable on £35.  The Minister, after allowing an abritrary sum for rates and a sum of £20 for annual repairs, said that the real income from that house, on the basis of its being rented at £150, would be £94.  In the example I have, the landlord is not liable for rates; the tenant pays rates. Neither is the landlord liable for any repairs, so the figure of £94 is comparable with what the landlord of the particular house I have in mind would be getting.  In the case of this particular house, poor law valuation £28, on which he pays income-tax Schedule A £35, the rent per annum he receives is £30.  As there seems to be some doubt, I can only repeat what I said earlier, that I am speaking of this from my own knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is so much trouble in dealing with these adjustments and it takes so much time, that it is hardly worth while.  May I say that those whom I have met who have had dealings directly with income-tax authorities in respect of matters like this have always told me that their experience has been that the income-tax <Col N="538" /> inspectors have been extremely helpful to any citizen in such difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt as to the truth of what Senator Hearne has said.  That is the general experience. There is validity in the Minister's argument, only in the case of people who own houses for the purpose of letting them and where that is the main source of income.  If the actual net income that a man receives from a house is £90, he is very fortunate if he pays income-tax only on £35 or £40.  If he were earning it as salary, he would pay it on the whole £90, less allowances.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not deal separately with owners who reside in their houses which is the main cause of dissatisfaction. Certainly, the dissatisfaction about it has reached me from time to time.  This is not a new matter. Take the case of a man who saves enough money to buy a house or sells an investment to buy a house, to live in.  I know a house which has a valuation, not of £28 but of £35, bought by a man who sold £2,000 of 3 per cent. safe investment and put it into that house, to live in it himself.  He is not a bit interested in the fact that he could get a rent of £150.  He was gaining an income of £60 and sold that investment.  He might get £200 in rent. There were times in Dublin when he could have got £300, certainly if he put a few bits of furniture into it.  It seems to me that the present tendency in taxation of houses is severe in the case of people, particularly young married people, who have to pay a high price to buy their own houses.  I have always felt that if in theory you could have got £150 rent and do not get it, and if you are taxed as if you had got it, in practice that is unfair.  I think there is a very great distinction between the person who buys a house for himself and his family and the person who makes a livelihood as a landlord by letting his houses.  I never saw why there should be a fundamental difference between that and any other method of earning a livelihood, provided, of course, that repairs are fully allowed for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> I do not think that anybody, even Senator Hawkins, would want the recommendation carried as it stands because as it stands it would relieve anyone of paying income-tax if he spent the valuation on repairs. If the valuation were £28, all he would have to do is to spend £28 on repairs and he would pay no income-tax and I think that would be completely unworkable.  I have always opposed the removal of the one-sixth valuation since it was introduced.  It was first introduced at an earlier date but there was strong opposition in this House and the Dáil gave way to that opposition.  Later a different Minister introduced it and it was carried in, I think, 1934.  It was strongly opposed here on most sides of the House but the result was nil.  I think there is something to be said for some provision but this is another matter with which you cannot deal simply.  It wants careful examination and if it is examined, a distinction should be made between a person who is a landlord living out of his property and the person who has to pay a high price for a house in order to live in it.</P>
    <P>There is another difficulty with regard to repairs and I cannot quite make out how it operates.  I admit that this would not apply to some of the building that is done at the moment, but a man who builds a decent house for a few thousand pounds should have a small repair bill for the first few years while the person who very often finds it harder to live and who must buy an old house for perhaps a little less, has to pay highly for repairs.  While I know that in theory provision is made in the valuation for repairs, it has never come to my notice that additional provision has been made in the case of an old house as compared with a new one.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that, as the law stands, it is not practical politics to appeal against new valuations.  The practice generally is that the figure is decided by the valuation office, no doubt after careful examination, but they, no more than anybody else, are not infallible.  The figure is based on the rent less outgoings and that is divided by a third because otherwise <Col N="540" /> it would be grossly unfair if you were to put the full rent.  That is the practice but if you go into the courts you will find that the law provides for full letting value.  No satisfaction will be got unless an error so gross is found as that no attention was paid to the one-third. In practice there are no appeals and some of the grievances which have been mentioned by Senator Ó Buachalla are due to the fact that the number of appeals is practically negligible because of the state of the law at the moment.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with Senator Ó Buachalla that people who had a revaluation of the whole value of the house in recent years were unfairly treated in so far as they have to pay five-fourths.  In, I think, 1934, members of the House drew attention to that, but while the Minister admitted that it was the case&mdash;if it was not he someone did&mdash;he did not see how it was possible to separate the income-tax so that one house would be treated differently from another.  An exception was made in Waterford, and I think that there may be a case for the town of Galway.  You could not possibly pick out the odd houses which are being revalued because a person who makes repairs or proposes to do so on his house has his house revalued.  That could not be dealt with under an amendment of this kind but it is a problem which some Government some day will have to tackle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's approach to the recommendation, I do not intend to press it, but I would again draw his attention to the matter raised by Senator Ó Buachalla, valuations in Galway. The position there is that the corporation made applications to the Revenue Commissioners to have certain old houses which were valued prior to the 1914 valuation raised to a present-day valuation.  In the course of carrying through the valuation the valuation officers recommended that it would be more equitable to have a full valuation, with the result that the whole City of Galway has been revalued. Therefore, it has been brought on a par with Waterford and I would ask the Minister to keep in mind&mdash;it may <Col N="541" /> be too late now&mdash;giving on the next occasion some concession to Galway as has been given to Waterford.</P>

      <P>On Section 5 I should like to ask the Minister a question.  In his Budget speech, he indicated, I think, why he was removing the preferential duty on tobacco, and said that he expected to get £350,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister made any estimate of the probable additional dollars required?  Is it not likely that there would be a switch over from sterling tobacco to additional dollar tobacco owing to the removal of this preferential rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the figure exactly, but it is something very small.  The introduction of this last year arose from the fact that in O.E.E.C. pressure to some extent was being used to have this country buy tobacco of American Virginian type. When searches were made to see where tobacco could be got, it was discovered that the only country really offering was Rhodesia, because, although some was to be had from Turkey and Greece, neither was suitable and a costly process of drying and other things would be involved.  When an approach was made regarding the purchase of Rhodesian tobacco, it was found that the British Government through bulk purchasing arrangements had for a number of years to come contracted to buy, and the sellers in Rhodesia had contracted to sell, a very high percentage, somewhere in the 90's.  The remainder the Rhodesians desired to distribute among customers who could be described as old-time customers.  The result was that the amount of tobacco we found it possible, even remotely possible, to get was very small indeed.  I had to make the <Col N="542" /> arrangements, and on account of Rhodesian tobacco being a bit dearer we had to allow for a preferential rate so as to put importers and manufacturers here into a position equal to that which we would have had if Virginian tobacco had been introduced.</P>
      <P>That situation stood until this year, when a treaty was made with the United States, and they raised&mdash;they always do raise&mdash;the question of Commonwealth preference.  It did not seem to be a preference that was likely to last.  They had not got very much result from it during the year and it was certainly not worth while making it any cause of friction between ourselves and the American Government on the general tariff, and for that reason it was decided to remit it.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to tobacco is relatively quite easy.  There are very big supplies of tobacco in stock and it certainly will not be necessary to buy even the smallest unit of tobacco by reason of this remission this year.  We are in quite an easy position so far as stocks are concerned.  The gain this year is estimated at £35,000, and there will be no switch to dollars by reason of this provision.</P>

      <P>Like income-tax, there was a time when a discussion of the film industry or cinematograph shows in general would not have been so <Col N="545" /> popular, but we have reached a point where we must have regard to the fact that the cinema and the film play a very important part in the life of the country.  We have had various suggestions that the time had come when steps should be taken to set up here an Irish film industry, and if it were possible to develop such an industry, it would be a great asset to the nation.</P>
      <P>We have here many of the things which go to help to build such an industry.  The one thing we lack at present is Government interest and Government assistance.  Some attempts in this direction have been made in the past and I understand there are at present one of two companies endeavouring to build up what they hope will be at some time in the near future a real Irish film industry.  If that is to be brought about, there will, first, have to be more sympathetic help from the Government and there will, secondly, have to be more sympathetic assistance from cinema owners in general.  The question is how that can be brought about and the purpose of the recommendation is to draw the attention of the Minister to the need for making some concession in this regard.</P>
      <P>I understand the tax on the films coming into this country at present is on a footage basis.  We are one of the very few countries where no very active steps have been taken, so far as giving essential support is concerned, to establish the industry.  What is required in this respect is, first, the fixing of a quota for Irish-made films, that is, films completely made, processed and recorded, in this country.  We have then to have encouragement for the newsreel.  In every cinema throughout the country, there is shown a film review or newsreel.  These are imported from abroad.  There is a company in this country at present which is capable of producing, and has produced, an Irish pictorial review, but, with the present control of the cinemas, they are finding it very hard to make the progress which they would wish to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second step would be to have a tariff imposed on all imported news-reels, so as to encourage the production <Col N="546" /> of Irish news-reels.  I understand that the tax at present is on the footage of the film.  I suggest it is time some change should be made in this direction and, instead of having the tax on the value of the film per foot, to have it on the amount of money earned by it in this country.</P>
    <P>I understand that the position could be that a film with an earning capacity of £5,000 or £6,000 would pay the same tax as a film capable of earning £20,000 or £30,000.  One way to develop the industry here would be to put a tax on the earning power of imported films and to put the money collected into a pool to assist Irish companies.  A company is at present erecting a studio and I understand that that studio is to be utilised by outside companies.  As many people in this country are very interested in this matter, I put down the recommendation in order to draw the attention of the Minister and of the House to it, with a view to seeing what could be done to encourage those who have put up money for the formation of a company to develop the Irish film industry.</P>

      <P>Have not the arguments used in favour of this recommendation been much wider than what appears on the Order Paper?  As I understand it, the recommendation refers only to relief in cases where 20 minutes are devoted to the Irish language.  There is no question involved here of establishing a film industry, from my reading of the recommendation.  It is rather more limited than the remarks that have been made would lead one to believe. The suggestion is a good one if it were practicable.  I remember that, when a relief of this kind was given some years ago, provided there was a certain amount of stage entertainment, ways and means were found of avoiding the tax altogether.  I wonder whether something of the same kind could now be introduced by all cinema proprietors by just having some item in the Irish language?</P>

      <P>When I read this recommendation I wondered how it would work.  In the first place, the arguments put up about news-reels had nothing to do with the purpose of the recommendation. I am not a picture-goer, but a great many people who go to pictures say that the cinemas do not give Irish news.  The recommendation aims at helping the Irish language.  Already in regulations issued by the Revenue Commissioners dealing with entertainment duty, provision is made by law for remission of tax when the subject is educational.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) An entertainment which is promoted by the Gaelic League, or by some other society or organisation in respect of which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that its primary object is the extension of the use of the Irish language and the whole of the net proceeds of which are devoted and will be applied to the extension of the use of the Irish language.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The principle of exemption of certain types of entertainment from the tax, in order to help Irish, has already been adopted in legislation.  I do not know how this recommendation will work. As I understand it, all that is required is that there would be 20 minutes' performance in Irish, out of the total performance during the day, and if that is so 25 per cent. of the tax would be returned to proprietors of cinemas and not to those who went to see the films. These people would pay the tax as they went in and the proprietors would get 25 per cent. of the tax back.  I do not know how the Minister calculates that the cost of this recommendation would be £250,000.</P>

      <P>I suppose it would be worth everybody's while to qualify, assuming that each day there would be 20 minutes of Irish, to get back a quarter of the tax.  I do not know if anybody would think that to be a good scheme.  Would it do to have a gramophone record?  I think gramophone records of 20 minutes' duration are now available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it would not be a sound track.  The term &ldquo;sound track&rdquo; has a very definite technical meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  People who know Irish would like to know what kind of Irish would be used.  To set down simply that Irish was to be used and that the tax was to be got back by proprietors, does not mean help in the promotion of the Irish language. Who would judge what kind of Irish was used or what it was about? Who would judge whether the performance had for its primary object the extension of the Irish language?  The Revenue Commissioners are a very able body of men, and they have to deal with a very complicated set of rules.  Are they now to be asked to distinguish between a 20 minutes' sound track, the object of which was the extension of the Irish language, or a 20 minutes' sound track with no such object?  I can imagine people going into a cinema and listening to a 20 minutes' sound track in Irish which might do harm to the Irish language, but the cinema proprietors would get the tax back all the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motive in putting such an item in the programme need not be that proprietors cared for Irish.  The motive would be to get money back on any kind of splash-dash entertainment. Going back to the newsreel question, it seems to me that it would be more effective if we were to get out a newsreel in Irish and to subsidise it. People would then know what they were doing, and would have control of the newsreel as well as the amount of money spent on it.  An amount of <Col N="549" /> money might be spent on a newsreel that would be doing some good.  The proposal in this recommendation would cost a considerable sum of money, but the amount of good that it would do to the Irish language might not be effective. The other procedure&mdash;although I know it is not relevant to this particular discussion&mdash;of subsidising newsreels in Irish, would be far more practicable, would cost the Minister considerably less, and would do far more good to the Irish language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Connell misunderstood me when he said that I implied that this would cost the Minister only about 1/- in the year.  I wanted to convey that at the present time films are not available to fill up the 20 minutes and that, therefore, in this year it would hardly cost anything at all.  Next year I do not know whether it would cost anything.  It would take considerable time before the necessary plant would be assembled, the necessary scripts obtained, and the trained artistes made available.  How many years that would take, I do not know.  I was mainly concerned to get the mind of the Minister on the matter and that he would express his sympathy with this or with some idea that would encourage people to go into the production of films in Irish.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes and the Minister think that this amendment would cover, say, the playing of a gramophone record in a cinema.  I do not think that that is so.  I think it is very clear from the amendment that the sound would have to accompany a film.  The idea of sound track means that it is part and parcel of a film.  The sound track is incorporated in the film itself, so that I do not think an ordinary gramophone record would suit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes thinks that this would be merely a money-making proposition for the proprietors of cinema houses. There may be something in that, that they would get something extra out of it, but I visualise that if films in Irish, covering, say, sporting events, documentaries of a historical kind, general newsreels, and so on, were made at all, much of the work, for some time, will have to be done outside <Col N="550" /> Ireland.  I understand the plant is very expensive and that, when a film has been made, the whole thing must be transferred, say, to London, for further processing.  I imagine there would be some extra cost in this, which would mean higher rentals for the owners of the cinemas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the object the cinema owner would have in taking in such films, it is difficult to visualise, in the present state, a cinema proprietor taking in a film in Irish except for the purpose of aiding the Irish language movement.  Many of the patrons of cinemas have not got Irish as we know it, say, in the West, so that, if they go to a performance where part of the programme is in the Irish language, they will understand that they will go there with a certain duty on them to pay attention to this sound track and, in consequence, improve their knowledge of Irish.  The very fact of a cinema proprietor taking in a film with a sound track in Irish would mean that he meant to aid the Irish language revival movement.  I do not think there is any point in Senator Hayes's objection.</P>

      <P>I am thinking of something to encourage him to introduce it.  I do not think he would get it all.  It is quite possible, as Senator O'Connell said, that ways would be found of driving a coach and four through regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners.  That is true of everything in the way of legislation that is proposed.  By experience we would discover the tricks adopted by these people and so devise means of checking them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite understand that there are difficulties in this.  What I am really anxious for is that the Minister would indicate to us his sympathy with the <Col N="551" /> object mentioned in the amendment and that he would indicate to people interested in the language and to people interested in the film industry that there is reasonable opportunity of their getting back their costs, at least, if they go ahead with the production of films of the type mentioned.  Incidentally, it would be an encouragement to those in the language movement to go ahead and aid that industry.</P>
    <P>I put down the amendment with Senator Hawkins in the hope that the Minister, since he got the amendment, would have given some consideration to it and would indicate to us his views on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the amendment, as it is drafted, I cannot say I have any sympathy whatever. The difficulties in carrying out this are very great indeed.  The amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where entertainments duty has been paid on payments for admission ... to an entertainment which consisted either solely of a cinematographic exhibition or partly of a cinematographic exhibition and partly of a personal performance,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash; I am leaving out the second paragraph&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that at least 20 minutes of the duration of the sound track of said cinematographic exhibition is in the Irish language, and that its primary object is the extension of the Irish language....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Take a cinema in Dublin which ordinarily would open its doors at, say, 2 o'clock and close them at about 11 at night.  I take it that, if they opened their doors at 20 minutes to two and ran off a sound track in Irish, they would have qualified for a remission of one-fourth of the tax.  I think they would, under the Senator's phrasing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  It has done its 20 minutes.  Even if it had to do 20 minutes three times during the evening, as the amendment is phrased, it would mean that if a cinema proprietor has some sort of stock film&mdash;I am not putting it at too high a point of parody&mdash;if he has a film and shows it in the cinema, of a public person making a speech in Irish, gesticulating and walking about and taking a glass of water, I think it would qualify.  I am sure that is not what is meant.</P>
      <P>We have to remember the evasions that were practised already with regard to what was called the live variety performances as opposed to mechanical performances, where the method of evasion was, where a cinema or entertainment hall ordinarily opened at 8.0, they opened at 6.30, not expecting anybody would come in, and would run from 6.30 to 8.0 with somebody strumming a piano, and so on.  Maybe an odd courting couple and a few stragglers went in but the performance really started at 8.0.  They qualified. It was that evasion which brought about the change in taxation.</P>
      <P>This amendment, I think, would lend itself to the same.  If a stock film in Irish would enable a proprietor to secure the duty reduction, apart from the loophole of evasion, it would not tend to put the Irish language on its feet but would tend to throw ridicule on it if there were any attempt of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Into this argument there has been introduced the matter of Irish films and the production of films in Ireland and in Irish.  That certainly is in its infancy yet.  Maybe some attention would have to be given to it when it shows some better signs of life.  It is not possible to give a real estimate of the cost.  One does not know how many would qualify.  I do not know what real films there are with real sound tracks attached to them in Irish that would qualify.  I imagine the number would be very small.  Therefore, everybody would be led to the evasion. If every one did qualify, it would not <Col N="553" /> be long until a method would be found of breaking through, so that every film would be qualified.  Then we would lose a quarter of the entire tax, a quarter of £1,109,000, which is, say, £270,000.  If I had £270,000 to give to the promotion of the Irish language, this is not the way I would use it.  If this were tied on to the promotion of a film industry, there might be something in it, but we will wait and see how that develops.  At the moment, I am against this.</P>

      <P>I should like to make one comment and ask one question on this section.  In an afternoon when there has been a good deal of hard hitting at the Minister, it is only fair that one bouquet should be thrown to him.  I would draw the attention of the House to page 22, to a section which may have missed Senators' attention, in the treaty between this country and the United States.  It is very gratifying to teachers that the framers of this Bill should have shown consideration to a hard-worked and often under-paid profession.  Articles 18 and 19 on pages 22-23 make certain provisions for teachers when they go to the United States of America or when they come here.  I should like, as a member of that profession, to congratulate the Minister and those who framed the Bill on putting in this section. It might easily have been overlooked and it is very much to their credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I should like to ask is this: Is there a similar arrangement between Northern Ireland and the United States?  In other words, will teachers and professors in Northern Ireland have the same privileges when they go to the United States?  If there is no similar provision, this treaty is something that would go towards <Col N="554" /> making members of the profession in Northern Ireland desire a little more to become citizens of our Republic.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 17, in page 9, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947 (No. 33 of 1947) is hereby deleted and in lieu thereof the following sub-section is substituted and shall have like force and effect:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The stamp duties chargeable on conveyances or transfers of lands, tenements and hereditaments under the heading &lsquo;conveyance or transfer on sale of any property&rsquo; in the First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891, as amended by subsequent enactments, shall, on and after the first day of December, 1950, be at the rate of 10/- for every £50 or fractional part of £50 of the amount or value of the consideration in lieu of the rates immediately theretofore chargeable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(2)  References to sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, contained in the other subsections of the said Section 13 shall be construed as references to the new sub-section (1) inserted by sub-section (1) of this section and the provisions of the said Section 13 shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This needs very little explanation. Section 16 makes provision for the removal of this 5 per cent. stamp duty on certain types of purchases or transfers <Col N="555" /> of property, that is, between local authorities and utility societies. The State makes very generous contributions to local authorities to erect houses and makes provisions whereby loans may be made available to people. Here is a section of people not in a position to acquire a site for a house, or who for one reason or another cannot undertake it and are not in a position to benefit by any of the Government grants.  Rather is a tax being imposed on them in this Section 17, to the amount of 5 per cent. on purchases or transfers over £500.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to bring the position back to what it was prior to the introduction of the Supplementary Budget in 1947.  The then Minister for Finance explained to this and the other House that this tax was to stop an inflationery tendency at that time, a tendency to purchase houses not only in those who required them for their own use but in people who had money to invest.  There was a traffic being carried on in the purchase and resale of houses at that time. These conditions have passed.  Last year when we suggested that this tax should be removed he seemed to look very sympathetically on the suggestion. However, it is being continued this year.  Where a person proposes to purchase a house for £1,000 we by the imposition of this stamp duty put a tax of £50 on him.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government announced a few days ago that an amending Housing Bill was about to be introduced and that one of the provisions would be to make the payment of grants available to a person who was the first purchaser of a new house.  At the present time a grant will not be payable except to the person who erects a house for his own use or to a utility society or local authority.  That is an argument for the removal of the stamp duty.  If we pass a measure tonight imposing a tax of £50 per £1,000 and to-morrow or the next day are prepared to pass a Bill making a generous grant of £280, say, available to that person, we are not being consistent.</P>
    <P>This question has been argued in the <Col N="556" /> Dáil and it was argued here last year, so Senators and the Minister are familiar with the argument.  No good case can be made for its retention except the case made by the Minister, the question of finding the money.  The £600,000 which the Minister proposes to collect as a result of this is £600,000 of an imposition on young people in many cases starting off in life purchasing a house for their own occupation and being compelled already to meet the legal expenses of transfer, the auction-cering expenses and so forth.  There is no use in the Minister or anyone else suggesting that the money is not going to come out of the pocket of the purchaser. There is nowhere else from which it can come and the argument that has been advanced in the past does not exist now, that the contractors can afford to pay the tax because of the profits they made during the war.</P>
    <P>If it did ever exist it does not exist at the present time and the tax must be borne in the long run by the purchaser just as he has to pay the auctioneer's fees and all the other expenses in connection with the transfer of property.  No good case can be made for the continuance of the tax at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case which was made for it was founded on a statement exactly opposed to the statement which Senator Hawkins has made.  The tax was carried in 1947 and the then Minister for Finance when questioned about the tax and its objective and where the money was going to come from said on the 29th October, 1947, column 1070 of the Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think 5 per cent. is enough at the moment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I interrupted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To cheapen houses?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Not to cheapen houses&mdash;to get money from the vendors of houses. It will not cheapen houses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was not satisfied with that very explicit statement but on the 13th of November, column 1916 of the Dáil Debates, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the vendor whose price is going to be reduced by the 5 per <Col N="557" /> cent.  The 5 per cent. instead of going into the vendor's pocket is going to go into the pocket of the Treasury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the way in which the tax was carried&mdash;on the basis that the vendor would pay it.  I said in Dáil Eireann that that was tantamount to an admission that it was a revenue tax and I do not see how it could be explained in any other way.  Remember that in 1947 the situation was, as I have explained in the Dáil, that the vendors of houses were in control.  The then Minister for Finance said that certain houses known to him had changed hands two or three times during that year at increased prices each time.  It was the vendor&mdash;successive vendors&mdash; who were able to extract an extra bit of money from the people who were looking for houses.</P>
    <P>These were the days when the vendors of houses were supreme because houses of a particular type were scarce.  A scarcity value had accrued to these properties and there were a number of people who just had to get houses.  I did not believe that the tax was going to be paid by the vendors and I opposed the tax for that reason.</P>
    <P>There is the reasoning by which a vote was got for the imposition of the tax.  The situation has changed.  When I saw the Incorporated Law Society a year ago and they complained of the tax, they agreed that houses which were running at £5,000 in 1947 were not even getting a buyer that year at £2,500.  So the difference between 5 per cent. on £2,500 and 1 per cent on £5,000 would be of some benefit to whoever had to pay it.  I think it was admitted at that conference, and it is certainly the view I hold and have expressed more than once, that now that houses of that type are more plentiful and buyers are not anxious to pay the enhanced prices which vendors are anxious to exact it is pretty certain that the tax will be levied on the vendors.  The people who built houses and trafficked in houses did make so much money in the years during which they had the community at their mercy that it would not make anybody very keen on easing their particular difficulties at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> With regard to the type of houses that would benefit, the increased stamp duty did not apply where local authorities built houses and sold them or where public utility societies built a house and sold it to one of its own members.  There would be no relief for them because the stamp duty did not apply to them.  The type of house with which Senator Hawkins dealt can be dealt with when the new Housing Bill comes before the Oireachtas.  The grant house was another type which could be built freely during 1947-48 and the great majority of houses were built under contract and the tax did not apply once the house was built under contract.</P>
    <P>The people concerned were able to a substantial extent to escape the incidence of the stamp duty by leasing a plot and getting a house built upon it, because that did not rank as a sale and the stamp duty was not charged.  If under the new Bill a house is given to the first purchaser attention in that Bill will have to be given to putting that type of house on the same footing as the contract type under the old legislation.  But that is a special case and has nothing to do with the general remission here.  The people who would benefit are the people who were selling houses to the better-off sections of the community.  I feel that in the main the tax is being paid by the vendor at the moment to such an extent that I do not think there is sufficient reason for remitting them £480,000 and seeking to get that sum from someone else.</P>

      <P>That the Seanad hereby approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1950, made on the 25th day of May, 1950, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before the Seanad on the 21st June, 1950.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="Minister for Justice (General MacEoin) Seán (Major-General) Mac Eoin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Order consists of a number of miscellaneous amendments to the existing Garda Síochána Pensions Orders.  An explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Order, and I assume that it will not be necessary for me at this stage to give a detailed explanation of the various provisions of the Order.  I should like to say a few words, however, about the more important provisions.</P>
      <P>The most important provisions in the Order are those which provide for increases in respect of widows' pensions and children's allowances similar to those granted to other State pensioners by the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950. These provisions will have retrospective effect to 1st April, 1949, the date from which increases are payable under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950.  The Order provides also for smaller increases in widows' pensions and children's allowances in respect of the period from 1st April, 1947 to 31st March, 1949, these increases being calculated to correspond with increases of benefits under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, which became operative from 1st April, 1947.</P>
      <P>There are three other changes made by the Order, about which I should like to give some explanation.  These changes are&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the abolition of the distinction between accidental and non-accidental injuries;</P>
      <P>(b)  the provision of special pension terms for members who were over the age of 27 years when they joined the force, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the change in the definition of injury on duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing pensions Orders, when a member is injured on duty, without his own default, and has to retire or dies as a result of the injury, he or his widow, as the case may be, is entitled to a special pension, but the rate of the special pension depends on whether the injury is an accidental injury or a non-accidental injury, a non-accidental injury being defined as an injury intentionally inflicted or incurred in the performance of a duty involving special risks.  The special pension in the case of a non-accidental <Col N="560" /> injury is on a much better scale than the special pension in the case of an accidental injury.  The Order abolishes this distinction and provides that in future the higher scale of special pension will be payable in every case where a member is injured on duty.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, many members of the Garda Síochána, who had helped to establish the State, were over the age of 27 years when they joined the force and under the existing pensions Orders many of these men could not qualify for full pension.  The existing Orders provide that Garda pensions will be calculated at one-sixtieth of annual pay for each year of service, with an additional one-sixtieth for each year over 20.  The new Order provides that where a man was over the age of 27 years when he joined the force, his pension will be calculated at one-sixtieth of annual pay for each year of service with an additional one-sixtieth for each year after his 47th birthday.</P>
    <P>In regard to the definition of injury on duty, the position is that, under the existing Orders, an injury is regarded as having been sustained on duty if it was suffered in any of the following circumstances:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  while the member was on duty;</P>
    <P>(b)  while the member, although not on duty, was performing some act which is within the scope of the ordinary duties of a member of the force;</P>
    <P>(c)  in consequence of some act performed by the member in the execution of his duty;</P>
    <P>(d)  while the member was acting as a fireman or assisting in the extinguishment of a fire or in protecting life or property from fire; and</P>
    <P>(e)  while the member was on a journey necessary to enable him to report for duty or to return home after duty.</P>
    <P>The effect of the new Order is that in future an injury sustained by a member when travelling to report for duty or when returning home after duty will not be treated as an injury on duty, unless the member was performing some act which is within the scope of a policeman's duty at the time or <Col N="561" /> unless it is shown that the injury was inflicted on him on account of something done by him in the performance of his duty.</P>
    <P>I consider that this is a reasonable amendment and will not result in any hardship.  If a member meets with an accidental injury when reporting for or returning from duty, and has to retire or dies as a result of that injury, he, or his widow as the case may be, will be entitled to an ordinary pension on the same basis as if the death or incapacity resulted from illness, but the special pension, which is payable in respect of injuries on duty, will not be paid in such a case.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House will agree that this Order effects a substantial improvement in the Garda Síochána pensions code and I hope that the motion for its approval will be passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome and desire to give approval to this Order which is long overdue in regard to a pension scheme for the Garda Síochána.  I direct the Minister's attention to one other matter.  He has given us an explanation regarding injuries sustained while on duty but as he is aware, we have travelled very far on the road as to when an employer is directly responsible for any accident that might happen to an employee.  In fact, we have gone so far that, when a person sets out for work in certain circumstances, that person is paid to travel to work.  It might be well if the Minister would amend the Order so that when a Guard meets with an accident while on his way to report for duty he would be covered.  It is hard to define when a Guard is on or off duty.  As far as I am aware, he can be called on at any time in the service of the State.  It would be most unfair, if a member of the force met with an accident or with an injury that might result in death that there could be a dispute as to whether he was on duty at the time, in case he had not reported to the barracks or had not been assigned to that particular duty.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Trade Union Act, 1941, it is unlawful for any body of persons, with certain specific exceptions, to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment unless it has been granted a negotiation licence.  A condition precedent to the grant of such a licence was that the union should make and maintain with the High Court, a deposit of not less than £1,000 increasing to a maximum of £10,000 (according to membership).</P>
      <P>Before the Act was passed it was foreseen that, on account of prevailing abnormal conditions, some of the Irish trade unions would be unable to make the full deposit.  It was therefore decided to insert a relieving provision in the Act to meet such cases.  Section 8 of the Act accordingly conferred on the Minister power to make an Order in favour of Irish unions reducing by a maximum of 75 per cent. the normal deposit, if it could be satisfactorily shown that, on account of abnormal conditions referable to the war, undue hardship would ensue by requiring the trade union to make the full deposit. This provision was due to expire on the revocation of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many reduction Orders were in force towards the end of the emergency and it was considered that the circumstances which necessitated the relieving provisions in the Act of 1941 had not materially changed.  Consultations with representatives of the trade union organisations showed that the withdrawal of the concession at that time <Col N="564" /> would impose hardship on many unions and, in some cases, might have the effect of disqualifying trade unions from continuing to hold negotiation licences.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Act, 1947, was therefore introduced.  It repealed Section 8 of the Act of 1941 and reenacted the main provision of that section as from the 9th July, 1947.  Again, in 1948, a new Trade Union Act was passed extending the concession for a further period of 12 months as from 9th July, 1948.</P>
    <P>Circumstances in 1949 showed no substantial improvement and the Trade Union Act of that year was passed in order to continue these reliefs up to the 8th July, 1950.  Upon reviewing the situation this year I am satisfied that there is a good case for the extension of the concession which is now operating to the benefit of 25 Irish trade unions.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is intended to continue the relieving provisions for a further period of 12 months, that is, to the 8th July, 1951.</P>
    <P>The question of a further extension after that date will receive consideration in the light of the circumstances and conditions then obtaining.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of insisting on this deposit originally was to ensure that the union was in fact a genuine union and not just a small group that pretended to be a union. I always thought that the minimum amount required as a deposit was too high.  In practice it proved to be too high.  Power is now given to the Minister to reduce the amount.  I am wondering&mdash;and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this for the next occasion&mdash;whether it would not be advisable to make a permanent reduction in the amount that would be required as deposit.  There are many small unions that are efficient and good, catering for men in special employments, that could not undertake to pay the amount of the deposit that is required under the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Some are smaller craft unions.  Others are unions catering for small numbers of workers. They are more or less all unions confined to particular trades.  The point Senator O'Connell made was considered and in fact it was originally intended to continue the Act for a longer period than 12 months but, in view of the discussions which are proceeding at the moment, it was thought desirable to continue it for 12 months.</P>
      <P>On the general question of a reduction in the amount of the deposit, I think there is a good deal to be said for that in respect of a number of these unions.  On the other hand, if the two congresses reach agreement, it might be likely that some of the larger unions would be in a position to pay the full deposit.  So that, for the present, I think the Seanad will agree, it is desirable to continue the Act for 12 months and consider the situation, possibly after these discussions have terminated.</P>

      <P>The first thing I would like the Seanad to realise is that this is a very important matter.  It is so important that at least one very important professional organisation has devoted considerable attention to it since the duty was imposed in 1947.  There is also this fact, that certain business organisations who handle a good deal of house property and land are keenly interested, and feel the time has passed, when this duty should serve the purpose for which it was introduced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not the Auctioneers Association.  I will refer to it in a second.  That prompts me to refer to a statement of the Minister this evening, that when the former Minister was introducing this duty he made it clear that this duty was really a revenue duty, a fiscal duty. I have not had time to look over the debates covering the Supplementary Budget, so I cannot say, to what extent, the Minister's quotation represents the mind of the former Minister, but I think that it would be no harm, if I referred the Minister to the proceedings of the Incorporated Law Society at the meeting held in May, 1949, and, if I may, to quote from the address of the president of that association.  The meeting was the ordinary general meeting held on May 19th, and there the president of the association made these remarks:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" />&ldquo;The then Minister for Finance, Mr. Aiken, in introducing the proposals stated that their object was to stop speculation in house property values which was at its peak in the autumn of 1947.  It was not stated at that time that the tax was proposed for the purpose of revenue. The case which was made by the Minister was that the continuing inflation in house and land property values had to be ended in the interests of our social economy, and particularly in the interests of persons of modest means who were unable to purchase houses to live in, and who were induced to purchase them with the aid of loans for amounts which were beyond their means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have a recollection that that fairly represents the mind of the Minister when he introduced the Supplementary Budget.  The House will remember that there was a considerable amount of inflation in regard to house and property values at that time.  These values, we know, have declined very much.  In fact, I think the position is, at the moment, that it is very hard to dispose of houses even around the £2,000 or £2,500 mark, so that it is clear that the duty was imposed for the purpose of checking inflation, and that inflation has been curbed and has been removed, at least to a considerable extent.  If that is so, then other grounds will have to be found to justify the continuance of this duty.  May I continue the quotation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council discussed the matter in the light of this information and it was decided that, in view of the Minister's statement and whether he was right or wrong in his view, that taxation of this kind would prevent or stop inflation, that the council could not, at that time, oppose the Act in principle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There came a change of Government, of course, and the council then continued to press for the removal of this duty, and this remark of the President will be of interest:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As you all know, the inflation in land and house values has ended, and if the tax was imposed with this object in view it seems to have <Col N="569" /> achieved its purpose.  In the view of the council, there is no longer any case for the continuance of this penal taxation directed at one section of the community, namely, the owners or prospective owners of land and house property.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society, I think, had some discussion with the Minister and they had a feeling that relief should be given as, I think, is clear from this remark of the President. May I quote again:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance, in the Budget proposals, has stated that the tax must be continued for the time being and from this statement it would appear that the increased stamp duties are being continued, not for their economic and social effects, but for fiscal reasons, and that the tax is now being regarded from the point of view of its yield to the Exchequer.  I wish again to reiterate the unfair and penal nature of a tax of this kind.  If revenue is required it should not be sought from one section of the community, many of whom are least in the position to pay.  These stamp duties have now assumed the form of a capital levy imposed upon one particular form of capital, namely, house property and land, and the persons from whom the levy is being extracted are in many cases those who for one reason or another are forced to change their residences, possibly for domestic reasons such as growing families, or persons who intend to marry, and who wish to purchase a residence in which to settle down.  Both of these classes are being mulcted to the extent of 5 per cent. on their capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think no words of mine can strengthen the case made in that statement for the removal of these duties.  When I heard of this at first, I inquired of my informant whether the amount of duty was of sufficient importance to deter people from buying house property, and I was assured that £100 would be the tax on £2,000, and that a £100 tax of this nature would make all the difference. This person informed me that he knew of people who had changed <Col N="570" /> their minds in regard to the purchase of houses because of this duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Who pays it raises another matter.  Just as Senator O'Connell mentioned this evening when I was referring to this question of films, people can come along and devise means of evading the law, and I am sure, that if the intention is that the vendor should pay this tax, there are ways of transferring the tax on to the purchaser.  That does not affect the case being made by this society, which represents all the solicitors of the country, people who know the extent to which this is affecting the disposal of house property.</P>
      <P>Last week this matter was referred to by the chairman of the New Ireland Assurance Company.  It is interesting to note the extent to which his view on this matter tallies with the view of the Incorporated Law Society.  May I quote from his address to the company at its meeting on the 20th of this month:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I reported last year that we had experienced some reduction in the volume of applications under our house purchase scheme.  While the position in this regard has greatly improved in the current year, your directors feel that the incidence of the heavy stamp duty payable on the purchase price of new houses has been the principal deterrent to many otherwise acceptable clients who just could not find the 5 per cent. on the purchase price, together with the necessary legal and other expenses involved in the purchase of a home for themselves and their families.  It was hoped that the Minister for Finance might have found it possible this year to reduce this heavy impost in the interest of those worthy citizens who desire to own their own homes, mostly young couples starting out in married life, who are not eligible for houses under the various Corporation or other scheme, even if these were suitable to their position and requirements. If family life is the basis of the <Col N="571" /> nation's wellbeing, as I believe it is, then everything that can be done should be done to encourage and assist young couples to own their own homes and so lay the foundation for a properly integrated future family life.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It does.  I think I read that out almost in the opening passage of the quotation, or words to that effect.  Senator Hawkins has advanced arguments in favour of the removal of this duty.  The Incorporated Law Society has been interested in this for some years and it has recently expressed its view that the duty is an unjust one in present circumstances and ought to be removed.  This insurance company, which has a good deal of business with prospective house buyers, expresses the view that the duty is unfair and ought to be removed. Individuals have spoken to me about it and have convinced me that whatever function it served in the past it no longer serves a useful function and that it ought to be removed.  On those grounds, I strongly support this recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the recommendation. I believe that anyone who would seriously study the situation will realise that conditions at present are completely different from those that operated when the tax was imposed. I have been reading over the debates and I can hardly believe that the people who made the statements when the tax <Col N="572" /> was imposed are now the people who are loudest in their approval of the continuance of that tax.  As has been stated in the Dáil by various speakers, the tax was imposed at a time when the price of property generally was soaring. It served its purpose.  It did what those who imposed it thought it would do, in so far as it reduced the price of houses and stopped the boom, when one house would be bought to-day for £3,000 and sold this day week for £4,000.  We have now reached a very different situation.  Property generally has deteriorated in value&mdash;whether houses or land, building sites or anything else.  There is not this rush which had to be checked at that particular time.  When the tax was being imposed, the man who is now Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I believe this tax will merely result in making house property dear and housing for persons with limited means impossible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach thought at that time that that would be the result, he was within his rights in opposing the tax. Having seen the results, I put it to the Minister that the Taoiseach, to be consistent, should say: &ldquo;We were in opposition to that tax at that particular time because we thought so and so would be the result.  Now we have lived to see that that was not the result and, far from increasing the price of houses, the price has decreased in the normal trend of business.&rdquo;  Deputy McGilligan, now Minister for Finance, at that time said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It will mean there will be a rise in the already swollen prices being paid for houses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am prepared to grant that they were sincere then, but they should examine the situation and see if, in the light of subsequent events, it is necessary to carry on that duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know something about the property market and while we have people on this side of the House stating that it is unfair to the vendor and other people on this side stating it is unfair to the purchaser, and both views on the other side of the House also, I say we have now reached the stage where it is unfair both to the purchaser <Col N="573" /> and to the vendor.  When the tax was first imposed, there were several cases where newly married couples went to buy houses.  A. had a house to sell and put it up for sale.  The price which would normally be realised was £2,000 and even by the time the normal legal expenses and auctioneer fees were paid out, it would still be within their reach. But the minute they found they had to pay another 5 per cent., they said: &ldquo;We cannot go that far; we have reached the end of our resources and the building society will not advance any further money.&rdquo;  That existed for a considerable time.  The vendors found they could not get the price they expected, having had to make provision for the payment of the 5 per cent.; and the purchaser could not buy the house at a sufficiently low price to enable him to pay the 5 per cent.  The result of it, in my opinion&mdash;others may differ&mdash;is that the vendor has now come to the stage where he is being forced to accept a price 2½ per cent. less than he would normally get if this duty were not continued, and the purchaser is forced to pay 2½ per cent. more than he would have paid.</P>
    <P>When you go back on it, it is amazing to find the statements made by people who are Ministers now.  We will have to take it that there is collective responsibility.  Deputy Dillon, as he then was, described this thing as:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A landlord's tithe, a dirty fraud, a dirty, deceitful game, a dirty wangle, flat-footed incompetence, a shuffling and cloutish way of dealing with the problem, a vicious and mean jab at those who are defenceless,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>in column 1171 of the Dáil Debates. That is fine language but there is not much sense to it.  I suggest that the situation has not changed so drastically in this country that the people who were then defenceless have got on the offensive.  I think that the people Deputy Dillon, as he was then, referred to are in the position that they must buy houses and they are in the defenceless position they were in when the then Deputy Dillon and the present Minister for Finance were prepared to back them.  Now that they have become the Government their attitude has changed and they can say to the people: &ldquo;You got so and so from the <Col N="574" /> last Government; you cannot expect to get anything more from us.&rdquo;&ldquo;You can go to blazes,&rdquo; in other words.  It does not matter what the then Deputy Dillon said on that occasion.  It only matters what he does.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance must have sat calmly around a table and said: &ldquo;We must swallow what we said, let the tax go merrily on and collect the money.  There can be no pretext about lowering the price of houses as it is not necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know why people should change so drastically in such a short time.  The position to-day is that building materials are far more plentiful than they were at that time and the question of building a house is not the great problem it was two or three years ago or even one year ago.  At the present time there is very little excuse for anybody who goes seriously to work for saying that he cannot manage to build a proper house for himself and his family.  Take the newly married couple who were going forward for accommodation a couple of years ago.  They were facing a quite different problem.  Even if they could get a site out in the country, not alone were building materials dear, but they were practically impossible to get, while to-day there is an entirely different situation. To my mind, the reason for imposing the tax has practically entirely disappeared.  We now have a situation where the property market could be described as steady, and if the 5 per cent.  tax were taken off in the morning it would merely mean that 2½ per cent, relief would be given to the vendor and 2½ per cent. relief to the purchaser.  That is my opinion, in any case.  It would allow the people who are clamouring for accommodation to purchase a house and start life on the right foot rather than to have to go to the directors of building societies or banks craving for a loan of a few extra pounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his handling of this matter in the other House adopted a system which I think is as old as the language he was speaking and that is a long time&mdash;perhaps it is not quite as old as the Irish language&mdash;that is, that attack is the best form of defence.  The Minister passed over a lot of the people <Col N="575" /> who are the sort of members from whose backs attacks would run like water off a duck's back.  He waited until he found Deputy P.J. Little and here is what the Minister, on 20th June on the Report Stage, said in his wrath that anybody should suggest that this tax should be taken off:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the amendment proper, Deputy Little has called this a harsh and oppressive tax, as driving a lot of lawyers to the position where they may shortly be described as shyster lawyers.  When the Deputy resumes his practice, as I suppose he has, and when this goes ahead in the inner lawyer's circle, he ought to be made president of the shysters' association, as it was he who put on this harsh and oppressive tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To say the least of it, I think that is an uncalled for attack on a decent man, a man who, I think, is regarded as a decent man by every section of the community in this country.  The Minister for Finance, however, takes it on himself to hold him up as a suitable man to be chairman of the shysters' committee in the legal profession. Deputy Paddy Little, as we all know, has been in the legal profession as a solicitor for a very great number of years and I have yet to find the man who will seriously stand up and cast any reflection whatever on Deputy Little's character or conduct in the legal profession.  If anybody else undertook to attack Deputy Little&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are people who have no mind to change and who go blindly on bashing their heads against stone walls.  A man is entitled to change his mind and see what the position was when the tax was imposed and compare it with what it is to-day. What I resent and what I am protesting against is the fact that a man because he does that must be attacked, chastised and classed amongst the worst elements of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I have transgressed the rules.  There is no point whatever in continuing this duty because money has become scarce in the country and the people who were in the market buying houses at £3,000 a year ago now find that they are unable to buy, despite all the talk about devaluation and so on.  In the same way, people who were prepared to buy houses at £5,000 are not now prepared to buy at that figure.  Money has become scarcer and this tax is really a means of collecting 2½ per cent. from the purchaser and 2½ per cent. from the vendor.  I definitely support the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity to become very heated about this recommendation. I fail to understand what Senator Quirke was trying to get at and I fail to understand the point he was trying to make about consistency. I have to admit that, while he was very voluble on the matter of this tax to-day, he was equally silent when it was imposed when he sat here.  It is always difficult to know exactly what Fianna Fáil desire in the matter of taxation.  They want this tax taken off, and, when this Minister took off another tax which they had imposed, they did their utmost to prove that he was foolish and stupid in doing so and that it ought to be reimposed. When he remitted the taxation on drink, tobacco and cinemas, Fianna Fáil speakers at every opportunity insisted that it was a stupid and foolish thing to do and urged the absolute necessity of reimposing it.  Probably with the exception of the auctioneers <Col N="579" /> and solicitors, the Party generally would be disappointed if the Minister decided to do as they ask.</P>
      <P>We must all admit that, no matter what side one is on, none of us likes to stand for the imposition of taxation. It would be delightful if we could live in the country and not have to pay any taxes, but we know well all the tortuous methods which people employ in an effort to get around their obligations to pay taxation.  There is no use pretending that it is popular for anybody on this side to defend a tax, but the Minister found a situation which you had created and which you, in your silence, supported.  There was not one word of the arguments you have tried to make here this evening uttered by any of you when the tax was imposed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>He has never been afraid to speak his mind, to say unpopular things and take the consequences. However, that is by the way. The argument which started this discussion was to the effect that there was a condition of inflation and that this tax was necessary in order to stem this rising tide of inflation.  The Minister was quoted as having said during the debate in the other House that the effect of this tax would be merely to cause a rise in the price of houses.  If one were to draw any conclusion from the arguments made here this evening, one would feel that the effect of the tax was to reduce the value and lower the price of houses and that in fact, because the tax is there, there is less demand for houses and property generally.  In the case of the New Ireland Assurance Company, demands <Col N="580" /> were not being made on their funds to the extent they desired, although the chairman's statement as quoted was that conditions were better this year than last year.  I do not know how conditions last year compared with those of the year before, but, if we had the whole story, we would have a fuller picture of the situation with regard to the New Ireland Assurance Company, whose practice apparently it is to give loans for the purchase of houses.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to enlighten the House on what the situation is.  The Incorporated Law Society have spoken about this.  I believe that if there is any case to be argued in regard to the remission of the tax it is the case of small farms down the country.  I think a case could be argued for that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the position generally, we know now that it is operating as a tax which the Minister is collecting. The difference between the Minister and his predecessor is that whatever taxes he is finding he is spending them wisely.  There was a good deal of taxation collected in the days of his predecessor which was not spent wisely, and, if all their plans had come to fruition, it would have been spent much more unwisely and the taxation would have been higher.  The Minister is getting hold of this tax.  It is not pleasant for the purchaser or the vendor, or for the auctioneers or the members of the Incorporated Law Society.  I do not know whether, if property were higher and there were a greater number of sales&mdash;Senator Quirke might be able to enlighten the House&mdash;the auctioneers would be prepared to come down from their 5 per cent. to 2½ per cent. and whether members of the Incorporated Law Society, for whom apparently Senator Ó Buachalla speaks here, would be prepared to lower their charges, if transfers of property were greater, either from the point of view of total turnover or numbers of units of property transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what the Minister has stated here and from what we know of the situation, there is no slowing down in the numbers of units of property being transferred and apparently no reduction in the total values of the property <Col N="581" /> changing hands.  Senator Quirke makes a statement to the contrary.  That apparently is his view and he ought to know better than I do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard again, perhaps the Minister will be able to enlighten us.  Perhaps there are not as many farms on the market as there were&mdash;I do not know.  Perhaps farmers are finding it more profitable to hold on to their property now, and are not as anxious as they were some years ago to dispose of it.  There are definitely thousands of new houses on the market for sale and, as Senator Quirke stated, there are materials and greater assistance from the Exchequer, as well as more opportunities for the transfer of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>And reducing the price of old houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>And presumably new houses too, so that the cost to purchasers is definitely lower to-day than it was some time ago.  In so far as the purchaser is paying, or the vendor is paying, the argument that young people setting up house could not find the money to do so is not half as strong now as when the tax was first imposed. Frankly the case made by speakers on behalf of this recommendation has been so contradictory that there is difficulty in understanding exactly what case they made.</P>
      <P>As far as I understand it, this tax was not popular and neither were the taxes on drink or tobacco which were supported by the Party opposite.  Not one of these taxes is popular, but the Minister has to decide how best he can serve the various activities of the State.  If this recommendation were within narrower limits, and had relation to small property worth from £500 to £1,000, it would present a different picture.  As far as the Minister is concerned, he is carrying on what was done by his predecessor, and maintaining a position for which the Party opposite stood.  Apparently the only thing wrong about the tax now is that it has the support of the present Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>As many speakers <Col N="582" /> have been referring to this problem I venture to add a few words.  There has been a very interesting argument going on as to who pays the tax, whether it is the purchaser or the vendor or if it is split fifty-fifty.  In my opinion the question is decided by the circumstances of each transaction.  There is what I call a purchaser's market, and when that comes about, the vendor has to pay and also vice-versa.  The real problem in connection with the purchase of a house concerns the person who cannot take out a cheque book and write a cheque for its value.</P>
      <P>I am referring to a person that I call for want of a better word, a black-coated worker, who is, probably, excluded from a corporation scheme but is looking for a house.  He is not in a position to take out a cheque book and write a cheque for the cost of a house. What has he to do then?  He has to go and find the price of the house and then get cover at a bank.  Somebody tells him the valuation of the house which is, probably, substantially less than the price he is asked to pay, even with the Government grant taken off. He has then to find the difference in the price as well as solicitor's and other costs.  What really happens is that there is a very narrow margin and this tax is added to the margin.  We are not discussing a matter of £2,000 but a matter of £100 added to the £300, so that £400 has to be found instead of £300 on getting possession.</P>
      <P>My suggestion for what it is worth is that the Minister or the Government should be a little more generous in regard to valuations.  It should be remembered that every house put up by a corporation or by other bodies costs the State a substantial amount. At the present time there is a steady market for desirable houses.  I will not say anything about materials being more plentiful.  I suppose it would be unseemly in my position as a builders' provider to do so.  But Senator Quirke spoke about the difficulty of obtaining materials for houses.  I thought the Senator might say that the merchants could not provide the newly-married couples for them.</P>

I am in agreement with Senator O'Brien when he stated last week that there is no particular virtue in political consistency.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is an excellent idea if the Senator is following the Minister's example, particularly when the Minister happens to be right. He is not infallible and neither am I. However, this is an excellent illustration of how dangerous it is to put on taxes more or less in a panic, and finding that a tax, put on in 1947, is afterwards found to be unpopular and acts unfairly in certain cases, but cannot be repealed.  From the point of view of any Minister for Finance, anybody who has been in politics for any time knows that no such Minister is able to do anything like what he would like to do.  He has to agree to a great deal of expenditure. He cannot take off all taxes and has to pick and choose in a particular year between one tax and another.  I shall not probe into the Minister's mind.  I shall not ask him to say whether this is a good tax or a bad tax.  We know he did not take it off.  But, I do want to suggest that at the moment this is a tax which should not be viewed simply from the point of view of revenue. Sooner or later, this tax will have to be <Col N="584" /> modified or taken off but I think it should be viewed from its possible effect on the provision of houses for the people.  I think that in a short time it will be found that the maintenance of too high a stamp duty is operating against the provision of houses.</P>
      <P>Remember, it is not only the man who builds a house who helps somebody else to get a house.  The man who, rightly or wrongly, fortunately or unfortunately, has made a sum of money and buys a larger house for himself, sells the smaller one and enables somebody else to buy it.  The net effect is that you get more accommodation.  If a house is built, it is another house and it undoubtedly will help.</P>
      <P>I do not see that there is the slightest bit of good for the Seanad to try to pass a recommendation of this kind but I do think that we would be justified in asking the Minister, between this and next year, to consider particularly this tax from the point of view of the effect it will have on the building programme and in relation to subsidies, etcetera. I am confident that that is a thing he is doing or possibly has done.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I think we are rather futile in the eyes of the public in trying to make taxes of this kind Party issues and debating whether something that was good in 1947, or ideal in 1947, is now extremely bad.  The fact is that it was not ideal in 1947 and may or may not have been justified.  It is not ideal now and in certain cases it is operating in an undesirable manner.</P>

      <P>The time has come when the Minister should reconsider this tax.  He should listen to the appeal of Senator Douglas.  Senator Douglas's statement was quite sound.  I personally believe that it is an injustice to continue this tax at the present time. It may or may not have been necessary to have done it in 1947.  I was not a member of the House then.  I know that a considerable number of people resented it at the time.  The Government of the day were convinced that they had no alternative.  Granted, they had no alternative.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The people were of the opinion that the idea in introducing the tax was to stop the inflation that was setting in in the high cost of houses.  That was what the people understood, regardless of anything that was said by way of interjection by the Opposition.  The people were led to believe that it was introduced for the purpose of stopping people rushing in and paying high prices in a period when building materials were very scarce and dear and when houses were scarce. Now that we have returned to a more normal period, the Minister should consider the matter.  I do not care whether it is this Minister or some other Minister.</P>
      <P>I regard it as an injustice that a young man who is settling down, in addition to having to get a couple of thousand pounds together, has to pay £100 by way of stamp duty.  The time has come when that should be changed, especially in view of the fact that materials are fairly plentiful, that more people are prepared to go into the building business and houses can be more easily acquired.  The Minister should face up to it.  I regard it as an injustice.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of what the former Minister may have said and irrespective of what the present Minister said when he was a Deputy, the people of this country regard this duty as an injustice in normal times.  The times are fairly normal now, more normal than they were in 1946 and 1947.  The Minister should listen attentively to what Senator Douglas has said. Senator Douglas's contribution was quite sound.  The Minister should give a promise to this House that in the next Budget he will seriously consider the matter and have that section of the Finance Act of 1947 repealed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, like Senator Douglas, I do not like this tax but there are so many taxes that I do not like that that is scarcely an argument. The debate has wandered around the question.  The matter has been largely <Col N="586" /> debated on both sides on the basis of what was said in 1947.  &ldquo;Oh would some power the giftie gi'e us, To see ourselves as others see us.&rdquo;  We ought to debate the question on the merits. I did not like this tax in 1947.&mdash;that is not saying whether it was just or not in 1947&mdash;but, if this tax was a just tax in 1947, it is just to-day.</P>
      <P>We must regard this from the point of view of the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance has a very difficult task.  His job is to assess the burden of taxation as best he can on the people who can best bear it. I might debate the matter on the same lines as Senator Hawkins and Senator Quirke and throw stones and say: &ldquo;You voted for this in 1947 and you are coming to-day to oppose it without any valid reasons.&rdquo;  Senator Quirke will retort that he has numerous reasons. I am trying to argue that the arguments are the other way and that if this tax was a just tax in 1947, it is a just tax to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Senator Quirke's own words building is not the problem it was in 1947.  In other words, builders have a better opportunity of providing houses now than they had in 1947 and can produce them at a cheaper rate.  There has been no argument put up in the debate by anybody that the condition of the people who purchase houses is worse now than it was in 1947.  I could argue to the contrary and say that the position of almost everybody who purchases a house now is better than it was in 1947 and that he or she is better able to bear the tax now on any particular commodity than he or she was in 1947.  We could go into the question in a variety of ways.  In 1947 there was a standstill wages Order.  There has been a great increase in wages since 1947.  On the question as to whether the people are better of now than in 1947, I think the consensus of opinion in this House would be that they are something better off.  Senator Quirke may not agree, but I think that the consensus of opinion is that they are. I do not think anybody can get up here and make a tangible argument for the case that the people generally are worse off than in 1947.  I do not like this tax but I want to discuss it in the light of what the Minister has to do. <Col N="587" /> The Minister has to assess his bill on the shoulders of the people who could best bear it.  As Senator Douglas said, a Minister sometimes takes the line of least resistance.  A Minister who finds certain taxes amongst his existing taxes says to himself: &ldquo;Which of these can I most easily retain or dispose of?&rdquo; There are certain taxes which he reduces, certain taxes he wipes out, and certain taxes he retains.  The Minister was not able, in his review, to remove this tax and the Minister found no argument whatever for abolishing it. He did not find that the circumstances of the people who sold houses or who bought houses were worse than in 1947. In fact, I suppose he persuaded himself they were better, as I am persuading myself they are better.  As far as I can see, the Minister was justified in retaining the tax that was put on in 1947. It would be for the people who are proposing the recommendation to prove that there were other taxes that the Minister could more easily impose than the tax recommended to be taken off. The retort can be made that they do not recommend the imposition of any tax, but we could all go on proposing recommendations that certain taxes should be wiped out until we reduced the Budget or the Bill to a nullity.</P>
    <P>If we conscientiously propose a recommendation we have got to make some case.  I want to see some Senator getting up and saying, that if the Minister takes off this imposition, which I do not like, what is going to be put on instead of it.  I am one of the people supporting this Budget as a whole.  There are various parts which I do not like.  There are any number of items in the taxation proposed by this Minister, and by the past Minister, which I do not like, but I have got to swallow them, whether I like it or not.  This is, certainly, one of the taxes I like least.  While I am appealing to the Minister, that at the first available opportunity, I hope in the next Budget, he will do away with this tax, I think it is fair to say that the arguments for the retention of the tax have been greater than any argument made against it.  I do not see that the position has worsened, in any respect, <Col N="588" /> as regards the vendors and purchasers of houses.  If the tax was a just tax then, I cannot see that it has been proved that it is an unjust tax in 1950.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. D. Burke Mr. D. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Minister said in his speech on the Finance Bill, either last year or the previous year, that this was a tax that he hoped at some time to modify. Certainly, it is not a tax which he introduced.  It has been a hereditary element of the budgetary structure for some years past, and it will be very difficult for the Minister to remove it this year.  I personally, do not like this tax, and the reason I do not like it is, that it is a tax on ownership. I believe ownership is a very important factor in our life, and that we should in our method of taxation, see that it would encourage ownership and make it as widespread as possible.  Any form of tax on property is a tax or deterrent on ownership and, for that reason, I dislike it.  I would like to support what Senator Baxter said when he asked the Minister, especially, to consider the tax on small properties up to about £1,000.  If we want real responsibility in this country, we will not have it, until most of the people in the country own something in the country.  That is the reason I am against this form of tax.  I do hope that the Minister will, as soon as he has an opportunity to do so, modify or even remove this tax completely.  It is a tax which this side of the House never approved of, and while the other side of the House did approve of it at one time, they have now come to a realisation that it should go.  I hope, then, that the Minister will, in a very few years time, be able to remove this tax completely from the Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of the argument for the recommendation has been based upon what the solicitors' profession have said and what the chairman of the New Ireland Insurance Company has said.  I want to say, right away, that I am not impressed by either of these.  I met the deputation from the Incorporated Law Society.  They are a very fine body of men.  They play a very important function in the life of this country, <Col N="589" /> and they are people who, undoubtedly, as a profession, have gained for themselves considerable repute, and it is a reputation that I would be the last person to take away from them.  When they come into me to develop a case for a particular tax, I have to become a bit of a realist.  Above all people, joining them with the other branch of the profession, they are people most expert in making a case, and everybody will make a better case, the more his personal interest is involved.  I do not think I am saying anything that the solicitors' profession as a whole would repudiate when I say they were particularly anxious about sales of properties, and whether sales of properties were going to be impeded by the tax.  As a matter of fact, one of the spokesmen on that occasion, said property sales had almost come to a standstill; yet, that was one of the arguments when you are on the defensive that you like to hear, because it was so ludicrous, it was easy to defeat.  I was able to point out the duty taking fruits of the tax and what transfers had been in value.  I was able to point out what our experts, the Revenue Commissioners, had forecast as the probable revenue from the tax in a later year.  We have not in any year forecast a fall.  Sales of property are still going on, and if you take £600,000&mdash;it is around that figure &mdash;revenue derived from this tax, it means there is property of £12,000,000 changing hands each year, and if the unit price is gone down, it must mean that the £600,000 has, not merely been retained, but is increasing, and that there are more individual sales, and it is on the individual sale the solicitors look to get a return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the solicitors made that case, they were entitled to make it and made it vigorously and in an efficient way. I do not think it is going to gain credence unless the solicitors are to be thought of as social reformers or as people completely altruistic.  They were speaking on behalf of the profession and wanted to see sales continuing and were definitely relieved when they found they were going to be continued at the old rate.  The forecast was borne out and in fact this year we estimate a slight increase in the fruits of the taxation.  Property sales are not going <Col N="590" /> down.  The rather solid arguments the solicitors made have only been weakened by the completely exaggerated statements made as to property sales being brought to a standstill.</P>
    <P>Regarding the statement of the Chairman of the New Ireland Assurance Company, I was interested to note that Senator Ó Buachalla quoted it only in part, though even that included a statement that the situation had improved during the year, that is during the year in relation to which the forecasts were that it would be disastrous, a complete disaster in regard to sales of property.  There has not been any complete disaster.  Even the statement proved that.  I wish the Senator got the whole report.  I think he would have found that profits had increased, that dividends were greater and that the chairman, at the end, as well as complaining about the property tax, had also gone on to say that the wear and tear allowances, which would cost the State this year £800,000, should be removed in accordance with what the industry put up.  That meant he wanted £800,000 in regard to industry and would like to have, say, £480,000 remitted in relation to the purchase of property&mdash;all for the good of new Ireland, or The New Ireland.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the auctioneers, they are people rather shy of bringing forward proposals.  I met them also.  They, too, were rather concerned about the sales of property and made a wonderful case, the first time I heard them, on the inflated values put on house property. When one of the people receiving the deputation with me suggested that that might be a reason for the auctioneers to remit part of their 5 per cent. and take, say, 4 or 4½, a sudden chill came in the room.  It was pointed out that that would assist sales and that, even on the statement they were making, a 4½ per cent.  return to auctioneers on the inflated value of property would have brought them in as much as 5 per cent.  On a more reasonable return. They did not accept the argument.  The auctioneers want us to remit the 5 per cent., the solicitors want their 3 per cent., the Chairman of New Ireland, although business is improving, wants £800,000 for industry, all to be provided so that everything can be merrier <Col N="591" /> still than it is now in the garden.  These are the outsiders.</P>
    <P>The people most intimately connected with the tax are those now concerned in this proposal.  I did not say this had been stated to be a revenue tax: I said that what was said was tantamount to an admission that it was a revenue tax.  The Minister for Finance, asked what the purpose of the tax was, asked what was going to come from it, said&mdash;may I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the vendor whose price is going to be reduced by the 5 per cent. Five per cent. instead of going into the vendor's pocket is going to go into the pocket of the Treasury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was 1947.  I did not believe that would be the result and for that reason I protested.  I believed that in the then conditions, when the vendors had the whip hand, they would impose this tax on the purchasers and the purchasers in some way or other would have to cover it by getting the accommodation, and they would be fleeced a little more.  I start from that point. The amazing thing in this debate is that the arguments coming from the side of the House in favour of the removal of this have been coercively in favour of retaining it.  There is no better argument than that of Senator Quirke.  He said in the old days that there was difficulty in regard to houses, inflated prices, a great scarcity of house property, and prices soaring.  At the moment he says that certain houses are unsold.  It seems to me, to add to the possible superfluity of houses, that building materials are plentiful and that there ought to be a recrudescence in house building.  In those circumstances, all that situation is changed.</P>
    <P>Senator Dockrell has said that the best part of the debating society argument is whether there is or is not a purchaser's market.  I think there is, certainly more so than in 1947.  In those circumstances, who is likely to pay? Senator Quirke puts it, even at the worst, that the purchaser has to pay 2½ per cent. and the vendor 2½ per cent.  I do not think it is even as bad as that.  I think that at the moment there is a bit of a purchaser's market and that the vendors are probably being asked to pay the whole difference. <Col N="592" /> The only case that could be argued at this stage is as to whether the vendor is being mulcted too heavily.  With regard to that&mdash;when one makes a general statement, exceptions can be made to it&mdash;in general I do not think this community will be terribly worried about the vendors of house property. They did really well during the war and they dug in.</P>
    <P>The President of the country, when he was Minister for Finance, came in with a threat of new legislation at one time with regard to taxes, on the ground that he found people making money out of the exigencies of the needy.  If any people were doing that, it was those engaged in house building and as a class I would find it very hard to persuade myself to give them any remission at this point.  I think we have a lot to get back from them that they made from the needy elements of the community during the war years. That general statement does not apply to each individual who might be thought of.  People now in the position of owners of property, who want to sell it, will be hit, but the Minister for Finance has to take the whole general situation and in the circumstances I have no heart about giving away £480,000 to the vendors of house property.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear someone say that money was scarce now.  I do not find money scarce.  I look at the bank returns, seeing the amount of increased credit being given, and consider also the amount of money being pumped into circulation through all the capital development the present Government engaged in in 1948, increased in 1949 and which we hope will be increased still further this year.  I do not see how anyone could say that money is scarce.  In fact, it is because money is plentiful that there is a little bit of danger about this tax.  It may be that certain people will get money so easily into their hands that they may be paying something above the price at which the house would be sold if they were able to stick out a little longer.  It is not a question of money being more scarce, but of people being more price conscious, particularly with regard to house property when they look back over the bad years of the <Col N="593" /> war when they were scandalously treated by the house vendors of those days.</P>
    <P>As far as the argument goes with regard to a drastic change in such a short time, people who use that argument ought to remember that circumstances have changed very drastically in two years.  The situation in 1947&mdash; in which there was a great scarcity of all houses and of certain houses in particular, with the terrible need there was and the pressure on people to get some sort of accommodation&mdash;played into the hands of people with houses to sell.</P>
    <P>An argument that was used in 1947 appropriate to those circumstances would be futile as an argument in present circumstances where there has been such a complete change.  I have no doubt about it, no one could argue otherwise, the price of houses has come down.  That is due to a variety of circumstances and there are fluctuations still going on; there are ups and downs and nobody can say with certitude that the property market is in a settled state.</P>
    <P>I have the feeling that if this tax were remitted at the moment and the duty diminished the vendors might seize on that as an excuse for an increase in prices once more and that is a development which I do not want to take place.  Although this may press hard on certain people, I intend to keep it for this year.</P>
    <P>I want to join the company who are against taxes.  I am against this tax and against every tax.  The ideal I have is to leave every individual in the community with more money in his pocket to jingle and to spend as he proposes instead of the State taking it from him to spend.  There are certain things, of course, for which the State must take money&mdash;housekeeping expenses. I cannot carry out the ideal I really have because pressure is put on me from every side, from my own supporters in the Government and from the Opposition, to increase State intervention in certain developments, and as far as that goes more and more of the people's income must be taken to be spent in what I feel in the end is a wasteful way instead of leaving it to the people themselves to spend.  I would like to see this tax remitted but <Col N="594" /> I would not give it high priority. Allowances were mentioned and I would like to bring subsistence allowances into greater consonance with the value of money.  I would give that matter priority, and while I would put this tax close to it, I would certainly not give it a high rank.</P>
    <P>The best argument for this tax and against the recommendation has been made by those who support the recommendation and are opposed to the tax, while Senator Dockrell made the best argument against the tax.  I would like to discuss the matter with him later.  With his knowledge, more precise knowledge and better information than any other member of the House has, notwithstanding that, he says he will vote against the recommendation. That should commend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the tone of the Minister's reply seems to be much less sympathetic towards this recommendation than it was this time last year.  I understood last year that he would, before the introduction of this Finance Bill, give sympathetic consideration to the removal of this particular duty but that sympathetic approach seems to have been abandoned in the 12 months that are passed.</P>
      <P>The discussion has centred mostly around the position of young people who are anxious to purchase homes for themselves but I would like to draw to the attention of rural Senators particularly that this duty affects more people than that.  It affects property of any kind over a certain figure whether the property is transferred on death or as a marriage settlement. That is a tax which should not be imposed.  Such a tax should not be imposed where property passes from a father or a mother to a son or daughter in the case of death or as a marriage settlement.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter would like to forget the position which arose not alone after the last war but after the first world war; that position existed in 1947 and it is very doubtful whether we are clearly out of it yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dockrell expressed sympathy with the recommendation and with his knowledge of the building trade and the supplies position his contribution was certainly very important, but his solution did not recommend itself to me.  What he suggests as the solution of the problem which we propose to try to rectify is to give more cover.  I take it that what he meant was that the banks and lending societies should be more generous in their valuation of the buildings.  While the person seeking financial assistance would welcome that at the moment in the long run he would have more to pay because the bank would be prepared to make a greater percentage of the cost of the house available to him.  Take the £2,000 house.  The imposition of this tax means that an additional £100 has got to be found.  If the applicant&mdash;as <Col N="596" /> in almost 99 cases out of 100 he must-has to seek a loan from a building society or bank, he must, together with the rest of the £2,000 or whatever proportion of it he can get, raise £100 extra to meet this stamp duty.  That £100 has to be paid.  For what?  As a tax for having tried to provide a home for himself.  It does not end there.  Having borrowed the £2,000 to be repaid over 25 to 35 years, he is forced to pay for an additional period 5 or 6 per cent. per annum on that £100. The auctioneer's fee can be avoided perhaps because all transactions are not conducted through an auctioneer but he has to meet legal expenses.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for the Minister to suggest that the builder, auctioneer or solicitor or all three combined should say: &ldquo;We will make a reduction sufficient to enable you to meet the tax which the Government are compelling you to meet.&rdquo;  The Minister has made no case.  There is also the question of the delay in the conveyancing as the result of the imposition of this tax.</P>
    <P>I can safely say that the majority of the members on the other side of the House are as anxious to see this tax removed as we are and they regret, I am sure, the Minister's attitude.  I am disappointed that his approach is not what it was last year and that he has not given us some ray of hope that even next year he would be prepared to remove the tax.  It is certainly hitting very hard those people who propose to purchase a home for themselves.</P>

I said that the payments that had been made for some years out of the Transition Development Fund would be transferred, or appropriate payments would be substituted, and borne on the Vote for the Department of Local Government. What those will be, I am not in a position to say.  I do hope to get some new scheme with regard to the grants for houses to substitute for the present very complicated system under which grants come from about three sources.  I want to simplify that.  We are continuing the Transition Development Fund until 31st March, 1951.  The Senator ought to possess himself in patience until some time in the early stages of 1951 to discover what will be the situation after that.  I can make no promises.</P>

      <P>I notice that this section refers to a Capital Service Redemption Account.  I think the Minister, on the Second Reading, said we could look through the Estimate and any item with which we did not agree could be queried.  Last year, when the Minister was speaking on the Finance Bill, he spoke of a loss that was incurred on the turf account.  I think it ran into millions.  That item is included as a capital item.  I take it that that loss is still there and that it is a liability that the State will have to discharge. I do not know how it has altered over <Col N="599" /> the past 12 months, but now that we are starting a capital account in which, presumably, all the items can be included, I would like to ask the Minister where our liabilities are shown as against the turf account, what they amount to and whether they will be brought into capital account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">
      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard Section 22 as being one of the interesting features of this Bill.  We see here the creation of a redemption fund to amortise this £12,000,000 odd that is being borrowed for capital purposes.  Perhaps, with your permission, Sir, I might quote the words of the Minister in his Budget statement, where he epitomises what he regards as the economic obligation of the State:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One of the primary responsibilities of a Government is to promote by an enlightened budgetary and investment policy the continuous and efficient use of national resources in men and materials.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What I find so interesting in viewing the various items for which the Minister proposes to borrow, and under this section, amortise over 30 years, is that, taking merely the three items in the Vote for Agriculture, the amount that he proposes to borrow is £3,800,000 and there is £350,000 for poultry this year.  The interesting point that strikes me on that is the astonishingly small sum it is necessary to find to amortise some of the borrowings once the production following this capital expenditure gets going; in other words, once this capital expenditure starts to earn actual, real dividends.</P>
      <P>Obviously, if you are proposing to collect the money for the redemption of capital expenditure from earnings that follow from this capital expenditure, you can only do that in simple manner if the resultant product is in some way canalised so that it passes through a bottleneck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of poultry.  I do not know what is the total figure that has been borrowed for poultry development but now the actual export of eggs has reached the astonishing sum of £5,250,000 this year.  Twopence in the £ would easily amortise the borrowing. I wonder has the Minister <Col N="600" /> ever considered, in the light of his Budget remarks, that, let us say, to augment this redemption fund, he could collect sums off the various items that go to make up the total that he has borrowed for productive purposes. I suggest the case that I have given, poultry.  Obviously, the Minister cannot collect anything in any way for a considerable term of years off land reclamation, which is the big item, amounting to over £3,000,000 this year, but if, in the process, he could satisfy himself and the community that some of these borrowings were in themselves self-liquidating, he would be justified in the eyes of all in undertaking greater capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>Senator George O'Brien when he was speaking on the Second Reading rather suggested, that if he had any criticism as regards the Budget, it was that the Minister was not borrowing enough.  I wonder has it occurred to the Minister that in agriculture there are certain products that lend themselves to some sort of tax collection in a simple manner.  I would like, as I said in my Second Reading speech, to see large sums of money spent on research.  I would not in the least mind, once a saving was effected by the increase of knowledge, if the money to run that research was collected off the farming community.  I think it would be only right and just, and sound business. Obviously, all borrowing for desirable purposes done by the State cannot necessarily be self-liquidating, but I think a great deal or something more can be done than is done at present, to see that certain sorts of capital expenditure by the State can, by suitable mechanism, be made self-liquidating.</P>
    <P>Let me finish on this note: it has always been one of the great problems in all countries, where you have a large number of small farms, to find any mechanism for injecting fresh capital into the agricultural system.  Here in this, or related to this, section, the State, to some extent, is finding capital, and directing that capital to be sunk in agriculture for a specific purpose. I have given the example of how, quite obviouly, from the increase in the export of poultry and eggs, money already borrowed can be amortised with a very small levy on the <Col N="601" /> £5,750,000 that the export has amounted to since the initial poultry scheme started, I think, in 1948.</P>
    <P>Let me give one other possible example of what I mean.  We all know that research might indicate how manures can be used more effectively. At present, the farmers are spending £3,000,000 on manures, and an improvement or saving of waste of 2 per cent. would bring in quite a large sum of money which could be usefully devoted to research.  I suggest, that now the idea of a capital budget and a capital redemption account has been instituted, that we should see and judge whether it is not possible actually to increase useful borrowing, provided, in some way, we could make these debts incurred either self-liquidating or, at any rate, partially so.</P>

      <P>The point of detail put to me was as to how the losses, so to speak, on the turf fuel up in the Phoenix Park are going to be met.  That lies in the future.  They are not at all referred to in this Section 22.  There will be very heavy losses arising to the State as a result of the accumulation of unsaleable or practically unsaleable turf in the Park.  It is one of the debts we got from the last Government.  It will have to be liquidated.  How it will be done, I am not in a position to say at the moment.  It is being carried on overdraft at the moment, and it is not the best possible financial situation to have it so appear.  On the other side, there have been savings here and there. I was able to get a profitable sale of the Constellations that were bought and, obviously, going to be used at a loss to the State.  I turned these into a gain, in any event, on the capital side.  There are certain other sales that can be effected.  Even though they do not bear any relationship to the money put in at the beginning, they can be used to offset the very heavy loss, and if the State gets out with a loss on the fuel accumulated in the Park of some £4,000,000, it is going to be lucky.  That is one of the things we have got to take on, left to us by those who preceded us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as this capital account is concerned, I should make it clear, that Section 22, with the sum of £655,432 <Col N="602" /> has relation only to the sum of £12,113,680 which is set out as the Capital Services on the face of this year's Estimates.  That is not the only Capital Service to which we are going to apply money.  In addition to that £12,000,000, there will be found in the Estimate of Receipts and Expenditure that is always presented round about Budget time, what is called under the line expenditure.  This year, there is set out a sum of £19,630,000.  As I explained on the Financial Resolutions in Dáil Éireann, that figure does not cover the full amount, because certain returns will come to some of these funds from time to time, and they will also be ploughed back into capital development during the year.  If you add the £19,000,000 odd, and the £12,000,000 odd, there is a sum of about £32,000,000, but the sum we are setting aside is not £32,000,000, but more nearly £34,000,000, for capital development.</P>
    <P>Section 22 has relation to the £12,113,680.  The section need not have appeared there, but under the existing legislation, and without any special provision in the Finance Act of this year, any moneys devoted to capital services in the Central Fund Act and the Appropriation Act would be charged on the Central Fund, as also would any sinking fund attached to any long-term borrowing, by way of national loan.  Making an innovation this year of these capital services, which are carried in a preliminary way on the face of the Estimates, we decided it was better to mark the occasion by including this special section, which makes provision for the payment into a special account year by year, over 30 years, of the sum of money set out, of which the sum mentioned at the top of page 12, £423,000, represents the debt. The difference between the two represents the amortisation account.</P>
    <P>As to what Senator Orpen asked me about the poultry borrowings, I am not in a position to reply at the moment, but I know that in the £12,000,000 is a sum of £350,000, which is an advance of £100,000 on the sum set aside last year.  That is all I am in a position to say about it at the moment.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (5) provision is made for the payment of <Col N="603" /> £423,979, which I understand is to cover the interest to be paid on the £12,000,000 which the Minister proposes to borrow.  What is the rate of interest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has set out the purposes to which the £12,000,000 will be put.  Over a period of 30 years, provision is made for the setting aside each year of £655,432.  We have now from the Minister that the sum of £400,000 odd is for the payment of interest.  Many of us at one time or other considered the interest rather high, and I remember on many occasions the Minister himself giving expression to the point of view that the prevailing rate of interest was rather high.  For housing in general, he subscribed at one time to the proposal that not alone was 1¼ per cent. sufficient for the State to borrow at but that the applicant should be in the position to receive loans at that rate of interest. However, there is very little we can do about it now.  This provision is made over 30 years and we will have the privilege of paying back £20,000,000 over the period.  That is a huge sum. We must take into consideration that the £12,000,000, with the other sums the Minister mentioned, coming altogether to £34,000,000, is to be expended this year.  We must make provision for the repayment but must also look forward to the probability that it will be necessary to borrow £12,000,000 more next year and for a number of years to follow.  If the State is to be burdened with £650,000 each year, at the end of the period we will be faced, for every £12,000,000, with paying back £20,000,000.  That will be a big burden on the State.  The money invested or expended will have to be expended on works of a reproductive nature.</P>
      <P>Members on this side of the House have no objection to borrowing.  Our objection to some of the provisions is that many of the items should be provided for out of taxation.</P>

      <P>For instance, housing grants.  We had considerable sums spent over a number of years on many useful schemes&mdash;land improvement schemes, farm improvement schemes, farm building schemes, and so on.  All these moneys were provided out of taxation.  Now we are having something in the way of a new idea and all the provision necessary to carry out these works is not to be met out of current taxation.  This year it cost £24,000,000 for administration costs alone and we are faced with finding something in the region of £700,000 to provide for the payment of loans that have to be raised in the future.</P>

      <P>The total administration of the Government Departments of this country costs something in the region of £24,000,000.  When we take all this into consideration, we cannot be too happy about the position.  We are anxious to draw the Minister's attention to exactly where we are going and what the position will be. Particularly when Marshall Aid ends, it is important that whatever money is being expended should be raised through taxation at the moment.  We all remember in the early stages that many protests were made, particularly as a result of the conditions arising out of the world war when money was made very plentiful by the banks. Quite a number of farmers purchased land and stock and when the slump came and the banks decided to call in their cash they found themselves in a very awkward position.  What happens the individual can happen the State. If repercussions come along and we find ourselves in difficulties here, we will find it very hard to meet both our national debt and whatever debts we owe to other countries.</P>

      <P>I would again appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to the effect of taking the £300,000 from the Road Fund.  This section proposes to take that round sum from the Road Fund.  The local authorities I think are prepared to argue that this money is theirs and that they are entitled to it.  Irrespective of Party outlook they argue that any Minister for Finance who proposes to take money from this fund is taking money to which they are justly entitled. That fund was regarded as the kitty out of which roads could be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator remember what the then Minister for Finance said in 1947?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard all Ministers <Col N="606" /> for Finance as being prepared to take the line of least resistance.  They will get money in the easiest possible way and when they cannot get it in that way they resort to more intricate ways of getting money.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to bring the House into a debate on the question of whether the road grants were justly reduced some time ago, but I have always felt that there was no proper plan in the giving of moneys to local authorities. They were given seemingly on some basis which had no equity.  Many local authorities, particularly in the West, in Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Leitrim, part of Longford and Cavan&mdash;I am outlining the congested districts&mdash;could never by local taxation raise the money to take proper advantage of the road grants when they were more substantial than they are at the present time, and the result is that their roads are not up to a reasonable standard.</P>
      <P>Because of their contracting taxable capacity and because the councils of these counties with their engineering staffs and organisation were tied hand and foot in the production of turf, they were not in a position to bring their roads up to standard as quickly as the eastern counties.  No wonder that when counties in the West hear rumours that £300,000 is to be spent by an apparently rich local authority on one road of 12 miles from Dublin to Bray they must feel a grievance as they could not get that amount of money to spend over their whole area with 1,000 to 1,200 miles of roads to be made.  Irrespective of political outlook, the members of the councils of those counties felt that there was something wrong with that sort of thing and that there was something very unjust and inequitable in the administration when one county could afford that amount of money while others cannot afford to bring their roads up to a reasonable standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By means of some plan the Minister should try to arrange that grants would be available after a proper survey and having a regard to their needs to certain counties whose taxable capacity has contracted.  The reduction of the road grants caused a loss of £60,000 this year and £60,000 last year to one <Col N="607" /> council in which I am interested.  A penny in the £ to that council would mean something less than £600,000 on the poor law valuation of that county. It would be quite impossible for that council to raise enough money to give a service comparable to that of richer local authorities.  Many local authorities in the West that cannot get money to do the things they would like to do feel that this money should not be taken away but that it should be given to the local authorities.  The Minister in conjunction and collaboration with the Minister for Local Government should provide, after a proper survey, moneys out of the Central Fund which would ensure that such local authorities would have enough money to give reasonable service and he should attempt to make them equal to counties better able to meet their responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, I am only interested in the Road Fund to the extent of seeing how much money goes to the Exchequer from it and from the Exchequer to it and how to stop money going from the Exchequer to it.  How it is distributed after it gets there is a matter for Local Government and I will refer to that Minister what the Senator has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Virtue should be unostentatious and I am being made ostentatious with regard to my virtue on this.  When increased charges were put on motorists in 1947 it was stated by the then Minister for Finance that these would not accrue to the Road Fund but would come to the general Exchequer.  In those days the amount was small; over <Col N="608" /> a full year it would be £300,000.  Many more vehicles are registered now, however, than in 1947 and if I were following strictly what the then Minister for Finance in 1947 had arranged I would take, not £300,000, but something near £500,000, so I am giving back some £200,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
