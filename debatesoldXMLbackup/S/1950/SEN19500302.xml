    <Title>Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1949&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins) Thomas Francis (Jnr.) O'Higgins">

      <P>This Bill, as Senators will observe, is a three-line Bill and it is introduced at this stage purely for the purpose of giving a legal existence to the Army after the 31st March.  Last December in Dáil Éireann I introduced the permanent Army Bill, and I hope to be back here within the next two months with that permanent Army Bill.  In it, when it comes along, there will be a section which will rescind this Bill on the date on which the permanent Bill comes into force.  In the light of that set of circumstances, I suggest for the consideration of Senators that it would be inadvisable, and to an extent a waste of time, if we were to have a debate now on this temporary Defence Forces Bill and another full-dress debate on the Army in connection with the permanent Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I am introducing this Bill at the moment is so that, when the permanent Bill comes before the two Houses, neither the Dáil nor the Seanad will be up against either the face of the clock or the calendar.  This Bill will keep the Army in existence, if required, for 12 months, from 1st April next, so that the permanent Army Bill can be approached in a leisurely, contemplative frame of mind, so that there will be no rush and no hurry and so that both the Dáil and the Seanad will have ample time to consider it in full. I put that to Senators for their reasonable consideration, but, on the other <Col N="660" /> hand, if any Senators desire or require or think it advisable to have a full-scale discussion on the Army at the moment, I am quite agreeable and am in the hands of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to a great extent with the suggestion put forward by the Minister that as this is a temporary measure and as the comprehensive permanent Bill is to come before us within the next two months, this may not be the best time for a prolonged discussion on the Army.  At the same time, the Bill which the Minister proposes to bring to the House will, I expect, be a rather weighty document, and, as much of our attention will be directed to what is in that Bill, it may not be any harm at this stage to make one or two suggestions as to what we would like future policy in connection with the Army to be.</P>
      <P>It is very essential that we have an efficient Army, not so much in point of numbers as in point of personnel and that that Army be well equipped with up-to-date weapons of every kind.  We would like to know what steps are being taken to prepare the country in case another emergency arises.  We were very lucky on the last occasion that the real war took something like 12 months to start after the outbreak of hostilities and that in that period it was possible to build up a good Army and an efficient civil defence force.  We may not get the same opportunity the next time.  We have seen the nations of the world almost on the day the last shot was fired in the recent war preparing for another.  It is not very popular sometimes to advocate the keeping of a permanent Army because of the burden it places on the people, but we must realise that it is a very good insurance policy.  In that connection, I should like to have from the Minister, if he thinks it advisable to give them, details of the progress made in the recent recruiting campaign.  The campaign was begun in what, I think, was a rather half-hearted attempt to induce our young people to go into the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also a civil defence force and I am afraid that sufficient attention is not being paid to it.  In many parts of the country, the organisation <Col N="661" /> is dwindling in numbers and there is a general feeling that it is not getting the encouragement, help and assistance it requires to become an efficient service. There are also other defence measures which must be taken.  The British Government last November went in for a very extensive scheme of organising home defence services.  What are we here doing about it and what do we propose to do about it?  If we are to be engaged in the next war, we must face the fact that there is no use in our taking part in it if we have not got the ways and means of doing so. If, on the other hand, we intend to maintain our neutrality, as in the recent war, we must have something with which to defend that neutrality and freedom, so no matter what decision we come to, it is, as I have said, essential that we have an efficient defence force.</P>

      <P>I should like to know, in view of the permanent measure which is to come before us in the near future, what opportunity the Seanad will then have of discussing Army matters, apart from the opportunity provided by such omnibus measures as the Appropriation Bill or some such Bill.  It is very desirable that the Seanad should have some opportunity of discussing Army matters, and when the permanent Bill has been enacted, it seems to me that we will no longer have that opportunity.</P>

      <P>Sílim go mbeimid ar fad sásta gur innis an tAire dúinn go bhfuil an Bille seasmhach cuid mhaith chun cinn aige agus gur gearr go mbeidh sé ag teacht os ár gcomhair.  Sílim go mbeidh muid sásta, freisin, géilleadh don achainí atá á chur orainn agus gan díospóireacht mhór leathan a dhéanamh ar an Arm ar an ócáid seo.  Nuair adúirt an tAire go raibh sé ar tí an Bille mór a thabhairt isteach, tháinig sé ar intinn agam go mb'fhéidir gur trua é, go mb'fhéidir go mb'fhearr é go bhfágfaí é i leataoibh go ceann tamaill eile, go bhfeicimis cén chosúlacht a bheadh ar chúrsaí síochána idirnáisiúnta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>San am chéanna, tá an oiread sin daoine ar an tuairim go bhfuil sé thar <Col N="662" /> am an Bille mór a thabhairt isteach, nach miste liom go dtatharfaí isteach é chomh luath agus atá ceaptha ag an Aire.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire, más é a thoil é, aird faoi leith a thabhairt ar imeachtaí an Chéad Chatha, sin an Cath Gaelach, atá i nGaillimh ó cuireadh an tArm ar bun.  Ba mhaith liom go bhfaigheadh an tAire eolas ar leith ar imeachta agus obair an Chatha sin.  Ba mhaith liom go scrúdódh sé cúrsaí an Chatha, ní amháin ó thaobh a thábhachta mar bhuíon saighdiúirí, ach ó thaobh tábhachta eile, ó thaobh cúrsaí na Gaeilge féin.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an Cath chomh láidir agus ba mhaith leis an Lucht Ceannais é bheith.  Is deacair a rá cén fáth é sin.  Tá mé féin ar an tuairim nach mar gheall ar dhaoine óga a bheith mí-shásta dul isteach sa gCath é.  Casadh orm fir óga as Conamara a mba mhian leo dul isteach in sa gCéad Chath.  Do réir mar a thuigimse é, chuaigh duine amháin suas go dtí an bearraic le dhul isteach. Meabhraíodh dó go gcaithfeadh sé dul ar aghaidh go dtí an Currach le haghaidh tréineála.  Pé ar bith fáth atá leis, agus pé ar bith údar atá leis, níl mise i ndon a rá, ach tá an t-údar ann nach bhfuil an meas ceart ar an nGaeilge agus ar shaighdiúirí an Chéad Chatha, sa gCurrach.  Tá súil agam nach fíor é.  Pé ar bith fírinne atá sa scéal nó a mhalairt, is dóigh liom go mb'fhiú do Lucht Ceannais an Airm smaoineamh ar na fir, a bheadh le tréineáil le haghaidh an Chéad Chatha, a thréineáil ó thús go deireadh i nGaillimh féin.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir liom a rá go bhfuil eolas mór agam ar chúrsaí míleata, ach le linn na Práinne bhí an seans agam, mar bhall de na Fórsaí Aitiúla, cúrsaí tréineála a dhéanamh i mBearraic na Rinne Móire.  Tá roinnt eolais agam ar Ghaeilge agus roinnt eolas agam ar chúrsaí oideachais agus go háirithe ar cheard-oideachas.  Ba mhaith liom an méid seo a rá, gur dóigh liom go mba deacair foireann chomh héifeachtach le foireann múinteoirí an Chéad Chatha a fháil in aon áit sa tír.  Mar mhúinteoirí, bheadh sé deacair iad a shárú. An spéis a bhí ag na fir sin ina gcaint nó ina seirbhísí agus a leithéid, an <Col N="663" /> spéis a bhí acu san obair, an dóigh inar réitigh siad nó inar ullmhaíodar a gcuid ceachtanna agus léachtaí, an spéis agus an tsuim a bhí acu sna heachtraí, bh'fiú go mbeadh a fhios ag múinteoirí na tíre faoi sin.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam céard iad na deacrachtaí a bheadh ann maidír le fearas áirithe a fháil le haghaidh tréineáil i nGaillimh.  Mholfainn don Aire, ní hé amháin ó thaobh an Airm féin ach ó thaobh na Gaeilge, an oiread a dhéanamh ar son an Chéad Chatha agus is féidir.  Ba cheart dúinn cuimhniú go bhfuil dualgas mór ar an Arm, chomh maith agus tá ar gach duine eile, gach ní is féidir a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ar an abhar sin, achainím ar an Aire go gcuirfeadh sé spéis faoi leith in imeachta an Chéad Chatha agus go dtabharfadh sé an chomhairle do Lucht Cheannais an Airm go ndéanfadh siad gach ní is féidir leis an gCath seo a neartú agus obair na Gaeilge agus staid na Gaeilge a neartú ann.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nach dtógfadh an Seanad orm é dá n-abrainn chomh mór agus is cúis bróin dúinn ar fad gur imigh príomh-cheannasaí an Chatha uainn le déanaí, trí thimpist uafásach.  Ba dheacair saighdiúir níba dhílse, saighdiúir níba dhúthrachtaí, saighdiúir ní ba éirimiúla d'fháil ná an Coirnéil Ó Tiománaigh.  Taobh amuigh de sin, ba dheacair duine d'fháil a thuig tábhacht na Gaeilge i gcúrsaí náisiúnachais, a thuig cén chaoi cúrsaí Gaeilge a chur ar aghaidh san Arm, níos fearr ná é.  Is cinnte go mbeidh sé an-deacair áit an Choirnéil Ó Tiománaigh a líonadh.  Mholfhainn don Aire, ar an ócáid seo, go gcuirfeadh sé spéis phearsanta sa scéal agus go bhféachfadh sé chuige go dtoghfaí mar phríomh-oifigeach ar an gCath fear chomh maith agus is féidir a fháil ó thaobh saighdiúireachta agus ó thaobh Gaeilge san am chéanna.</P>
    <P>Beidh seans againn chun cúrsaí an Airm a chíoradh sar i bhfad agus fágfaidh muid an scéal mar atá go dtí sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Seanad for the way in which they <Col N="664" /> have accepted my plea to postpone the general discussion to a later date.  I think that there is an amount of common sense and reason and sound tactics in that particular attitude that the Seanad has adopted.  There were certain questions put to me by the Senators who did speak that at least are worthy of as detailed an answer as it is possible for me to give at this particular stage.  I regret very much that I cannot give the answer in the fully detailed way I would like to give it, in the way of figures, absolutely correct figures, as unfortunately I have left a file containing the up-to-date figures behind me in the Department.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins, in opening the debate, asked generally what preparations were being made and were under way with regard to any critical war situation that may arise in future.  On that particular question, I can only say that the work, the vigilance and the activities of the General Staff in view of the world situation are as advanced as ever.  We have a General Staff that fortunately we can all look to with complete confidence.  It is an experienced and highly-trained staff and we are fortunate in the fact that every single individual of that staff has got the confidence of a number of successive Governments and no changes of any major importance have been made in the staff at any time because of changes of Government.  The work is going on, the soldiers are being trained, the officers are being trained as thoroughly as possible at home and where there may exist any deficiency at home they are being trained abroad.</P>
      <P>I would venture to say that, if you took the officers as a &ldquo;line&rdquo; and picked out 50 officers of our Army of different ranks, at random, you would find&mdash;and that is recognised not only nationally but internationally&mdash;that that average 50 officers from our Army would be more highly trained in the theory of war than any average 50 officers you might pick from any Army in the world.  We lack experience of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank God.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a thing for <Col N="665" /> which we can say &ldquo;Thanks be to God&rdquo;.  I agree we are fortunate in that, but from a purely military point of view we are unfortunate.  In everything but practical experience, in the theory of war, on the academic side, in the study of war, in the satisfactory results as shown by comprehensive courses not only here but in officers' academies abroad, I think we can be perfectly satisfied that the standard of knowledge and efficiency of our officers is peculiarly high.  The Army is a kind of organisation that lives its life behind bars and is not very much seen in the public eye, except on a couple of occasions every year.  It is due to them to say that about them.  There is very little room for a slacker, very little room for a shirker.  The bad boy in a small Army is very quickly found out and we are fortunate in having so few bad boys.</P>
      <P>With regard to other &ldquo;lines&rdquo; in the Army, the N.C.O. line is a fairly steady one.  When the short-term attestation period has expired, it is more or less unusual or exceptional for a N.C.O. to be anxious for his discharge and to leave the Army.  We have the advantage of having, in the main, N.C.O.s of long service.  Most of the N.C.O.s in the term of service are senior men, and when their attestation period is up they reattest.</P>
      <P>We have the balance on the other side with regard to privates.  The private's job is certainly not what you would regard as one of the aristocratic jobs of ordinary life.  A man joins the Army as a private, perhaps because he is unemployed, or perhaps because he has a taste for soldiering.  A great number of privates, at the end of their period, be it three years or longer, do take their discharge.  That is all to the good.  If you have a big turnover of privates you are building up your first line reserve all the time with trained men and if you can cash in your privates to a great extent every third or fourth year you are mounting up the number of trained men in the country because the bulk of them go on the reserve for a further long term period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a recruiting campaign opened some weeks ago.  The returns <Col N="666" /> have been very satisfactory.  The returns up to a couple of weeks ago have exceeded the most optimistic figure put on the recruiting campaign. We have not done it in a very noisy way.  We have not done it through immense figure posters on the hoardings. We have done it through the daily and provincial Press.  The returns have been very, very satisfactory. Senator Hawkins asked me for the return to date.  I am not giving him a firm figure but I am giving what I think is within five or ten of the figure up to yesterday morning, when I say we had something like 895.</P>
    <P>When people are coming forward fairly freely an army becomes more and more selective.  If the recruits are coming forward in small numbers you cannot afford to be very selective on the educational standard, even on the physical standard.  You have to let all those standards down a little bit if there is a small number of recruits presenting themselves.  If there is a large number presenting themselves, then you can be more selective and look for a higher standard all round. I am happy to report to the Seanad that we were in a position to be peculiarly selective, more selective than we have been for the best part of 20 years.  The standard of recruit we have got in is young and intelligent, physically, a very high standard, educationally, a good standard.  We would have been happy to keep many of the trained men who have gone out.  They have not gone out in the sense of being completely separated and divorced from the Army.  They have gone on to the first line reserve.</P>
    <P>With regard to armaments and the supply side of the Army, that is not an easy matter and will never again be an easy matter in any country which is not in a position to produce its own supplies.  We are in the position of a small country, producing nothing in the way of ammunition or armaments, having to look outside our own shores for both ammunition and armaments, endeavouring to purchase in a world that is suffering from war nerves, where the world policy is one of conscription. Every country is looking for more and more armaments and practically <Col N="667" /> every country in the world is in one or other of the great world combinations. We are an island outside that great world, standing aloof from one great combination or the other, producing nothing in the way of armaments, producing nothing in the way of ammunition, in the position of a buyer on a market where the supply does not meet the demand, the only recommendation we have being the good money in our hands.</P>
    <P>We might be in a completely hopeless position in that situation and there were times, even in my period of office, when I was inclined to get rather pessimistic with regard to the supplies of arms and armaments, and at times, when, like anybody else, my liver might not be functioning as well as on other days, I would be inclined to say to myself: &ldquo;What is the good of having soldiers if you cannot even put a pop-gun into their hands&rdquo;?  Fortunately that did not work out to be the situation in practice.  Britain was satisfied that, neutral or belligerent, our intention was to hold this territory against anybody that might come to invade us, and I am glad to say we have got in reasonable amounts the supplies that we require.  That is one thing that it is gratifying to report.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has to be taken into consideration is that, fortunately, we have never fired a shot in anger and we have been buying our materials right down along the line since the beginning of the Army.  Certain armaments and certain mechanical vehicles of war, of course, get worn out by disuse but, in the main, we have been accumulating year after year, with the exception of ammunition, which is an expendable commodity and which has been used in practice training and various forms of manoeuvres from year to year.  The armament position generally and the supply position generally is far from being unhealthy.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins also referred to the position of the F.C.A.  We have not conscription in this country and&mdash;it may be an unwise thing for a Minister for Defence to say, but I have the reputation of being normally unwise&mdash;I would go further and say that I hope <Col N="668" /> we will never have to have conscription in this country.  The fact of the matter is that we have not got it.  It is unlikely that we ever will have it.  In that situation people may talk with regard to Army strength.  Army strength is not decided by figures in an Estimate or the ambitions or desires of any individual. Army strength is decided by the number of recruits, in a free country, without conscription, that knock at the barrack gate and ask to be taken in. That means that in practice the Army is limited to a certain strength, talking in world terms relatively a very small strength and, if we are to keep ourselves in a position of preparedness, then we cannot look to the strength of a whole-time standing Army; we must look to the strength of the expertness and high specialist efficiency of a tiny standing Army reinforced, in the first place, by a first line reserve and, to the greatest extent possible, by a second line reserve, namely, the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>I referred to the first line reserve. The strength of the reserve depends on the rapidity of the turnover of trained soldiers.  The strength of the next reserve, namely, the F.C.A., depends on the extent to which we and the Army in particular, show an interest in that particular body of men. Considerable thought, considerable time, and considerable investigation have been given to the question how best to make that force a successful force.  The Army people who investigated it came to the conclusion that they were not heretofore getting sufficient assistance from regular personnel, that it required here and there the presence of regular officers and regular N.C.O.s to keep things up to the maximum point of interest.  We are proposing to extend the assistance from the Regular Army to the F.C.A. by approximately 300 officers and the same number of N.C.O.s.</P>
    <P>With regard to training facilities, one of the deficiencies in connection with the F.C.A. was that you had an immense force in numbers but you had little more than 10 or 11 per cent. of that great number turning up for annual training, even over a period of a number of years.  In their own locality the amount of training they can get does not go very far beyond the <Col N="669" /> rifle.  If they do not turn up for annual training, then their training is very limited.  It is hoped to provide inducements of one kind and another that will make it likely that a higher percentage will turn up for training each year.</P>
    <P>Training in the past was done only through three months each year, three of the most ideal and suitable months, but there was a great number of members of the F.C.A. who, for one reason or another, harvesting operations, and so on, could not get off during those three summer months.  We are endeavouring to arrange that training will be carried out through at least ten months of the year, if not the whole 12, so that any time these people are free and available for training they can get that training.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins further asked me with regard to the position of neutrality &mdash;he took it for granted that we would be neutral.  I do not know.  I think a person in my position who puts himself in the position of being a prophet is rather unwise because a prophet can be contradicted flatly and it takes only time to prove who is right and who is wrong.  But, the constitutional position of this country is such that we can only be engaged in war through the vote of Parliament.  In the past we were neutral and we were very, very fortunate to be able to be neutral.  There was a particular world line-up at that time.</P>
    <P>If we were not neutral then it would be a matter of which side we would be on.  In the world line-up we have at the moment, my opinion is that if we were not neutral there would be no question as to which side we would be on.  The whole liberty-loving tradition of the people, the religion of the vast majority of the people and our conception of man's rights would seem to indicate which side we would be on if we were not neutral.  The next step from that is to view the position of our country, a mutilated country with portion of it cut away and occupied by the forces of a nation with which we would be allied directly or indirectly if we stood against the force coming from the other side of Europe which we detest. Reasonable men inside and outside the <Col N="670" /> country would realise that it would be impossible to expect people of any country with any drop of national spirit in their veins to ally themselves in almost any circumstances with a power that is occupying by force portion of their country.  When the next war comes, for all I know, these circumstances and conditions may be changed.  I can speak only in regard to the present.  No Senator would expect me to speak in regard to the future, but if things remain in the future as they are at present then we must work as an individual country alone and do the best we can.  I do not think any Senator would ask me to go further than that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla appears to be concerned with the geographical soldier. That is a strange bird, a soldier who is to be recruited from one place, trained in that place and maintained in that place.  The Irish-speaking battalion, recruited mainly from Connemara, is stationed most of the time in Galway, but they do the initial training of every soldier, namely three months' training in the recruiting depot in the Curragh. Our Army is too small, our instructors are too few and our facilities are too limited to have training depots all round the place in each battalion.  It is easy enough to shove a man into uniform and a pair of heavy brown boots and call him a soldier; he is not a soldier unless he does his initial training.  We have only one place where we can give that initial training and that is the recruiting depot at the Curragh.  After he has finished his three months training he goes to the appropriate battalion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether these men get their instruction in the Irish language at the Curragh?  That is the important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Every order given to a soldier at the recruiting depot is in Irish as far as possible and, where possible, instruction is given in Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise how precise a knowledge of Irish is required, the familiarity of technical terms and methods of expression, in order to instruct a young man fully in the mechanism and use of rifles and grenades?  I hope that the Minister <Col N="671" /> will not dispose of the matter on the present line.  I would ask him to think over it and see whether there is not something in the suggestion I have made.  He would realise the peculiar position of the First Battalion and, realising it, make, even at some cost, special regulations in connection with it.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Senator is primarily interested in the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly interested in the Irish language, but I want good soldiers, and I believe that you cannot get a good soldier from the Irish-speaking areas unless you give him instruction in the Irish language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My primary interest is in the soldier.  Whether the instruction is in one language or both, the fact of the matter is that no soldier passes out of the depot until he has sufficient qualifications in the way of training.  I have never seen in my time Connemara men being delayed in their exit from the depot because of any linguistic deficiency on the part of the instructors to impart their knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned to the Minister the fact that men are not keen to join because they must go to the Curragh and face this ordeal of doing their training in English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures do not bear out that.  I do not want to be misinterpreted or misunderstood, but if there was any tendency towards embarrassment of the Irish-speaking soldiers, who come mainly from Connemara, there has certainly been no shrinkage or shortage.  I and my predecessors have found that they make first-rate soldiers and are highly trained when they leave the depot.  As far as there is any language difficulty, every effort has been made to meet it. The Senator must understand that circumstances change with the times, and none of us is growing younger, and the same applies to the Army.  The instructors of to-day are, in the main, <Col N="672" /> men who came in through the cadet school and an officer does not leave it without being perfectly proficient to deal in full with any military subject through the medium of Irish.  They are the instructors for the soldiers. The instructors for the officer courses are still, to a great extent, senior men who may not have the same knowledge of Irish.</P>

      <P>I hardly think the Minister will be in a position to answer this question fully, but does he think that the First Battalion has been up to full strength for a considerable time?  The Minister is very good to pay the compliment he did pay to the members of the First Battalion, but I wonder if it has been up to full strength for a considerable time?</P>

      <P>It all depends whether the Senator is talking of war strength or peace strength.  There is a war establishment and a peace establishment in every battallion in the Army.  The peace establishment strength of every batallion in the Army is 60 per cent. of the war establishment strength with the reserve making up 100 per cent.  I cannot pretend to be answering the question perfectly, but my memory calls to my attention those battalions that are unusually below strength and the First Battalion is not among them.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not prepared to insist that men coming from Connemara and the Gaeltacht areas should be instructed fully in Irish?  We have spent a lot of money on the propagation of Irish and getting young people to learn it and surely provision should be made to have men coming from Connemara instructed solely through the medium of Irish.  I think they are entitled to that.</P>

      <P>Either we are dealing with an army or with a university or school.  The Army and the Army chiefs may be as sentimentally attached to the Irish language as any Senator, but when an army moves it has to move as a whole, not as isolated units.  It is just as important for a fellow in the sixth battalion to understand an order in Irish as for a fellow in the first to <Col N="673" /> understand an order in English.  If the crash came five years ago and the Irish-speaking battalion knew Irish and nothing else and it went into action with two other battalions where every officer was not a fluent Irish speaker then you would have had chaos.  I think nobody has any complaint against the Army in regard to encouraging Irish and never had and I hope they never will have cause.</P>

      <P>Recruits of the Irish-speaking battalion are not being held back in their training through any deficiency in the instructors' knowledge of Irish.  They are there to be educated as soldiers to go back to the Irish-speaking battalion in Galway a little bit more bilingual than they were and that would be better for the Army.</P>
      <P>A point was made by Senator Orpen &mdash;and I was afraid it might stampede the Seanad&mdash;that when we bring in the permanent Army Bill the annual opportunity of making me or my successor an Aunt Sally will be withdrawn from the Seanad.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is to enable me to increase certain pensions payable in respect of public service.  I have previously, in bringing in certain token Estimates in Dáil Eireann, indicated the general scheme and that, having got the token Estimates from Dáil <Col N="674" /> Éireann, the pensions would be payable forthwith, and wait for the enabling legislation to follow.  A great many have been paid in full.  The pensions dealt with are in respect of public service of civil servants, teachers, police and widows and children of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  The Bill also deals with certain local and harbour authority employees and there is a special class of employees of the Electricity Supply Board who are dealt with.  They are a special class whose pensions are restricted under a particular Emergency Powers Order.  If the restriction is to be removed it is thought better to do it by this legislation than by Order.</P>
      <P>The payment of the pensions is run according to a certain scale, but the increase in pension is subject to a couple of limitations.  There had been a general increase in remuneration that took place about the end of 1946, and the first restriction that there is in this piece of legislation, is that any pension which is calculated by reference to remuneration below the level obtaining towards the end of 1946 will be raised, but not raised any higher than by reference to the remuneration at that particular date.  The second thing is, that there is a ceiling of £450 put upon the pensions.  If a pension now being paid, is at or above a sum of £450 a year, then it is not being increased at all.  In so far as any pension under that limit is increased after the application of the percentages I will go on to mention, to raise it above the sum of £450, then it stops at £450.  Subject to these two limitations, the increases authorised are as set out in one of the sections.  Where the pension does not exceed £100 a year, 50 per cent. of the pension; where the pension exceeds £100 but does not exceed £150 a year, 40 per cent. of the pension, but not less than £50; where the pension exceeds £150 but does not exceed £450 a year, 30 per cent. of the pension, but not less than £60, provided that no pension will be increased to more than £450 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the overriding maximum of £450 comes in there.  Certain pensions now paid have in them an element that is attributable to emergency bonus <Col N="675" /> that was paid during some date from 1940.  From any persons receiving pensions which were increased, we take away the emergency bonus, and then the pensions bereft of that emergency bonus are calculated according to this scale I have given.  Any increases that are permitted in this Bill are to be paid as from the 1st April, 1949 or if a pension has commenced at a later date than that it is from whatever date it commenced.  All others are being made retrospective to the 1st of April, 1949.  There are two or three special points in connection with the proposed restrictions.  Civil servants and Gardaí who retired in the period from the 1st of July, 1940, to the 31st of October, 1946, when their salaries were stabilised, have already had increases granted to them under previous legislation, but in respect of those people who had retired before the 1st of July, 1943 the improvement made in the old position would be less beneficial than the improvement made in this legislation. In those cases, it is proposed to give them the benefit of this legislation under that particular head. When the October Estimates were before the Dáil a couple of comments were made, by way of objection, to show that I should have made provision for a minimum increase; that nobody should get anything less than a certain amount.  It was represented to me, truthfully at the time, that some of the pensions paid were miserably small; that even a 50 per cent. increase would not be of very much benefit. That is, unfortunately, the case.  It has also to be remembered, that where a pension is very small, it must mean that the period in respect of which it has been earned must have been very brief.  The difficulty I am in is not the money associated with the particular group of pensioners concerned.  The minimum is here laid down, and if anybody finds that minimum pensions would have to be paid, it would mean that a person coming into the Civil Service and retiring for health reasons after a brief period would find himself with a pension at the minimum rate to be paid.  If that is not done the Minimum position would find these people better off than people who retired hereafter with very much greater service. <Col N="676" /> For that reason, I decided against it.  The cost to State funds of the legislation and the Orders associated with it amounts to £250,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself deals with national teachers, civil servants, members of the Garda Síochána, the Dublin Metropolitan Police and certain resigned and dismissed members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and a group of others, the widows and children of Parliamentary Secretaries amongst others.  I did not make any provision in this particular piece of legislation for the widows of Garda Síocháná or of resigned and dismissed members of the Royal Irish Constabulary or of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  It is considered better to provide for these by way of Orders and these Orders have already been agreed.  The reason for that was that it was desired that increases given now should apply to future pensions, as well as those already paid.  About 500 widows will benefit and 600 children of the deceased Gardaí and members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police will also benefit to some extent.  In accordance with this scheme Orders were made providing for increases in Army pensions and the retiring pay of Army people.  All the increases that were given have been according to the scale I have mentioned. This is a scheme that is accepted for all these groups.  A section in the Bill definitely excludes from the benefit of this legislation any provision at all for increases in pensions awarded under Article 10 of the Treaty to former civil servants or members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  These are the people who had a certain beneficial position secured for them under the Treaty and under legislation founded on it.  They were entitled to the advantage of the legislation under the Treaty, and if they achieved a higher rate of pension at times, than what is now being provided, they have enjoyed enhanced pensions in terms for many years.  I do not consider I have any obligation towards them, and I make no provision for them.  The increases to harbour and local authorities employees which are referred to here will be granted by the authority concerned, subject all the while to the <Col N="677" /> Minister responsible.  The increases to those people will be paid on a basis similar to that applicable to civil servants. The legislation was extremely difficult to draft to cover all the types of people who had to be provided for, and it may not be easy to follow the sections.  If the House desires to have a detailed Committee Stage then it will assist that consideration if I very, very sketchily indicate the meanings of the different sections.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is mainly a definition section. Section 2 is the section upon which the Bill pivots.  It indicates what are to be the appropriate sums; that is to say, the increases that will be given, those percentages I spoke of. Section 3 provides for the increase of the pensions of police and civil servants other than those increased under previous legislation, and the pensions of teachers.  Section 4 deals with widows' pensions and children's allowances granted under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Officers Acts, and Section 5 deals with police and Civil Service pensions where the increases under the Bill are being substituted for lesser increases previously granted.</P>
    <P>The local authority people are covered by Section 6 and the harbour authorities by Section 7.  Section 8 applies where a person has two pensions. It is simply to make provision that we aggregate the pensions as one scheduled pension for the purpose of arriving at the ceiling of £450, and also for making the addition to the pension proportionate to the way in which the present pension is paid.  Section 9 is the section which deals with the commencement of the increase which will be retrospective to the day of the commencement of the pension or the 1st April, 1949, whichever is the later.  Section 10 deals with a small matter.  Under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1920, pensions that then fell due for payment are subject to a means test.  It is desired not to have the trouble of applying the means test hereafter, and what we do is to take the amount of money paid on 1st April, 1949, as the basic amount for the application of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 11 continues to apply any statutory provision providing for the <Col N="678" /> diminution or change that may have to occur in a pension.  These are continued in regard to new pensions. Under certain Acts, say, if a person who has a pension gets employment in some of the public offices, then the pension payable by the State ceases, and it is replaced by the other with certain reservations.  It is also possible to have a pension forfeited for certain criminal offences and under the Bankruptcy and Lunacy Acts pensions may be changed.  We continue to apply these conditions to the new pensions. Section 12 indicates that the increases shall be granted by the Minister who grants the pension.  There are special groups in which pensions are granted by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Justice and in other cases by myself.</P>
    <P>Section 13 again deals with a small matter&mdash;pensions that are granted under an Order&mdash;the Royal Irish Constabulary (Resigned and Dismissed) Pensions Order, 1924.</P>
    <P>Those are subject to a restriction that the pensions may not at any time come to a higher point than two thirds of the salary to which the pension is related&mdash;in this case the salary which the person was in enjoyment of at the date of retirement.  We had to change that because it would restrict very narrowly the increase of the pension, and would put in another ceiling in addition to the two limitations we have already applied.  Section 14 has been framed to meet a rather special point. It is the position at the moment that if certain pensioners receive what is called a compensation award, then the pension is abated by a certain small amount.  Say, a person who is a member of the Garda got what is called a compensation award in the courts in respect of certain matters, the practice up to date has been to substract from the full-time pension about 2½ per cent. of whatever the award is.  We want to carry that forward but to make it applicable to the new pensions instead of to the old rate.  Section 15 is common form.  It allows doubts to be resolved by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 16 relates to this group of pensioners who are paid by the Electricity <Col N="679" /> Supply Board.  It does not apply to pensioners of the Electricity Supply Board comprehensively, but only to a limited group of people who were previously in the service of a local authority and went over to the Electricity Supply Board and carried with them certain special rights.  When the stabilisation took place during the emergency, the money payable to these employees was restricted by an Emergency Powers Order.  We are freeing these particular groups of pensioners from the imposition of that Order, and the Electricity Supply Board will pay the pensions, but there will be no longer any handicap such as that imposed by the Emergency Powers Order.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in Section 17.  It relates back to the rest of the Act. There was no great pressure put on me in Dáil Éireann when this Bill was under consideration except in one matter of the minimum provision.  I have said that it is not so much the amount of money involved in meeting the minimum standard as it would be the relation of that at a future time. It would stand as a precedent and would make for justice.  In any event, I have made the case in the Dáil and I make it again here, that the provision made for the lower paid pensioners is, I think, on a scale higher than has been made where pensions have been increased elsewhere.  Take the example of other countries.  I think that in allowing a 50 per cent. increase to the lower groups I have made better provision than is made elsewhere.</P>
    <P>With a limited sum of money to deal with, and I had to do the best I could inside the limitations of the money available, there was the difficulty that by increasing the minimum the pensions paid to the higher levels would have to be somewhat reduced.  I did not find any great complaint in Dáil Éireann and it was accepted, I think, that another quarter of a million added to the other benefactions last year did represent a good effort to make up for losses, and to compensate for the increase in the cost of living. I recommend the Bill to the House as a good effort to meet the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has dealt with the point of the difficulty of giving effect to the suggestions made in the Dáil, I would like to put it in a new light.  We all appreciate the difficulties of a person living on a pension of, say, £50, or anything under £100 a year, and while it might be claimed to be generous to make an all-round increase of 50 per cent. in such cases, I would endeavour to assist the Minister to overcome his difficulty by pointing out that, as the number of persons concerned is small, he might have gone one step further, and that in the case of persons in receipt of pensions of less than £100 per year he could increase the percentage.  That would get over the difficulties he has pointed out in the whole matter.  It is true, of course, that the amount of money provided is considerable, if you look at it that way, but it is also true that persons in receipt of pensions have had very difficult times in recent months and years, and even the increased pensions will not be of very much assistance, because we have the ever increasing cost of living, and if we are going to continue on the road we are now travelling, it must follow that this increase now being given will not keep up with the growing cost of living. There would be another case to be made on behalf of those people who are in receipt of pensions up to £100 or £150.  One could also make a case for those people who are in receipt of pensions up to £450, which is the ceiling. We know full well that, no matter what the family income is, most people are living according to that income and have certain commitments.  Therefore, while it is difficult to be generous with all sections, it is quite possible that even the person who has £450 could find himself in just as much difficulty as the person with a smaller income. I should like to know from the Minister if the increases now provided for will be subject to income-tax in the ordinary way, or will the provision now being made be free of income-tax in respect of those who pay income-tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will remember that all the Parties constituting the present Government, prior to their <Col N="681" /> election, promised that they would give certain increases to pensioners, but it was some 18 months before they made up their minds to bring in the increases.  As the Minister told us, in July of last year, he made an announcement in the Dáil setting forth briefly the increases proposed to be given and stating, as he stated, I think, to-day, that the intention was that these would be paid forthwith.  All these pensioners who had been anxiously looking forward to the increase&mdash;they had got nothing over the war years, despite the heavy increase in the cost of living &mdash;heaved a sigh of relief and immediately began to calculate, each for himself, the amount by which his pension would be increased.  The newspapers gave just a summary of the Minister's statement and did not mention or go into any detail about all these limitations which the Minister has told us about to-day and which are enshrined in this Bill.  The papers reported that pensioners who had under £100 were to get 50 per cent.; that others were to get £40; still others £30 and so on, and these people were especially pleased by the statement of the Minister that payments would be made forthwith.  I wonder does the Minister know when the payments were made?  I know that many months afterwards there were pensioners still expecting payment, and many, after months of weary waiting, did not get any increase because they had passed to their reward in the meantime.  The reason for that was, of course, the provision of all these limitations and I wonder if the Minister himself appreciates what the result of these limitations was in the matter of calculating the increases in pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure is an extraordinary measure.  I do not know how many Senators have read it, and I wonder how many have been able to follow or to interpret it.  I have been for the past 30 years, off and on, dealing in this House and in the other House, and outside, with Bills and Acts of Parliament and it has never been my misfortune to read a Bill more complicated or more difficult of interpretation than this.  It is the way Governments and Finance Departments especially do things&mdash;they always, as we say, take <Col N="682" /> the good out of it.  They promise to do a certain thing and then they hedge it around with all sorts of limitations and barriers which take all the good out it.  What would a business firm do if faced with a position like this?  They would say: &ldquo;We have so many under £100 and so many under £150.  We will give these the appropriate percentage and we will have the whole thing done.&rdquo;  But that was not done in this case.  All kinds of limitations were set into the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 says that, subject to sub-section (2) of the section, certain percentages will be paid and sub-section (2) says that the pension calculated on the emergency bonuses will be deducted.  So far as I know, no good case has ever been made why the increase given to a public servant &mdash;teacher, civil servant or any other&mdash; by way of bonus to meet the cost of living should not be pensionable in the ordinary way.  Neither in the Dáil nor here to-day did the Minister attempt to explain or justify the refusal to calculate this increase in salary for the purpose of calculating pension.  I understand that, in the case of civil servants&mdash;I am not very sure about this&mdash;there was a certain basic salary with a cost-of-living bonus and it was the practice before the war to make some distinction in the matter of the pension as referring to the basic salary and to the cost-of-living bonus; but that was never so in the case of teachers, and whatever might have been the justification for it in the case of civil servants, there was no justification whatever for deducting the pensionable part of the bonus in the case of teachers.</P>
    <P>Let us look for a moment at this proposal.  That was the first limitation, that the bonus was to be deducted, and I will show later what that meant in practice.  We come then to Section 3 and it is the real gem.  Some of the Senators may not have the Bill before them and I will read it for the purpose of having it on record.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  A scheduled (Part I) pension shall be increased&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of a restricted pension, to the lesser amount, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> (b)  in any other case, by the appropriate sum.</P>
    <P>It then goes on to define what has been set out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  In sub-section (1) of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;restricted pension&rdquo; means a scheduled (Part I) pension&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  which is specified in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), (h) or (i) of Part I of the Schedule to this Act, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  which, if increased by the appropriate sum, would be greater than the pension payable to or in respect of a person of equivalent status and service whose service ended on the 31st day of October, 1946;</P>
    <P>The genius who evolved that is wasting his time in the Government service&mdash; he should be in the School of Cosmic Physics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am objecting to&mdash;putting all these limitations into what should be a very simple proposition.  You find a person with less than £100 pension and you say: &ldquo;We will give him 50 per cent.&rdquo; Should that not be easy without going into all these limitations?  I will deal with what I am familiar with, the position of the teachers.  The first limitation the Minister mentioned was the £450 ceiling.  That did not cause any trouble when it came to calculating the amount in relation to a teacher, because no teacher had a pension of £450. <Col N="684" /> For those who had retired before 1st January, 1943, the position was simple, too, because it was after that date that the first bonus was paid, so that there was no question of a deduction of bonus in their case.  The only thing to be watched in their case was that the increase would not bring them above what they would have got if they had served after 31st October, 1946.  That is a significant date&mdash;the day before was the day on which the strike finished and the new scheme came into operation.  In the case of any teacher pensioned before that date, care was taken that his pension would not be such as to bring the amount higher than the amount he would have if he had served after that date.  That was simple, too.</P>
      <P>In their case it was simple, but then we come to those who retired between January, 1943, and the 31st October, 1946.  In that period there were bonuses paid at the following rates: In 1943 women got 5/- a week and men 7/-; in 1944 that was increased to 8/- for women and 10/- for men; in 1945 it was increased to 9/- for women and 11/- for men; and in 1946 to 13/- for women and 15/- for men.  Let us see how that worked out on the simplest calculation I can get.  Take a woman teacher who had a salary of £160&mdash;and there were several who had less.  On the 31st December, 1942, she had 40 years' service.  She got 5/- bonus on the 1st January, 1943, and she retired on the 31st March, 1943, having drawn £3 5s. 0d. by way of bonus.  For the purpose of pension, that £3 5s. 0d. had to be averaged over three years.  That meant that, for pension purposes, there was a sum of £1 1s. 8d. entering into the calculations, in addition to her £160.  Having 40 years' service, she got the half of that, so that instead of £80 as half of full salary she got, because of the bonus, £80 10s. 10d. Under this pension increase, if the £80 10s. 10d. were to be the basis of the calculation, she would get an increase of £40 5s. 5d., but because it was calculated on the £80 pension she gets only £40 and the Treasury saves 5/5 in that case.  That is the simplest calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That same woman might have gone <Col N="685" /> on for another quarter&mdash;teachers retire every quarter&mdash;and there is £3 5s. 0d. for the first quarter, twice that for the second, and so on.  The next year they had different rates altogether.  I said that 40/80ths is an easy thing to calculate if they had it; but if they had 39 years' service it would be 39/80ths, and so on; and you got involved in all kinds of fractions then.  What was the result of that?  There was a staff in the Education Office for months making these abstruse calculations.  For what purpose?  For saving the amounts that would be involved by deducting these small bonuses for the purpose of pension.</P>
    <P>I honestly and sincerely believe that the amount that was expended on these clerks&mdash;I am dealing only with the case of teachers, but it was the same in the case of other officers&mdash; was more than was saved by the deductions. I am sure it cost more to the Department of Finance to make the calculations than it would if they just paid right off without making the calculations at all.  That does not take into account the discontent and disappointment and the irritation that was caused to those people who were expecting to have their pensions paid. I think I am right in saying that the Minister had no appreciation of the amount of trouble and the number of calculations that had to be made in all those cases because of the way the scheme was devised.  It is a shining example of how not to do a thing. I am sure we are all glad that increases were given, but we certainly are not glad about the way it was done.</P>
    <P>There is not much use in talking about it now, as the thing is done. Valuable time of officials in the Education office and other offices has been taken up in making these calculations. I believe that most of the pensions have been paid by this time&mdash;I hope they have been&mdash;and there is not much use in trying to remedy it; but I am calling attention to it to show that it is not the way the thing should be done.  Taking one thing with another, it would have been better and would have given more satisfaction, and I believe it would have cost less money <Col N="686" /> in the end, if many of those limitations were omitted.  I refer especially to the one I know most about and understand best, that is, the deduction of the emergency bonus from the salaries for the purpose of calculating the pension.</P>

      <P>Tá moladh ag dul don Aire as ucht an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach, ach is dóigh liom gurb é an moladh is mó is féidir a thabhairt don Bhille gur fearrde ann ná as é.  Sásaíonn sé mise, ar aon chaoi, go bhfuil ordú le fáil ag na daoine atá luaite in san mBille ar a gcuid pinsin; ach ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil mé mí-shásta leis, ar dhá chonntar thairis sin.  Sa chéad dul síos, is cuimhin liom an méid cainte a rinneadh, síos suas tríd an tír, aimsir an toghcháin, ar an méid a déanfaí do lucht na bpinsean.  Taréis an toghcháin, fuair mé cuireadh go dtí cruinniú in nGaillimh a thug Cumann na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta le chéile le scéal an phinsin a phlé.  Ag an gcruinniú bhí duine amháin a d'fhág le tuiscint go raibh fios aigne an Rialtais aige agus thuig na sean-mhúinteoirí agus thuig daoine eile gur gearr go mbeadh an réiteach déanta, go bhfaighdís na pinsin agus go bhfaighdís siar iad go dtí an uair a thosaigh an Rialtais. Maidir liom féin, chreid mé gur mar sin a bheadh an scéal.  Casadh múinteoirí orm idir an dá linn agus chuireadar in iuil dom an mhoill a bhí ar an scéal agus an mí-shásamh a bhí orthu mar gheall ar an moill sin.  Dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Conaill go bhfuil cuid de na múinteoirí a bhí i gceist an uair sin imithe ar Shlí na Fírinne ó shoin.  Is dóigh liom, munar féidir a rá go raibh geallúint ann do réir dlí, is cinnte go raibh &ldquo;Gentleman's Agreement&rdquo; ann go bhfaighdís an pinsinn gan mhoill agus go bhfaighdís í síar go dtí lá tosuithe an Rialtais, an méid sin ar a laghad.  Tá níos mó ná sampla amháin ann gur briseadh focal den tsórt san. D'fhéadfadh an tAire a rá nach bhfuil aon gheallúint scríofa ann.  Déarfainn, do réir equity, go bhfuil an ceart ag na daoine bheith ag súil le níos mó ná mar atá déanta dóibh.</P>

    <P>Cuimhnímis ar scéal tuarastal na múinteoirí scoile.  Thuig an gnáthdhuine <Col N="687" /> go bhfaigheadh na múinteoirí scoile ardú do réir mar adéarfadh lucht an choimisiúin a scrúdaigh cúrsaí tuarastail agus uile.  Tá an-díomú ar na múinteoirí nach bhfuaradar ardú ar an dóigh a raibh súil acu leis agus siar go dtí lá tosuithe an Rialtais.</P>
    <P>Tá mé mí-shásta leis an mBille nach bhfuil an t-ardú pinsin ann a mbeimis ag súil leis agus an t-athrú atá tagaithe ar luach an airgid a chur san áireamh.

Nach bhfuil sé chomh maith againn a rá leis na daoine nach bhfuil an oiread déanta againn dóibh agus ba mhaith linn agus go mba cheart dúinn a dhéanamh dóibh?  Is mó an ní é an Bille a bheith os ár gcomhair. Theastaigh cuid mhaith fiosruithe agus cuid mhaith mhisnigh go dtiubharfadh an tAire an Bille isteach ar chor ar bith agus, é bheith ann, is fearr é ná é bheith as.</P>
    <P>Is trua liom go bhfuil cúis casaoide ag an Seanadóir Ó Conaill.  Ní dóigh liom go ndúirt sé focal iomarcach nuair a bhí sé ag cur síos ar an scéal. Is trua liom narbh fhéidir linn na hiarmhúinteoirí agus seirbhísigh eile fhágháil chomh maith as agus ba cheart, mar gheall ar an athrú atá tagaithe ar bhrí an airgid.</P>
    <P>Tá pointe amháin eile ann.  Níl fhios agam an mbeadh an tAire ábalta an t-eolas a thabhairt dúinn: Cé mhéad duine atá i gceist?  Ba mhaith liom fhios a bheith agam cé mhéad múinteóirí atá i gceist.  Bheadh an fhigiúir sin seasmhach.  Tá brainnse eile ann agus níl fhios agam cé chaoi bhfuil an scéal fúthu.  Mar shompla, cé mhéid sean-phóilíní, sean-R.I.C. agus seanD.M.P., atá ann ag fáil phinsin?  Ar dhóigh ghinearálta bheadh spéis agam sna figiúirí.  Ba mhaith liom iad d'fháil, más féidir, ón Aire.  Murar féidir, b'fhéidir iad fháil trí cheist sa Dáil nó ar shlí éigin eile.</P>
    <P>Is maith linn go léir an Bille seo a bheith os ár gcomhair agus an oiread a bheith déanta agus atá.  Mar adúirt daoine eile, is trua linn nach bhfuil an oiread déanta agus ba mhaith linn.</P>

      <P>For many years since I came into this House, during <Col N="688" /> Finance Bills and Central Fund Bills, it has always been a theme song of mine to seek a revision of teachers' pensions.  Their pensions were small because they were based on very small salaries.  I would feel that I was wanting in my duty if I did not thank the Minister for having done what he has done in this respect.  When Senator Ruane, Senator O'Connell and I pleaded for increased pensions for teachers and said that the disgraceful pensions they were receiving meant that they were allowed to starve, we were told that their pensions could not be increased, presumably because it could not be done without increasing other pensions.</P>
      <P>The Minister took the bull by the horns and did the right thing.  It is ungracious for us not to thank him.  In my own house the increase was very welcome. The Minister has done a generous act in introducing this Bill and it is a pity that we would not give him full praise for his courage and generosity.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the increased pensions.  I think it is a pity that we would not have more pensions for more people, but I think the House and the Minister ought to consider the position of the people who are providing the moneys for these pensions.  I submit to the House and to the Minister that a great portion of this money comes from the agricultural industry.  The year 1949 was a boom year, one of the best years during my long experience of agriculture. Many people believe that we are near one of the greatest slumps that has happened in our time.  If that slump comes, the agricultural industry will be in a very sorry plight and will not be able to carry the heavy loads that are being imposed on it from all sides.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the age at which pensions are being paid.  I have been told that people got old earlier in Ireland years ago, that they were not as well fed or as well housed as they are to-day and had to endure greater hardships.  It is true that with the improvement in health services and the great facilities which <Col N="689" /> we have to-day, people are able to perform effective work up to a later age. The number of people in the late age groups has increased considerably in recent years, and the State is taking on itself a tremendous and unnecessary burden in providing pensions at earlier ages, as it has been doing recently.  In any future schemes the Minister for Finance should set his hand against a reduction in the age at which pensions will be granted.</P>
      <P>It is very unfair to the young that they should be asked to carry a large number of people who are capable of doing work.  By all means, if they are unable to work through ill-health let them retire at an earlier age but there should be a genuine reason for it.  I would suggest to the Minister that, in future, these people should be retained to give useful service to the State.  We hear a lot about production.  Anyone who can give service should be retained as long as he is able to give it effectively.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill. It is a pity the Minister was not a bit more generous with the lower paid pensioners.  They have to live.  There is a considerable number of persons in this country whose pensions are less than £100 a year.  Others have pensions of about £150 a year.  The cost of living has gone up considerably.  If the Minister were to consider the matter in the light of the cost-of-living index figure he might do justice.  The prevailing grievance as far as lower paid pensioners are concerned will continue to exist when this Bill has been passed.  When the Minister was dealing with the matter he should have dealt with it in a generous way.  By no means is this Bill going to satisfy the people.  It is better to face up to the fact that the cost of living has considerably increased.</P>

      <P>I am not going to put the blame on the Minister.  The position has to be faced up to, and I <Col N="690" /> do not think it is now being faced in the generous way that people expected. Resolutions on this question have come before public bodies, and come before the Minister and his predecessors, asking that these people should be generously dealt with.  I do not think the Minister is dealing generously with them now, or even middling generously. It is to be regretted that he does not see his way to do so.  The taxpayers have to pay these pensions, yet they would have no hesitation in giving support to a measure which would deal generously with those affected.  I do not think this Bill is meeting the situation. If the Minister decides to meet it now, or in two years' time, he will have my support.  It is a pity the position was not met in the generous way that people expected.</P>

      <P>I am not going to complain of the manner in which this Bill was introduced or of the amounts that will be awarded to the various pensioners. But I believe that there would be no resentment if higher increases were granted.  There is one section of pensioners on whose cases the Minister might have taken a more generous view &mdash;those who resigned following the Treaty or those who resigned in 1923. The Minister stated that the cost of living then was nothing like what it is to-day.  Many of these people are getting on in years and, at the same time, their position is not too secure. I know some people who received princely sums and on the other hand some got £1 or 22/- a week.  I appeal to the Minister to take into consideration the position of such people, and to give them an increase on the lines of what was awarded to those who resigned in 1923, seeing that the position has since worsened.  As the cost of living has gone up in the intervening years I appeal to the Minister to deal with them in some way in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments passed here as to lack of generosity in treatment come very badly from those who supported a Government that would not move a hand's turn for these people.  I am doing more than the last Government thought of doing. That is the situation.  Did that Government <Col N="691" /> ever indicate any such view when they were appealed to many times in my experience in Dáil Éireann?  They always said that they could not afford it.  But we found it possible to afford it.  Do not forget that in three years increases in pay of civil servants as well as awards to teachers that I have had to meet, as well as the Garda and the Army, are costing this State £2,400,000 a year. If you add this £250,000 it will equate in some way to the cost of living.  That is something that was not given before, despite Senator O'Connell's warning that it should be attended to.  There is £2,600,000 and only two years to make up the amount.  I announced that in the Budget in 1949, about a year after we came in.  The number of people affected will be teachers, 2,700, 1,100 civil servants, 250 members of the Garda and D.M.P. as well as 470 resigned and dismissed R.I.C.</P>
      <P>It is easy to poke fun at the length of this legislation, but it was more difficult to draft it.  I think the drafting of the Bill has been remarkably well done, and if Senator O'Connell has any suggestion I will be glad to put before the draftsman what might be done.  Of course this could have been done more simply.  The scheme originally was to increase pensions in relation to civil servants, which are related to a particular figure in the cost-of-living index figure.  It would be easy to change it in that respect, but then complications arose dealing with Guards and teachers who are on an entirely different basis.  It would be very bad treatment to have a flat rate for everyone.  The Education Department speaking vehemently on behalf of the teachers caused all this complication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole trouble caused to Senator O'Connell and the others was the matter of making calculations. The bonus had to be deducted because, if it was not deducted, the people who got the bonus at a later stage would be better off than the people who got it at an earlier <Col N="692" /> stage, and if you add the percentage over and above some would be better off than others.  We did this to get equality by bringing it to its original basis and letting it mount up on that. The Senator could get examples of the way injustices would mount up and if that had been done I suppose we would have had equally vehement protests. In fact, he would have had a better case then because he could point to distinct injustices as between groups. I put it to the House that when this £250,000 was added to the £2,400,000 already taken from the taxpayers in order to improve the conditions of these people I think I ought to get much more of the type of favourable comment I got from Senator Mrs. Concannon rather than the grudging comment I got from Senator O'Connell. Senator O'Connell might go back to the Gospel of about three Sundays ago about the workers in the vineyard. Why should people give me sour looks because I am generous?  I have that feeling with regard to Senator O'Connell.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann is of opinion that a joint committee, consisting of members of both Dáil and Seanad should be set up to consider and report on what steps (if any) should be taken to provide for a periodic review of the operation of companies in which the State holds a majority of the issued shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be agreed by all that in the last ten or 15 years we have seen a remarkable growth of these State and semi-State companies, by which I mean companies in which our Minister for Finance holds shares and very often holds the dominating number of shares. When companies of this type are formed there is a tendency for Parliament to feel that they no longer have that control of their operations and the way the money is expended that they <Col N="693" /> would have had had the expenditure been made and the operations carried through by a Department of State.  No doubt that is true.  There are very good reasons why it is advisable in certain cases to free a company from day-to-day interference by Parliament. At the same time one has to remember that Parliament has voted the taxpayers' money to these companies and even if Parliament can legally release itself from the obligation of looking after what is happening, the moral responsibility to see that all is well with the operation of these State and semi-State companies rests with Parliament. I wish to say at the outset that this motion does in no way suggest that any of these State or semi-State companies are operating in a way they should not.  I do not wish anybody to get a suspicion that something is wrong and that what this motion asks for is to unearth something that is wrong. What I maintain is that in many cases all the information is not placed before us that would allow of a just assessment of how these companies are operating. It is often said that companies or boards such as the Electricity Supply Board or Bord na Móna all are highly efficient.  They may be, but it is interesting to note that the only measurement of efficiency the ordinary man in the street can apply is by judging from the information given by these companies. We get an annual report from the Electricity Supply Board, an excellent document in many ways, but that is all we get.  We have to judge of their efficiency on what information they give us.  It is the same with many of these other bodies, so I claim that until the Oireachtas has some opportunity of acquiring the information it wants and analysing it is almost nonsensical to say that we are in a position to judge as to the efficiency or not of the operation of some of the large State and semi-State concerns.  This motion asks for an inquiry into whether or not it is desirable to set up machinery, and what sort of machinery if it is necessary, to investigate the operations of these State companies.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that as the State year by year undertakes to do more, unless it delegates that work to civil <Col N="694" /> servants, a Department of State or State companies, the whole procedure of Parliament might become clogged. Obviously, the tradition of the Civil Service does not necessarily suit itself to new undertakings.  It is rather apt to be swayed by precedent and therefore there is a very good case in any new development for handing it over to a specially appointed board.</P>
    <P>I do feel that with the growth in numbers of these State companies that a good case can be made for setting up some sort of machinery for periodic review of their operations.  Now, one thing I hope should come out of a periodic review of operations would be this: that when we knew more about what these companies have done, what they are proposing to do, we might allay some of the idle talk and suspicion that goes on around the country. It is a curious thing, that lack of information is often very much more dangerous than too much information. Perhaps, I might quote from Bacon on this.  He says: &ldquo;There is nothing makes a man suspect much more than to know little&rdquo;.  Anybody who has looked at some of those reports, even a model one, can find examples of omission or lack of frankness, which if we did not know the explanation, we might say &ldquo;Ah, something is not working right&rdquo;.  Even the Electricity Supply Board sins in this direction.  If you look in the report for the year ending 1948 you will find on a graph showing the output of units from Poulaphouca that the graph shows a gap of two months.  We all know the explanation, but would it not have been wise to put in a foot-note to show for that period that one of the stations broke down.  Would it not have been frank? That is the sort of thing that ought not to appear.  There is one other example that, it seems to me, we ought to know a little more about.  These alcohol factories were built for the purpose of acting as a stabiliser for unwanted or unsuitable potatoes.  World prices changed and potatoes fetched more in the market than the alcohol factories could pay.  Therefore, we imported molasses and, presumably, we are still going on with that policy.  We are paying dollars to keep the alcohol factories <Col N="695" /> alive, to add alcohol to petrol, and to increase petrol by 1½d. a gallon with the one object of having a stabiliser for potatoes at a price which the alcohol factories can pay.  It looks like Alice in Wonderland, one of those things one would like to look into.  These are the things we see on the outside.  What we would see if we were able to cross examine these companies, I do not know. For these reasons, I move the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I think this motion gives rise to very big questions of public administration and public economic policy.  It really raises the question, as to how one can deal with monopolies in the public service, and in public utilities, which have become inevitable during the 20th century.  Up to a certain point, of course, the approach to it was the point of view of a contract in the restraint of trade, to break it up if you could.  That is the basis of American legislation in relation to monopoly, the Anti-trust and the Sherman Act.  That is now out of date, and the position is now such, that the provision of transport, water, electricity and other public services of that kind are necessarily monopolies in the modern State, and must necessarily in financial terms, have a good deal of State finance for their support. The question is, whether they should be left in private hands, with all the possibility of exploitation, and abuse of consumers, or whether they should be handed over to the State with all the possibility of the red tape of Government Departments, lack of enterprise of the Civil Service, the political fears of Ministers of having to face parliamentary questions on matters of detail which would, unquestionably, interfere with the day-to-day administration of these great concerns which are playing a growing part in modern public life.  It is very interesting to follow the literature on the subject, the literature on monopolies in the last 50 years.  I think I am correct in saying that the economists in modern times have accepted it really as a problem of administration, a problem of expediency rather than one of principle.  The question is to find some sort of compromise between private monopolies, <Col N="696" /> with possible exploitation, and the dead hand of the red tape of the Civil Service department which is tied up by various administrative principles which are not conducive to running businesses which require expansion, progress, invention and the trying out of new ideas.  There has been evolved, the, I think, rather unpleasant phrase &ldquo;<i>ad hoc</i> authorities&rdquo; to describe these new types of hybrid device.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a number of examples of this.  We have the Central Bank, the Electricity Supply Board, and we have Bord na Móna.  We have a large number of these in this country where the authority, which is nominally a private company, is not really a private company at all, because most of the capital is owned by the State; if not the whole of it, at least the majority of it is owned by the State.  The original idea in setting up these <i>ad hoc</i> administrative authorities was to get the best of both worlds, by having on them directors, who were not civil servants, so there would be the enterprise, initiative and the business courage of businessmen, and at the same time which would not be subject to the criticism of the parliamentary opposition or be made subject to parliamentary questions or political embarrassment in their day-to-day activities. The idea was to combine the advantage of private operation and public operation at the same time and, may I say, a great deal of ingenuity has been devised in the construction of administrative bodies of this kind in this and other countries.  But actually, in the events that have happened, it looks as if, instead of having the best of both worlds, we have had the worst of both worlds from some of these devices and new bodies, because they retain the forms of a company, owned by shareholders and governed by directors, with an annual general meeting&mdash;all the apparatus of company democracy&mdash;but at the same time the public owners, who really own the shares held by the Department of Finance, have no control.  Risks are not taken by the holders of the shares; they are taken by the public, and the taxpayer has to pay the losses, if losses are made, or the consumers <Col N="697" /> have to pay high charges, so that you have a type of monopoly which may impose a liability on the taxpayer or on the consumer in this new form of company and will escape parliamentary scrutiny or public control.  It is to draw attention to what is happening that we have put down a motion asking for an inquiry.  There is something deceitful in the position of these companies.  Everyone knows they are really public companies.  Most of their capital is put up by the Minister for Finance from some fund or other, and the directors can be appointed and removed by him.  These directors must necessarily reflect the views of the Department concerned.  If the company loses money the Minister for Finance has to pay a grant out of taxation, because you find the companies are formed with all sorts of guarantees which ultimately impose liabilities on the taxpayers.  Yet, in spite of the fact that for all practical purposes these are public property, in fact they do escape the only legitimate form of public control, namely, parliamentary supervision and parliamentary inspection. It is to draw attention to that that Senator Orpen and I have tabled the present motion.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that these are public companies, run by public money, operated by public servants and imposing a liability on the taxpayer. We feel that these are matters of vital importance to every member of the public, and yet, if the Minister is asked any question in the Dáil about the activities of any of these companies he can wash his hands and say: &ldquo;I cannot interfere with the affairs of a private company or an independent corporation.&rdquo;  No Minister is responsible, because these companies are not directly under any Department as is the Post Office, and, therefore, as I said, instead of getting the best of both worlds, we get the worst.  We have got a large number of public corporations in this country run with public money, administered by public servants and in fact, wholly under the direction of the same people, and, at the same time, eluding and evading proper parliamentary control.  That is the problem with which this motion asks the Minister to deal.  The motion does not purport to <Col N="698" /> suggest remedies but to call attention to the problem.  The motion is carefully phrased; it simply demands an inquiry.  It asks the Minister to grant an inquiry into this problem which is one of the great problems of modern times.  Other countries have faced it, and in England and elsewhere, there is a considerable amount of literature on it.  There was a series of interesting lectures delivered by Lord Justice Denning, one of the members of the British Bench of Lord Justices of Appeal.  He directed his attention to examining how this problem of public corporations can be subjected to the rule of law and to parliamentary control.  The problem is this: how can the Irish public regain control of its own property, for that is what it really comes to?  Shareholders in public companies who put up the money themselves have ultimate control of the undertaking at the annual general meeting.  They can change the board and change the policy of the company, and in the long run, they have got full control.  A great many of these companies are owned by the Irish public and administered by representatives of public departments but the representatives of the Irish public, the members of the two Houses, cannot exercise effective supervision.  These companies have been constructed in a way which denies the right of the representatives of the Irish public to make investigations into their own property. As I have said, it is a problem in other countries as well as in this one, and we are asking the Minister to institute an inquiry as to how this problem can be faced and solved here.  We are not suggesting a policy of our own.  We recognise that a solution may be difficult, but we think it is a reasonable proposition that the problem must be investigated.</P>

      <P>I rise in the hope that the Minister will find his way to accept this motion.  Its terms are very innocent looking and very reasonable. I think it is true to state that as far as our State and semi-State companies are operated, they are neither fish, fowl nor good red herring.  As the Senators who have moved this motion have indicated, they have got all of the advantages of ordinary competitive business, <Col N="699" /> plus the security of a State umbrella. In two outstanding cases, we find ourselves paying tribute to two semi-State concerns&mdash;I refer to the Electricity Supply Board and to Irish Shipping&mdash; but I do not think that it is unreasonable to say that ordinary competitive business could be equally efficient and perhaps more so.  There is a danger in smug security, and that is the danger for which these State and semi-State concerns are heading.  Is it not strange, in an era of price control for competitive business that the Electricity Supply Board from time to time, at intervals, announces that the board has decided to ask for a revision of prices and that they automatically get permission to increase their charges?  I submit that they have got those increases and new charges far more readily than people engaged in competitive business with their own money could get permission to increase their charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can easily make profits and show a healthy balance sheet if you are permitted to increase your charges to make those profits inevitable.  Coming to Irish Shipping, I do not think it is generally known that the moment that devaluation of the £ took place, Irish Shipping Limited, running with Irish boats, built with sterling investments, manned by Irishmen, and victualled in Irish ports, immediately increased their charges to the full extent of dollar devaluation and, speaking now as an importer myself, and as a representative of business interests, I have yet to be convinced that a case can be made to justify the action which Irish Shipping has taken in putting the whole extent of devaluation on to their shipping charges from American ports when it is obvious that the results of devaluation do not bear fully on their costings.  I could enlarge on that, but I do not want to say anything that could be taken as aggressive.  I have no intention of being aggressively critical of these two fine companies we have in operation, but I do think that what they have done justifies the mover of this motion in asking that where we set up companies that operate with advantages as compared with competitive business within the State, we, members <Col N="700" /> of the Oireachtas, ought to be very jealous of the privileges given to those companies and we should be in a position, as members of the legislative body, to insist that we have an opportunity to ask, when major decisions are being taken, to be told the reason why. It would be an impossibility to have the board of directors running to the Oireachtas to justify every ordinary routine matter, but I submit that where charges bearing on the whole community are involved, as in the case of the Electricity Supply Board and Irish Shipping, they should be compelled to justify those charges to the Oireachtas, which represents the people of the country.</P>
    <P>Protests have been made by the various bodies representing industry against the action of the Irish Shipping Company, but they fail there.  As far as I know, that is all we can do.  These bodies make their protests, but they fail at that point.  If, as suggested in this motion, a committee of both Houses is set up to look into the administration of these companies, then these things which at present are regarded by the mass of the community as very serious matters pressing on industry here would at least be brought into the light of day, and if there is a reason we will know what it is.</P>
    <P>The motion is so simple that I sincerely hope the Minister will accept it. It would show that the Government has nothing to hide&mdash;I hope they have not&mdash;and that they are quite willing to see that, where State moneys are used for the creation and maintenance of companies, everything that happens and bears on the community as a whole will be subject to scrutiny by the elected representatives of the people.</P>

      <P>Is fíor don Seanadóir Ó Briain nach bhfuil sé ag iarraidh a lán agus é ag iarraidh ar an Aire géilleadh don tairiscint seo.  Níor mhaith liom a rá go bhfuilim ina choinne, mar nílim.  Sé an rud atá mé a cheapadh faoin scéal ar fad go bhféadfaimis cuid mhór den eolas sin d'fháil dá mba mhian linn é a lorg agus an chaoi a bhfuil an scéal faoi láthair. I want to say that I have no objection to the motion.  It will not do any great <Col N="701" /> harm if the Minister accepts it and if this joint committee is set up.  We have had experience of a long series of complaints being made in the Seanad with regard to the operations of Departments in the farming and issuing of Orders.  In due course, as a result of those complaints, a committee was set up with very wide powers to inquire into the reasons why these Orders were framed.  The committee had power to summon officials before it to give explanations.</P>
      <P>We had one or two reports from that committee before us and I wonder if they were of great importance.  I felt there was a great deal of substance in some of the complaints that had been made and that the result of investigation would show that civil servants and Ministers had acted in a highhanded fashion.  The result of the appointment of this committee, however, has been to satisfy us that the officials and the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries concerned were very careful, when they set about framing and issuing an Order, to be able to justify their action.  I feel that the same thing will occur in the investigation of the working of semi-State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad that Senator O'Brien did not launch an attack on the principle of establishing State companies.  Most reasonable people have come to the conclusion that these companies are very much in the nature of things in these days and may be more so in the days to come.  One would wish that that should not be so, but as things are going it seems that Government must take a greater interest in economic and industrial development in a more direct way than it has taken in the past.  The right to set up these companies is not questioned: it is there under the Constitution.  The number of companies is not very great. The reasons why they were set up are, on the whole, good and sound.  Senator Summerfield suggested that the work they do, if handed over to private companies, would be as well or better done.  The fact is that you could not possibly hand over this type of work to private companies, for very grave reasons.  Private companies would not be prepared to put up the <Col N="702" /> capital and face the risks involved. Again, you have to give very wide powers&mdash;taking things by and large&mdash; to these companies.  One has only to think of the Electricity Supply Board and the right it has to enter on to people's land, the right to erect poles and pylons, to run wires in particular directions as it thinks fit.  One has only to think of Bord na Móna and the right it has to enter on certain lands and cut drains, and to make bridges and so on.  It is clear that you could not hand over responsibilities of that kind to an ordinary private company.</P>
    <P>Much of the trouble with regard to these semi-State companies arises out of a failure on the part of members of the Legislature to study the reports, the profit and loss accounts and balance sheets of these companies.  If we want more information about them, that may be easily obtained.  One of the great results of the 1944 Transport Act was the manner in which the directors of Córas Iompair were able to simplify the annual accounts.  Those of us who have been studying accountancy always wondered why it was necessary to present railway accounts in the way they were presented.  It was really a worthy achievement on the part of Córas Iompair to change them in such a reasonable and simple manner. It is only a matter of the responsible Minister indicating to the companies that more information is required on the profit and loss accounts and on the balance sheets.  It is only a matter of people genuinely interested indicating to a Minister, or to those in control of companies, that the reports might be more complete and indicating to them what extra information might be supplied. A good deal of the information might be obtained through the Committee on Public Accounts, especially where the State is involved in the payment of subsidy or in the payment of interest, which is subsidy in another form.</P>
    <P>Whether it is a good thing to prescribe that the directors and officials of a company should come before a special board and account for every action is another matter.  If you do that in the case of companies so peculiarly situated as these semi-State companies are, I do <Col N="703" /> not know whether you will get men to act as directors at all.  If you are going to make regulations compelling directors and officials to come before a commission of inquiry and be subject to a thorough-going examination, you cannot very well draw the line at that.  We would say the reason is that public money is involved and the community is seriously interested in the working and the results of these companies. That is why we would say they should be hauled before a special committee of inquiry.  If we are to be logical, we must admit that the public is interested in the working of all companies, whether State companies, semi-State companies, public companies or even private companies.  If people are unhappy and feel there is a conspiracy on the part of the directors of a company to keep prices up or on the part of workers to work in a certain fashion with a view to keeping wages up and consequently prices up, or if they feel there is a conspiracy between the two of them, resulting in the public being unduly mulcted, it seems to follow perfectly that companies of that nature should also be hauled before a special committee of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I did have the opinion, and still have it, that it might not be a bad idea if there were some bureau of commercial and industrial investigation, before which genuine complaints regarding charges, methods of working, policies, and so on might be investigated and which would report later on these complaints.  I often thought it would not be a bad idea, especially when we have quite a number of industries enjoying protection.  I do not for a moment believe that they have abused or are abusing the protection: I have no evidence of that and am satisfied so far that no charge of that kind could be substantiated.  However, in the public interest, if people in certain quarters insist on carrying on a campaign against these companies, against the policy of protecting them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am expressing the opinion that, if we decide on a committee of investigation for companies of the nature mentioned in the motion, there is a danger that it must follow from that that there should be a committee to investigate the happenings in all kinds of companies. It is only a question of degree, to what extent the people will declare that they are interested in the doings of these companies and interested or not interested in the doings of others.</P>

      <P>I have said I have no objection to this motion and no objection to the setting up of this committee and that I would be pleased that it be set up and report.  I would be pleased, in the public interest, if we could devise some reasonable formula whereby the workings of these companies could be investigated.  If it is out of order to refer to possible consequences from that, I have nothing more to say.  This is one occasion where I can genuinely say I am pleased to see the motion on the Order Paper.  There is something in this motion.  There is a certain amount of uneasiness with regard to the workings of these companies. If that uneasiness is there, we should take every step possible to allay it.</P>

If we think that by investigation of this kind we can get these companies to act in a more reasonable way, we will have done a good day's work.  Senator Summerfield has referred to specific companies and has indicated his view that they have not acted in a reasonable way. He referred to the charges made by the Electricity Supply Board and to Irish Shipping, Limited, and the way they <Col N="706" /> have handled this matter of devaluation. He referred to specific cases. If there is uneasiness, as he indicated, we should investigate the matter.  If these companies have been acting wrongly, that should be pointed out and if by our advice we can indicate to them how they can do the business better, we ought to give that advice. I am quite satisfied to see this motion adopted and would like to see something result from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter on which I have spoken here on various occasions in the past six or seven years.  I never put it forward in the way it is put forward by Senator Ó Buachalla.  He seems to think the idea is investigation and that something wrong is being done.  That is not what is in my mind, nor was it ever in my mind, and I do not think it was in the minds of the proposer and seconder of the motion, judging by their speeches.</P>
      <P>As I see it, in the case of an ordinary public company which is not State owned, if public criticism arises from time to time which is liable to be injurious to the business or in other ways, it is brought up at a shareholders' meeting by some shareholder concerned about the damage that may be done to the company.  He may do that out of self interest, though usually he is interested as a person concerned with the welfare of the public company. Where you have what are strictly known as private companies that also occurs, but, it does not reach the public as the meetings are not public.  The companies we are concerned with are somewhat varied, and, to keep to the motion, they are all companies in which the State either directly or indirectly holds a majority of the shares.  Some of these companies are what are called public utility concerns, of which obviously, the Electricity Supply Board is one, with which everyone in the State is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator give a short list of the companies he has in mind, apart from the Electricity Supply Board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer not to answer directly, but I shall do so indirectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> I do not want to refer to companies by name.  I only mentioned the Electricity Supply Board because it is one that has been mentioned by other speakers.  I mention it only as a type.  There are other companies which were started by the State, not because the State particularly wished to start them, but because it was obvious that no private interest was likely to do so, and they were necessary for the country.  I do not want to mention names for fear it would get into the Press that I was criticising them.  Nothing is further from my mind.  There are some companies in which the State has indirect control as they were financed by a company in which the State holds a majority of the shares.  But these companies are obviously in a somewhat different category.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why I believe the best way to deal with the question, is not that the Minister would have the position examined in the first instance by civil servants and then brought before the Cabinet, but by the appointment of a committee out of which would come proposals which would be publicly debated.  Based on the reaction the Government would make up its mind whether the proposals were going to be useful or leave matters as they were. I indicated the different kind of companies, because I suggest to the House that the same method would not be suitable for all.  We have all heard wild talk outside about State-owned companies. I have no sympathy with that.  I do not want to be in any way identified with it.  People have been saying that they would make the position so difficult that there would not be any more of such companies.</P>
    <P>I recognise that in a small country, it is inevitable that you will have certain highly desirable industries, for which private enterprise could not find the capital or would not be in a position to deal with them.  One way, as in the case of the Post Office, is to set up a Department which would be subject to the Civil Service and general Ministerial control through Parliament.  That has been the established practice for a long time, with some advantages as well as disadvantages.  Many years ago <Col N="708" /> I was chairman of a postal commission at which witnesses came forward indicating some of the advantages as well as the disadvantages that might arise.  In the Electricity Supply Board, which was mentioned, there is a completely different method, and ultimately the Minister is responsible although he does not give detailed instructions to the board.  At the same time, he has pretty close control, although not in any sense, day-to-day control.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the position in the Central Bank, but I would say that a general rule applying to companies would not suit the Central Bank I thank the Senator for that interruption, as it rather illustrates the point I want to make.  This matter needs careful consideration as we do not want to do anything hastily. It would be disastrous if, in our desire to achieve a measure of public control, particularly parliamentary control, it resulted in frequent interference and questioning by busybodies, because that would not make for efficiency and would not gain the confidence of the public.  It is particularly desirous that anything we might do would not shock the confidence of the public in public concerns, but should rather strengthen them.  Therefore, what we have to do must be done carefully, so that the Government would be ultimately responsible for policy, and if necessary major decisions, but would not interfere in details which could not be properly explained to the public.</P>
      <P>It would be very bad if they had to do that.  I believe that between these two extremes there is a way out.  I do not think my proposal would suit in all cases, but it would be well worth trying the plan of setting up a small committee, perhaps not more than a dozen members of both Houses, who would be appointed by the Minister and act as shareholders, meeting once a year for the particular company in which the State owned a majority of the shares.  I suggest that the committee should only have the same rights and powers as shareholders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think shareholders meet for investigation.  At a shareholders' meeting information is given by directors for the benefit of the company.  At such a meeting directors are asked for information with regard to the affairs of a company. It is not usual at such meetings to give the name of an office boy who was appointed or why one was changed.  The principal difference between a meeting as I envisage and an ordinary shareholders' meeting, is that in the latter case the shareholders, if dissatisfied, have to call another meeting and propose the removal of directors.  In my proposal a committee of the Oireachtas if not satisfied with the information given could report to the Minister and make suggestions. As far as possible I believe that such a committee should be appointed over a period.  I do not think that we should select 12 people this year and 12 others next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as possible service on one committee should be regarded as the duty of every Deputy and Senator, who would confine his attention to the public interest.  They would be expected to take the same interest in the company as if they were substantial shareholders, remembering that they were there representing the public.  I think that would be worth trying.  It is quite likely that on examination the committee would say that it should be tried in the case of certain companies.  It is certainly worthy of examination.  I do not put it forward as a certain cure, but it would provide closer contact and direct questioning.  I am not in favour of close questioning of Ministers, except in exceptional cases, because Ministers doing their best are not always in a position to defend.  I do not want to appear dogmatic, but I emphasise that this proposal is something that might be examined by a committee.  I do not mind whether it is a committee of the two Houses or a body set up by the Minister, but I rather favour a committee of both Houses.  Above all let us make it clear <Col N="710" /> that this is not a committee to investigate errors.  It is something to provide a contact between the Oireachtas, as the representatives of the public, and therefore the shareholders, and the directors for the good management of the business.  In no sense should it be a mischief-making body and it would be disastrous if it were.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a question.  With the principle of the motion, I like other Senators, am in agreement.  If such a joint committee as is suggested in this motion were set up and if it recommended that periodic investigation or inquiry should take place into these companies, would not it be necessary to bring in legislation to empower them to make such investigation as would be necessary?  I merely ask the question because, if a committee thought that an investigation and a report and recommendations based on the report were necessary in future, I do not think that you have any powers at present to ask these companies to produce for any of us or any body of us, any more than for any individual taxpayer, a detailed outline of their expenditure, their receipts, or other aspects of their business.</P>
      <P>I only raise the problem so that the Minister can consider it when he is replying.  If such a joint committee were set up, if the committee thought there should be investigations, would not the next step be to implement that by legislation?</P>

      <P>I hope that the House will not consider it an impertinence if I make a few remarks on this motion.  I was not able to be present at the debate but I got a good account of it.  It seems to me that the debate went astray towards the end of the discussion and that the fundamental principles underlying the motion were not fully appreciated by some of the later speakers.  I would like to emphasise the fundamental principle on which, it seems to me, the motion is based.  I am quite certain that it is not based on suspicion of any particular company and that it is not intended as adverse criticism of any company of this kind <Col N="711" /> nor is it intended as adverse criticism of the general policy of setting up companies of this kind.  They are needed; I think we all agree about that.</P>
      <P>What it is based upon is a fundamental democratic principle that the people and their representatives have a right and duty to know how public money is being spent.  It is not a question of mere accountancy.  We are all quite satisfied that there is no dishonesty in administering the funds or anything of that kind; there is no question of asking about this or that item of expenditure.  It seems to me that the notion is that we as trustees of the people should have some say in the general policy of companies of this kind.  Incidentally, to say that protected industries come under the motion is a complete misapprehension. That was not intended at all.  The motion makes very clear that it refers only to those companies in which the State holds the majority of the issued shares.  Some members of the Seanad feel that they are trustees of the people in connection with these companies and they wish to discharge their duties as trustees more carefully, perhaps, than they have done in the past. It is not a question of suspicion or of adverse criticism of the Fianna Fáil Government or of any other Government; it is a matter of general policy. It is, after all, absolutely basic that if we as representatives of the people delegate certain powers we must keep an eye on the exercise of these powers. There must be constant scrutiny of some kind in this matter.  The Oireachtas is, so to speak, father of these companies.  We do not want to treat them like minors who are incapable of looking after their own affairs, but we do feel that they are a family. When the members of a family set up establishments of their own, they tend to forget the common loyalty they owe to the family at large.  When they live apart they tend to forget the family claim.  We suggest, as parents, that there should be a family reunion at which we could extend criticism or perhaps praise of the grown-up members of the family.  Is this unreasonable or is it too much to ask, as I believe one member of the House suggested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> It seems to be an absolutely democratic motion and one that deserves the full and unanimous support of the House.</P>

      <P>On the 28th of February, 1948, that is to say ten days after I entered the Government, I sent a memo to the Government headed &ldquo;Review of the Financial Operation of State-Sponsored Bodies&rdquo; and in that memorandum I suggested as an <i>ad hoc</i> method of dealing with all these State-sponsored bodies the adoption of a simple course, to empower, by changing one of the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann, the Comptroller and Auditor-General to inquire into the accounts of such bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration of that memorandum led to the consideration of the different types of companies with which we had to deal and at that point I began to realise the amazing difficulties of this subject.  Some of the 25 or so companies which I had under my review at that moment, I found, were in the position that their accounts were audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  In some cases the accounts of the companies were audited by an auditor appointed by, or with the approval of, a member of the Government. In some cases the accounts had to be presented to the two Houses of the Oireachtas; in some cases they had to be presented to Dáil Éireann alone; in some cases the accounts of these companies established under statute were presented merely to a Minister and he had no responsibility after that to bring forward the report or accounts to either House of the Oireachtas.  In addition to that, there was a difficulty regarding the types of companies.  I am not pretending that this is an exhaustive review of the companies, but there are some companies in which part or all of the capital is held by, or on behalf of, the State. In that category I would put the three air companies as they were then&mdash;and they still exist, Irish Shipping Limited, and its subsidiary, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, the Minerals Development Company, Irish Steam Limited, the company that is known as Céimicí Teóranta, which was the old Industrial Alcohol Company, and a <Col N="713" /> temporary company, the Irish Industrial Life Insurance Company&mdash;that is in liquidation.  There is also a group of statutory bodies which have no capital but which receive State grants. Chief among these is the Electricity Supply Board, and there are also two important companies, Bord na Móna and the Irish Tourist Board.  There is a third group of companies in which no capital is held by, or on behalf of, the State but the borrowings of the companies&mdash;and they are entitled to borrow&mdash;are guaranteed by the State. You have companies in that category which mainly developed under the exigencies of war&mdash;Tea Importers, Grain Importers, Oil and Fats Limited and Fuel Importers.  In addition to these, and I do not put these in any of these categories, I do not separate them, there is the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Butter Marketing Committee, the Sugar Company of Ireland, the Dairy Disposals Company, the National Stud Company, the Pigs and Bacon Commission, the Racing Board and the Sea Fisheries Association.  If one went through all that list and looked at the difference of objectives for which they were established, the different ways and systems under which they get money, and under which they are allowed to have credit, there was undoubtedly chaos with regard to these companies, and the mere simple business of asking the Comptroller and Auditor&mdash;General to investigate did not appear, on the whole, to be a good solution.</P>
    <P>One special difficulty about the Comptroller and Auditor-General is this: that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, although he is supposed to be a very old institution, in fact, only dates less than 100 years, but he has rather special duties.  He was set up to examine the appropriation of moneys, to see what moneys were appropriated for special means, by the ordinary system of supply here, and he has the duty of seeing that no more money was spent than was voted, and of seeing that what had been voted got to the area for which it was intended and, of course, in the main he had to be brought in nearly always to operate after the event.  He certainly could <Col N="714" /> not give any forewarning of anything The system of his investigations is well-known to senators.  He is assisted by a body known as the Public Accounts Committee, but they report only after the event.  They conduct their deliberations without the Press being present, and there is an old-time tradition, that every member of the Public Accounts Committee is bound to silence and secrecy until the Comptroller and Auditor-General reports; so that, in that way, it is very much a late event in the whole history of any accounts he investigates when the public hear anything about it.  Under a very old statute which was limited by a statute of 1921, the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Department is also entitled under that Act, which was not carried over here, to examine any accounts that are sent before him by a Committee of the House of Commons. There was a thought at one time of adopting that legislation here, of having it either in the power of the Dáil, or the two Houses of the Oireachtas to send, apart from the ordinary Estimates, to send other accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  In any event, the Office took a peculiar line on that.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General did not report because he said it might come into conflict with another part of his work.  He decided to let some members of his staff, generally some senior member, examine the special accounts sent before him.  The history of that seemed to indicate a weakness, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is not too sure of his powers under the legislation they have in England.  He is not too sure whether he is entitled to access to the books of any of these companies, where he is asked to inquire by resolution of the House of Commons and, I think, it is quite clear, that if he is going to produce a proper account he would have to be allowed to inspect the books and go into the whole of the companies' business.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions made from time to time as to what is to be done.  The simplest suggestion is to put in the Comptroller and Auditor-General on top of all these companies and give him power to inspect books; to a certain extent, that which characterises <Col N="715" /> them in a general way, is that they are in some way financed by the State to a greater or lesser degree or where their borrowing has to be guaranteed, that there is sufficient State assistance being paid to enable the Comptroller and Auditor-General to obtain their books for investigation. The second suggestion, one made in England from time to time, envisages that the Comptroller and Auditor-General could do, apart from the assistance of the Public Accounts Committee, with a different group established from amongst the parliamentary assembly, with a body of persons not selected according to Party affiliations as, unfortunately, the Public Accounts Committee is, but selected because people would have some special interest in the subject matter of the company they were dealing with, or some product they were engaged in the manufacture of, or else you would get some people interested in business as such, people interested in local or general finance, that they would form an expert body to help the Public Accounts Committee or the Comptroller and Auditor-General by investigating the books and reporting to them. The third system is one I mentioned in the House earlier, and is one which is in operation in certain portions of the Continent.  I know it to be in operation in Sweden, because at the time we established the Electricity Supply Board here the Chairman of the Swedish Waterfall Board suggested that we should adopt the Swedish practice. This practice, which I understand from certain speeches made here, might not be acceptable to some of the directors of these State-aided companies. The system there is that a group of the parliamentary assembly be selected and that a special day&mdash;I am talking of the Waterfall Board&mdash;is appointed for the examination of the board's activities during the year.  The body of parliamentarians selected sit almost as a court.  There is a special room devoted to the investigation and it may last for a week.  Members of the public and of the Press are admitted and members of the public may send in statements of grievance to cause questions on the <Col N="716" /> investigation to be conducted through the members of the Waterfall Board. It is the officials of the organisation who attend in every case and usually the chairman and, possibly, the permanent members of the board, the technicians on the different sides attend, and they have to be subjected to public examination.</P>
    <P>The Swedish system is in order to enable the inquiry to be conducted in an intelligent way, somebody, who that is I do not know, somebody is entitled to make a preliminary investigation into the affairs of the board to brief people who are investigating parliamentarians or even members of the public who can then put their questions up through any member of the group. A fourth suggestion has been made, that instead of having that, you should have a specialised group who would not necessarily be confined to Parliament; that you might have people selected from Parliament, with such outside experts as might be required for some special job, and that they should then sit and go through that sort of public examination.  Any of these suggestions may be considered, and the Government are definitely considering them at the moment.  We have not got to the end of our deliberations, because the further we went the more the complexity of the matter was disclosed, and the fact that some of these companies have been allowed to grow up haphazardly has added to the difficulty of getting any proper solution of this.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of comment on this from time to time because Parliaments are more and more taking control or, at least, having some sort of association with this type of body, which is on the increase with all sorts of multitudinous activities. I have three brief quotations from the issues of the <i>Economist</i>, one as far back as the autumn of 1947.  The last I have here is the end of January, this year.  A comment in the <i>Economist</i> dated the 27th September, 1947, runs on the lines that a new type of public accounting is required for a lot of the State companies that they have in England.  They said that the Treasury fails, partly or wholly, to satisfy any <Col N="717" /> of the three functions which its accounting should perform, and I think there is some value in this extract which I shall read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;First, members of the House of Commons need crisp non-technical summaries, bringing out the main trends, on which to base general discussions of policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said that you will get at any time a crisp non-technical summary that enables you to investigate anything, I do not think the ordinary company is any better off than some of these State-sponsored companies. It goes on&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Secondly, the committees of the House engaged in more detailed investigation of particular fields should be able to call not merely for petty cash book accounts designed simply to ensure that there is no dishonesty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that was what Senator Stanford was suggesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and that appropriations have not been exceeded, but for proper cost accounts designed to bring out the full costs and economic efficiency of particular services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Seanad will probably also agree with this quotation&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And thirdly, the Treasury itself needs similar cost accounts to maintain a running audit of the efficiency of Departments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is from a journal of considerable repute in England, which devoted and fostered a good deal of thought on the matter at the time.  The quotation comes from its issue of the 27th September, 1947.  I come to read a quotation from the issue of January 28th, 1950.  The journal then admitted that there had not been much progress since its comment of February 14th, 1948, in which it said there was no clear line of division between those questions which Ministers should and should not answer.  It continued&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The issue is a difficult one... on the one hand there are innumerable detailed matters which it would be entirely wrong for the Minister to answer or interfere with; on the <Col N="718" /> other there are major questions of principle and policy for which Ministers must be directly answerable. The trouble is the breadth of the no man's land between.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is still the trouble, and I think that we would get very definite agreement here that if these concerns are to be allowed to run with any pretence of efficiency you cannot have day-to-day interference by parliamentary questions with day-to-day actions, but, at the same time, it is clear that there are matters&mdash;big matters of policy, on which the Minister ought to be questioned in the House, because he ought to have something to do with what this journal describes as &ldquo;the breadth of the no man's land between&rdquo;.  At a later point, this article comes to the suggestion that if investigations of these matters are to get anywhere:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;members of the boards should appear in person and not be represented by officials of their parent ministry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that is a point on which we might also have agreement.  On 28th January, 1950, the same journal, giving what amounts to a retrospect of the parliamentary procedure over five years, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From this point of view, it is particularly serious that no satisfactory method has been found by which Parliament can discuss the affairs of the new public corporations and nationalised industries.  No uniform procedure has been followed in the answering of questions on these organisations; the board rule has emerged that a Minister should not answer questions on matters of the day-to-day administration but only on matters of major policy; but this is a line that has proved difficult to draw in practice.  There are annual debates on the reports of accounts of boards and corporations, but these are issued only after a considerable lapse of time and there is no method by which Parliament can ascertain whether current policy is going astray.  Some kind of grand committee for the nationalised industries could be evolved, but this method would have its own danger. <Col N="719" /> The debates on the affairs of the Overseas Food Corporation have revealed the extent to which it is possible to thwart parliamentary curiosity.  There is a risk that, unless some satisfactory basis for discussion can be worked out, the House will acquire a professional suspicion of the public corporations which will inevitably be reflected in the public attitude.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I stress that because that is the situation we have here.  There is, undoubtedly, a suspicion of these boards as a whole, and that is not confined to members of the Dáil and Seanad, but the public generally have that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>A much more suspicious view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The public are reflecting the attitude which, I believe, is mainly the attitude of members of the Dáil and Seanad with regard to these companies.  Where we will end as between all these interests I do not know. It is a very complex matter and it might well be that the Comptroller and Auditor-General might be the proper solution, certainly for the simpler types of companies, or you might have a parliamentary assembly with a few chosen members instead of picking them by a proportional representation system on party strength.  You might also have a combination of several systems of investigation or you might adopt a system of appointing outside auditors, asking them to inspect the books in detail, and to collect whatever information was required by the inquiries that had been made.  Or, having got the replies to these inquiries, they could be sent back with further inquiries where the inquirers were not satisfied with the first information they received.  There are other ways in which an investigation might be made into the workings of these companies.  But, there is one company in which there has never yet been a request by the Dáil or Seanad for an examination.  At the formation of the company, the position was taken that a Minister was to have responsibility, and while he was to have responsibility, <Col N="720" /> he was to be allowed to disclaim responsibility for the day-to-day administration. That system is still in operation and it still stands the test. The company is the Electricity Supply Board, which was required to open its accounts to outside auditors sent on them by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was responsible for that concern.  The system was that the board would make its report on the persuasion of that outside auditor sent in by the Minister, and he brought back to the Minister who appointed him the preliminary report and the accounts in preliminary form of the Electricity Supply Board.  It is the Minister's duty to see that further inquiries are pursued and his responsibility to Dáil Éireann was that if something emerged that merited inquiry, the Minister had to cause it to be inquired into.  It was his duty to see that anything agitating the public in regard to the affairs of the Electricity Supply Board was specially investigated by this outside auditor who was sent in to be watchdog and to report back first before the Minister reported to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The arrangement was that any member of the Dáil if he had any following &mdash;not just a Party following&mdash;but a following of people in Dáil Éireann who were perturbed about anything, and wanted a day to discuss the report, would have to get a day or longer for the discussion of it.  Although that system is in operation, there never has been one half hour's discussion on the report or accounts of the Electricity Supply Board since it was established, and it was the one body most open to investigation according to the different pledges given by the Government who set it up, and accepted by the Government who succeeded them.  I feel it may take some long time still to get these accounts and go back to this &ldquo;crisp comment&rdquo;&mdash;something that would lead people to make further inquiries, that would put them in the position of seeing the facts and if necessary trying to get further facts and comments on them from the concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would take a good deal of further thought.  The Cabinet have been considering this matter for a <Col N="721" /> number of years and various memoranda have come back from interested Departments but no conclusion has been reached and it may be that some little time will be required before a conclusion is reached.  We must remember that the Audit and Exchequer Department, although nearly 100 years old is a fairly young institution.  It was set up only about 1860, after the procedure had developed of having inquiries into expenditure.  If you cast your minds back, you will recall that in those days, government was rather a simple matter.  There were certain things regarded as proper for the Government to interfere in.  There were categories of things which the Government could do and nobody else could do, like the arrangement for the administration of justice and defence.  Those were two outstanding things.  There were particular cases in which certain benefits were diffused but where the beneficiaries were not in a position to pay or meet the cost.  Primary education would probably be classified under that heading nowadays as well as the provision of lights around the coast, and so on.</P>
    <P>The growing category at the moment is the category of things in respect of which the Government believes that it has a better judgment or a better right to pass judgment than anybody else. It is a varying group and unfortunately, to my mind, it is on the increase.  It is all very well for the Government to say it knows better than anybody else the age up to which children should remain at school, or the hours within which or outside which people should or should not be allowed to drink and matters of that sort; but the area in which the Government is more and more interfering in the private lives of citizens is on the increase and I do not know how, if any of these companies follow that line, how we are to meet it.  It is an interference and if we could only get the people to take a different view and to believe that there is an interference which ought not be tolerated, we might get that sphere of Government activity very much restricted.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is undoubtedly clear, however people may lament it, that the Government is going to interfere <Col N="722" /> more and more in economic matters, in either commercial affairs or manufacturing concerns, and the point is whether we are to have that activity examined and, if so, by what machinery?  The system of the Comptroller and Auditor-General is the proper system and you could not have anything better than it for the examination of the old system of Government in relation to the old Departments like Defence, Justice, and so on.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General can do all that is required there.  When you come to the semi-social or semi-commercial area of duties, I think that we have there a mixed area with which it is going to be very difficult to deal. When you get into the sphere of the trading concern in which the Government is playing its part, I think that that should be subjected to the type of examination carried out by an outside auditor, but with that outside auditor reporting to some people with parliamentary responsibility and parliamentary experience, and especially I should like to see a specialist group of parliamentarians chosen, not because of Party affiliations but because of their association with business, their experience of administration or various factors like that.</P>
    <P>When you get into this intermediate stage, where you have things that cannot be classified&mdash;nobody pretends that they are either commercial or trading and yet there is public money being spent and possibly wasted&mdash;we want somebody away from the busy parliamentarian, away from the busy civil servant and away from the busy Minister to go quietly and leisurely into the affairs of such a concern and report.  I do not know how that is to be managed.</P>
    <P>I take up the Book of Estimates and take as one example the Vote dealing with Gaeltacht services.  I do not know why that Vote should be in this Book of Estimates at all.  The service should pay its way, but going through this current volume for 1949-50.  I find that that service cost the State £110,000.  As the money of the State goes at the moment, that is not a tremendous sum, but, when one examines it, one finds that there are something short of 200 officials borne on that Vote whose salaries <Col N="723" /> amount to about £60,000, so that you have nearly 200 people costing in salaries £60,000 in order to lose £110,000.  The mere presentation of these facts must argue&mdash;not inefficiency in the persons who are around the service; I am not saying that&mdash; something bad in the whole set up, if 200 people costing the State £55,000 in salaries are occupied in that work in order to lose £110,000 on the service.</P>
    <P>The answer that will come immediately to me is that it is not a business and never pretended to be, that it is not a trading or commercial concern, but that it is something in the nature of a social service in respect of the Gaeltacht.  I suppose that is the answer that will be made to me, but I am not sure that we are getting good value for it and it might be better to give the whole of it to the Gaeltacht instead of paying part of it to officials. Again the answer will come to me: &ldquo;Was it not better to occupy these people, even if they were occupied at making something they cannot sell at a profit or cannot sell to meet expenses than to have the money divided amongst them?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one of the odd types of services we have.  That is being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and what does he do in that respect?  He sees that the people are properly appointed, that the money is properly voted and gets to nobody but people in the Gaeltacht or in the direction of materials bought.  He reports that as being perfect.  He finds nothing wrong with it.  He never has and he could not, but there is something wrong with that.  How is that to be fitted into the sort of examination that will be made in the case of the simple type of service?  The Comptroller and Auditor-General gives you all you want in that respect, but in the matter of the type of commercial audit which I think is required for the trading concern, there will possibly have to be a change with regard to all three.</P>
    <P>This matter has been gone into in some detail.  People will realise from what I have said that it has not passed without observation and the expenditure <Col N="724" /> of a good deal of officials' time and the time of members of Government. We have not reached any conclusion on the matter and I am quite willing to accept the views Senators have expressed. I do not want them to pass this resolution, because, if they do, I am left with the alternative of either neglecting it or setting up a commission which will be pursuing inquiries along the lines we have already been pursuing our inquiries.  I will bear in mind what has been said, and, if necessary, will come back, and, if I feel that I would be assisted by the setting up of such a committee, will ask to have it set up.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield referred to the Electricity Supply Board charges and said that they got their charges raised with much greater ease than an outside person in private business could have got them raised.  I do not know about that.  I think the Electricity Supply Board has considerable trouble in getting leave to raise their charges and in fact they raised their charges by a percentage that was very much lower than the percentage by which most charges were raised in the country over the period of the emergency.</P>
    <P>Another Senator referred to Irish Shipping Limited.  I wish there had been an examination of Irish Shipping, if only to get rid of the confusion which Senator Summerfield has with regard to it.  If Irish Shipping said that the recent increase they made in their freight charges was due to devaluation, they could not expect anybody to believe them, and I am surprised to find Senator Summerfield accepting it from them.  They were going badly, very badly, at one time.  Devaluation gave them a chance and they seized it, but whether there had been devaluation or not, the freight rates of Irish Shipping would have had to go up.  Otherwise, the company was going to be another addition to the list of lame ducks in the way of public companies which I have to finance out of the taxpayer's pocket.</P>
    <P>Córas Iompair Éireann was also referred to and I think that a considerable amount of the difficulties in which Córas Iompair Éireann now finds itself might have been avoided if the public had any hint of what was going on for the past couple of years.  If the public had realised two years ago that <Col N="725" /> there was a non-technical chairman&mdash; and he was clearly that, certainly on the railway side&mdash;and a manager who was non-technical on any side of transport or traffic and a board carrying on without a chief engineer or chief mechanical engineer, I have the feeling that if merely those facts had been revealed to the public two years ago, there would have been such a clamour that at least technical men would have been brought around that board and the situation would not be as bad as it is now.</P>
    <P>There is also the point which I mentioned earlier.  It is one of the points in respect of which, if Senators have thought over it, I should like to hear their views.  It is a matter which I want considered as a special point.  Who is going to inquire if we have some system of inquiry?  Is it to be Parliament, because it is in the Parliament that the matter will have to be threshed out or will members of Parliament prefer to rely on people of some specialist type to give them information? I have dealt with that already.</P>
    <P>The point on which it is more difficult to get any real line on is how the people who are to make the inquiry are to be briefed.  You could set four or five very eminent men in one line of business to deal with Bord na Móna or Irish Shipping, and they might not get anywhere, but if somebody with an intimate knowledge of the affairs of a company like one or other of these is sent in to make a preliminary inquiry and to come out with what he had found and put others on inquiry, something might be achieved; but the trend &mdash;possibly a wrong trend&mdash;is to make these inquiries public inquiries. and, if it it to be a public inquiry, we might as well have nothing.  If the inquiry is to be conducted on the basis of members of the public coming in with grievances they have and somebody putting up those grievances, they are generally going to be about small points which are not going to be met or which will be met in the perfunctory way companies have of meeting these things.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that I have not added anything to the deliberations of the Seanad on the point, except possibly <Col N="726" /> to give an indication that the matter has been very seriously considered for a very long time.  The fact that it has taken so long to get nowhere, so to speak, may give an indication of the difficulty of the whole matter.  I ask the Seanad, having given me the benefit of their views, not to pass the resolution but to let the matter rest here.  If it should become necessary, I will come here and indicate what is going on and let the Seanad pass its views on it, or come back and ask to have this resolution resubmitted, so that it could be assented to and the committee of inquiry referred to set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of very great importance and it seems to me to arise, as the Minister has said, from the extensions of the powers of Parliament and Government and from the failure of the modern Parliament to carry out anything like the supervision of the operations of Government which, under the old democratic system, it was expected to carry out.  I think that is the fundamental dilemma.  There is a tendency, as the Minister said, a continuing tendency, not confined to any country or any Party, to extend the powers of Government.  That extension in itself extends the powers of Parliament and then, as Senator Stanford says, we want to apply the principles of democracy to these extensions, but the trouble is we cannot do it.  Parliaments both here and in England&mdash;the examples we know best&mdash;and indeed to a great extent in France, have failed to do it.</P>
      <P>The idea of these companies is the creation of a half-way house between complete State Socialism and private enterprise and they have grown up in a haphazard way.  That is only natural to expect because no Government here since 1922 took the line that Socialism, as a principle, was correct and that, therefore, we ought to nationalise things because nationalisation in itself was good.  What Governments here since 1922 did was to say, when they found a particular problem: &ldquo;It cannot be solved by private enterprise and therefore we will put public money into it.&rdquo;  That was done, in the first instance, by the present Minister, with regard to the supply of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> I remember that, when the point was raised as to what power the Dáil was to have, I was asked the question myself in the Chair.  I said I did not know.  I do not know yet.  I knew enough then to prophesy that this was the beginning of a number of bodies of the same type.  I said then, 25 years ago, that some scheme would have to be found to control them.  Here, now, in March, 1950, the Minister says the Government is considering whether that can be done.  It seems to me that we ought quite frankly make up our minds that it cannot be done satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>What we want is to have the work of these bodies done in a business-like way with, in the main, State money and with the power of the Government to appoint directors and to be ultimately in control.  In other words, we want to combine the good things of private enterprise with a certain amount of State money and with State control.  The question is: Can these two things be done?  One answer to all this is to say that the Government of the day, whoever they are, are a committee, under the control of Parliament and, indeed, appointed by Parliament ultimately, which has to control these companies. But, the Government, no matter who they are, are the busiest body of men in the country, having each of them three full-time jobs to do, one parliamentary, the other administrative and the third, the keeping of themselves in political office.  The present Minister only does two of these jobs.  That is another question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusOFarrell" hpid="Mr. S. O'Farrell Mr. S. O'Farrell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not keeping him awake at night, I suspect.  As a matter of fact, the suggestion is that we should, in some way, have parliamentary control of these numerous companies.  The Minister mentioned 25 of them.  What is the principal function of the other House&mdash;of the House of Commons and the Dáil, for example&mdash;as conceived years ago?  The principal function is to control Government expenditure.  That is the one thing above all other things that they <Col N="728" /> never do.  The position now is that a Government is endeavouring to control expenditure and that a House of Commons or a Dáil is urging them from all angles to spend more.  I have done it myself.  We all do it.  I am not arguing that I am a person free from these particular defects.  We all do it The whole tendency of the Dáil on Estimates&mdash;I have sat through a great many Estimates myself&mdash;is not to say to the Government: &ldquo;Why are you spending so much&rdquo;, but &ldquo;Why do not you spend more and more and more money on what I want you to spend money on&rdquo;.  So that, in that way, the control of their own committee, that is running the country, is something which, in fact, Parliament has entirely lost track of.  Can a Parliament, therefore, which is finding it increasingly difficult to do its own immediate job, find time to do another one?  I think it is very difficult.  I think it is impossible, as a matter of fact.</P>
      <P>The most important thing of all is the appointment of directors.  They must be let reasonably alone.  One of the problems of appointing any body to supervise them is, to whom are the people who supervise them to make their reports?  To the two Houses of Parliament?  What kind of discussion will arise in the two Houses of Parliament?</P>
      <P>In nearly every case where you have had discussion dealing with individuals it has been a bad discussion.  While there may be certain evils, I think it is a greater evil that Parliament should be able to say: &ldquo;Here is Mr. X, who is not doing his job&rdquo;.  Even if he is not doing his job, there should be some other better way of settling that than having discussion about him in Parliament.</P>
      <P>In what are parliamentarians usually interested?  Not in principles but in small things.  The members of a popularly elected House are the most badgered and persecuted people in any country at the moment about small things.  Discussion of Córas Iompair Éireann, or of the Electricity Supply Board is why will they not give electricity to Bally so and so; why will not they open branch lines; why does Córas Iompair Éireann want to close down stations?  Is not that the whole story?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> As for the general question, very few are interested.  If they are interested, they are not doing their best to keep their seats and, as somebody suggested a few moments ago, quite properly, if you do not keep your seat, you will have no more influence either in Córas Iompair Éireann, the Electricity Supply Board or Dáil Éireann or any of the various bodies that there are.</P>
    <P>The T.D. and the member of Parliament in other countries is becoming more and more harassed by his constituents. He is interested in smaller rather than bigger things and is immersed in an immense mass of futile correspondence because his constituents believe that he is a kind of maid of all work except that he has not fixed hours and they think that he is far too well paid.  That is the general position about him.  The latest thing I heard was that a constituent asked a T.D. to find him a wife.  The easiest thing to say, as the Minister has pointed out, is that the Comptroller and Auditor-General ought to do something about this.  It does not seem to me a question of accounting.  It is not, as has been said here, that people are suspicious that these companies are not being well run.  It is that people in the Dáil and the Seanad have a feeling that, being the representatives of the people, they ought to be in a position of shareholders. I think the truth is that they cannot get into that position and cannot put themselves in that position. They can try but I doubt very much that they can do it.</P>
    <P>The Public Accounts Committee is a very successful committee in the other House but its success is caused by the fact that its work has to be done on a very narrow basis and that it is done after the event.  They work satisfactorily for that reason.  What the motion wants is that there should be some control as to the policy that is being pursued&mdash;is not that so&mdash;and as to how the policy is being pursued.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General has nothing to do with that.  Neither has the Public Accounts Committee.  Any analogy between the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and <Col N="730" /> Auditor-General is a false one and is not doing the job.</P>
    <P>I do not know what kind of review is desired.  I heard a certain amount of discussion about this but I do not really know what it is.  The Minister says that if people were aware of certain things about Córas Iompair Éireann, there would have been a public outcry.  I wonder would there.  I wonder is there sufficient public opinion in the country to create an outcry about matters of great importance as distinct from an outcry about small details that are in themselves not very important but that hit somebody right away. When they close down a station, the people in that particular area start to agitate.  That, in a democratic State, is the most important kind of agitation, just as the most important question&mdash;I have seen dozens of them on Dáil Order Papers&mdash;is: When are you going to divide the Hayes-Smith Estate.  It is far more important than any other question in the Dáil.  The discussion that takes place on Estimates is nearly always a discussion of details.</P>
    <P>All the suggestions that have been made about the Comptroller are, I think, not satisfactory.  The other suggestion of imitating the Swedes and having a parliamentary Committee with public discussion, does not commend itself to me either.  I think the Minister is entirely right when he says, if you want discussion it must be in some way private.  That, again, is not what Senator Orpen or Senator O'Brien want, that is to say, a private discussion.  Will that lead to a report to the other House, for example, and what kind of discussion are they going to have there?</P>
    <P>We used to have a member of this House who advocated constantly on all occasions the getting together of what he called cost accounts.  That might be a good thing but it would mean nothing to the average voter.  It would mean something to highly skilled people.  The truth is that in the name of democracy, having destroyed here and in England one form of aristocracy, we are developing another form of aristocracy, namely, the managers. We are developing towards a <Col N="731" /> managerial State&mdash;a new form of aristocracy with new powers.  What we are wondering is how we can control our new aristocracy.  I do not know that we can do it at all.  Perhaps we can.</P>
    <P>Then, again, there is the question of specialists, getting specialists to inquire into these bodies, but the Government, if it is a competent Government&mdash;and on this kind of thing Governments are fairly competent because their own reputation is at stake&mdash;are likely to put on specialists and the suggestion, therefore, of specialists to inquire is specialists inquiring about specialists and reporting to people who, by definition, are not specialists at all.  So, the conclusion that I arrive at&mdash;I am afraid it is not a satisfactory one&mdash;is that we are endeavouring to apply to a very complicated situation a machine made for a much more simple situation and I do not think we can get any democratic machinery which will enable us satisfactorily to inquire into the progress, even the general progress, of these bodies.  It is a half-way House that we have at present.  The other solution, of course, is full-blooded Socialism, which leads you into the position where you control everything, including the labour of human beings and including the human being themselves, where this kind of discussion, which Senator Orpen and Senator Ó Buachalla and others are having, would not be possible and where the workings of the State machine are not allowed to be discussed.  This is not a peculiarly Irish problem.  There has been a lot of talk about it in other countries, particularly in England, and it is now one of great importance for the United States of America.  Whether it can be solved or not I do not know.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it is hardly the thing now to set up a committee to consider it, as the committee could not devise any other suggestions but those which have been made&mdash; that is, to allow some committee to inquire into it.  the whole basis of democratic government is that an intelligent public-spirited individual as a Minister, with the help of specialists <Col N="732" /> who are civil servants, will be able to control a Department; but when you see the ramifications of Departments like Industry and Commerce it becomes, practically speaking, impossible to control everything done in it. I do not think it is possible to remain a parliamentary body to have people elected on non-specialist bases, as we are, and at the same time to control all these specialist activities.  We should endeavour to examine whether the parliamentary machine itself is not in some way defective.  I think it is defective for the purpose of carrying out the job which has been put on it and which, I think, it certainly is not able to do.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to talking without the Minister, because had he been here I have a feeling that the motion would eventually be withdrawn.  I do not believe it was ever intended to press it.  It was suggested to me last night that we ought to leave this discussion to the men who have land.  I did not fall in with that, as it would be equivalent to suggesting that the man who had no boots and went barefooted should not think or talk about boots.  This is a question well worth discussing and as I have no personal axe to grind I can be impartial. If I refer to Senator Burke or any other Senator whose name is attached to the motion, I do it merely because they have identified themselves with this proposal and must be prepared to defend it or give further information if we ask for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest that Senator Burke comes in here with a hammer and sickle in his attaché case.  I do not suggest that he has a red flag wrapped around him.  I know that he is the most inoffensive person here.  I know that he is the mildest mannered man&mdash;I will not finish that quotation.  He has never said or done anything offensive and because of that he is very popular and because of that he is very dangerous. He can very easily get people to agree with things that are not worthy of support. This motion is a most dangerous proposition and there was no justification for it.  He said yesterday that he had tried the system on his farm for 16½ <Col N="734" /> years.  He tried it with such success that nobody in County Galway has the slightest intention of following his example.  If he wants a demonstration of its efficacy surely he has a demonstration there.  Why does he want the State to come in and set up co-operative farms, financed presumably by the State and cause a further complication of the problem that we have been discussing earlier?  Who is going to audit the co-operative accounts and look after them?  Are we to add another series of boards to the Electricity Supply Board, and all the other organisations that we are not able to control at the moment?  I was surprised when I saw&mdash;not Senator Burke's name because I knew he had been trying this out&mdash;but Senator Tunney's name and Senator McCrae's. If they are recommending this as a good thing I wonder how far they are prepared to go themselves in adopting this principle.  I do not know whether they have farms or not.  If they have, without any State interference at all, they can try it out.  Nobody has to coerce them into doing it if they believe in it.  If they do not believe in it, who has the right to coerce, say, Senator Baxter into it?  Senator Baxter spoke on what a good Christian Senator Burke was.  He paid tributes to Senator Burke as a good Christian; he said nothing about him as a good farmer.  I was surprised that Senator Baxter should above all things praise Christianity without being prepared to follow because if there is anyone whom I know to be a good Christian at heart it is Senator Baxter.  But he was not going to be so much of a good Christian as to follow Senator Burke.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be nasty and I do not mean to be nasty, but I suggest that there is one of Dickens's characters who comes to mind when I hear talk of humility.  There is no Christianity in this experiment of Senator Burke's.  Senator Burke has not made a moral claim for it.  He has made no claim for his system except six good reasons.  I took them down and four of them amounted to saying the same thing in different words: that the men worked harder, that there was greater output per man and per man hour and a greater yield per <Col N="735" /> acre, in other words, that it was a good whip.  He said that the profits and the losses were shared. There is nothing new in sharing profits. Any man who paid wages shared. profits and he even had to share when there were no profits.  To call this a co-operative farm is a misnomer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">

      <P>Is it a co-operative farm?  Do the seven men own the farm between them?  Can any one of them sell his share in the farm?  How are the profits estimated?  What is allowed to the owner for rent, use of buildings and machinery, cattle and so on? Surely there must be some costings of that sort.  Can any man of the seven decide to sell the farm in spite of Senator Burke?  The men are only working under a master.  What are they working for?  The best up to this has been the agricultural worker's wage, plus a £10 bonus.  Spread the bonus over a year and it represents 1¼d. an hour over what the meanest farmer in the country is compelled to pay by the State as the lowest possible wage. A magnificent achievement after 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke said that there were several sorts of co-operation and that this was the one he had tried.  I heard of common ownership between a farmer and a labourer that was, on a limited scale, very like what Senator Burke is doing.  The farmer said: &ldquo;We will get a cow between us; we will buy it between us and own it 50-50. You will own the front and I will own the back and you can feed it and I will milk it.&rdquo;  That is the sort of co-operative farming that is going on and I do not think the State should try experiments of that sort.  If you want experiments try them on your own farm.  Every farm is an experimental farm and every farm is a demonstration farm.  You have only to look over the hedge or the gate to get a demonstration of what the farmer is doing and <Col N="736" /> how he is doing it and you can guess whether it is worth doing or not.</P>
    <P>If you want the State to come in to teach farmers and labourers their business and set up co-operative farms for the labourers can you not be consistent and say that the State should set up co-operative cinemas, hotels and dog tracks?  If the State once starts to set up co-operative things there is not any limit.  At the moment I do not want a farm but I might take a share, if the State gave it to me free, in one of the more profitable ventures like dog racing.  I do not know much about dog racing and I know little about farming.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke did not tell us enough. He has 250 acres which he works on a co-operative basis.  Does he pay land annuities and are they deducted from the earnings of the farm?  If so, this means that the seven labourers are buying out the fee simple of his farm for Senator Burke without knowing it. Has he other land which he does not run on a co-operative basis?  If this is good for 250 acres would it not be better for 2,500 acres and better still if we ran the whole country as one co-operative farm with one commissar in charge.  I think there was a gentleman called Cincinnatus who was taken from his plough to become a dictator.  Senator Burke did not even leave the plough but he thought he would be a dictator, not for 16 days, but for all time over all the farms in the country.  When I hear so much talk from farmers I wonder who runs the farms?  I wonder are some of the farms run by Radar because I meet farmers in the Dáil and Seanad.  I read of some farmers at company meetings. I hear of farmers at the Royal Dublin Society, and I read of them at banquets, but seldom on the farm.  When I do meet them they are wringing their hands and saying the farm does not pay.  I wonder then where they get the free tickets on the railways to come up to all the shows they come to.</P>
    <P>This system is, as Senator Ó Buachalla said, at best a form of profit-sharing. We do not know enough about it and, not knowing enough, we could not recommend it.  It is not the duty of the State to set up more experimental farms and I do not see <Col N="737" /> how they would pick the labourers to run the farms co-operatively.  It has not even the merit of being new.  That is the fantastic thing about it all.  Today, in 1950, Senator Burke is advocating the co-operative farm.  In 1830 what was called a co-operative farm was set up in Ralahine in County Clare by a gentleman named Vandeleur. I have more details about Vandeleur's experiment than I have about Senator Burke's, but as far as I know anything about Senator Burke's it runs on a line with Vandeleur's and whether the purpose of setting them up was the same I do not know.</P>
    <P>Vandeleur was living in very troubled times.  He was afraid of the White Boys, and of some body called the Terry Alts.  I do not know whether there were any Terry Alts in Tuam when Senator Burke decided he would try the experiment of co-operative farming.  Maybe, it is only a coincidence, that the Fianna Fáil Party had just assumed Government and he thought another revolution was coming.  Vandeleur thought he would safeguard himself by putting the labourers into a co-operative farm, and to convince him he should make up his mind they shot his agent, shot him dead.  The agent the day before was out supervising the labourers. They had a bucket of cold water into which they dipped a mug now and again to drink when they were sweating. He kicked the bucket over to stop them drinking.  I do not know whether that is the origin of the phrase or not, but he &ldquo;kicked the bucket&rdquo; himself on the following night.  Vandeleur saw that this was getting dangerous, let us, he said, make a co-operative farm of it, and he brought a man named Craig over here to run the co-operative farm.  The labourers were to get a share of the profits.  Vandeleur charged a rent against his machinery, against his farm, and against his cattle.  He had to be paid in coin.  He drew £900 a year, probably £1,000 a year&mdash;and money was money at that time&mdash;out of the farm.  What did the others get?  They got less than Senator Burke is paying his men. They got eightpence a day for working in the summer time from 8 a.m. to <Col N="738" /> 8 p.m., and in the winter from dawn to dark.  The women got fivepence a day.  Senator Burke says his men are living in houses provided by him.  I assume something is deducted from their earnings for rent.  Vandeleur also made the men live on the farm in houses provided by him.  He arranged their marriages for them.  A Deputy was recently asked to find a wife. Vandeleur looked after his people.  He made sure that they got wives or husbands of his choice.  Nobody was allowed to smoke, nobody was to drink, nobody was to gamble, and nobody was to call anybody else by a nickname.</P>
    <P>Everything went swimmingly in this fashion until Vandeleur went to Dublin, and on a throw of a card, gambled the farm away, and the people who had been working on it were thrown out on the road as they did not own the farm.  I wonder if any dispute arises in Tuam who would own the farm?  I am not saying that out of any personal antagonism, but when anybody gets up to suggest a plan for the country I want to know more about it than I do.  It is also a coincidence that this thing started as a co-operative farm.  When it collapsed Mr Craig wrote the history of it and it became known as &ldquo;The Just Commune&rdquo;. I wonder is the Second Irish Commune in Tuam?  Are the Government to facilitate putting one in every county?</P>

      <P>I know practically nothing about farming, and I do not propose to attempt to deal with the practicability of what is called co-operative farming, but it seems to me that Senator Burke put forward a scheme with a certain idealism behind it, in a perfectly sincere and thoughtful manner. It is rather a tragedy that some of the members of the House have thought it wise to treat it in a frivolous or semi-frivolous manner.</P>

      <P>I believe it has been applied to the drapery trade.  I certainly would not have any objection to the Senator putting down a motion and giving his reasons.  I would not feel the tiniest bit hurt.  Whether the last speaker's remarks were to be treated as frivolous or not, my remarks were not intended solely for him, though I think some of his remarks were frivolous.  I want to be frank.  There were other references made, I am not going to mention names, which did not seem to me to treat the proposal in the way, I think, it should be treated.  I am only giving my opinion.  I think the great mistake Senator Burke has made, is not that he has endeavoured to give publicity to the idea of co-operation amongst workers on farms, but that he has asked that the State should encourage and facilitate.  Now, it seems to me that the essence of the co-operation, in the sense I understand co-operation, is that it is free, that it is of free will.  The minute the State comes in either to interfere, to encourage, or to give privileges it ceases to be entirely free.  I think it is highly desirable that we should have more co-operation amongst free men.  I am in favour of closer political co-operation. This is not a new idea.  I said it in the House many years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of much closer co-operation amongst businessmen in the same business, but as soon as you introduce an element of compulsion into it, it ceases to be co-operative, in the sense in which I understand it, and the danger to my mind of proposing that in the state of Irish opinion the State should provide any facilities or give certain privileges would be that this form of farming, whether idealistically framed or whether it is better than Senator Burke has described, would have become the enemy of the private owner because it would be getting privileges.  In other words, I think it would be a very good thing, whether on the lines of Senator Burke or on other lines, if people in this country could feel that they have a perfectly free choice if they chose to co-operate together, to join together in their mutual interest.  They should have general encouragement and sympathy, <Col N="740" /> and if the idea spreads, let it spread as their idea.  By all means, I would like to encourage Senator Burke to go forward and preach his gospel, but do not ask the State to come in, because if you do you risk failure.</P>

      <P>There is no law against it.  There should be no law against it.  There should be nothing to discourage it nor do I think, at this stage, there should be special facilities. The first remarks I made, were due to the fact that it seemed to me that some of the speeches, I was not referring solely or especially to the speech of the last speaker, that some of the speeches seemed to be of a rather cynical nature against what I thought to be a valuable contribution to the life of the country.  I do not at all agree.  I am not at all sure it will work, but surely when it is put before us in the spirit in which it has been, we ought to hope for its success and to encourage it, as long as it is on the basis of complete freedom.</P>
      <P>I did not originally intend to intervene in this debate, but I do so because it seems to me that the idea put before us has definite value, and I would not like it to go out from this House that there was not a great deal of sympathy for it even, although, in the form in which the motion was phrased, we could not possibly pass it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>In this motion and the two amendments before the House, I would like to deal first of all with Senator Counihan's suggestion that experimental farms should be established. The Senator pointed out that he put down this motion as a sort of counterblast to destroy the thunder of Senator Burke.  The only thing I want to say about it is, surely we have enough of that particular experiment and demonstration farm already. Unless it was going to be a demonstration farm run by a farmer on the lines whereby a certain amount of capital would be given to a particular farmer, and he would be given a certain sort <Col N="741" /> of directive or advice from the Department of Agriculture, or its technicians, that would enable individual farmers in every county, or if you like in every parish, to benefit by it, I do not see how it could be effective.  We are hearing something about the parish plan but a man would require to be given enough capital to enable him to set an actual headline.  That would be the only type of experimental farm I would favour, because so long as you have an experimental farm where the State is prepared to put in money without limit, the average agriculturist will say that it is not being seriously run as a farm.</P>
      <P>I think I could give the same answer to the amendment in the name of Senator O'Dwyer, but at any rate it must be admitted that in Senator O'Dwyer's case, it was put down seriously and not as a manæuvre.  It seems from his attitude that Senator Counihan saw something in Senator Burke's motion that aimed at the ownership and that it was in his mind that it was the first wedge in the right of private ownership.  On the motion, I might say I am in agreement with Senator Douglas, but I think there was a technique used by some members of this House, possibly following an example set by a higher level.  The standard of debate is a matter of opinion and it seemed to me that it followed the well understood pattern of the old days of the Irish Parliamentary Party on the principle that if you ridicule a thing whether it is right or wrong you will succeed in killing it.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the motion.  Senator O'Farrell commenced his remarks by saying that he had no personal animosity to Senator Burke and it then ran through my mind that while it was not personal animosity, it was this old question of division in a Party which we can understand, when we realise that there are two Labour Parties.  I came to the conclusion that was the cause of it, and I saw in this afternoon's paper some statement that something was to be done to bring about unity in trade unions.  It is not my business to criticise that, beyond saying that unity is desirable in any movement, but, in this case, it will not be helped by the sort of thing we had from Senator O'Farrell, by way of criticism of a motion put down by one of his fellows.</P>
      <P>My principal objection to the motion is this: I agree with the Minister when he referred to the fact that many of our people have beliefs deeply rooted in the three Fs&mdash;free sale, fair rent and fixity of tenure.  That is quite true, and I am sure that anyone who understands the rural people of any part of Ireland will agree that any of them worth their salt do make an effort to hold on to their land, and while many of them may not always use it as scientifically as Senator Burke would like, still they have a measure of independence and a spiritual value in that independence that it would be a pity to take away from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land League did something, surely, for this country.  While I agree totally with the outlook that it would be a pity to destroy that right of private ownership or of pride in the individual ownership of land, I have often thought of the matter when I had opportunities of seeing conditions in agriculture outside this country, where they have no fixity of tenure. Passing on the train through England, where they have the landlord system, you can see the effect of it in the fields.  The landlord stipulates, I believe, that the farmer-tenant must keep the hedges properly and see that the drains are maintained in good order, and I have often wondered <Col N="743" /> whether it is not one bad effect of this fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent that farmers in this country who have absolute ownership will let the briars grow out in the field.  It is a pity that that should be so.  The farmers in England would not do it under their system of land tenancy, but even if our farmers let the briars grow out in the fields, it is a grand thing that they have the right to do it and I would be the last to try to stop them from letting the briars grow out in the fields if they want to do it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the motion was put down seriously and honestly by Senator Burke and I do not think that any attention should be paid to statements striving to create the implication that Senator Burke was a Communist or a border-line case.  Those implications went too far.  At the present time, there is so much money being spent on propaganda all over the world that the day is long gone when by calling a man a Communist you simply meant that he believes in communal ownership. If a man is dubbed a Communist or a border-line case, it means that he is out to overthrow a particular system of government as we understand it in Western Europe, and to establish in its place a system whereby you have dictatorship in the name of democracy.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there was a definite ground in the case of Senator Burke for making any uncharitable remarks.  I do not think there was any definite reason for that criticism in the case of Senator Burke because he was applying in practice a simple system of communal effort.  I would not say it was communal ownership.  I tried to intervene in the early stages of the debate&mdash;the Chair decided I would not be allowed to do so&mdash;to inquire who was the vested owner of this land and who was responsible for such services as insurance and whether the workers were self-insured or whether they paid into a fund for the purpose.  I was honestly and genuinely looking for information and I suggest to Senator Burke that he might reply to these points.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> The fundamental objection I have to the system is that, even if it were much more profitable than the system of individual ownership, there are greater things in this world than efficiency. The only claim made for it is that it seems to work efficiently, but I am sure that Senator Burke will agree that there are certain other values. His case was that he was able to pay the farm wage, plus certain other services. It amounted, I think, to about 9/- a week in excess of the agricultural wage.  The Senator also mentioned something about the right to own one cow or to have the use of one cow.  I do not know whether that was costed in the extra 9/- or not, but surely the Senator will agree with me that there are many people living on smaller farms&mdash;he gave the example of a farm of so many acres employing seven men&mdash;and more people living there is better conditions.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in County Leitrim, where there is an average poor law valuation of less than £10, living as well and, as I say, much better, than the men to whom he refers.  I do not think it is a system our people would adopt, because, in the majority of cases, our people who are farmers will make an effort to hold on to the land, no matter what happens.  That is perhaps due to our past history and to the fight our people had to make to stay on the land.  Because of the hardships then endured, it is not easy for them to surrender a right won after such a fight in favour of a system of co-operative farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> Senator Baxter was right when he said it was rather an experiment with human nature, because it is not in human nature to co-operate to that degree.  If this system were applied generally, we would have a position in which the vested owners of farms would alienate that ownership to a group.  Any owner doing that would realise that he was alienating his right of ownership and would naturally begin to inquire in his mind whether he was doing justice to himself and his family.  I do not think it would be a practical proposition, and it would be very wrong for the State to interfere at all in such an experiment.  There is no law to prevent any group of people trying it out.  Senator Burke needed no support from the Government and if any other group of people in Galway, Kerry, Cork or Donegal want to do so, there is nothing to prevent them and nothing will be done by the Legislature to prevent them; but it is very wrong to suggest that, because this system is barely as successful as the operations of individual farmers on their own farms, land for the relief of congestion should be used to promote this system.  Senator Burke will know that many of our people, particularly in the west, are land hungry and he knows the race there is, when estates are to be divided by the Land Commission, by small holders to get parcels of land in the hope of making their farms more economic and it therefore would be very wrong for this House to decide that even experiments should be made with land acquired by the Land Commission on the basis of Senator Burke's idea.</P>
    <P>While it is a grand thing that somebody has experimented as he has, I do not think it would be a success.  It is not such a crashing success as to warrant the House asking the Land Commission to experiment in this fashion with land which is designed for the relief of congestion or the creation of new farms in congested districts.  It has not been such a crashing success as to justify the Land Commission in making any such experiment. I am prepared to concede that Senator Burke thought he was right and that he put down his motion and made his case quite sincerely and <Col N="746" /> that is why I thought the method of trying to destroy it by ridicule should not be adopted.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply used the motion to set out what he proposed to do as an alternative and he discussed the land rehabilitation project and the parish plan.  If I heard him correctly, he claimed to be successful and suggested that the fact that he was successful, or would be successful, seemed to be a source of anything but joy to people on his right.  The only people to whom he seemed to refer were Senator O'Dwyer and myself. Senator O'Dwyer put down an amendment and everybody who knows him will know that he put it down in all sincerity and that he discussed the matter with all sincerity.  It was a pity the Minister should bring political venom in regarding everything in his Department.  Every farmer here is prepared to wish the Minister success in so far as they believe him right and his land rehabilitation right.  I wish him success, but that does not mean that I alienate my right of criticism. Because anyone seems to criticise him or hold a different angle on a particular matter, he regards it as hostility.  He is over two years in power in the Department of Agriculture. He has talked a lot about land rehabilitation and now we are hearing about the parish plan.</P>

I claim that the land rehabilitation which he seems to think Senator O'Dwyer or myself would be hostile to is nothing more than a development of the Farm Improvements Scheme which is in operation and is well and truly tried. I claim that that scheme, just like the parish plan to which the Minister referred yesterday evening, was first advocated in County Leitrim&mdash;and I think it was there the Minister got the idea&mdash;by the late Fr. Confrey, a well-known figure, who was thought to be behind time but actually was before his time.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with the motion so far as Senator Burke is concerned. I am not in favour of it, as if it were sponsored by the State it would tend to upset the right of individual ownership, which should be safeguarded, and people would resent such interference.  It would be desirable to have better co-operation in agriculture. That could be got by more public-spirited co-operation in local communities for the ownership and management of machinery and in other <Col N="748" /> services which could be organised in local areas.</P>
      <P>Many of the co-operative societies have become big businesses and it is doubtful if they have not slightly deviated from the idea of co-operation, in so far as they are run on big business lines, with the possible difference that they are not liable for taxation in the same way as a public or private company.  The real answer to co-operative farming is for the co-operative societies to provide more facilities for their members and for the community with which they are doing business. It is only on those lines that there can be better co-operation.  I do not think it can be achieved along the lines in Senator Burke's motion.</P>

      <P>I do not think it redounds to the credit of this House that Senator Burke, a man who has set an example that has been admired by thousands, should be subjected to the vituperation and ill-informed criticism to which he has been subjected since the beginning of this debate.  Senator Burke can console himself with the fact that, measured by any standard of values, human or spiritual, he will compare very favourably with the best of his critics.  The Minister himself set a rather bad example.  He accused Senator Counihan of living in the days of Queen Anne, but I think it could be said that the Minister himself seems to live in the days of Isaac Butt.  What has Senator Burke proposed?  In the course of his elaboration of the motion, he suggested that where two or more farmers living adjacent to each other were desirous of working their farms co-operatively, they should be encouraged and facilitated.  It is all right to market co-operatively, it is perfectly good business to buy co-operatively and to act co-operatively in other respects, but to work two or three farms co-operatively is supposed to be immoral and communistic.  I never heard such humbug.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, there is no statement of the kind that has been made by Senator J.T. O'Farrell in the motion.  The motion <Col N="749" /> asks &ldquo;that the Government should encourage and facilitate the establishment of a small number of co-operative farms&rdquo;.

      <P>He gave six incontestable examples of improvements that could be effected by this method. What is wrong, revolutionary or antisocial about a motion of this kind?  One would imagine, listening to the Minister, that he had never heard where voluntary co-operation had succeeded. He seems to be like the Orange politician, Colonel Saunders, to whom he referred, who was always asleep except when Irish Home Rule arose. He seems to have been asleep and unaware of world progress in this matter. If Deputy Burke had suggested free love, the abolition of religion or the liquidation of everyone who opposed him, he could not have caused such <Col N="750" /> horror as the Minister and some members of the House simulated.</P>
      <P>It was melodramatic to talk in this connection about the fight the farmers of Ireland made for their land.  One would imagine that we did not know the history of Ireland.  We all know it. Surely that does not mean that it is criminal to suggest that farmers, in order to get more out of the land, should act co-operatively and that the State might give them asistance in that connection.  We give the farmers £4,000,000 a year by way of relief of rates.  We are to spend £40,000,000 on a land project to make the land richer and more fertile.  Apparently, it is all right and moral to give such help to each individual farmer but highly immoral to give it to three or four working together, in which case, it would appear, Communism of the worst type is brought into operation.</P>
      <P>What is the Senator's proposal but a development of Muintir na Tire and the parish plan and the various other things that encourage farmers to co-operate in their efforts and to be more scientific?</P>
      <P>I do not like the attitude of the Minister, who often assumes pitying contempt for anybody who puts up a point of view with which he does not agree. We are not children and do not like to be treated as such.  The proposer of this resolution was not treated fairly or decently in respect to it.  If the attitude displayed by the Minister represents his real attitude towards this idea, I am afraid we will not get the value we should get in return for the millions of pounds that are to be spent on the land.  I wonder what the representatives of E.C.A. would say if they saw the Minister holding up his hands in holy horror at the very suggestion of co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I lived on a farm until I was 20 years of age, and I say that one of the misfortunes of farmers has been exaggerated individualism.  It is bred in the farmer that he is an individual. Individualism is a fine characteristic if it is not carried to extremes.  The farmer has never combined with his fellow-farmer either in agriculture or politics. <Col N="751" /> The result is that he has been exploited by politicians of every Party and has not been able to take advantage to the fullest extent of modern labour-saving devices that would make his life easier and enable him to get more out of the land.  He reaches out for doles and concessions of all kinds which he could reject with contempt if he exploited his resources fully.</P>
    <P>We have broken the land of Ireland into entirely uneconomic patches.  No single piece of land that is allotted by the Land Commission is capable of keeping an average family in comfort. The farmer on that land is not in a position to purchase modern machinery.  He could only procure such machinery by joining in co-operation with his neighbours for the purpose of purchasing expensive machinery which would enable him and his neighbours to cultivate the land and to organise rotation of crops.  That is the type of development that the motion suggests.  Nobody wants to take a man's land from him.  It is perfectly ridiculous to suggest such a thing.</P>
    <P>If I am rightly informed, the men who were working on the co-operative farm in Tuam were ordinary agricultural labourers whom Senator Burke would have employed in the ordinary way, and would have paid a day's wages when they worked and then sent them to look after their own affairs and to do the best they could and let them remain idle when he did not require their services.  Instead of that, he brought them in on his land, built houses for all of them, gave them a voice in the running and management of the farm.  We hear a lot in recent times about giving the worker a share in the management of industry.  That is regarded by many employers as absolutely revolutionary but it is regarded by many Governments and reformers as being exceedingly desirable because of the sense of responsibility which it develops and because it places at the disposal of the employer the genius that is often found latent in a man in a humble position.  It gives the worker greater interest in life and makes him feel that he is not merely a <Col N="752" /> wage slave, that his opinion is valued and that, if he has any good ideas, they can be exploited to his own and his employer's advantage.</P>
    <P>That is precisely the idea that Senator Burke has carried out in full measure.  He has given these men comfortable homes.  He has formed them into a management committee where he has only one vote, the same as they. They meet periodically to decide in regard to various operations on the farm. He makes himself an allowance for his work as he does for his men.  Allowance is made for seeds, manures and so on and, at the end of the season, the accounts are made up and the profits are divided in equal measure amongst all.  I know for a positive fact that a man who could live luxuriously lives in the humblest farm and gives the best example of Christianity.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to take part in the debate but, on the question of farming, a woman ought to be heard because the important part that women play in farming is always overlooked.  From my reading of the motion and having listened to Senator Burke's exposition, it seems to me that the suggestion is that the experiment that has been made at Toghermore should be extended to other parts of Ireland, with Government assistance. To my mind, there are two difficulties in that.  The success of the experiment at Toghermore depended entirely on the character and on the work of Senator Burke himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> I would like to pay tribute to Senator Burke.  I have great admiration and respect for him.  I do not like to say anything that would make him blush but, certainly, he gave a wonderful example to the people of his class and I think we ought to appreciate that. The success of the experiment depended, to my mind, on Senator Burke. The trouble is that there are not many Senator Burkes and therefore there is not much hope of the success which his experiment has attained in places where there are not Senator Burkes. We are all the poorer because Senator Burke is unique.  He has brought the idea of the Government into it, but the success of his profit and loss sharing experiment depended on the fact that the Government had not a single thing to do with it&mdash;it was all his initiative and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I think the people who talked about wages in connection with the experiment did not do Senator Burke justice. He gave people what was more than money&mdash;homes.  At this time when so many people are homeless to possess a home and house is wealth untold and Senator Burke gave them homes and houses.  I am very glad of the opportunity of paying a tribute to him, but at the same time I could not vote for or support the motion because I think it is up against something very fundamental in our Irish nature, the feeling of individual ownership of land.  The individual ownership of land does not exclude co-operation.  Co-operation has always been a part of our life.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was a young girl we used send word to the people that we were cutting turf on the mountain and all the farmers on the mountainside would each bring down a cart of turf.  We would have dinners and teas going all day long and in the evening a dance in the barn.  That was co-operation, grand co-operation.  I think that the extension of that form of excellent co-operation is most essential to the development of scientific farming.  No matter how much one feels depressed at the present aspect of things in Ireland, if movements like the young farmers clubs, Macre na Feirme, and the Irish Countrywomen's <Col N="754" /> Association spread you can have heart and hope.</P>
    <P>One of the things we must cherish is the farmhouse, the individual ownership of the farm and the feeling for the farm, the feeling that the family works as a unit on the farm and the special part the woman of the house, the farmer's wife, must play.  I have often said that what we need is a bigger and better supply of farmers' wives, well trained women who bring all that a woman can bring to the farms.  They have done it instinctively and the farmhouses have preserved the ancestral virtues such as hard work, economy and those things on which the future of our nation depends.  We look around and see people who only spend their time looking at the clock to see when their work will be finished.  They have no pride in their work and spend their nights dancing, smoking, doing foolish things and making amusement one of the principal things in life. They do not realise that the only happiness we have in life is work; we must find happiness in work or not at all. People who work on farms have preserved these virtues and it would be a sad thing if that were lost, in fact, I think it would be fatal to our country.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who were brought up in the Land League days.  In fact I might claim that I am perhaps the only person in Ireland to be a member of the Ladies' Land League.  I was about three years old at the time&mdash;everybody knows my age so I do not mind saying it.  My father was very ardent in the Land League.  One of my recollections is&mdash;and it was one of the glories of the Land League&mdash;that the Catholics of Derry and the Protestants fought together. Orangemen did not exist in that part of the country.  They were all good friends and comrades.  There was a Land League hut on our ground so we were brought up in the Land League tradition.  Anna Parnell stayed in our house and my mother was President of the local branch of the Ladies' Land League.  They gave me a doll to keep me quite because I wanted to intervene in the debate.  It is rather amusing to think that my mother had been a pupil of the Sacred Heart Convent in <Col N="755" /> Armagh and the nuns had very old fashioned ideas about the woman's part.  She was supposed to keep in the kitchen and the nursery and when they heard that my mother was in politics the Reverend Mother sent her a most indignant letter.  I wonder what the Reverend Mother would have thought if she knew that I would be in the Seanad talking on behalf of the women of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have had a most useful discussion and those who criticised Senator Burke enlivened the debate.  I am very glad <Col N="756" /> of the opportunity of paying a tribute to Senator Burke even though I could not possibly support the motion.</P>
