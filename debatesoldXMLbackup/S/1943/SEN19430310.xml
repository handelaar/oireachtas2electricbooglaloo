    <P>Amendment No. 1.&mdash;By the deletion of paragraph (a) of the proposed <Col N="1535" /> new sub-section (1) and the substitution therefor of the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on any week-day&mdash;</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 2&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) by the deletion from the proposed new paragraph (a) of the words &ldquo;if such premises are situate in a county borough, between the hours of nine o'clock and ten o'clock in the morning on week-days, or, if such premises are not situate in a county borough&rdquo;, and</P>

      <P>I move that the Seanad do agree to the amendment made by the Dáil to Seanad amendment No. 1. I appeal to Senators to accept it, as in my opinion no useful purpose can be served by further opposition.  As was pointed out in the Dáil, a very peculiar situation would arise through having a differentiation in the hours in the boroughs and the outside areas. A man could be put out of a public house a yard at one side of the boundary at 10 o'clock, and he could go straight into a public house a yard at the other side and remain drinking there until 10.30.  In order to facilitate the Gárda authorities, and for various other reasons, I think we should accept the amendment made by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I want to oppose the amendment made by the Dáil.  Either Senators were in earnest or otherwise when they were discussing this Bill, and, having deliberately made up their minds that this was a necessary amendment to the Bill, I think they can hardly stultify themselves now and accept the amendment put in by the Dáil.  Therefore, I am opposed to the amendment, and I should like to hear the Minister on this matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not a great deal to say.  I have spoken so much on this Intoxicating Liquor Bill generally that I am heartily sick of it.  I can say this much&mdash;that the whole of the Seanad amendment has not been rejected. The Dáil has accepted one part of it, that is that there will be a difference of half an hour in the closing hour in summer time and winter time.  As the Bill originally came from the Dáil the hour was 10.30 all the year round.  The Seanad decided to have 10.30 in the country during summer and 10 o'clock during winter, and the Dáil has accepted the suggestion of the Seanad in so far as that is concerned&mdash;they propose to <Col N="1537" /> have it 10.30 both in the country and the boroughs, and 10 o'clock in the winter, and to that extent they have agreed with the Seanad.</P>
      <P>When I introduced the Seanad amendments in the Dáil, I said I proposed to accept them.  I made no case for them, because I did not feel that they were desirable amendments, and I was in the dilemma of recommending something with which I myself was not really in sympathy.  I saw trouble in the half-hour difference between the boroughs and the country.  I did suggest to the Dáil, however, that they ought to accept the amendments. There was a short debate in which five or six speakers on each side joined, and most of them objected very strongly to the change.  I agreed that on balance they were right, that it would be better to have uniformity, especially as we were going to revert to 10 o'clock in the winter time.  I think that is all I can say on the question of uniformity, but there was another aspect which appealed to me, and one of the Deputies reminded me of it.  It was a point I made rather strongly during the passage of the Bill through both Houses&mdash;the lesser the gap between the closing time in the evening for the ordinary trader and the <i>bona fide</i> trader, the better, because there would be less inclination for people to go out.  That is what reconciled me in the first instance to the proposal.</P>
      <P>I thought that one and a half hours difference would be suitable from that point of view.  I told the Dáil of the opinion of the Seanad, that the House by 24 votes to 12 was in favour of the change.  Nevertheless, my own view was that it was better to have uniformity at 10.30 in the summer on account of the gap between the two types of houses.  For that reason, I said I was prepared to accept it.  The Dáil, by an overwhelming majority&mdash;there were only about seven members in favour of the Seanad amendment&mdash; accepted the amendment which was proposed by members of different Parties.  I hope the Seanad will agree with the Dáil, because I do not think it will be worth while fighting on the matter at all.</P>

      <P>I think it is a great pity that more consideration was not given to the problem of Saturday night in large cities.  The Bill will inflict a distinct hardship on a body of young and growing men on Saturday nights. Closing at 10 o'clock would mean that they would have an opportunity of a walk in the fresh air after leaving what is very often an unhealthy, or, at least, a vitiated atmosphere.  Now, they will have no opportunity, and it will be at least 11 o'clock or a quarter to twelve before they are able to leave the shops after they have prepared the utensils for use on the following day.  It is a great hardship when the great body of workers are out enjoying themselves in the fresh air in the summer time, that those men are confined to the environment and atmosphere I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>Many of those men have fallen into ill-health, and the casualties in that way are largely attributable to Saturday night working in the city.  This situation will continue if the Bill passes in its present form.  That, in my view, is a great pity, but I do not know if any useful purpose will be served by raising the matter now. However, I urge that some consideration should be given in respect of that particular night.  According to the Bill, closing time will now be 10.30 on Saturday night, and if it is not too late that proposal should be reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What strikes me about this question is that the Bill got very fair consideration.  The Dáil <Col N="1539" /> accepted our amendments in connection with Sunday opening and closing.  Whether or not we were wise in these amendments, only practice and experience will show.  With regard to closing hours on weekdays in the country, a case could be made which would seem quite convincing from the point of view of the person living in Dublin, that in summer time, in particular, publichouses should be open until 10.30.  We inserted that provision.  The Dáil made a change which involved uniformity, that is to say, the Bill as it left the Dáil provided that public houses should be closed at 10 o'clock in the winter and 10.30 in the summer, both in the county boroughs and outside them.  I am not in agreement with a 10.30 closing hour for Dublin.  I think 10 o'clock is a reasonable closing hour from every point of view, including that of the assistants, but if we were to adhere to our amendment at the present time, we could do nothing except to have a conference with the Dáil.  If we were to have a conference with the Dáil, it seems to me, seeing that they have accepted practically all that we suggested, we could not refrain from giving to the Dáil what they ask in this amendment apart from its merits.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that if we were to have a conference with the Dáil on the two amendments this would be a very small thing to give them for the acceptance of our position generally. I do not think therefore that it would be, so to speak, good practice for us to differ with them on this particular point.  If a suggestion were made for a conference and the figures the Minister has just given were shown to us, I do not think that, as reasonable people, we could insist on this one point.  Therefore, though I prefer a Dublin closing hour of 10 o'clock all the year round, I am inclined to agree to the amendment of the Dáil on the grounds that if we did have a conference about it we could hardly be so unreasonable as to hold up the Bill on this one point.</P>

      <P>It seems extraordinary that in the absence of any public demand for this extra half-hour, the Dáil should reverse a reasonable amendment sent to them by the Seanad.  If there were a public demand for a 10.30 closing, we could understand the attitude of the Dáil.  Likewise if the times were normal one could understand the attitude of the Dáil but the times are not normal. The times are most abnormal in regard to transport and every other matter in relation to the consumption of alcoholic liquor.  Supplies are short, transport is limited and is becoming more limited.  Having regard to all these factors which go conclusively to show that there is no public demand for this extension of the hour, it is most unreasonable that the Dáil should not adopt the amendment sent to them by the Seanad.  We can only, I suppose, protest against the attitude of the Dáil. There does not seem to be any possibility of re-enforcing the decision we have already adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes said that nothing would be gained by a conference with the Dáil on this matter.  Perhaps nothing is to be gained by a conference, but in view of the fact that there is no public demand for this extension, and that very probably the assistants <Col N="1541" /> will be standing idle behind their counters until this late hour, and that they will have to get home by means other than by public conveyances why impose these hardships on them at this particular time?  If a conference would in any way bring about a measure of agreement between the two Houses, it might be worth while asking for the conference although Senator Hayes, who has very great experience in these matters, seems to think that nothing could be gained by a conference.  The position now is that the extended hour will be put into operation.  I suppose the Seanad having made its protest clear&mdash;at least those of us on these benches have made our position definitely clear&mdash;nothing more can be done about it.  We do think it is a shame, having regard to the abnormal conditions of the times, that the amendment we sent to the Dáil was not accepted by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting to find that there has been such a free expression of opinion in connection with this Bill.  Everybody appears to have approached it with an open mind. I spoke in favour of a 10 o'clock closing hour when the Bill was last before the Seanad and I see no reason since to alter my views.  I speak chiefly for the City of Dublin.  Shops throughout the city have had to close early in order to economise artificial light.  That is one of the factors that weighs with me in considering this amendment. Furthermore, the grocers' assistants are a section of the community who are entitled to as much consideration as any other section.  We are all aware that transport facilities in Dublin are now very limited and that the buses cease to operate at 9.30 p.m. even in the city.  The city has extended greatly during the past ten years. Houses have been erected in the remote suburbs.  If a grocer's assistant, for instance, had to travel from the North Strand out to Drimnagh, it would be a very long journey to undertake after 9.30 p.m. when there are no transport facilities.  In the old days the grocers' assistants had very long hours.  They gained certain concessions through their organisation and, <Col N="1542" /> in my opinion, it would be very hard lines now if they had to sacrifice any of these concessions.  In my view a 10 o'clock closing hour would be more suitable for everybody and would not inflict hardship on anybody.</P>

      <P>The Seanad can congratulate itself on having considered this Bill, when it came before the House, in the light of the public interest.  Sectional interests, it is true, were pressed, but on the whole they were not accepted.  The Bill was considered in the light of what was best for the greatest number.  I think even at this hour we ought to explain our attitude.  It is very unfortunate that as the result of legislation which was meant to promote temperance, we should be asked at this late hour to grant an extra hour for drinking on Saturday night&mdash;a closing hour of 10.30 p.m. instead of 9.30 p.m.  It is a most dangerous hour, it is the hour when the ordinary, decent working man is most subject to temptation.  It is not these <i>bona fide</i> people I am thinking of; they want to carouse, and we think too much of them, perhaps.  I am thinking of the ordinary working man; whom we would like to save from that temptation, which comes very strongly between 9.30 and 10.30, when the work of the week is over, and when he has money in his pocket and some sense of freedom.  I regret that the closing hour was not kept at 9.30.  However, we decided on 10 o'clock, and now we are asked to go to 10.30 p.m., and I am opposed to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard no new facts adduced which would justify our changing our minds on this matter. The Seanad devoted a good deal of time on the last occasion to the consideration of this case, which Senators marked by their approval or disapproval, as the case may be, in a very strong fashion.  The most extraordinary thing about these hours, which are being asked for by the Dáil, is that no one in the whole country&mdash;with the exception of the Dáil&mdash;appears to want them.  I would really like to know at whose instance the proposition of these extra hours or half hours was initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have gone through the country and <Col N="1543" /> have a pretty fair knowledge of it, pace the remark of a gentleman&mdash;a Deputy in another place &mdash; who said a week or two ago that Senators were out of touch, that they were retired, leisured and cultured individuals, and apparently innocent.  I am not surprised that Senators smile at that.  If the House would forgive a little egoism, I would treat them to it.  It so happens that I live, for my pains, within a mile of a very prosperous town in the south-east of Ireland.  It also happens that there is not a Deputy within fourteen miles of it, and it so happens that occasionally I am compelled, by the accident of geography, to do a Deputy's work.  People come when they want to push or pull wires to get them out of difficulties and to do the thousand and one things that we are bound to do, in all honour and conscience, for those who elect us. After all, the duty of a Senator or of a Deputy is not merely to record a vote.  If that were so, existence would be very easy indeed.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that I come into contact with the people as much as any other man in Ireland, and I resent the imputation&mdash;whether couched in the spirit of cynical levity or whether it was, as I suspect, mere verbal tripe &mdash;that Senators are any less or any more divorced than Deputies from the public in general.  It is only fair to say that, and to make that clear, for the honour of this House.  I have no objection to tripe at all but, when it comes to the verbal form, I detest it. It so happens that, in the course of my peregrinations through the country, I asked several people their views on these proposed extra hours.  That brings me back to the point I have been trying to elucidate.  Why on earth did the Dáil decide to have these extra hours?  They cannot have been trying to convenience the common people in this instance.</P>
    <P>I took five or six people&mdash;a commercial traveller, and none of them are pussyfoots, two publicans, an agricultural worker and a town worker&mdash;and I asked them casually, not leading them up the garden path, whether they were in favour of the extra hour which was being proposed, or what <Col N="1544" /> they thought of it.  Every one of them disclaimed the idea of desiring it in the slightest.  Therefore, in this case, we are asked to give way to the Dáil and to submit to an imaginary demand, to pay tribute to an unknown body of opinion; we are asked to grant a concession that no one has asked for.  I cannot understand how the units of the Dáil, severally or collectively, could have asked for these hours, when there is no demand for them.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with a <i>coup d'état.</i> We are told that, if we do not pass this, it will be passed in spite of us. The suggestion is slightly minatory. Our recommendations were reasoned, well thought out and debated here. The only thing I regret is the difficulty in which this would put the Minister, who has been, then and now, so disarming in his manner that it is simply impossible to think of putting him in a difficulty.  However, if there be a division on this&mdash;I am not inviting the question as to whether there will be or not&mdash;I would consider it my duty to vote against the Dáil.  It may be said that we are putting the Dáil in an awkward position, but what is our existence if it be one of pure acquiescence in everything that comes from the Lower House?  What precisely is the <i>raison d'étre</i> of our existence? I suggest that not only has there been no public demand but that, if we were to take a referendum on this matter&mdash;though that would be like using a steam hammer to crush a butterfly&mdash;these extra hours would not be asked for by one-tenth of the people.</P>
    <P>We are told that, in the case of houses on the border, this is intended to obviate a certain difficulty that may occur.  It is said that the hard case makes very bad law, and I do not know whether the &ldquo;drunks&rdquo; on the border would justify this one or not. As I have said already, no facts have been adduced here which would justify our stultifying ourselves on this point. Much has been made of the difficulties of the licensed trade assistants.  On the last day, I spoke&mdash;long, and, I hope, to the point&mdash;on these hardships; but these hardships alone would not <Col N="1545" /> make a case against this extra hour. The point is, that having discussed this calmly and at length, and having given every possible consideration to it, we put forward an ordered and reasoned amendment.  The Dáil now sends it back, and says that it expects us to acquiesce calmly in our subsidence, if not in our extinction.  It is hardly fair to expect us to do that; this House must have some dignity left.  People may say on this or that point that we should give way; but we may be faced at some time in the future with something which would threaten the Seanad's existence; and if we cannot exert ourselves to the point of carrying on our freedom, I still think we should take up a position consistent at least with the dignity of this House.</P>

      <P>My views are practically the same as those of the last two speakers as far as the principle is concerned, but I am somewhat inclined to agree with Senator Hayes that it is not worth while holding up the Bill for this.  I have probably more experience than the last two speakers, though it is not a thing to shout about, of public houses and hotels.  I say from a temperance point of view it would not matter a row of pins whether you keep them open for this half hour or not.  There is another point I would like to have cleared up. I got the impression that the possibility is as far as the hours are concerned that they may not be put into effect until after the emergency.  I mean that another Minister may intervene. Is that not so?</P>

      <P>I think this problem may be divided into two parts.  Probably the Minister and his advisers are quite justified in saying that in the other county boroughs if you had a 10 o'clock closing hour a man might walk out 100 yards or a mile and get a drink, but I do not think the same <Col N="1546" /> applies in Dublin.  In Dublin it is a different problem because the boundaries stretch very far and there would be a very long distance to go.  I am wondering whether we could get agreement as far as the county boroughs are concerned so that the same hours should be kept, and in the case of Dublin remain at 10 o'clock.  I do not know whether that is possible. While I agree with Senator Kehoe that we should not take everything that the other House says if we do not agree with it, at the same time I would rather have some bigger problem to have a row about.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Senator Kehoe has said.  The amendment has been given very careful consideration by the Seanad, and the Bill was debated section by section.  After all, half an hour is a great deal of time to be allowed for drinking, and there is another matter which I am sure decided the Seanad.  It was said that the 10 o'clock hour had been in force since 1927.  Undoubtedly the previous Government had reason for that decision seeing that during the intervening period, and during the period of summer time, there had been no demand for a change in these hours. There seems to be no necessity for an extension to 10.30.  I agree that the Seanad was right in restoring the hour to 10 o'clock.  One of the arguments has been that there will be different hours on different sides of the border line.  That would be a small matter, and would arise only in very few circumstances where there would be public houses on each side of the border, and consequently need not be taken into account.  It has been said that we should agree with the Dáil amendment, because we have no power to alter the decision, and will be holding up the Bill.  That is one reason why we should adhere to our decision, because it would be well to demonstrate to the country the utility of the Second Chamber.</P>

'Na theannta san sílim gur fearr gan moill a chur ar an mBille.  I think in all the circumstances that it would be wise to accept the proposal made by Senator Quirke that the Seanad agree to this amendment. I agree with the Senator who said that there was no demand from any quarter as far as I know for opening until 10.30 in the City of Dublin, but we were faced with the position here that what we thought to be very fair and reasonable demands were made on behalf of farm workers in the rural areas, suggesting that the closing hour there should be at 10.30.  That amendment was accepted and with it there was this further demand for opening in the City of Dublin until 10.30.  I agree with the Senator who said that there is a very decided grievance on the part of workers employed by licensed vintners. It is a very great strain on them to have to remain on the premises till 10.30.  The injustice is there, but the Cathaoirleach will explain the Seanad's power as regards holding up this Bill.  I believe that the 90 days which we can hold it up will shortly expire.</P>

      <P>If we want to engage in a conflict with the Dáil I think we should select a far more important issue than the present one. It is not fair to state that the Dáil has taken our recommendations lightly.  They have accepted some of our suggestions.  There has to be give and take in matters of this sort.  No one in the Seanad wishes public houses to remain open later than 10 <Col N="1548" /> o'clock, but this is a question on which we should have, as Senator Michael O hAodha said, a certain amount of give and take.  When a clash comes between the Dáil and the Seanad it would be well, if we are going to have a fight, to have it on a major issue. I think that this is not a major issue. In this case, I think that, no matter how strong the feeling may be, we should agree to the recommendation made by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I cannot claim to speak with expert knowledge on this question of the closing hours of public houses.  I never really know when they should be legally opened and when they should be legally closed. I can find out only by asking somebody and, occasionally, I do not get very definite or reliable information.  However that is by the way.  So far as this question of 10 o'clock or 10.30 closing in Dublin is concerned, I must say that I have great sympathy with the demand that 10 o'clock should be the latest hour for closing the public houses.  I look at the matter mainly from the point of view of the health and welfare of the publicans' assistants. After all, these are days of great emergency in which we are all under some kind of social obligation to produce the maximum output in the minimum of time.  I have no doubt that, if the public tried very hard, they could achieve the maximum input of liquor before 10 o'clock and be able to walk home perfectly satisfied, without the additional half-hour that is proposed. It is up to the general public to accommodate their habits and customs to the interests and welfare of the publicans' assistants in this matter.  The whole life of a publican's assistant must be most tantalising. Next to the life of the banker, who is constantly handling money which does not belong to him, the life of the publican's assistant must be the most tantalising. The publican's assistant, who knows the difference between good drink and bad drink, is handling all day some of the good things of this life, while it is extremely unlikely that any customer, at any time of the day or night, will say to him: &ldquo;Will you have one&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> I have the utmost sympathy with the publicans' assistants from the point of view of the tantalising character of their occupation but, still more, from the point of view of the long hours which, under present conditions, they have to work.  It is cruel that they should be compelled to work as late as 10.30, particularly on Saturday evening.  That means that they are not really free to get some fresh air or exercise, or even to go home and go to their beds, until about an hour later.  I think that the interests of the publicans' assistants have been ignored in this matter and I shall regret if we have to agree with the other House on this question of the closing hour.</P>

      <P>I object very strongly to any lengthening of the hours for the sale of intoxicating liquor in any portion of the country.  Senator O Maille, who, I am sorry, has left the Chamber, said that this extension was made to suit farm workers in certain places.  The amount farm workers have to spend on drink is so small that they need not be considered in this connection.  The Senator said that if there was to be a conflict between this House and the other House it should be on a major issue.  I hold that this is a major issue, because it affects the lives of many of our citizens.  Anybody engaged in the insurance business knows that, if a policy is taken out by a person engaged in a public house, he must pay an extra premium because he is not considered as good a life as a person engaged in another occupation.  Whether this Bill can be held up for 90 days or 90 hours, this House should hold it up for the permitted period rather than increase the facilities for the sale of drink.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding that we have had numerous speeches, nothing of much consequence has been advanced in connection with this amendment.  Some extraordinary statements have been made and I am sure that a few more would have been made if Senator Foran had been at liberty to intervene again.  Amongst the most extraordinary statements was that by Senator Kehoe, that there was no demand for this extension of hours from the people of the country. Senator Kehoe should be the last man to say that the Dáil does not represent the country.  When an overwhelming majority of the members of the Dáil are in favour of a certain course, it must be taken for granted in a democratic country that there is some demand from the people of the country.</P>

      <P>I believe that, if the question were left to the people, a majority would vote for the half hour extension.  We are gradually being manoeuvred into a position in which anybody who suggests that the public houses, inside or outside the borough, should remain open for an extra half hour is branded as an advocate of drunkenness.  Nothing of the kind. Those in favour of the extension may be more temperate than the people who advocate the closing down of the public houses.  It is amazing to find a man like Senator Tunney objecting in the strongest possible terms to any extension of hours in any part of the country.  Surely, a man like Senator Tunney who advocates&mdash;rightly&mdash;consideration for the rural workers should take into consideration the fact that it would not be possible for an agricultural worker to get a drink at all if all the public houses were closed at the time which, I think, he suggested&mdash; 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock.  If Senator Tunney, or any other Senator, were to say that there should be no drinking at all, I would give him credit for consistency, but if a man admits that <Col N="1551" /> agricultural workers are entitled to take a drink&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he must follow that out to its logical conclusion, and regulate the hours so as to permit agricultural workers to get a drink.  There is no use in telling the people that they can drink all they wish between 10 o'clock in the morning, and, say, 7 o'clock in the evening.  That would be class legislation, because you would not give the agricultural worker a chance to get a drink.  For that matter, you would not give a chance to the worker in the city to get a drink.  I am not in favour of drunkenness.  Few people would object more strenuously than I do to drunkenness.  I am not a teetotaller, but if there is one thing that annoys me it is a drunken man. But if you admit that a workman in the city has a right to take a drink, you must recognise that it takes him a certain length of time to get home in the evening after work, to wash himself, and to change his clothes.  There is very little time left to him before even 10.30 in which to get drunk.</P>
      <P>To my mind, it is an amazing thing that Labour Senators in particular should come along with that kind of argument.  I have been circularised&mdash; just the same as Labour Senators, I take it&mdash;by the grocers and vintners' assistants to the effect that it is a terrible hardship on them to have to work an extra half-hour at night.  I suppose it is, but, if people go into the catering business, then they must be prepared to meet the consequences and to supply the demands of the public in their own particular trade.  To my mind the extra half-hour does not make all the difference that it is supposed to make according to the statements of certain Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the possible exception of Senator Hayes, I do not think anybody made the slightest reference to one very important matter in connection <Col N="1552" /> with this discussion, and that is the question of the public houses on either side of the boundary.  Some Senator &mdash;I forget who it was&mdash;said that in the City of Dublin people would have a long distance to walk to get from the public house which would have to close at 10 o'clock to the public house which could remain open until 10.30. That depends, absolutely and entirely, on the situation of those public houses.  One of them might be a yard at one side of the borough boundary, and the other a yard at the other side of the boundary.  In fact, it would be quite possible for both to be under the same roof.  I think any reasonable man who will look at the situation which might arise&mdash;people rushing from one public house, a yard or five yards or 100 yards on one side of the boundary, to another public house a few yards on the other side of the boundary&mdash;will agree that there is a big argument in favour of uniformity of hours.</P>
    <P>As far as our powers of delay are concerned, to my mind we would only be making ourselves ridiculous in the eyes of the public by insisting on our powers in this connection.  It is not the first time that the Seanad has insisted on its powers of delay, but I would remind Senators that the people did not take their action very favourably in that connection.  I would suggest in all reasonableness that Senators should take into consideration that the only thing we can do is to put considerable difficulties in the way of the Minister and in the way of the Gárda authorities and of other people by insisting on what some Senator referred to as the upholding of our dignity.  I would appeal to Senators to take the matter more seriously; to realise that certain arguments have been put up since we discussed the matter here on the last day, and to realise the various difficulties which would arise through our holding the matter up still further and refusing to accept the amendment of the Dáil.  I would appeal to Senators on every side of the House to take those matters into consideration and to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This <Col N="1555" /> Bill, notwithstanding its Title, is not a Bill to develop or expand agricultural production except in a very limited sense.  It is a Bill, the purpose of which is to enable local authorities to assist persons who, by reason of their limited resources, would not perhaps be in a position to secure seeds and fertilisers on favourable credit terms from merchants in the normal course of trade.  The Bill in its present form was passed by the House last year, but it is a Bill which runs only for a limited period&mdash;in this case, the period expired on the 31st July, 1942.  The present Bill is to extend the Principal Act for another year and to give to local authorities and county councils the necessary powers to provide credit facilities or to enter into arrangements with merchants to provide credit facilities for the purchase of seeds and fertilisers up to the 1st August next.  The Bill contains a provision which validates the action already taken by county councils in extending these special facilities subsequent to the expiration of the period prescribed in the Act itself.  That was necessary in order to enable those county councils to assist the beneficiaries under the scheme to secure seed wheat for the winter sowing season.</P>

However undesirable it may be that the daily Press should institute a sort of inquiry into such a catastrophe, without indeed being very well equipped to do so in the circumstances, we have no complaint to make of what the public were told in regard to the occurrence, with the exception of the report and a comment in the <i>Irish Times.</i>  We welcome this inquiry.  All intimately or remotely concerned are glad of the Minister's decision to hold an inquiry. We welcome it and all possible facilities will be afforded the tribunal by the interested parties&mdash;the religious Order and the ecclesiastical authorities as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For various reasons, as I have said, through the Press and the Press alone have the public been told anything about this fire.  It is regrettable that an organ of opinion like the <i>Irish Times</i> should have acted and written so unwisely as it did in the circumstances. It caused very considerable pain&mdash;it may be without knowing it. The religious community who are the sufferers to the greatest extent by this catastrophe feel that they were hardly treated fairly.  The Minister's action is welcome because there is an urgent necessity in the first place to prove or disprove some of the things that have been written and circulated <Col N="1557" /> from one end of Ireland to the other and, perhaps, outside our shores as well.  In its editorial on the fire, the <i>Irish Times</i> asked the question: &ldquo;Is it reasonable, in this year of grace, 1943, that more than 80 children should be housed in buildings that lack fire escapes?&rdquo;  That statement was not true.  Other statements were made about the difficulties of gaining access to the buildings, and the facilities placed at the disposal of the people who went into them by the members of the religious community. There were some statements made about the difficulty of procuring keys, but that is really a misrepresentation of the facts.  In great trouble like this, people&mdash;the public and the Press in particular&mdash;should be doubly careful about what they say and write, lest a great injustice may be done. Hence it is that the Minister's decision to set up an inquiry is comforting and encouraging to all interested in the situation that has been created and in the trouble that has come upon the religious community, the town of Cavan and the surrounding neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>I should say that really the truth is that the period from the time when the fire was discovered at approximately 2 o'clock until the last possible rescue of the last child at a quarter to three, was so short, the fire had got such a hold, the difficulties that confronted the few people who had discovered the fire in dividing their energies and in trying to provide more help were so great, their attempts to effect rescues from the room into which they went until it was flooded with smoke, and to get equipment to reach a building four storeys high were so unavailing, and the efforts of the number of people who congregated in that time had to be scattered over so many different activities, that it is little less than miraculous that so much was achieved.</P>

      <P>I do not want to say anything that is not in order.  This may not interest Senator Crosbie, but if Senator Crosbie were a member of our small community down there, about whom so much has been said and written that is not true, Senator Crosbie would feel that there were impelling reasons why we should hold this inquiry.  Much has been said that is untrue.  It has gone out to the public and has not yet been contradicted.  I felt, therefore, that there was justification for giving in this House the reasons why we welcome this inquiry. I think I am within my rights in saying that I do know that in such a catastrophe there are lengths to which decent people will not go.  The charity of silence is often much more powerful and fairer to afflicted people than any desire for work of a spectacular nature on the part of newspapers however attractive it may be from the point of view of circulation, it is undesirable that, when tragedies come upon the country, people should feel an impelling urge to describe them in the most gruesome form and in a manner that may be very unfair. When the commission starts its investigations, I think that a tale of marvellous heroism will be unfolded, and that those who misunderstand at present, because they have not been given the facts, will then see the facts in their proper light.  This will have a restraining influence on people who desire to speak of these things in a manner that should not be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the House does not desire me to go further than that: at least some Senators obviously are not anxious that I should.  I would like the Minister to give some information, of a more explanatory nature than he gave in the Dáil, when he indicated his intention to set up this commission of inquiry, with regard to the personnel of the commission.  The <Col N="1559" /> Minister indicated that it was not a question of trying to fix blame or responsibility, and I am sure that view would be accepted.  We have been thinking about this locally, to find the weaknesses in our defences.  If this inquiry is to result in securing our communities against such occurrences in the future, it must fix responsibility somewhere.  We must discover the causes of the weaknesses and, probably, we will have to distribute the causes over different authorities and even different persons.  Even Government Departments have partial responsibility in this matter and in arranging the personnel the Minister should give consideration to that aspect.  Those who are interested in the holding of the inquiry would be happier if the Minister would recognise that it will be impossible for the commission to make a report without finding faults or weaknesses somewhere. It is quite conceivable that responsibility might be fixed with a certain disregard for the actions or efforts of different parties in the past to provide against occurrences like this.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to indicate that the chairman of the commission would be a lawyer, that someone acquainted with fire-fighting would be another member and that an inspector of his own or of some other Department would be included.  That third person, I gather, would be from some Department in contact with these institutions in the past, and that would make the commission better balanced and its judgment would be more fair. It would make the people concerned at both ends feel that there would be a judicial approach to the questions which the Minister is putting to the commission.  I think it will be revealed that there is nothing to be shirked, nothing which cannot be discussed and that, as the circumstances were, everything that could be done was done.  If there were faults, they are faults which are to be found in a great many of our institutions.  That aspect is very important in regard to the personnel of the commission, and the Minister would be well advised to take it into account, especially in view of the fact <Col N="1560" /> that the Irish public has been given an interpretation of the position which is not true and which has tried sorely the feelings of people who have had a great burden put upon them.  It is a peculiar dispensation of Providence that that burden should be put upon those people.  Wrongs must be righted and it is important that the commission should watch every aspect of the case to ensure that the examination will be regarded as perfectly impartial and that the ultimate decision will be regarded as a judicial decision.</P>

      <P>Of that I have no knowledge.  With regard to what Senator Baxter said I should like to say that I have reason to know that this inquiry will be welcomed by all concerned&mdash;I mean by those who have been most intimately and tragically associated with it.  Perhaps it conveys a wrong impression of my point of view if it is assumed that the commission will not have to fix responsibility. I did say in the other House that I was setting up this commission not so much to find scapegoats as to try to find what were the weaknesses which led to this tragic and regrettable loss of life, and with a view to devising such safeguards as would prevent similar occurrences in the future.  I am not able to announce the personnel of the commission to-day.  There are certain formalities which have to be gone through between the Minister responsible for the setting up of this tribunal and the Department of Finance which have not yet been completed, and I am not yet at liberty to give precise details.  The chairman will be an experienced lawyer.  We have secured the consent of a person experienced in fire fighting and in fire prevention to act on the commission and I hope to secure a lady as third member of the commission.  She will not be an inspector of the Department of Education but she may be a lady who is attached <Col N="1561" /> to another Department.  The third member will in any event be a lady.  I should say we have had to ask for this tribunal because there is no Department which has special powers of holding what is in the nature of a sworn inquiry at which people can be compelled to produce evidence and papers. I have taken the responsibility of setting up this tribunal because not merely the internal regulations which were supposed to be applicable to these buildings come into the question but also the sufficiency of the fire-fighting appliances in the town, and the measures which were taken to deal with the fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the general public and the Seanad to withhold judgment upon these issues until the committee has made its report.  I think that when the personnel of the committee is published it will command confidence.  Certainly it is my desire that the matter will be fully investigated and that whatever issues from the commission should receive general acceptance.  It is particularly my desire that the people in Cavan and those people elsewhere associated with institutions of this kind will realise that it has been a fair and just attempt, not indeed so much to find culprits, nor as I said to make scape goats of people, but to see how these things can occur and, having regard to the fact that there are numerous institutions of this kind throughout the country, to consider whether it is necessary for us considerably to revise the powers which we have for dealing with them, and for ensuring that the precautions which this disaster has shown to be necessary will always be taken.  I do not know that there is anything else I can add.  I have considered the question of putting a lay person on this commission, that is one who is not associated with any Government service, but my difficulty is that I do not want to everweight it.  The industrial inspector, on the one hand, with a knowledge of what is required in industrial undertakings in relation to fire prevention, and the experienced technician on the other hand, will be more or less assessors to guide and direct the chairman of the tribunal in relation to <Col N="1562" /> the investigation, and in consultation with him to make the necessary recommendations. It might be very difficult to find a third person who would be as competent to do that as a person who is already familiar with factory and workshop regulations and the manner in which they are generally applied.  Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that it would be best to put there a person of the type I have mentioned.  However, my mind is not closed, and if suggestions are made to me between now and, say, Friday or Saturday, I will consider them.  I do not want to overload the tribunal.  The custom has been to keep the size of these tribunals as small as possible, down to three persons, indeed sometimes only one person has constituted the tribunal.  As a rule when there are technical questions involved there have been two or three.  If I can I do not want to exceed that number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out previously that unless these Orders were modified or revoked it would entail very grave hardships and loss on pork butchers.  I stated that pork butchers were not so concerned with the reduction of the quota as the interference with the trade which they were carrying on for 100 years.  It was pointed out then that there are several portions of the pig which are not sold fresh by the pork butchers, including the belly, and the practice was that these were sold as pickled pork.  The Minister on that occasion promised to consider granting some concessions to the pork butcher, <Col N="1563" /> but nothing has been done since.  My principal concern in seeking to have these Orders modified is in the interests of the producers and not solely in the interests of pork butchers, but I feel any curtailment of supplies to pork butchers or any loss which they sustain in their trade will eventually affect producers.  The Minister promised concessions, but nothing has been done, and the only conclusion I can come to is that the Pigs and Bacon Commission would not agree to them.  The Minister pointed out that they were a statutory body and quite independent.  I suppose he made representations to them and they did not agree to them.  The Minister says he wants bacon for the rural population, and that pork is only used by residents of cities and towns.  If that is so, why is there such a difference in the prices of lean and heavy pigs?  The Minister says he wants to have bacon for the rural population, but everybody knows that it is the heavy fat bacon that is required there, while the towns require thin, light pigs, which at the present time are making 15/- per cwt. more than heavy pigs.  They are used for rashers, which are required principally in towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the bacon merchants have always influenced, and continue to influence, to their own advantage, the Pigs and Bacon Commission. I believe that the present Orders have been made, to some extent, at the dictates of the bacon merchants, who want to cut out the pork butchers and get more of the pigs for themselves.  Before the Pigs and Bacon Commission was set up, we were always able to export between £3,000,000 worth and £4,000,000 worth of pigs and bacon each year, while still retaining plenty of bacon for ourselves. Since the Pigs and Bacon Commission was set up, the pig trade has been steadily diminishing.  It was declining even before the economic war, when we had plenty of Indian meal for feeding.  We had, according to the Minister, a surplus of our own grain but still our exports were declining until they were down to <Col N="1564" /> £400,000 in 1938&mdash;before the emergency. Now, we are not producing sufficient for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Looking at the results of the work of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, the only sensible conclusion anybody can come to is that it is time to scrap a body which had had results so disastrous for the country.  I ask the Minister to consider the advisability of scrapping the Pigs and Bacon Commission. He could control the price of bacon and pork and let the trade take its natural course.  We cannot be in any worse position than we are, with a decline from £4,000,000 to £400,000 in the value of our exports even before the emergency.  The Minister says that the whole cause of the scarcity of bacon is the want of feeding stuffs. There was no want of feeding stuffs in 1938, when our exports went down in value to £400,000 from £4,000,000.  If the price were economic, we would still have plenty of feeding stuffs in the country for the production of bacon.  But farmers are not going to work for nothing.  They will not produce pigs at an uneconomic price. Unless the Minister is prepared to recommend the Pigs and Bacon Commission to raise the price of pigs, the pig trade will vanish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>These Orders were made with the object of diverting as much of the available material as possible to bacon, rather than pork, because there was a scarcity of bacon, while there was not any scarcity of fresh meat.  It is much easier, too, to substitute beef or mutton for pork than to substitute anything for bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that Senator Counihan knows that, to a large part of the rural population, bacon is the only meat available.  It is difficult for people living many miles from a town or shop to have fresh meat for their table and they depend to a great extent on bacon.  I think that the Pigs and Bacon Commission were quite right in making these Orders.  Before they were made, the percentage of pigs going into pork had risen from about 9, which was the ordinary percentage before the war, to about <Col N="1565" /> 25.  In some cases, the percentage was 30.  Under this regulation it has been brought down to about 15.  There is no doubt that these Orders were justified.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that Senator Counihan should take the line of attacking the Pigs and Bacon Commission for making these Orders because they were, obviously, made to give the rural population a little more of the pigs available and to give the city populations a little less.  The pork butchers were called into the Department of Agriculture before these Orders were made and they agreed that the Orders were all right.  When the Orders were made, evidently, some of the pork butchers saw that they were going to suffer a certain amount of inconvenience.  They made complaints and they were again received in the Department, after the Orders had been made in January.  They were persuaded&mdash;I do not say that they agreed willingly the second time &mdash;that there was no necessity for any concession during the winter months. They were promised that, in the month of April, the position would be reviewed and that, if they could make a case then that there would be any loss of human food by not allowing them to pickle certain parts of the pig, some alteration might be made in the Orders for the summer months. One alteration, which deals with the legs of pigs, has been agreed to already.  The legs can be pickled.  I do not know whether any further concessions will be made in April or not but the matter will be considered.</P>
    <P>I do not see much force in the argument the pork butcher is making that, unless he can pickle some of this meat, it will be lost.  Many of these men are also in the butchering trade, and have been all their lives dealing with sheep.  If a piece of mutton is left over on Saturday evening, I am sure they do not throw it out, nor do they pickle it.  They sell it on the following Monday or Tuesday.</P>
    <P>I think that, in this instance, they are playing on the feelings of the softhearted men, like Senator Counihan. We should not be too lenient with people of that kind.  I am quite sure <Col N="1566" /> that they are better able to look after their own interests than are the farmers who find it difficult at present to get bacon.  Senator Counihan made rather an unwarranted attack on the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  He said that, since that body was set up, things had gone from bad to worse, that, before it was set up we exported £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 worth of bacon and yet had enough for ourselves.  We had enough for ourselves simply because we brought in imports from America.  We sold our good bacon to the British and bought inferior bacon from America and Canada.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not.  But that was the position anyway before those regulations came into operation. Where we have a good article like Irish bacon, I think it is right that we should keep it for ourselves; if we have anything to spare, of course, we can let it go.  That is what was done.  Things did not go from bad to worse at all.  As a matter of fact, things were going from bad to worse for seven or eight years up to the time the Pigs and Bacon Boards were set up, but then things began to improve.  If Senator Counihan will look up the figures I think he will find that, taking the years 1939 and 1940, they were better years for the bacon trade.  The net exports of bacon&mdash;that is exports less imports&mdash;were better during those years than they had been for ten or 12 years previously, that is including the years 1929, 1930 and 1931. I did not think the figure was as low as £400,000 in the year 1938.  Perhaps Senator Counihan is right, but I am surprised to hear that it was as low as that.  I do not think there can be any doubt&mdash;I am surprised that anybody should question the matter&mdash;that the scarcity of bacon is due to the want of feeding stuffs, and not to the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  I think any of us&mdash;Senator Counihan or Senator Baxter, or anyone else&mdash;who produced pigs in the past would be glad to produce more pigs now if we could feed them.</P>

      <P>I do not agree at all that it is controlled at an uneconomic price. I think that is absolutely false.  I say here without any hesitation whatever that, if I could get feeding for pigs, I would feed all the pigs I could lay hands on at the moment, and make them pay.  The proof of that is that there is not a bit of feeding in this country that is not used.  The farmers are feeding all the pigs they can.  They have not got feeding stuffs for more. That is all.  It is very illogical and unfair to blame any organisation like the Pigs and Bacon Commission for the small number of pigs we have.  The same position exists in every country in Europe, as far as I know.  In each of them there is much less bacon than there was pre-war, and surely our Pigs and Bacon Commission had nothing to do with the Danish farmer or the Dutch farmer.</P>

But the only way we can feed pigs is to grow the food ourselves.  We have not succeeded in doing that.  That is the position.  As far as this Motion is concerned, I can assure Senator Counihan that I think the Orders were perfectly justified.  We have been in consultation with the pork butchers, and I think they were fairly satisfied&mdash; I do not say they were absolutely satisfied&mdash;at the last interview, on the understanding that we would meet them again in April and discuss the matter with them before the hot weather comes along.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad requests the Government to introduce proposals for legislation with a view to regulating the opening hours of fairs and markets throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House that this motion is of considerable importance to a large section of the community; otherwise, I would not have agreed to take up the time of the House with it.  In the first place, I would point out that those cattle fairs are always held at a very early hour in the morning.  Of late years, the tendency seems to be to have that early hour more marked.  The farmers have a tendency to try to get there before each other, and the buyers follow suit, with the result that it is quite a common thing to find all the cattle at the fairs while it is still dark on a winter's morning, and the best part of the business done before daylight.  Those fairs serve a radius <Col N="1569" /> of ten or 12 miles.  That means that the farmers who wish to attend those fairs have to get up at a very early hour in the morning.</P>
    <P>In the dark, they have to collect the cattle in the fields and drive them along the road, often with great difficulty, in order to be in time for the fair.  That means a great hardship on the farmers and on their employees, who have to go such long distances, and wait, perhaps cold and hungry in very bad weather, until the fair is over. It also means a certain amount of hardship on the buyers, who have to come long distances to attend those fairs. Indirectly, it also means a hardship on the railway men, who have to attend at the railway before their usual hours, Perhaps the greatest hardship of all is on the cattle.  It is an unnecessary cruelty to those cattle to be collected in the fields in the early morning and driven long distances along country roads in the dark.  When those cattle arrive at the fairs, which are generally held in towns, they are dazzled by the lights, and rush to and fro.</P>
    <P>The whole arrangement means a great deal of hardship on the farmers, on their employees and on the cattle. The hardship associated with the holding of those fairs in the early morning is one of the things which make agricultural life so distasteful to the people of the present day.  It is one of the reasons why they are anxious to leave the land and go into the towns.  I have been observing that for many years, and endeavouring to get people to change it.  I cannot see that there is any real necessity for holding the fairs so early.  Auctions of cattle are held all over the country during the day, and seem to work quite satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>It is well to deal with the arguments which will be advanced against the motion.  First of all, we will be asked: &ldquo;If it is such a hardship on the farmers and on the buyers, why cannot they arrange by agreement to hold the fairs at a reasonable hour?&rdquo; Again, it has been said that it would not be possible to hold the fairs at a later hour in the morning, because the <Col N="1570" /> buyers would lose the connection to England.</P>
    <P>I think the best answer I could give to both of those arguments is to quote the report of the Committee of Inquiry set up in 1925 under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture to inquire into the marketing of live stock.  The following interests were represented on it: the shipping companies, the railway companies, the Irish Farmers' Union, Cattle Traders' Associations, Salesmasters' Associations, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Gárda Síochána.  The committee held several meetings and the recommendations included hours for the holding of pig fairs.</P>
    <P>On this point, the committee recommended on behalf of the pig buyers' and bacon curers' associations that the hour for the sale of pigs at fairs should not be earlier than 8 a.m.  I mention pig fairs because the recommendation has been brought into effect.  The committee also recommended that the fixing of the hours for the starting of fairs should preferably be dealt with by a central rather than a local authority.  The first part of the recommendation, so far as I know, has been brought into force and has resulted in the holding of pig fairs at a later hour in the morning. With regard to cattle and sheep fairs, in view of statements by cattle trade representatives, the committee recommended that the hour of commencement should be 7 a.m. from the 1st of March to the end of September, and 8 a.m. from the 1st of October to the last day of February.  Again it was recommended that the matter should be dealt with by a central rather than a local authority.  That is the answer to the point that those things should be fixed by agreement.  Several agreements have been made, but it would not be practicable to enforce them without the assistance of a central authority.  Even action by the local authority has been shown to be insufficient.</P>
    <P>This, also, is the answer to the argument that fairs could not be held later on account of the export trade. <Col N="1571" /> A recommendation came from the cattle traders' associations themselves to that committee.  They were satisfied that in normal times the fairs could be held at a later hour and the question of transport to foreign markets would be easily arranged.  Otherwise, the cattle traders' representatives would not have put this view forward.  The present system of holding fairs causes great hardship to the people and great cruelty to cattle, and I think reform in that direction is much overdue.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that there is no question about difficulties of transport, because at the present time practically all arrangements for transport have gone by the board and there are no more fixed hours for foreign markets.  Again, there can be no objection to the fixing of fairs at a later hour on the ground of lighting, because later hours would mean a saving in light both to shops and users of motor cars.  I suggest to the Minister that he should examine the question of reform with a view to the making of an Order or the introduction of legislation which will have the effect of fixing a reasonable opening hour for winter and summer to obviate the hardships felt at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I believe that it opens up a very big question.  I have had some experience of attending fairs at long distances from my home&mdash;driving cattle during the night for distances of eight and ten and sometimes 15 and 17 miles.  It often occurred to me that there would be far less hardship to man and beast if there was proper fair green accommodation in the big centres.  My idea is that in the larger centres there should be a fair green situated as close as possible to the railway station with a proper surface so that people will not have to wade through slush and mud to look at the cattle.  There should be a better system of pens where each farmer could bring his cattle and the various grades of cattle should be sectioned off in the different parts of the fair green.  There could be <Col N="1572" /> a system of payment per head or something like that arranged with local authorities and the farmer could make his reservations beforehand.  Similarly, if he was not sending cattle he could notify the authorities also.  Prior to the fairs, then, the local authority would be able to publish facts, in regard to the number and classes of cattle, which would be useful to buyers.</P>
      <P>Holding fairs in the streets of towns throughout the country causes enormous confusion the morning of the fair. Cattle have to be driven here and there and farmers and their workmen have to try to herd them in different corners and places in the town, causing a tremendous lot of hardship which could be avoided.  Townspeople may be anxious to keep the fairs on the street, but I think if they understood the matter they would agree that the fair green system would not take away business from them.  Farmers have to leave their horses and carts in yards in the town and they have to go to the banks to get paid and I believe that that system would lead to the spending of more money in towns.  Anyone with experience of agricultural conditions in the country knows something about the markets and the trying conditions under which farmers have to exhibit their cattle.  They have to rush to the fair and stand in it for hours. They have to drive along a most congested thoroughfare to the railway station where there is even more confusion. If the green was situated near the station the farmers could find out conditions there beforehand, and might not move their cattle until everything was in readiness for them.  This would produce some kind of system and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of dealing with the hours of fairs is rather an easy matter. That could be arranged with the transport companies to fit in with the trading time.  I do not think it matters very much if a man is living three or four miles away.  He has to rise before 6 o'clock in the morning.  It matters of course, where a man lives 15 or 17 miles from the town.  He has to start at 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning and if fairs were a little later in the winter <Col N="1573" /> months, it would mean less hardship. But, I would say that the hardships attendant on sales of cattle in fairs throughout the country are responsible, to some extent at any rate, for the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>At a very early age I had the experience of having to attend fairs during the winter months almost every fortnight, and of driving cattle under the worst possible climatic conditions, and having to stand for hours before I would have my cattle sold, rushing them to the railway station and getting them put into wagons, and so on. All this was by no means encouraging to me to continue in the business of agriculture.  There is no reason for it. I think we could improve conditions and the lot of the farmers in that respect very much.  People may talk about the farmer as being neglectful&mdash; some people refer to him as being lazy and not doing his bit&mdash;it has been said in this House.  If those people had only attended a number of fairs or travelled the roads on the morning of fairs, they would very quickly alter their view of the farmer and the kind of life he has to lead.  I ask the Minister to do what he can to see that some system like this would be put into operation.</P>

      <P>If I were to consult my own convenience and the convenience of a number of people, I would willingly support the motion.  A good deal could be said in favour of the proposal. Everyone knows that farmers and drovers suffer great hardships in coming to fairs early on dark and wet mornings, particularly in the winter months, but this matter cannot be settled quite as easily or as simply as Senator O'Dwyer thinks.  A good many considerations have to be taken into account before an Order could be made regulating the time of opening for fairs and markets.  Certain customs prevail in other parts of the country, and it is rather difficult to upset them.  I agree that if anything could be done to prevent the hardships endured by farmers, drovers, and cattle, it would be an excellent thing for everybody concerned. I would have no objection to it, but I feel that before such an Order <Col N="1574" /> is made there should be some inquiry into the whole business.  If the Minister would consider setting up a tribunal to inquire into the position, he might help by extending the terms of reference so that an inquiry could be made into the transport and better marketing of live stock.</P>

      <P>He can make any terms of reference he likes.  All I am concerned with is to get the best prices possible for the farmers.  We have a market in Dublin which is a national concern and, to put it mildly, the Dublin market is a disgrace to the Government.  For the past 20 years, I have been agitating to get the Dublin market changed to the North Wall, but I have not succeeded in getting any further with the project, either with the Fianna Fáil Government or their predecessors, the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Everybody admits that the conditions prevailing in the Dublin market are antiquated, that they are 50 years at least out of date.  Many experts estimate that the loss arising from deterioration of stock coming from the Dublin market and sent through the port of Dublin alone is at least £500,000.  If we had proper lairage and market facilities in Dublin, £500,000 would be saved to the country.  In 1931, the last year before the economic war, we exported from Éire 834,427 cattle, 672,664 sheep, 429,460 pigs and 8,250 horses, asses and other live stock.  More than half of these exports passed through the port of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a terrible disgrace to this and the previous Government that nothing has been done to provide proper lairage accommodation at the North Wall when practically the only thing we have to depend upon is the export of live stock.  Nothing has been done by either the present Minister or his predecessor to provide proper facilities at the port, through which practically half the exports of live stock from Éire pass.  Proper accommodation is needed at all the <Col N="1575" /> ports, but particularly at the port of Dublin.  Recommendations have been made by several bodies, the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, the cattle trade and by several other important people who understand the position, regarding a transfer of the Dublin market, but it seems that a few people with vested interests in Prussia Street are able to hold up that national concern.</P>
    <P>A few people with vested interests and other influences, no matter what Government is in power, are able to prevent any progress in this matter. If the Minister would consider setting up an inquiry, he could arrange for representation to be given to the cattle trade, transport, his own Department, and also to the Dublin town planning authorities.  If that were done, we might be able to make some progress, and we could then inquire into the question of regulating the opening hours for fairs.  If we were to fix a definite hour for opening fairs without having such an inquiry, it might have a very bad effect on the export of our stock.  I do not think any regulations could be made without having such an inquiry, otherwise I would very gladly support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not desire to labour the obvious&mdash;to everybody here it is obvious that there should be some regulation governing the sale of animals in country towns&mdash;but, if I did so, I would not be so far out of order as Senator Counihan was, because he did not discuss the terms of the motion at all.  He discussed the cattle market and the advisability of transferring it to the vicinity of the port.  That is an old story, and it would be another day's work to discuss it in detail.  However, if it were I who said that the Dublin cattle market was out-of-date, Senator Counihan would say that it is the most renowned cattle market in the world. I would be committing a great wrong in saying such a thing, as the Dublin cattle market is world-renowned, and is not antiquated in its equipment or anything else.  It is a credit to the country, and a credit to Dublin.  If we had anything approaching it in the less <Col N="1576" /> important cities and towns, we would have a very satisfactory state of affairs.</P>
      <P>Until some system of fair greens or municipal or borough market places is established in each town, I see little hope of governing or controlling the time at which the sale of animals is to begin or end.  We should ensure that towns which are important enough and anxious enough to have a market should provide a market place and then we can proceed to regulate &mdash;possibly in an elastic manner&mdash;the time of opening and closing the sales. I would remind Senators, however, that even in Dublin&mdash;where you have such opening hours&mdash;sales of animals are conducted, even at the risk of a £50 fine, the evening before the market opens.  It is not such an easy thing as. Senator O'Dwyer imagines to impose a specific opening time and to enforce it by a system of penalties.  You would not find so many people&mdash;even Senators, I fancy&mdash;enthusiastic about obeying such regulations.  We must have some definite market place or fair green as a preliminary step to controlling the time of opening the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two other reasons for supporting the motion.  I have travelled to fairs and through fairs and, after fairs, through the towns in which they were held.  We have not the facilities that are available at the Dublin cattle market, and there cannot be a quick clean-up.  The result of holding a fair in the streets is that they are left for days afterwards in a dirty condition, unless there is a good deluge of rain and they are washed by an act of God. That is one of the big arguments against the holding of fairs in the streets.  There are funny stories as to the conduct of animals of various sorts in towns where markets are held on the streets, on the footpaths and practically inside the houses.  Then there is the question referred to by Senator O'Dwyer, of the cruelty to the animals and to the individuals driving them. Neither man nor animal is treated fairly by the early, unnatural hours at which they have to leave home. Cattle are brought, under unnatural <Col N="1577" /> conditions, through the streets, and there is confusion in trying to get them to their place at a street corner, as there is no system of penning to facilitate the quiet standing of the animals.  The whole idea of holding fairs in streets is obviously wrong.</P>
    <P>The third point I wish to stress is the difficulty of controlling contagious and scheduled diseases under such conditions. I wish to emphasise now, as I have emphasised before, that this country must go forward in the control of those scheduled diseases and eradicate them as far as possible.  I do not wish to go into any more detail on that matter at present.  On a previous occasion one Senator referred to me as fouling my own nest, and I do not wish to make any further references to that, as I castigated Senator Counihan for referring so disparagingly to the Dublin Cattle Market.  We must introduce methods to deal with the contagious diseases of animals, as well as with those diseases which are transmissible to man; and the system of holding fairs indiscriminately in the streets of towns and practically inside the houses cannot go on.</P>
    <P>An extraordinary point is that, in many towns, there are fair greens which are ignored and where no fairs are held.  They may not be sheltered or covered places, but they are enclosures.  Time has caused the disuse of those fair greens.  Transport facilities will right themselves in their own time, and we should try to arrange for post-war eventualities now.  We should keep these three points in mind&mdash;that market places be provided, so as to keep the streets clean on the day after the market as well as on the day before it, so as to obviate cruelty to the animals and to the people attending on them, and so that there may not be such difficulty in controlling the contagious diseases of animals as there is at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw this motion on the Order Paper, the first thing that struck me was that it would be very desirable, if it were possible to carry it into effect.  Anyone who <Col N="1578" /> knows the position in the country and has gone around the fairs must realise the difficulty of putting such ideas into operation.  I did not hear Senator Counihan's speech on the motion, but I am sure he will agree with me that most of the fairs, particularly within any reasonable distance of the ports, are regulated by the time of shipping.</P>
      <P>A fair within 20 miles of a port generally starts about 8 a.m.  If you go another 20 miles on you will find it starts at 7 o'clock or maybe 6 o'clock. If you go another six miles it starts at 5 o'clock.  Nobody ever asks the question why it starts at 5 o'clock in one place and 8 o'clock in another.  I suppose there are men living who have never asked or never known why Fethard Fair starts at 8 o'clock and Carrick Fair starts at 5 o'clock, although there is only a distance of about 12 miles between them.  The reason that the fair has to start so early is to give buyers time to buy cattle and to get them up in time for shipment.  Unless we can advance much further than we have advanced, and much further than we can see much prospect of advancing in the near future, as far as transport is concerned in my opinion nothing of a serious nature can be done in connection with the alteration of the system of fairs.  These fairs have gone on for 60 or 70 years, or some of them for much longer, and it is going to take much argument and a lot of discussion or else very definite legislation to change from old established customs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the holding of fairs on fair days and the advisability of holding fairs on streets that matter has been discussed up and down the country.  In a few cases attempts to hold fairs on fair days have been successful but, in many cases, they have failed for the simple reason that you are up against terrible opposition.  You are, if you like, up against vested interests.  We had better not bring in the question of public houses again, but people in the towns and shopkeepers generally prefer to have cattle marketed in the town.  I am not saying that it is the most desirable method, but if you are going to make <Col N="1579" /> a change you have to be prepared to face all these arguments.  It is being said that it is cruelty to the cattle to have the fairs in the towns but, in my opinion, it is a greater cruelty to the people to try to hold fairs on fair greens in the dark.  That is another argument in favour of the street.  It is not an argument which I am putting forward, but it is an argument which would be put forward if such action as has been suggested by certain Senators were taken.  Before you suggest drastically altering the present arrangement you would need a scheme to provide, not fair greens, but proper markets with pens outside the town.</P>
    <P>If that could be done and if people knew that they were not going to herd the cattle upon the fair green, which is generally the coldest and the darkest place, you might get a certain amount of support behind it, but if you are going to go still further and say that fairs are going to be started at certain hours, it is not worth it.  It may be so, but I do not think it is worth it for the reasons I have stated.  I am in thorough agreement with people who say there is very much room for improvement; there is no doubt about it, but it is not something that can be done without a certain amount of consideration. I think the motion has done a certain amount of good and I am only sorry there are not more people in the House to discuss it, because if there were we might hear of ideas which might be helpful to the Minister and lead various sections to take an interest in the matter.  On the question of what can be done in regard to fixing hours I have not much hope, but I have great hope that something can be done for the betterment of the cattle-raising industry as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what the last Senator has said.  I do not like to see much interference and I warn the Department to walk warily in this matter.  Old customs have been long established and it would be a pity to introduce up-to-date methods without due consideration of what has been <Col N="1580" /> established by these customs.  There is a good deal to be said about the undesirability of holding fairs on the streets, but those responsible for the management of the towns represent the elected urban council.  At times they have tried to force the sale of cattle on fair greens, but the opposition of country people, who had not the slightest influence on the urban councils, but had with the shopkeepers, who largely formed it, forced them to relax any regulations prohibiting the holding of fairs on streets. There is everything to be said for keeping the towns clean.  In one town which I know there is a fair green and they had to revert to allowing cattle on the streets because country people would not go back to the fair green in the afternoon after they had done their business.  They had to employ five or six men and after some hours the streets were as clean as the Dublin cattle market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department recently brought in a change which had a bad effect on farmers.  The Dublin market was changed from Thursday to Wednesday. Old customs had been established and fairs were held on allotted days.  Navan, I think, held a fair on Monday, Cavan on Tuesday, and Louth on Wednesday.  In Louth we were accustomed to exhibit stock on Wednesday and found many buyers from Dublin coming to buy cattle which were exhibited in Dublin on Thursday. When the market was changed we found it meant that 50 per cent. of the market to which we were accustomed was no longer with us and we had to change the fairs to Tuesday.  The effect was that Cavan and Louth were having fairs on Tuesday.  Cavan and Kingscourt are well known places for breeders.  I warn the Department to walk warily and not to allow old customs to be interfered with.  There is everything to be said for cleanliness but, after all, there is an old saying, &ldquo;where the muck is, the luck is,&rdquo; and I do not like disturbing old customs. Senator Quirke's speech made the most appeal to me.  When we make changes we do not know but they may be the means of inflicting a loss of £10 to <Col N="1581" /> £15 on a farmer.  I hope the Department will not go too fast with such improvements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the cattle trade would suffer by the introduction of orderly methods where there is considerable disorder at present.  The primary consideration is the awful hardships that are imposed on farmers in certain areas where the custom of very early fairs exists.  The hardships especially in the driving of cattle and pigs are really unbelievable.  The stories one hears are not the stories one would expect to hear in a country like this, which is well served with ports and has a tolerably good system of transport.</P>
      <P>While saying that, I sympathise, to a certain extent, with the view of Senator McGee and Senator Quirke. If one undertakes some reform in haphazard fashion, one may cause considerable dislocation; regulations may be made which cannot be applied generally without creating considerable hardships in particular districts.</P>
      <P>Examination of the whole position is required before we definitely decide that the Minister should do what Senator O'Dwyer suggests.  I hope that this motion will induce the Minister to take the initiative in going into the whole question of the marketing of our live stock with a view to seeing whether or not it is possible to introduce more orderly methods, generally.  In the greater number of our towns in County Cavan, we have cattle greens to which the farmers take their cattle.  If you take your cattle into the square in the town of Cavan, when business is finished in the fair green, the town surveyor or some of his staff will quickly order you off, and you will be prosecuted if you disobey. Cattle will not be allowed to take their stand anywhere in the town. Over our country, generally, trading is done in the fair greens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main problem which, I think, Senator O'Dwyer has in mind, is that of the unnatural hour at which men have to drive their live stock along the <Col N="1582" /> road.  That must have caused the death of many a good man in the past. As the race declines, in the physical sense, I am afraid that practice will be more harmful.  The hardships which the present customs impose upon people in certain districts are very great, and it would be worth while inquiring whether better methods could not be substituted.  As Senator Quirke says, there is the problem of the transporting of the stock to the other end, which may be London, York, or Carlisle.  We may be trying to get some of the cattle in the fair on to the boat at the North Wall at 8 o'clock that night.  That boat has to reach the other side at a certain hour, and has to catch the train for London which, in addition to taking our cattle, may be also carrying dead meat to the Smithfield market, where it will arrive at 4 o'clock in the morning.  I travelled on the train myself, and was in Smithfield when some of this meat was taken off.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that a great number of our fairs have to be held at rather unearthly hours because a certain small proportion of the cattle from these fairs may have to be sent across to the other side.  I do not know if we could do anything to reorganise our system of marketing so as to make it possible for farmers to market cattle which are to be sent out of the country on a particular day and at a particular hour and have another day and another hour for the stock that are part of our own internal trade.  These latter cattle could be sent to Meath or Kildare or South Tipperary at 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening as well as at 2 or 3 o'clock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the present position for a long time and the desired change might involve a revolution of our methods.  It might necessitate discussion with transport companies on the other side.  On the other hand, if I were a purchaser of live <Col N="1583" /> stock for transport to the other side and if I had to keep them an extra day, I am afraid I should try to make the man who sold them to me pay the cost of the delay.  We know that the live stock leaving the country have to reach markets on particular days on the other side, so that the whole position is very involved.  It is not a question that can be lightly considered; it needs exhaustive examination.  I shall not go into the aspect of the question referred to by Senator O'Donovan. There is need for discussion in that respect, too.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not be blamed if, having been urged, he sees fit to inquire into the question of tidier methods.  A considerable number of our people have suffered hardships owing to the present methods of marketing live stock.  I am not prepared to say that we could have our present markets without imposing these hardships but I should like to see the matter inquired into.  If these hardships can be eliminated, then, in the name of common sense and of the welfare of the people, not to mention the live stock, we should try to eliminate them.</P>
      <P>A man who has to drive stock to a market over a distance of ten miles on a December or January morning knows what he is going through and he can imagine what the stock are going through.  I am sure the Minister realises that there is a problem to be investigated.  He could get a group of people representative of the farmers, transport interests and people interested in the fairs to inquire into the problem and put forward a plan which would be an improvement on the present methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has led, very properly, to a discussion on the modernisation of the methods of marketing our cattle.  I was particularly interested in what was said about the desirability of providing market yards for our cattle.  We have a very deplorable experience in Galway, where the largest square is put out of bounds for the inhabitants during the <Col N="1584" /> holding of fairs.  In fact, the situation is so deplorable that the schools are closed during the holding of the fairs because the children cannot reach the schools.  Of course, that is the fault of the Galway people themselves.  For a time, fairs were held in the fair green but feeling got so strong that the fair was brought back to Eyre Square, one of the nicest squares in Ireland. Unfortunately, the square is near the station and, if you want to get a train, you have to elbow your way through groups of cattle, with great danger to life and limb.  For that reason, I hope that this question will be taken up seriously.</P>
      <P>This is not a matter that could be dealt with by making an Order.  As Senator Quirke has pointed out, a great many interests have to be considered and a great many points of view have to be weighed.  In any system of town planning we ought, certainly, have proper market yards both for the preservation of the amenities of our towns and cities and also for the sake of the people and of the cattle at the fairs.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan reminded us of the danger of the spreading of disease through the present system of holding fairs in towns.  I think, too, that we might remember that there is a great deal of waste of very precious manure.  I would think also that temperance would be greatly served if the conditions under which people sell the cattle were made easier.  The plea made by Senator O'Dwyer for a more rational hour, a later hour, for the holding of the fairs impresses me greatly in that respect.  I speak, of course, out of ignorance, but it is always helpful to the experts in a discussion of this kind that the ordinary person should speak, the person who looks at the matter more or less from the point of view of the outsider, but who is concerned with the interests of her country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>From listening to this discussion, it appears to be fairly generally felt by all the Senators who spoke that there is a case for consideration, and that <Col N="1585" /> something should be done with regard to the regulation of fairs and markets, not only with regard to the time of opening but also to the location of those markets.  On the other hand, I think everybody felt that an investigation should be held into the whole matter before any action is taken. There are many factors that must be considered.  It is not by any means a simple proposition, and I do not think anybody&mdash;Minister or anybody else&mdash;would like to lay down the law as to what should be done with regard to markets in general without consulting all the interests concerned.  I do not know whether it should amount to a commission, but at any rate there should be consultation with the various interests concerned.  I think travel facilities for the buyers and freight facilities for the removal of cattle when the fair is over would have a big influence on those markets. Senator Quirke pointed out, for instance, that the time of the market is very often influenced by shipping facilities and the freight between the market and the port.  I think that is quite true.</P>
      <P>Again, as Senator McGee pointed out, there may be some relation between the time a market is held down the country and the time the Dublin market is held.  Cattle may be bought at the local market and brought to the Dublin market.  That might also apply to other parts of the country; cattle bought in one county may be brought along to a fair in another county, and sold again.  Those are all matters for consideration. Apart from that, pigs must go on to a bacon factory as a rule.  In that connection, too, we have a growing trade here for cows which go to factories also.  Then fat cattle are bought by butchers in different areas.  All those things have to be considered very fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised with regard to private sales.  A lot of people held that it would be better for the producer, at any rate, if private sales could be absolutely prohibited, but Senator O'Donovan pointed out the difficulty of enforcing a regulation of that kind. I take it that no market in this <Col N="1586" /> country could be better organised than the Dublin market; probably no market would have the same facility for detecting any breach of by-laws of any kind, and yet those by-laws are broken by private sales.  There are others who go further, and say that dealing in cattle should be cut out&mdash;that no sale should be permitted except by public auction.  I do not know whether or not we should go that far.  Then, of course, we come to the question of the location of markets, whether we should have fair greens or whether the markets should be held on the streets.  There you are up against vested interests in various areas, and I am afraid that the point made by Senator Mrs. Concannon &mdash;that there would probably be more temperance if markets were held at a reasonable time and in reasonable places&mdash;is just the point that is troubling certain people in certain towns, and keeping the markets where they are and at the times they are.  I do not think, however, that the location of the Dublin market, for instance, could be responsible for the huge loss to which Senator Counihan refers, that is £500,000.  If we take the number of cattle going out of the Dublin port, and assess the total loss of £500,000, it comes to a very substantial sum per head.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the two things combined might lead to a very substantial loss; first of all, the location of the Dublin market and the necessity to bring cattle from that market down to the North Wall, and secondly, the point made by Senator Counihan about the necessity for improvement of the lairages there, might be responsible for a substantial loss, but I suppose there is no point in trying to assess what that loss is.  I think on the whole the question should be considered <Col N="1587" /> by the interests concerned before we do anything about it.  I agree with the general consensus of opinion here in the Seanad that something should probably be done.  The position with regard to the law is very involved.  In fact I do not propose to give a strict outline of what the law is, but all those things have grown up over the years, over the centuries in fact.  &ldquo;Permits,&rdquo; to use a general term, whether by charter or otherwise, were granted in the old times either to the lord of the manor, where the fair was held on his grounds, or to the borough council or the borough corporation, where the fair was held within the walls of the borough.  That was done centuries ago, and, as far as I can find out&mdash;I think it would take a lot of legal research to get clear on this point&mdash;there is no control over such fairs.  There was a Public Health Act passed in, I think, 1878, and that gave further powers.  They had some powers before that, but that Act gave further powers to urban authorities, whether they were corporations or urban councils or town commissioners, to establish markets as opposed to fairs.</P>
      <P>Of course, the same business is done at both, but they were called markets in those cases.  Wherever the urban authority availed of that Act and set up a market, they have fairly full powers.  They have power to regulate the opening time; they have power to regulate where the market must be held, and they have also power with regard to tolls and so on.  A fair number of urban authorities availed of that power to set up markets, but very few of them have gone further than that.  Very few of them have made any by-laws with regard to the place of holding the market or to the time of opening.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation has passed by-laws dealing with those matters, but I do not know of any other urban authority that has dealt, very extensively, anyway, with the regulation of markets in their own areas.  That, I think, is roughly how the law stands at the moment in regard to powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> The urban authorities have certain powers, and the Department of Local Government has certain powers as far as sanctioning anything the urban authority might propose.  My Department has certain powers of a vague kind with regard to tolls.  Where there is a toll market, my Department has certain powers to interfere. Where there is no toll market, we have no power to interfere, so that the law is very vague and very mixed and it is probably a case where something might be done.  The point is how would we proceed if we were going to do anything?</P>
    <P>I feel we would have to set up some sort of committee representing the interests mentioned such as producers &mdash;the farmers themselves&mdash;the cattle trade as we call it, the people who buy cattle and sell them again or buy cattle for shipping.  They should be represented on such a committee, because they know a good deal more about that business and the necessity for holding fairs at certain points than anybody else.  Then, of course, the railway companies and the shipping companies would be very useful and, also, if it is thought necessary&mdash;personally I do not see that it is&mdash;the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  My point is that farmers and cattle traders and the shipping and railway companies are all anxious to prevent cruelty to animals, and it is not necessary to join a society for that purpose in order to be humane. Surely we are all humane as far as that goes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not.  That is the sort of body that will have to be got together to consider this matter.  The next point is when.  I feel if we were to do it now we would inevitably have present conditions in transport to take into account.  Transport is now much more difficult than it would be at normal times, and we might be inclined to come to conclusions now that would not be wise conclusions when the war is over and we get back to normal <Col N="1589" /> conditions.  I am just doubtful, therefore, whether we should do anything now or wait until the war is over. That is a matter for consideration. On the whole, I take it that if the Seanad agrees to this motion, it will be interpreted by the Seanad and by my Department as meaning that the Seanad thinks that something should be done with regard to markets and the times of markets.  If it is interpreted in that way, I am prepared to accept it and go into the matter to see what should be done, in what way it should be done, and the time at which it should be done.  I think that is all I could say in dealing with this motion at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has expressed his intention to deal with the matter.  I do not agree that we should leave it over until after the war.  We cannot visualise the circumstances that will arise at the conclusion of the war and this would be a very favourable opportunity for dealing with what is an undoubted grievance.  The great argument against it, so far as I can understand, would be the difficulty of arranging transport to foreign markets, but I should like to point out that the transport question does not exist at present.  Therefore, the present would be a very suitable time for making the experiment of regulating the hours in the morning. Several such experiments by the Department are in operation at present, and if an Order were made regulating the hours at which fairs would be held much useful experience would be gained.  The committee could be set up afterwards to see whether the changes would be made permanent or not and they would have experience to guide them.  No objection has been raised to the motion in the House, but various points have been discussed such as the removal of cattle from the streets and the setting up of fair greens and facilities in the towns. There can be no objection on the question of transport and I do not think there can be any other objection raised.  As I pointed out, grave hardship is caused to farmers, their employees, and to cattle by the continuance <Col N="1590" /> of a system which is long since out of date.  That is why I ask the Minister if it would not be possible to bring in a temporary Order that would regulate opening hours for the present, and, in the meantime, the committee of inquiry could be set up to decide whether the conditions brought about by the Order would be made permanent or not.  I ask leave to withdraw the motion.</P>
      <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Before the motion for the Adjournment is taken I should let the House know that representations have been made that it would be of convenience if the Central Fund Bill which, I am given to understand, we will receive from the Dáil this week, could be considered by the Seanad next week.  The Bill will, I presume, be certified as a Money Bill, and it is provided under the Standing Orders that if no meeting of the Seanad is fixed to take place within seven days of the receipt of a Bill of that description, the House must be summoned to meet within such seven days.  The days upon which we might meet next week would be Tuesday, Thursday or Friday&mdash;Wednesday being St. Patrick's Day.  I would like to have an indication from the Seanad as to which of these days would best convenience Senators' arrangements.</P>
