Is é an chéad chuspóir a bhíonn ag Bille Prímh-Chiste ná a cheadú go dtabharfaí airgead amach as an bPrímh-Chiste, agus cuimhneoidh na Seanadóirí gur údaruigh an Bille do hachtuíodh i mí na Márta seo caithte beagnach ceithre mhilliún déag púnt do thabhairt amach chun go bhféadfaí na seirbhísí puiblí do choimeád ar siúl go deire na míosa seo, tráth bhéadh breithiúntas déanta ar na Meastacháin go léir de ghnáth, agus bhéadh ar mo chumas teacht ós bhur gcóir le Bille Leithreasa a chlúdóchadh na deontaisí don bhliain airgeadais iomlán.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of a second Central Fund Bill this year has been made necessary by the recent General Election, the intervention of which has prevented Dáil Eireann from disposing within the usual time of all the Estimates for the Supply Services for the <Col N="2269" /> current financial year.  The main purpose of a Central Fund Bill is to authorise the issue of moneys out of the Central Fund, and Senators will remember that the Bill enacted in March last authorised the issue of nearly fourteen million pounds to enable the various services to be carried on until the end of this month, by which time consideration of the Estimates would normally have been completed, and it would have been possible for me to come before you with an Appropriation Bill covering the grants for the whole year.</P>
    <P>As matters turned out, however, the last Dáil considered only 29 of the 73 separate Estimates before its dissolution. The moneys required to carry on after the end of this month the services to which those 29 Estimates related were legally granted by the Appropriation Act which was before the Seanad last May.  The remaining 44 Estimates will not, according to present expectations, be considered by the Dáil before next October, and as, of course, the covering Appropriation Bill cannot be brought in until they have been considered, it is now necessary to pass this second Central Fund Bill to make available further supplies for the services covered by those Estimates, unless we are prepared to have those services brought to a standstill at the end of this month.</P>
    <P>The Estimates in question comprise the Finance, Local Government and Public Health, Agriculture, Posts and Telegraphs, Army and External Affairs groups, and the sum required for each particular Vote is in general about one-third of the total net Estimate for the year.  The total required is approximately £8,500,000, which will, it is calculated, be sufficient for the next four months, by which time I hope that the remaining Estimates will have been passed and a supporting Appropriation Bill enacted.</P>
    <P>The House has already had two opportunities of considering this year's Estimates in detail, and I do not propose to review them at length again. It may not, however, be out of place to say that the total of the Estimates in the Estimates Volume is £40,696,211, <Col N="2270" /> to which must be added £282,368, being the total of two Supplementary Estimates (for the Votes for Science and Art, and Supplies) passed by the Dáil since the Volume was published, arriving at the total sum now required for this year, which is £40,978,579.  The amount granted for this year by the first Central Fund Act was £13,820,000, to which the recent Appropriation Act added £9,551,899.  The amount now required is £8,423,000, which will leave £9,183,680 still to be granted.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the present Bill are stereotyped and are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 1 authorises the issue of £8,423,000 out of the Central Fund; Section 2 gives the Minister for Finance the usual power to borrow up to the amount granted by the Bill and to issue such securities as he thinks fit for the purpose of such borrowing. It also provides that the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Minister any sum or sums not exceeding the amount he is empowered to borrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it will be regarded as appropriate or not to enter into a discussion on general Government policy and conditions on this Vote on Account, but there are things one would like to say. Of course, I am concerned mainly with the problem of agriculture and agricultural production, and the Minister can plead, as he has generally been able to plead effectively, that that is a subject with which some other Minister could deal with more competence. There are, however, aspects of our agricultural policy that do not come strictly within the purview of any particular Minister, but fall rather on the Cabinet as a whole to decide. It may be that the Minister and his colleagues are satisfied with the condition of our agricultural industry and with our agricultural output.  Perhaps that is not true, and that Ministers are not satisfied.  I do not think that they could possibly be satisfied, or that the country could be satisfied with the output of our agricultural industry, or with the whole approach towards making conditions better either for those engaged in agriculture or for the country generally.  There was <Col N="2271" /> a very long discussion on this subject in the Dáil, and a very interesting survey resulted.  Figures were given from various sides, but I am not now going to deal with them at length. Generally, it appears to me as if Ministers considered that the output in agriculture had increased.  That is something that I do not accept, as any close examination of the facts would not bear it out.  It is true that figures could be produced to indicate that, from the point of view of the money values put on output, the position had improved.  When these values were being put on production I do not know what comparison was made with the decreased purchasing power of the £ during the last four or five years, or whether the measure taken is anything like an accurate measure of the real value of our output in 1938-39, or 1936-37.</P>
      <P>We have figures for 1936-37 which show a very considerable increase in the cash value of agricultural output but I do not think they are a true reflex of the actual position.  It is quite clear to me that you are taking conditions when we have raised the price of wheat within a certain period by a considerable number of shillings per barrel and when we have increased the cash value of other commodities, but whether we have any evidence to satisfy ourselves that we have a total increased yield from our fields is something about which I am very sceptical indeed.  If the Ministry as a whole are satisfied to accept these figures as a true reflex of the position in agriculture, I think it would be very unfortunate that we should accept it as the real position.  As I see the situation, we have actually fewer people employed on the land.  The numbers are decreasing.  It may be that some farmers are working much harder, but there is a limit to what any one man can do, and I am not satisfied that the fewer people on the land are actually competent to increase the quantity of physical goods available from the land.</P>

    <P>There is no doubt about it that the machines on the land are running down, and we are not able to replace <Col N="2272" /> them.  We need not talk about capital resources.  It is all right to have capital if you can buy the things you need.  The trouble is that you cannot buy them.  But, apart from the fact that we have fewer people employed on the land, and fewer and poorer machines to work with, there is also the other factor that the fertility available in our fields is much less than that in any pre-war year.  The Minister, perhaps, has a rough idea that in the present season we are having made available something like 40,000 tons of artificial manures, whereas we used from 200,000 to 240,000 tons in a pre-war year.  We know, too, that the quantity of farmyard manure has certainly not increased, because the number of live animals on our farms has gone down.  We have, then, a situation in which there are fewer people to work on the land, poorer machines and no addition to the number, and a lower fertility in areas under production. In a situation like that, I do not think anybody&mdash;and I do not mind who he is&mdash;who knows anything about the combination of essentials required to get yields from soil, can be satisfied that the quantity of physical goods has increased, or bears any reasonable comparison to the apparent increase in the cash value which the Minister for Agriculture gave in the Dáil last week, as apparently over £70,000,000 in round figures.  I suggest to the Minister that the situation needs examination, and not in any superficial way at all.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, and have been convinced for a long time, and I have lost no opportunity of saying it, that the situation requires examination and reorganisation in a fashion we have not attempted up to the present.  We have not the animals to-day which we ought to have.  The Minister for Agriculture, and perhaps the Minister for Finance, would say we would have the animals if we had the food.  I believe we have the land to have the food for the animals, if we had the men to work the land and the fertility which the land requires, and if, in addition, we improve the land in the way we ought to improve it.  We have schemes here which are being assisted by this Vote. One is the land improvement scheme&mdash;<Col N="2273" /> a very good scheme, so far as it goes. I do not know, for instance, under that scheme why we should impose a limitation on the improvement of the land as we are doing.  If it can be argued that we cannot produce any more until we secure more land, then the obvious thing to do is to see why we cannot get more land available for cultivation.</P>
    <P>We have 12,000,000 arable acres in a total area of 17,000,000 acres.  I have no idea what proportion of the 5,000,000 acres might be, or could be, made available for cultivation.  Perhaps it may well be that in the area of 12,000,000 acres, we have a considerable number of acres that cannot be regarded as in a condition to give us either good tillage crops, or fair value, from the point of view of producing grass.  Obviously, the right thing to do is to see what we can do to bring all this land into a proper state of cultivation&mdash;improve it in whatever way we can improve it, and, instead of letting our labourers leave the country because we say we have nothing for them to do, keep them at home and get them placed on the land under this land improvement scheme.  You have conditions in connection with that scheme whereby no man, no matter who he is, can get a Government grant unless he can satisfy the people in the offices and answer all sorts of questions as to the proportion of his income which he is getting from his land, and all that sort of thing.  If, for instance, a man has a little bit of a shop in the country, and if he may happen to have a considerable area of land, some of which is very poor land: if he wants to improve that land, he is not eligible for the grant, and the result is that much of the land that ought to be improved and assisted through this Government scheme, and which ought to be brought into a proper condition for cultivation, is going to waste.</P>
    <P>If we want to improve all the land in the country, why have these provisions and conditions at all?  In my opinion, Government policy on this matter ought to be to go out and improve every acre of land in the country that is capable of improvement.  No matter who owns the land, it is there; and if it requires improvement, it is <Col N="2274" /> in the interests of the nation that each individual who owns the land at the moment, no matter who he is, ought to be encouraged to improve it.  I think that, on the whole, the farmer will improve his land if reasonable repayment or compensation can be obtained by him for the labour spent upon it.  I think, accordingly, that with regard to our land improvement scheme the Government should put it on a much broader basis altogether and remove all the restrictions that you have imposed with regard to money incomes on land, or the way of life of individuals, or anything like that.  The Government should go out definitely with the intention of improving all our land, as they have done in Britain.  Do not bother about asking all sorts of questions, which are sometimes not easy to answer, and the net result of which is to leave the land there unimproved. I say that if we want to get more land under cultivation, and if it is not available in the present area of arable land, let us go out and bend all our energies towards improving any land that is capable of improvement. We would be spending money well by bringing every possible acre of land into a state where it could be cultivated.</P>
    <P>Now, that is an aspect of our problem that, I think, the Ministry ought to take notice of.  Even in my own county I know of quite a number of instances where men wanted to improve their land, and wanted to get the facilities of the Government grant from which they saw their neighbours benefiting, and who, for one reason or another, have not been able to do it.  I think that restrictions like these are a hardship and are definitely standing in the way of the carrying out of a sound Government policy that is, generally, going to be beneficial.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Ministry may think about it, or however satisfied they may be about the cash value they have put upon the output of agriculture for 1941-42, I think that the net result of our policy up to date is that the number of live stock in the country is falling. Our live stock are getting fewer and fewer, day after day, and month after month.  I believe that that is a <Col N="2275" /> very dangerous situation, but it is obvious to all of us attending fairs and markets that that situation is coming about, and that the speed at which it is happening is being greatly accelerated. Let us not disregard these facts; they are fundamental to our whole land policy in the future.  I myself believe this&mdash;that it is not enough for the Government to say, with regard to the maintenance of certain branches of our live-stock industry&mdash;our pig industry, for instance &mdash;that we cannot have an increase in the pig population unless the farmers can produce more food, and just leave it at that.  I believe that the farmers can produce more food, and that they will till more acres if they get the labour to do it, and if they are paid the money for doing the job.  I want to see Government policy shaped in such a fashion as will encourage increased production of the foods that are essential for live stock as well as for human beings, but a consideration must be that such a price will be paid to the farmer-producer as will enable him to employ men to do that work.</P>
    <P>Within a certain limited period, we have lost over 100,000 of our young people.  We have not enough of various types of food for the people here at home to eat, and we could have had them.  Mind you, 50,000 men in a year could produce a very considerable quantity of extra food, both of butter and of bacon, and, before these men left the country, there should have been a better diagnosis of the position as it would have been if it had been possible for these men to be employed in the fields of Ireland.  This is a matter that concerns our people and the nation generally, and it has a tremendous bearing upon our whole future, because beyond doubt we have got to look at this fact&mdash;that we have a situation here where we cannot buy in this country the goods that could be produced by our people if they were working in the fields here at home. Men and women go across to England and get money for the services they render there.  They send that money back to their relatives at home, and when these people go out into the <Col N="2276" /> market to buy a rasher of bacon or a pound of butter, these commodities are not there.  If these people had been kept in Ireland, not alone would they be able to provide a rasher of bacon or a pound of butter to supply the needs of their own families, but they would be able to provide a sufficient quantity of that type of goods for the rest of the community as well.</P>
    <P>I am not going to dwell at greater length on this situation, but I am satisfied that our policy at present does not reveal that deeper examination of the possibilities of our own land, and the ability of our own people harnessed to the soil, which is requisite for the circumstances of our times and, above all, of our future.  I think we should take a much broader view of the whole position.  If we are not getting enough out of our own land to provide for our human population and also our live stock up to the extent that is necessary, and indeed up to the extent that is necessary for us to have a surplus for export, then I say that we should ask ourselves: What can we do to improve our land?  What can we do to make it more productive?  Can we employ our people on it?  Can we hold the people, who are now leaving the country, on the land, and improve it so that it may increase its productivity for all of us, and, following on from that, what is necessary to be done in order to achieve this end?</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied.  I fear that the figures which we have been given may make the Minister and his colleagues, and a great many others, altogether too complacent, because I believe that while, apparently, the cash value of the products that are credited to the land, including the turf from the bogs, has increased, the physical amount of goods being made available from the land is actually declining.  I think that that is a very unsatisfactory situation, and I believe that that situation will continue progressively and that it will go on disimproving unless we show more courage and take a broader view than we have been taking up to the present.  The Minister for Finance, I think, myself, is probably in a position to make a bigger contribution towards changing this policy than anybody else <Col N="2277" /> in the Government.  I do not intend to go into the unsatisfactory procedure of permitting the youth of the country to go out of it to work in another country, and to send back here money to buy goods which are not available.  A situation like that should not be permitted to continue, because the services of those people are required here to provide for our own community the absolute essentials of life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I really rise only to say why I am not going to make a speech&mdash;if that is not a strange statement to make.  I cannot think of a better way of putting it.  I just want to explain that I regard this Bill merely as a formal measure necessitated by the dissolution of the Dáil. There are many matters which whoever happens to be in this House when the Appropriation Bill comes along will no doubt want to discuss, but I have come to the conclusion that to attempt to discuss now the details such as we would discuss on the Appropriation Bill would be rather futile in all the circumstances.  It is entirely for that reason that I think we should accept this Bill, simply as a measure which must be passed in the circumstances, because the Dáil was not in a position to deal with all the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Douglas has interpreted the view which I took on this matter&mdash;that we should not discuss this Bill at very great length.  At the same time, I want to contribute something in addition to what Senator Baxter has said, so that I suppose if I take the mean by stating that my speech will be very short I will be going a little distance both ways, which is a suitable thing to do at the present time.  Last season, almost at this time, I urged that, with food production the all-important question for us, the Government should revise its programme in regard to the implementing of its tillage scheme.  I think the time for the Government to set its house in order with the farmers and with the producing community is not in January or February or March or April, but now. We should now take stock of our prospects in relation to the most important foodstuffs that we need, particularly <Col N="2278" /> wheat and potatoes.  My own business is largely devoted to the production of both commodities, but, like other people in the House, I also let lands for tillage, and my opinion&mdash; based both on my own experience and on what I am advised by others&mdash;is that the tendency of our producers will be to produce less wheat and still less potatoes.</P>
      <P>That opinion, as I have said, is based entirely on experience and not on statistics.  That position can be avoided if the Government will here and now make their announcements, based on such experience as they are in a position to gather from instructors and from every other source that might guide them in such an important matter.  Only on Saturday morning last I read in one of our Dublin papers an announcement from its London correspondent that the prices for home-grown grain for 1943-44 had been fixed on the previous day.  The fixed price for wheat is 14/6 per cwt.; for oats, 14/- to 14/9 per cwt., and for barley 27/6 per cwt.  In addition, there is a bounty of £3 for each acre which the farmer tills, and on top of that they have derating.  That will permit the agricultural community there to budget for a very decent wage to their labourers, and will enable each individual farmer to produce a substantial amount.  It must be remembered too that the farmers there can get sulphate of ammonia&mdash;the most essential commodity in the production of both potatoes and wheat&mdash;at £9 or £10 a ton.  A very learned colleague here laughed at me when I suggested some time ago that those of us who are in a position to smuggle sulphate of ammonia should be given a bounty by the State.  The State itself has not yet adopted the courageous attitude of going out and smuggling a couple of hundred thousand tons of ammonia, but some of us get it and pay £60 a ton for it.  I have next year's supply in, and some of my neighbours have the same.  I see that extra Specials are being put on the Border every day to prevent the ammonia from coming in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will not be able to go on eternally producing wheat; we will not <Col N="2279" /> be able to go on eternally producing potatoes; and we will not be able to keep our labourers, unless the State considers meeting us on something like the lines on which the English producers are being met by the English Government.  I do not know what the State expects the producers to do. Our land is getting poorer, and no added inducement to production is being given.  The very fact that Northern Ireland is not encouraged to grow wheat goes to show what it is to ask the farmers here to do it.  If the Government would put its programme before us now, those of us who see the necessity for producing more wheat from fresh land would, as the season goes on, take the opportunity of stripping those fields that may still be left unploughed, getting rid of weedy sods, and generally helping towards the production of that commodity which the Ministry itself must know is most essential for us.  It takes an enormous amount of fertility to produce those essential crops, and added inducements to production should be given to the farmers.  In order to stimulate production, it will be necessary to give a better price than I advocated here a year ago.  Now is the time for the Government to put its programme before the public, and it should be based on some little common sense in order to permit the producers to meet the consumers.  I venture to suggest that the Ministry will find a considerable reduction in the acreage of wheat and potatoes.  I foretold that a year ago.  I do not want to say &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; but I am afraid the opportunity will be there.  It is up to the Ministry to prevent that.  They will not have very much to do during the next six weeks while the Seanad is being elected.  They may not be in a position to carry on without us, but at least they should put some of their schemes in operation.  That is the only suggestion I wish to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite agree with what Senator Douglas has said. Normally, the question of voting moneys for carrying on the government of this country can be dealt with on such a Bill as this and on the Appropriation <Col N="2280" /> Bill, but, as far as I understand it, this is the only opportunity that this Seanad will have of considering the whole question of the government for which we are now voting supplies.  I want to say, of course, that I recognise, as everybody must, that the Government needs money, and that it is better to have a Government than to have no Government.  At the same time we cannot get away from the responsibility imposed upon us, namely, to see, as it is our duty to see, that not merely the bare minimum of government be established but that the country be conducted in the way that is most apt to the desired end, namely, the promotion of the common good.  Consequently, I should like to refer to a number of things which have come into my mind particularly during the recent election.</P>
      <P>To begin with, in this Bill we are voting for the maintenance of what is called the Oireachtas&mdash;the legislature. Some years ago there was a drastic alteration or amendment of the Constitution which was submitted to the people of this country for them to express their considered judgment as to whether or not it was an improvement on the Constitution that was there before.  Now we know quite well, from ordinary common sense, that not one person in a hundred who took the responsibility of deciding whether or not such a change was desirable, had taken the trouble to read the Constitution. We know also, or must assume, that no member of the Fianna Fáil Party read that Constitution, because only a matter of some months ago they came along here and solemnly answered the Whip which called upon them to vote and to enact a Bill the effect of which was to take from the people a right that was guaranteed to them in the Constitution.  We must assume that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party here were not acting with such <i>mala fides</i> that having enacted the Constitution they proceeded consciously to take away a right which was guaranteed by that Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that Constitution also we had a form of election imposed upon us in such a way that after the lapse of three years, which three years were <Col N="2281" /> duly allowed to lapse, it was not in the power of the legislature to alter that form of election.  Consistently, certainly from 1927 onwards, I have taken all the opportunities I had to point out that proportional representation in this country, and in every other country in which it or something approximately the same operated, had a certain effect.  But the Government that put that across on the people of this country, and in a form that no legislature as a legislature could change it, came along during the election and said that it would be a national disaster if the necessary and inevitable effect of that type of voting were to operate here&mdash;which means that the Government presumably having, as it was bound, given some thought to the effect of this legislation, in enacting that particular part of the constitutional amendment of 1937 proposed that they would create a situation in this country which they knew to be a national disaster.  Afterwards, in an election they went round and tried to get the support of the people on the ground that this would be a national disaster, but carefully refrained from pointing out to the people that it was the Government's own action brought it about.</P>
    <P>Last week or the week before the Taoiseach referred to ignorance amongst the people and to some people aping that ignorance.  I do not remember his exact words, but I think he was quite right.  Take, for instance, that matter of proportional representation and its effect in producing a diversity of Parties in the Legislature. We spend about £5,000,000 a year on education, the assumption being that the people live in such a blissful state of total ignorance that they can be led astray by Party propaganda of the character I have described.  I have already raised the question as to whether or not that £5,000,000, by which we are trying to make the people of this country compulsorily literate, is justly imposed on the taxpayers. Again, as regards that section of the Bill which applies to education, I notice that the Taoiseach himself, going round the country, talking in spirals as he always does, tried to impress <Col N="2282" /> the products of our £5,000,000 education with the idea that somehow or other the neutrality of this country as it exists was dependent on the maintenance of the present Executive Council.  That argument could only be put forward by a man, the man incidentally responsible for taxing the people of this country with that enormous sum for educating the people on the assumption that the people, were sufficiently ignorant to be taken in by that type of argument.  Is not the phrase that has always been used, I admit by the Opposition as well as by the Fianna Fáil Party: &ldquo;We have declared our neutrality&rdquo;?  When the las war came upon us, we were in the position in which the Government of Great Britain, which at the time was also responsible for the government of Ireland, by their Act declaring war automatically led to a situation in which this country was at war.  There was a certain futile attempt by individuals or groups in this country to declare this country neutral.  Of course no such declaration would have any effect.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Treaty of 1921, a change was brought about whereby we were necessarily not involved in a war unless our own Government decided that it was in the national interests that we should be so involved.  That was the effect of the Treaty and in the Constitution of 1922, we, as I might say, tightened that position by declaring that even the Government itself could not commit us to a state of war unless it first submitted it to the Legislature and the Legislature itself supported such a proposition.  Therefore, as far as neutrality was concerned we were necessarily neutral, that is to say in a non-belligerent condition as against other States unless our Government proposed to declare war upon some other country.  Obviously in the present case, it would have been quite ridiculous apart from being criminal to do it because, as far as I see, they would have been declaring war on countries that they could not get even within shooting distance of.  It would have been quite ridiculous.  Nevertheless the story was put round, sometimes in these vague spiral phrases, <Col N="2283" /> that if the people should change the Government, other countries might interpret that change of Government as a dislike of neutrality.  That argument was put forward on the assumption that the people were capable neither of understanding the implications of the Treaty of 1921 nor the Constitution of 1922 and also that they had nobody to explain it to them.  As a matter of fact, I here assert that one of the effects of the Treaty of 1921 is that we are only at war when we ourselves declare war.  Apart from that, there was another argument that the present Government could not claim credit, for what that credit is worth, for neutrality in view of the fact that power to declare neutrality was derived from the Treaty.  There was certain argument ranging round the ports which I do not want to repeat.  I understood it somehow in this way, that by some masterpiece of diplomacy or other weapon, the ports which had been left in English hands after 1921 were won by only one individual and that it could never have been possible for any other individual to get them.  I want to say one or two words on that matter because I happen to be able to speak with a certain amount of authority on it.  The beginning of Article VI of the Treaty of 1921 reads something like this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Until such time as an agreement between the Government of Great Britain and Ireland, under which or whereby the Irish Government will take over its own coastal defence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now you will see from that phrase, and what followed after it, that that condition was essentially defined as being temporary until such time as an agreement was made between the Governments of Great Britain and Ireland whereby Ireland would take over her own coastal defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this in order?  What has coastal defence got to do with this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to vote money for various Departments. I could relate this to the Taoiseach's Department, to the Department of <Col N="2284" /> External Affairs and to the Department of Education.  If the people of this country had been educated to the point of realising the implications of the commitments of this country and of the agreements and pacts made by it&mdash;one would not expect individuals like Senator Healy to understand it&mdash; they would certainly be able to form a rough idea of this for themselves.  But, apparently, the standard of education on which we are spending £5,000,000 a year is such that the people can carry on in blind, blissful and totally contented ignorance of matters that most vitally affect the well-being and proper running of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Article 6, there is the statement referring to a condition essentially temporary governed by the words &ldquo;until such time&rdquo;.  Article 7 begins as though it were <i>ab initio</i> without relation to the previous Article.  I do not propose to quote the exact words.  The first section of it begins somewhat in this way: that the Irish Government shall grant to the British Government certain facilities, and, in the second part, it says that in times of war the Irish Government shall grant to the British Government certain other facilities.  In relation to these two Articles, there is a reference made to a schedule or an annex which refers to these ports.  When you come to the end of Article 7 it says, having set out the facilities which shall be granted, &ldquo;for the purposes of such defence as aforesaid&rdquo; or aforementioned. You will see that the defence referred to in Article 6 is controlled by the opening words, &ldquo;until such time&rdquo;.  Consequently, the Treaty clearly had in mind that Ireland in the position it was in at that time&mdash;it was not foreseen at that moment that we were going to have a disastrous civil war thrust upon us&mdash;would not be able to take the appropriate steps for the taking over of coastal defence. It even considered that coastal defence would be taken over in instalments, because Article 6 provided that, at the end of five years, there would be a conference directed to Ireland taking over a certain portion of its coastal defence.  I know, of course, that when you say &ldquo;until such time as an agreement <Col N="2285" /> has been reached between the British and the Irish Government whereby either will take over coastal defence&rdquo; the argument could be made that as an agreement requires the consent of two parties the British Government, by withholding such consent, could have kept that condition going indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I here and now assert that although many points of interpretation of the Treaty were argued, and argued at great length, between the Irish Government and the British Government, there never was any question raised by the British Government as to the provisions of Article 6 and 7 being other than temporary.  In 1926, I agreed myself at the time of the calling of the Imperial Conference, that there should be merely a formal meeting postponing the proposed conference with regard to the taking over of part of the coastal defence.  In February, 1928, when I arrived back from America with the then President Cosgrave, I was met by two representatives of the British Government.  As well as I can recollect, they were Sir Harry Batty and Sir James Harding. What they wanted to discuss with me was what action was to be taken against farmers on Bere Island who had ceased to pay their rents since the period of the Civil War.  I said that, as they held the place of landlords, it was a matter between themselves and the tenants, and that the obvious mode of approach for them was to take action in our courts.  They said that their Government was not prepared to do that because they assumed that we would, if we felt disposed, take over those ports.  Their attitude was that they were protecting what I may call the land-owning rights with regard to Bere Island until such time as we decided to take over the ports and until they came into our hands. They were merely calling attention to the matter for our good.  Anyway, the whole discussion was based upon the position that had been unchallenged from the beginning, namely, that when we were prepared to take over our coastal defence of those places, in fulfilment of the Treaty of 1921, they would be handed over to us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2286" /> I do not understand why they were not taken over in 1932.  When I was responsible, I frankly was in no hurry because I wanted to know what financial commitments would be involved in undertaking our coastal defence.  It will be remembered that during those previous years we had maintained a very low level of taxation out of which, of course, we had to pay large sums in relation to the civil war. Now, here we are being asked to vote money to a Government which not only has education in the condition in which it is, but actually seeks to capitalise on the ignorance that there is in the country and to play up to it: to get advantage from the fact that the people are so ignorant of the pacts made during their own lifetime and of their repercussions upon the activities of the country.</P>
    <P>Again, we are being asked to vote money in this Bill for what, in a way, is one of the most basic duties and functions of a Government, namely, for the policing of the country, and the maintenance of security for life and property which good order necessarily requires.  Last week, or the week before, we had statements made by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Justice.  I do not expect anybody here to listen to the speeches I make much less to remember them.  Possibly I am more appreciative of, and more interested in, the things I say myself, but I well remember getting up here time and time again and arguing the very point which the Minister for Justice argued last week.  He referred, if not very specifically, yet unmistakably, to the murders which were committed in Coventry and in other places in England at about the time of the outbreak of the war.  At that time, I got up and said exactly what I thought, and what any right-minded person necessarily thought, of murderers going over from this country to murder unfortunate citizens in England. I believe that those who are responsible for maintaining order and civilisation in this country, the very Government of the country, far from supporting the line that I took here, the only line that anybody who cares for the good name of Ireland and for <Col N="2287" /> the dignity of our people could possibly take, actually made representations to the British Government, asking that Irishmen in England who were guilty of murder should not receive the punishment that the ordinary British citizen would get, presumably on the assumption that there could not be expected from Irishmen the same moral code that every civilised country expects from its citizens.</P>

      <P>Time and again&mdash; and I am now coming to the whole question of the cost of the Government&mdash;I protested against the release of a man guilty of the brutal murder of an unfortunate boy named Egan in Dungarvan.  A man having been found guilty and sentenced to death was duly reprieved by the Government, and, if I remember rightly, after a few months, was released upon the people. I protested against the release of a known criminal merely on the ground that he was engaged in a hunger strike.  The Taoiseach last week said <Col N="2288" /> that it was one of the great regrets of his life that he ever did it, but I protested against that at the time, and had to face the resistance of the Government and a certain amount of misrepresentation and blackguardism all over the country as a result.  On the strength of it, I received blackmailing and threatening letters from certain anonymous cowards belonging to an organisation called the I.R.A.</P>

      <P>With regard to the hunger-strikers, the courts were completely disregarded and, as I say, men in jail were released and the argument put up&mdash;it was put against me here&mdash; was that even members of the Opposition had asked for the release of that hunger-striker.  I think I have consistently tried to regard the position of opposition as one of responsibility, unlike the present Government when they were in Opposition, but the Government must take its responsibility. A Government can only release a man or remit sentence when it is satisfied that the ends of the common good will be better achieved by the non-fulfilment of the penalty rather than by its fulfilment, but the Minister responsible in that matter, with a complete non-awareness of his own responsibility, says that people not members of the Government had asked for the release of this man.  The responsibility was the Government's and there is, to my mind, nothing more utterly contemptible or irresponsible than the action of a man who says: &ldquo;Though I have accepted this position of <Col N="2289" /> supreme responsibility, I seek an alibi and I seek to shelter behind the fact that people whose responsibility is not mine and who have not the same facilities for being aware of repercussions as I have, have, in the light of the information they had, asked that this man be released.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is responsible for the whole policy.  I do not want to go right through all these things, but he is responsible for the Revenue Commissioners who collect this money from the people.  He is responsible for the whole working of the Government&mdash;a Government which, when it lets out a murderer to murder its own police, says: &ldquo;Some of the Opposition asked us to let him out&rdquo;. Such a concept of Government responsibility <Col N="2290" /> is beneath contempt.  It is a concept which, carried to its logical conclusion, will hasten our departure from standards of civilisation even more than is the case at present.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is responsible for our relations with other countries.  It was only last week that, for the first time, it was publicly announced that a certain man who descended here in a parachute, presumably from an aeroplane belonging to a foreign Government, had with him a plan for the invasion of this country.  I should like to know what was done about that. That was a case, so far as I can judge from the information vouchsafed to us, in which a foreign Government sent over, against our sovereign rights, a man in an aeroplane to be dropped by parachute from that aeroplane, to get in touch with criminal elements in this country working to subvert the order which exists here, and with a plan for the invasion of this country.  When we talk about this neutrality, is it a neutrality which is such that no matter what any other country chooses to do, no matter how it chooses to threaten to outrage our sovereignty and independence we sit down and say: &ldquo;No matter what you do, we refuse to raise a hand or voice against you?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The fact that a man sent in an aeroplane belonging to a foreign power is dropped here with a plan for invasion is pointed to as an explanation why men belonging to an organisation responsible for many murders in this country are kept in prison, but I want to know more.  I want to know what steps were taken with regard to that foreign Government.  We are going to maintain this neutrality, but anybody can be neutral if he says: &ldquo;No matter how you spit in my face or kick me, I will not raise a hand against you.&rdquo; That seems to me to have been the line we have taken.  We protest when American troops come into Northern Ireland.  I am not aware that we protested when British or Canadian troops came in.  We protested against American troops coming in, but we did not protest when Belfast was bombed, so far as I know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think that the Minister, when he gave that information about a parachutist last week, should have gone further and told us exactly what steps were taken with regard to him.  So far as the Senator is concerned with carrion crows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should have given the information in the Dáil last week.  What I am aiming at here all through is that the Government seems to me to act with total irresponsibility.  As I say, it imposes upon us, in a way which can be changed only by referendum, a form of election which leads to what the Government itself calls national disaster. The leaders of the Government have used the ignorance of the people to try to fool them still further with regard to neutrality and other matters.  I do not want to keep the House unduly long but one thing I have always tried to give in this House is all support to the maintenance of ordered government in this country.  The idea that somehow or other it has to be assumed that, if you criticise any aspect, or even the totality of Government policy, your alternative is no Government, is not sound.  You have not only to see that you have a Government, but that the proper men are chosen to seek the end which is required, namely, the well-being of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to refer to another matter which I am sure some people may protest about.  Last year, or maybe this year, the Tánaiste, on behalf of the Taoiseach and the Government, <Col N="2292" /> explained to the Dáil that a certain outrageous speech made by a Deputy of his own Party should not be taken seriously, because it was known that the Deputy was a &ldquo;buffoon,&rdquo; and that his speeches were mere buffoonery. One could say that was all to the good.  The Government, having accepted this &ldquo;buffoon&rdquo; as a proper representative of the people in the Legislature&mdash;they were unaware of it at the time, but now they know it&mdash;at the last election the same &ldquo;buffoon&rdquo; went up as a representative of the Government. Now, either the Government were right when they said he was a &ldquo;buffoon,&rdquo; in which case it was criminal to put that man up as a member of their Party to represent the people, or they were wrong when they said he was a &ldquo;buffoon&rdquo;, inasmuch as they regarded him as being of that particularly elect nature amongst men that makes him particularly suitable to participate in the Legislature, and to guide the people of the country to the attainment of the country's well-being.</P>
    <P>Here we are voting money.  I am not going to vote against it, because I agree that we must have some Government. I am willing to agree that the Government got a lot of votes, while their &ldquo;buffoon&rdquo; headed the poll in south-east Cork.  The Government have created an electoral system which makes for national disaster, if you take their whole concept of their responsibility with regard to the people.  It is now I appreciate the Minister for Justice for the frank statement and the strong line he took against that completely discredited clamour for the release of criminals in this country. While I appreciate that, we must recognise that all this time we have been paying for a Department of Justice and for a Prime Minister responsible for a Government who have shown by their own words and by their own acts that they have a complete disregard for all that is implicit in the responsibility that they have accepted.  Therefore, we are in this position, as I say, that we have to vote for this.  But, in spite of the many attempts to make me keep quiet, or to make me say popular things which would have everybody <Col N="2293" /> saying: &ldquo;What patriotic sentiments,&rdquo; instead of what my neighbour here calls &ldquo;acting the part of a carrion crow,&rdquo; I have never understood that the service of my country required me to take a line which I did not believe to be true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that I was not aware that we made a formal protest against that, in the same way as I am aware that we made a formal protest when American troops were landed in Ulster.  I am not aware that we made any formal protest when Canadian troops were landed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>We did more than make a formal protest.  Did we not send the best equipment out of the resources we had available in order to help these people in their trouble?  Were not all our doors thrown open to them to help them in their difficulties?  The Senator rather implies that we cheered and raised our hats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that if I came along and saw a man being murdered by a blackguard, I certainly would take my handkerchief and try to bind his wounds, but that I thought it was equally binding on me to try to bring the criminal to justice.  In this case, apparently, the Senator's line is that the only duty of Governments and of people, when they see a man murdered or semi-murdered, is to give him a decent burial or to attend to his wounds and take him to hospital, but that you must never say a word against the murderer.  That seems to me to represent the Senator's line.  As I say, I am not going to try to buy popularity; I do not think I ever have tried. I am not going to serve my country by pretending something is true which I do not believe is true.  I think that nothing I have said to-day is otherwise than consistent with what I have said on other occasions.  I do say that what was stated by the representatives of the Government condemned themselves, because when I took the line <Col N="2294" /> that I took and told them they were rejecting their responsibility and leading this country on the path to disaster, I was voted down on the matter. Now they turn round and tell us with appalling hypocrisy that the supreme regret of their lives is that they let out this man to murder.  From 1932 onwards they consistently let out men known to be implicated in murder plots.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzgerald tells us that he has said his say. I wonder am I in order in examining his post-mortem on electioneering speeches relative to our neutrality and the conditions which have made neutrality possible.  I regret to notice the failing memory of the Senator and that a great many important items concerned with the coastal defence of this country have already escaped the memory of an ex-Minister for External Affairs.  I suppose, as we grow older, we all begin to fail mentally, but this failure is highly regrettable on the present occasion.  I wonder does Senator Fitzgerald recall how often, when he was Minister for External Affairs, the present speaker, in the Dáil, pointed out a flaw&mdash;which should have been very obvious&mdash;in the terms of the Treaty in regard to our coastal safety.  I recollect well the analogy of a famous case in the days of duelling in the Phoenix Park.  A barrister challenged another to a duel.  It happened that the challenger was a very big man and the recipient of the challenge a very small man.  The person challenged exercised the privilege of his position by choosing pistols.  As the challenger felt that he was a better mark for a pistol than the other, the other generously agreed that his outline <Col N="2295" /> should be chalked on the challenger's gigantic figure and that any shot that hit outside the mark should not count.  That was precisely the position under the Treaty.  Article 7 of the Treaty, which the Senator was able to quote fairly correctly but inadequately, stated that in time of peace England was at liberty to choose certain strategic positions, and in the annex to the Treaty to which the Senator has referred specific places were indicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>If we exercised the privilege which we reserved for ourselves in that Article of the Treaty, then a foreign Power at war with England could easily say to us, in the blandest of language: &ldquo;We are very sorry, we must attack this position. It is occupied by British troops and any shot that kills any of your nationals or destroys your buildings must not count.&rdquo; That was the type of neutrality that was understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me come back to Article 6; there was to have been a revision of certain Articles, notably 5 and 6.  At the end of five years the whole position of Saorstát Eireann taking on its own coastal defence would be gone into. Meanwhile, His Majesty's Naval Forces were to take on the duty of guarding the Irish coast as part of the security of the safety of Great Britain.  What the Senator forgot to quote was that in March, 1926, at one of the most important of the international conferences within the British Commonwealth of Nations, there was a committee, presided over by the late Earl Balfour.  That conference was attended <Col N="2296" /> by the President of our Executive Council and one of his Ministers, and the report was signed on our behalf by these two Ministers.  In that report while Great Britain reiterated the thesis in our Treaty and Constitution, that the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations are co-equal, Lord Balfour very astutely put in a reservation which secured for Great Britain the hegemony of the British Commonwealth, that equality of status did not connote identity of function&mdash;a fine piece of metaphysics which came very naturally to Lord Balfour, but was not understood, as I pointed out in the debates in the Dáil afterwards, by our sapient Ministers. Co-equality of status did not connote identity of function, and so Great Britain reserved to herself the control of war and peace as carried on by the Navy and the Army&mdash;His Majesty's Navy and His Majesty's Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>That made it possible for a certain Minister for External Affairs, by name Fitzgerald, to make an egregious speech in the Dáil to the effect that in the case of a general attack upon these islands&mdash; these are his own words&mdash;the military forces of Saorstát Eireann&mdash;I forget the exact words he used in this case, but they were equivalent to these&mdash; would take their stand alongside of the British forces in resisting that general attack.

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out, first of all, that the Senator, who is so exact, is quite wrong.  No such meeting as he mentions took place in March, 1926.  It was late in the year.  There was no query whatever.  At that very meeting that he speaks of the British asked would we then go ahead with the proposal for the taking over of part of our coastal defences.  I myself proposed that that be postponed.  What I have pointed out here to-day is that, as far as these ports were concerned, specifically, it was laid down in the Treaty that the holding of these ports by Great Britain was essentially temporary and, as far back as 1928, the British Government said that they assumed we were going to take them over at what time we chose.  That was the case I made here.  The present Senator has sought by his own <i>ipse dixit</i> to interpret the words in the Balfour Declaration which must be interpreted in the light of the 1929 Conference and the 1930 Imperial Conference and the Statute of Westminster.</P>

      <P>I may point out that the form of neutrality which was possible under the Treaty in those days was that the Dáil, in accordance with the Constitution, could refuse to declare war; it could declare for peace and, according to the Constitution, which was accepted by Great Britain, in the English Parliament, that was within the competence of the Saorstát Eireann as a member of the British Commonwealth, notwithstanding the hitherto well-established doctrine of Constitutional law that when the King was at war all his subjects were at war, and one of the terms of the Oath contains this reference, &ldquo;in virtue of our common citizenship.&rdquo; So, it was regarded as a great matter, and it was a great matter, that Saorstát Eireann should have the privilege that its Dáil could declare for peace even though the King, as King of Great Britain and Ireland, was at war or the King, in his capacity of President of the British Commonwealth, was at war.</P>
      <P>Now I point out the thing that the Senator overlooked, to wit, how the position was modified by the acceptance on the part of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations of that claim of Great Britain for hegemony in regard to the Navy and Army.

      <P>I am dealing with past affairs, not future.  The position with regard to the islands of the south was that the British continued to occupy them as strategic positions. Deputy Cosgrave said on one occasion &mdash;I think it was in 1937 or 1938&mdash;that he was offered Spike Island and refused to take it, but in the recent election he modified that and declared that he calculated it would cost £342,000&mdash;an outlay of something like that figure&mdash;and he refused it.  Now, that is the testimony of Deputy Cosgrave, testimony to the effect that had he taken it over, as a temporary approach to the taking over of coastal defences into our own hands, it would have necessitated considerable outlay. Why should he object to get back Irish territory into Irish hands on the ground of expense?  I am defending ex-President Cosgrave on this point, because I point out what nobody has pointed out on his behalf, not even himself.  He objected to spend Irish money to rehabilitate military defences which he knew, under those Articles of the Treaty to which Senator Fitzgerald referred just now, would be taken over by Great Britain and used by Great Britain.</P>

      <P>The case I am making is that until the advent of Fianna Fáil to power in 1932, the circumstances in this country were that the Treaty was recognised as between the two States and, so long as the Treaty was recognised as between the two States, the position unmistakably was that Great Britain in time of peace and in time of war or of strained relations was at liberty to use certain <Col N="2301" /> strategic positions.  Senator Fitzgerald said that that was temporary; but temporary has nothing whatever to do with the essence of the case.  The position was that in certain circumstances this country would here and there be occupied by British forces in defence of Great Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The situation was essentially altered in 1938.  The whole relationship between the Twenty-Six County State and Great Britain underwent a revolutionary change&mdash;that is unquestionable&mdash;and part of the settlement made in that year&mdash;I think it was in April&mdash;gave us Spike Island and some other bases, which we took over.  The present Government have spent over £600,000&mdash; the Minister for Finance will give the figures correctly, if we need to have meticulous correctness; but I think the figure was upwards of £660,000&mdash;in the defence of the Irish coast.  Surely Senator Fitzgerald does not ask us to believe that the country's education is defective because it cannot take as identical situations which are wholly different?  It is because the Irish people are alive to what has happened, and to the very marked advance in our international position that has taken place since 1938, that the arguments that he complains of were addressed to the Irish people. Had it been possible for Great Britain legally to occupy Spike Island and those other places, they would have been occupied in this war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read of members of Parliament in the English House of Commons declaring that thousands of lives have been lost because the British were not allowed to occupy those ports.  Surely the Senator is alive to the current facts, he who chooses to be the tutor and reprover of the Irish people for their lack of knowledge of current events?  The ports would have been occupied and the result would be that the presence of those forces would have involved us in war, whether we liked it or not.</P>
      <P>Another point, to show how little the Senator appreciates facts.  He says Mr. de Valera lodged a protest against the landing of American troops in the Six Counties, and he asks why did he not make a similar protest in respect of Canadian troops, who were there before the Americans came.  Surely that is the question of a child.  It is a puerile remark to make.  The Canadian troops were troops from another member of the Commonwealth and the Six Counties are an Imperial province, portion of the Empire.  The British troops, or any troops that come to their aid in any form of alliance are entitled, under international law, to occupy the Six Counties.  There is not the parity such as the Senator asks us to accept between the presence of American troops in the Six Counties, which we claim to be part of Ireland, and the presence in it of British troops, because in accordance with the settlement, that miserable and infamous settlement to which Senator Fitzgerald was privy&mdash;to wit, that of December, 1925&mdash;the Six Counties are included, as the King's title indicates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the authority of Mr. Cosgrave for the statement that he was offered the ports and refused them.  In recent times, he declared that his refusal was based on the fact that acceptance of them would entail an expenditure of £342,000.  I do not now propose to dilate on the implications of the statement that Irish territory was not to be taken over from any Power because it would involve the expenditure of money.  He, as the maker of the settlement of December, 1925, declared that it was &ldquo;a damn good bargain&rdquo; because it exchanged six counties of our 32 for a supposed release from taxation under Article 5. The one unmistakable thing is that, if the settlement of 1938 had not been made, we should have had not merely British troops in various positions here but American troops as well.

I want to put a few realistic points to the Minister.  There was a good deal of talk during the election about family allowances.  I understand that the Minister has indicated that he will have provision made in the next Budget for this very important and very necessary social reform.  I put it to the Minister that the time is ripe when such a measure should be introduced. We ought to have it now, without a promise of having it at a not too far distant date.  An Emergency Budget might be introduced to deal with it.  I hope that the Minister will indicate the intentions of the Government on this very important matter.  It is one that cries out for immediate application, seeing that there is agreement on it amongst all Parties in this House and in the Dáil, no matter how we may differ on other things.  That unanimity would not be there only that the need is urgent.  I hope the Minister will be able to indicate how soon we may expect this reform.  There is no use in telling us that provision to <Col N="2307" /> deal with it will be made in the next Budget.  Provision could be made this year in an Emergency Budget to meet what is a real emergency.  It was referred to during the election, and I hope it will not be forgotten or be put into the Limbo of £les in Government Departments.  Other matters that I wish to refer to can be dealt with under the Emergency Powers (Continuance) Bill.  I am very anxious to hear the Minister, and hope he will be able to tell us what provision will be made for this very urgent reform.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to listen to Senator Foran after the rather barren discussion that we listened to.  We are not now dealing with ancient history, but with the desirability of providing a sum of money to meet the extraordinary expenditure that the Government has incurred during the emergency.  It is only waste of time to be going back on the history of the past 20 years, and to be talking about the merits of a former Government or of the present Government in dealing with the situation that now exists.  I could state that but for the present Government we would be involved in this war and Senators on the other side could argue against that.  A discussion of that kind would not get us anywhere.  We are looking to the future and we are more interested in what is going to happen when this war is over.  We are certainly interested in knowing that at least we have escaped the worst of this war.  There is undoubtedly criticism of the amount of money we are asked to vote, and there was considerable criticism in the other House of various Departments of State and the way in which they spent the money.  It is as well to make it clear to everybody that we are living in an abnormal world and, if our national expenditure is abnormal, that is due to the abnormal circumstances of the time in which we are living.  As Senator Foran pointed out we should be more interested in what is going to happen in future.  It may not be easy to plan for that.  The post-war period is going to be a very serious one, and this House and the other House would <Col N="2308" /> be doing better work by trying to formulate a plan to meet the situation in which this country as well as other countries in Europe will find themselves when the war ends.  It is very inadvisable to be going into past history and to resurrect old wrongs and old disputes instead of endeavouring to plan for what will face us in the future.</P>

      <P>In his eloquent speech Senator Magennis made reference to certain Senators treating the House to a swan song and, if I remember rightly, the swan sang &ldquo;a wild carol ere her death.&rdquo; Certainly we had Senator Fitzgerald's swan song to-day and he made no mistake about making it a wild carol.  I think it was the most miserable, reckless and irresponsible exhibition of bad manners seen since this House met.  In connection with his irresponsibility, the Senator made a statement about neutrality which, if he were to be taken seriously, could do irreparable damage to this country.  I am satisfied about that.  I am only sorry that Senators on this side of the House did not treat Senator Fitzgerald with the same contempt as members of his own party treated him, because while he was speaking it was significant that only two members of his Party remained in the House to hear his ridiculous swan song.  When referring to the Constitution Senator Fitzgerald stated he was satisfied that not one person in 100 had read or was interested in it.  It is hardly necessary to point out to the House that Senator Fitzgerald is completely out of touch with the ordinary people and with what is known as &ldquo;the man-in-the-street&rdquo;. If the Senator knew the country as we know it, he would admit that the people there go very carefully into every line of an important document like the Constitution, and into other items of legislation that come before the Oireachtas and, if anybody wants instruction on any item of legislation passed in either House, the best place to get it is in a country district from some man who is interested in that particular type of legislation.  That is where it will be found.  Senator Fitzgerald stands on a pinnacle.  I do not believe that anybody <Col N="2309" /> ever got much credit for getting to the top of a pinnacle who then looked down on the people of the country and on the members of this House. The Senator insinuated that nobody but himself understood the position. If we wanted any evidence of the contempt of Senator Fitzgerald for the party he represents in this House, or for the Ministry with which he was associated in the past, it is only necessary to take his own words, where he stated that the ports could have been taken over all along; that there was no trouble about doing so.</P>
      <P>If that could be done then why were they not taken over?  The Senator's answer was that there was no immediate hurry about doing so.  My reply is that if the Taoiseach and his Ministers had taken up the attitude, that there was no hurry, we would have found ourselves when this war broke out with the ports in the occupation of another country.  While I do not care what Senator Fitzgerald or anyone else says, I believe the results would have been disastrous for us.  The Senator's treatment of the situation in the North was adequately dealt with by Senator Foran, when he referred to his attitude as that of a carrion crow.  I do not think it is necessary to say any more about Senator Fitzgerald's speech, but to assure the Senator that if there were a few people&mdash;I suppose there are&mdash;in this country who had not read the Constitution before war broke out, they have done so since then, and they know why this country was able to continue to remain in a state of peace.  Those who had not read the Constitution at the time it was passed have gone to considerable trouble to do so since, and have seen for themselves that the Constitution was the only reason why it was possible for this Government to keep us out of the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also suggested that the Taoiseach claimed for himself and for the Fianna Fáil Party sole responsibility for our neutrality.  Certainly not.  The Fianna Fáil party did not claim sole responsibility for making our neutrality possible.  We challenge contradiction on that now. We do not say that we are solely responsible <Col N="2310" /> for neutrality, because we could not do it if the other parties in the country did not join up and present a united front on that question. In connection with Senator Baxter's speech, I think that he also should be congratulated.  He changed his speech, and perhaps it was his swan song, also.  I was listening to him very carefully and I was quite amused, I must say, and I wondered why he changed his speech.  When he was speaking here before, his complaint was about the high cost of living and all that.  I suppose he told the people during the election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Senator did not make a statement on the high cost of living, he should have made it.  Everything possible should be done to keep down the cost of living but in the attempts we made we got very little assistance from Senator Baxter.  In any case, we are now facing a Seanad election and appeals have to be made to different people.  Senator Baxter tells us that he does not believe that agricultural output has been increased and he is very uneasy lest the Government may be satisfied with the present position. If the members of the Government were satisfied with the present position, surely we would not have Ministers going around the country to special meetings for the purpose of getting output increased?  We would not have Ministers coming into this House time after time to tell us that it is necessary to increase agricultural output, and to answer people like Senator Baxter who are complaining about shortages of food for animals. Time and again, Ministers have pointed out that the only way in which sufficient food can be provided for animals is by having a surplus for the human beings.  Unless we can get sufficient production to provide adequate food for human beings and a surplus to provide for animals then, if anybody is to go short, it must be the animals.</P>

Surely, we are in a different position from people in England?  If we were in the same position as England, Senator Baxter would be the first man to protest.  He would say that the people were being marshalled under dictatorship, and that they were being ordered to do this and that.  Maybe we will have to get to that stage.  I hope not.  I believe that if farmers are left alone, and not interfered with by weathercock politicians, they will continue to do their duty to this country as in the past and continue to produce food. Senator Baxter goes on to say that if we had men to put on the land we would be better off, but, of course, we have not got them, because the Government is allowing them out of the country.  If the Government refused to allow them out, what would the attitude of Senator Baxter be?</P>

      <P>Yes, to the extent that any men required for agricultural work will not be allowed out, and representations are regularly made by friends of Senator Baxter to get a permit for Johnny so-and-so to leave the country.  That is the kind of argument we have to listen to in the face of an election.  We are told that if we had fertility in the soil we could do something else.  If we had not grown wheat for the last two years we would have more fertility, and more room to <Col N="2312" /> raise wheat and other crops.  What were we to do in war conditions when we needed tillage?  What alternative was there but the alternative of the people belonging to Senator Baxter's Party who said they would not grow wheat and would not be found dead in a field of it?  But, this Government was long-sighted and, unlike Senator Baxter's Party, looked ahead and saw the possibilities of the years to come. As soon as they got into power, they settled down to a policy of wheat growing, and because of that policy we are in a position to-day to feed this country.</P>
      <P>I will not deal with Senator McGee's statements at all, because I do not believe that any Senator could be serious in making them.  He suggested that the Government should go out on smuggling expeditions to get in artificial manures.  I will not refer to it, because I do not believe he was serious, but at this meeting, before we go to the country for re-election, we should be more serious and should not allow ourselves to be carried away by ridiculous, nonsensical and dangerous statements like those made to-day.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald says nobody has read the Constitution and he makes statements which are completely irrelevant, as if the Constitution was hidden away in Government Departments. This document was circulated to every Senator.  Every member of the House was given a list of items for which money was required, and for which no money was required, and this list was circulated at considerable expense to people who will not go to the trouble of reading it.  He pleads complete ignorance.  If he would tell us the things he knows it would not take us so much trouble telling the things he does not know.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to take part in this debate, which seems to have travelled over what I thought was completely ancient history, and, in fact, what I intend to say to the House might have come in more <Col N="2313" /> appropriately with reference to the Emergency Powers Bill than on this one.  But, leaving out things I might have said with reference to that Bill, there are some things which ought to be said with reference to points raised by Senators Baxter, Quirke and others.  I think that one of the reasons for our present difficulties in the agricultural situation is the fact that Anglo-Irish commercial relations are not what they should be, and have not been what they should have been ever since 1932.  Of course, we all imagined that the so-called economic war had been settled in 1938, and I vaguely thought it had been, but, actually, a very important aspect of that war against our economic and commercial interests has been continued ever since 1933 and still continues. That began in 1933 as a quota limitation on the export of Irish cattle, especially fat cattle, and, in the Articles of Agreement of 1938, the right to impose a quota limitation on our cattle and other agricultural exports still exists, and can still be used as a whip to whip us in any attempt we make to approach the British with reference to more satisfactory commercial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how or where the blame should be distributed between the two Government, but, personally, I hold both the British and Irish Governments equally responsible for the present unsatisfactory commercial relations between the two countries, and, ultimately, for the ill health of our agricultural position.  The fact that agricultural output is not increasing, though doubtless re-orientating itself from what was normal some years ago, is partly the result of the war situation, and partly the result of the differential prices imposed on us by British policy in recent years, prices which we tamely accept.  This is one of the matters which makes me wonder more than anything else that we have not a national government in this country, a government thoroughly national in every sense of the term.  Of course, I know that the Fianna Fáil Government claims to be national.  I, personally, would not object to a Government, under present conditions, all <Col N="2314" /> of whose members were members of the Fianna Fáil Party, if they fulfilled their functions in the spirit of a truly national government, but they seem to hesitate to put their cards on the table and to approach their British neighbours, as a government, with propositions which, if rightly understood and fully presented, could only eventuate in our commercial relations with Britain being put on such a basis as would stimulate the production of agricultural products here for the people of Britain as well as for ourselves.</P>
    <P>We have about 12,000,000 acres of land here, and if our agriculture were what it should be, we could feed ourselves with the produce of 6,000,000 of those acres and have the produce of the other 6,000,000 acres for export, and there is nowhere to send that excess produce to except Britain. Actually, however, we find that, owing to these various causes, these failures of policy on the part of both Governments, the whole of the produce of our 12,000,000 acres of land is scarcely able to supply ourselves with some products which are essential to our life and comfort, and that in the case of some commodities, which we formerly exported, because we had a surplus of them, not alone is the supply inadequate to enable us to export any of them, but there is not enough for our own people's consumption.</P>
    <P>That situation, as I say, is directly the result of the differential price policy imposed upon us by British policy, which we have tamely accepted.  Everyone knows that a fat beast, finished fat and exported for immediate slaughter in Britain, commands a price some 14/- a cwt. less than the price of a similar beast, born, reared and finished in Britain or Northern Ireland.  We are penalised for finishing and fattening cattle for Britain and, consequently, the whole process and practice of the stall-feeding of cattle, especially in winter time, has completely disappeared within the last ten years and, as one indirect result of that, the quantity and quality of farmyard manure available for agriculture has diminished in those years. Consequently, the various crops which, directly or indirectly, owe their productivity <Col N="2315" /> to farmyard manure are either not as good as they would be if we had the manure, or we have to use more land in order to get enough food for ourselves, because it is a wellknown fact that, if land is not put in proper rotation and treated with adequate farmyard manure, you cannot grow even cereal crops with safety and advantage.  Accordingly, the question of our agricultural sickness is partly a question of price policy; and the question of price policy is partly a question of the relations between our country and Britain, as a result of the fact that, when the so-called economic war came to an end, the price war did not come to an end.  That is neither in the interest of our country nor that of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Now we find ourselves exporting agricultural labour to Britain instead of agricultural produce.  In Britain and Northern Ireland agriculture is paid at a very much higher rate than it can be paid here.  Again, that is partly the result of the prices which the Irish farmer gets for his finished products being so very much lower than the prices which the British or Northern Ireland farmer gets, and because of that differential price, differentiating against us, our farmers find more and more difficulty in keeping agricultural labour at the present relatively low wage they are paying, because they cannot afford to pay the higher wage that would prevent agricultural labour from exporting itself to Britain.</P>
    <P>Another aspect, however, of our peculiar agricultural situation is this tendency towards the export of female cattle for breeding stock: the export of in-calf heifers and springers which, if carried to a great excess, might have injurious effects on our agriculture, but I do not wish to develop that point now because I have mentioned it on former occasions.  In this matter, although I speak as a representative of agricultural interests, I also advocate an approach to Britain, by a Government acting in the spirit of a truly national Government, from a British point of view as well as the Irish point of view, because it is, <Col N="2316" /> surely, in the British interest that there should be as much food produced here, available for export to Britain, as we can possibly produce to export to her after providing for ourselves. It is quite disingenuous, for example, for them to say that they are out to get all the food they can from us when they have a price policy which deliberately discourages us from producing that food for export.  Judging by a debate in the House of Lords, there has at last appeared in England to be a certain realisation of the fact that British commercial policy, as applied to Eire and our agriculture, is injurious to Britain as well as to us, and that it is quite time that something was done about it from their point of view as well as from ours.  I would urge that the Minister should seize that favourable moment in the awakening of British public opinion in order to put his case to Britain for a revision of our commercial relations in such a way as will put our agricultural industry on a thoroughly sound and prosperous basis.</P>

      <P>Ní rabhas chun labhairt in aon chor.  We were called here for the purpose of giving our approval to a Vote on Account.  Senator Douglas dealt with the matter in a sensible manner, but it is terrible, Sir, to have to sit here all day and listen to a repetition of the same speeches that we have had to listen to day in and day out, and year in and year out, for the last few years. The only reason I stand up to speak now is that I regret that Senator Fitzgerald took the liberty of dragging a lady's name into this House&mdash;a lady whose life has been an example to her sex; a lady whose life has been an example to everybody who knew her&mdash;and that is Mrs. de Valera.  From my own experience, I can say that we worked together in the old Gaelic League movement and, unquestionably, she was an example to us all.  Therefore, in these, my last remarks to this Seanad, I must enter an emphatic protest against her name being dragged in here.</P>

      <P>There is one matter that I should like to raise, and, as it <Col N="2317" /> is within the Minister's special jurisdiction, perhaps he will be able to tell us what his intention is, or what is the intention of the Government, regarding it, and that is the question of an increase in pensions for pensioned public servants.  The matter has been raised before, but I should like to hear from the Minister whether it is his intention to do anything about that in the near future.  A number of public servants&mdash;civil servants, teachers, local employees, and so on&mdash;are trying to exist on a pension which might be suitable enough for them in normal times but which, certainly, in view of the big increase in the cost of living, is not adequate, and, as a result, they are suffering under great hardship.</P>
      <P>The pensions, as we know, were based on salaries which were suitable for normal times, but even at that they were only half the salaries on which they retired, and it must be a matter of great difficulty for these people now, seeing that the cost of living has increased by something like 50 per cent., to try to exist on their pensions.  The salaries which were paid in the Civil Service were not such as would enable these officials to put by savings for their old age, and I should like the Minister to do what he can, and as soon as he can, in the way of bringing them some relief.  It was found necessary to make some small increases by way of emergency bonus in the remuneration of the existing public servants, and I think that something should be done to meet the claims which have been put forward from time to time on behalf of these pensioned public servants, either by making an increase in their existing pensions, or by way of bonus or otherwise.</P>

      <P>During this debate we have heard accusations made by Senator Fitzgerald.  There was one Article of the Constitution which, I think, was misunderstood, and that was Article 41.  Perhaps I misunderstood it myself, and I want an assurance from the Minister on the point. It was interpreted as limiting the freedom and the social and political activities <Col N="2318" /> of women, making them slaves and chattels.  I do not take that view at all.  I thought one of the sections of it really contained a definite undertaking on the part of the Irish people &mdash;the Constitution is the voice of the Irish people&mdash;that women would not be forced by economic necessity to undertake work which would make them neglect their families.  Implicit in that, it seems to me, is an admission that the principle of family allowances is accepted by the Irish people, and so I was particularly glad when Senator Foran brought forward the question to-day and reminded the Minister that we should like to see them made as generous as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Government have taken cognisance of some of the needs of poorer families&mdash;there are food allowances and fuel allowances&mdash; but one thing which is going to press very hard on poor mothers is the provision of clothes for their families.  I cannot see how that is to be met in any other way than by some system of money allowances&mdash;family allowances. The difficulties encountered by poor families in getting clothes have now been increased by the disinclination of ordinary middle-class people to part with old clothes which they might find it difficult to replace.  The question of the provision of clothes and boots, therefore, will become a very urgent one for the poor.  I take this opportunity of reminding the Minister to think of that great necessity when the question of family allowances comes up.</P>
      <P>I should also like to back up Senator O'Connell in his plea that some consideration be extended to the pensioners. Bonuses were granted to aid everybody to stand up to the increased cost of living.  That increased cost of living presses as heavily on pensioners as on anybody else, and they should not be left submerged when everybody else is getting help.  I was glad to hear Senator O'Connell making a plea for them, and I should like to add my voice in support of his.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with previous speakers in pleading with the Minister to consider the position of those servants of the State who are out on pension, and who have no means of meeting the increased cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the housing question, I would urge on the Minister the necessity for giving a better subsidy for the erection of houses, but it is not so much in relation to the building of the houses that I wish to speak as in regard to the allocation of the houses which are being built.  The local authorities, in order to avail of the full subsidy, have to comply with the condition that the occupants of the new houses be people from the slum areas.  That sounds very practical and very good in itself, but I find that in Galway City it does not work out so well.  I have had it brought to my notice in the past few days that the effect of the regulation is that a family in the slum area, consisting perhaps of only a brother and sister, is entitled to one of those houses, while I know of one case where a man and his wife and a young family of seven children, two of whom are receiving medical treatment at Wood-lawn sanatorium, are unable to get one.  I should like to plead with the Minister, and, through him, with the Minister for Local Government, to change those conditions, and to make the conditions for the letting of those houses somewhat similar to those which apply in the case of board of health cottages.  In the allocation of a board of health cottage, a family of which any member has suffered from T.B., or is receiving treatment for that disease, gets prior consideration.  I think if that were made a condition in the allocation of urban houses as well as of rural houses it would be a very good thing.  A sad case was brought to my notice recently in Galway, <Col N="2320" /> where a father and mother and a large family were occupying one room and were unable to get a house, while probably an old maid or an old age pensioner was getting prior consideration because she had been living in a slum area.  I would ask the Minister to impress on the Minister for Local Government the desirability of changing that regulation.</P>

      <P>I was simple enough to imagine that, when I came in here with this Bill to-day, it would probably be treated by the whole House as it was treated by Senator Douglas.  I think Senators will remember that, in this financial year, there have been other opportunities for general debate on the policy of the Government.  As this is an urgent Bill which has to be dealt with owing to the adjournment of the Dáil without an opportunity of taking the other Estimates, I thought it would be treated as a formal matter and passed without much discussion, but one nearly always gets surprises in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised by two things to-day. One was the strange&mdash;not to use a stronger word&mdash;speech delivered by Senator Fitzgerald, and the other was the strange recommendation about smuggling made by Senator McGee in the course of his brief remarks.  All I can say about Senator McGee <i>re</i> smuggling is that I hope to God the Revenue Commissioners will get after him&mdash;he is not here, but I hope he will read my words&mdash;and, if he is engaged in or encouraging anybody else to engage in smuggling.  I hope the Revenue Commissioners will get hold of him and that he will be well &ldquo;salted.&rdquo; I also hope that he will not come to me to ask for a mitigation of any fine which may be imposed on himself or any of his friends who are caught by the Revenue Commissioners.  To say the least of it, it was strange to hear such recommendations coming from a man who is supposed, here at any rate, to uphold the law.  As a matter of fact we have got in what, in present circumstances, should be regarded as a considerable quantity of sulphate of ammonia from the British Government. Negotiations are going on at <Col N="2321" /> present for further supplies, and I hope we will get them.  Everything that can be done in the normal course of intercourse and negotiation with the British is being done, and I certainly deprecate recommendations to people to get in, by smuggling, sulphate of ammonia and other fertilisers and, I suppose, any other things that people can get across the Border in an illegal way.</P>
    <P>I think that comes badly from any member of this House or of the other House.  I hope the Senator is not serious in that.  If he is engaged in smuggling I hope he will be caught. Nobody will be more pleased than I if he is caught and well &ldquo;salted&rdquo;, because he does not deserve anything else if he is serious in making such a recommendation.  With regard to Senator Baxter's speech, I do not claim to be competent to discuss the details of agriculture.  I regard the agricultural industry as a most important and vital element in the economy of this country and I think it should get every support from the Government. I think it has got, and is getting, generous support from the Government. From my slight acquaintance with agriculture, I have not found that farmers have been dissatisfied in the last few years.  That has been my experience.  I have met quite a number of farmers at different times in tillage counties&mdash;they are nearly all tillage counties now&mdash;and in counties that were not formerly tillage counties. I have met men who had to get into tillage for the first time and who found it difficult and oftentimes a strain on their resources to get the necessary capital equipment to adapt themselves to the change over in policy, but it has been done.  I gather from the banks that the banks are not being asked to advance money to any considerable extent to agriculturists. There are millions of money available for them and agriculturists themselves are increasing their deposits.</P>

If it should lack anything, it will not be for want of goodwill or want of money.  Nothing will be refused to farmers that is likely to prove helpful in their efforts to produce more food.</P>

      <P>Probably that will be done, but I was thinking of any suggestions that Senator Baxter might have in mind for any present help that might be necessary.  As I say, I am not an expert in agriculture by any means; far from it, but I do not think that in the way of financial assistance there is much that the agricultural community need at present, to enable them to produce food under present conditions, especially during the emergency. Take the land improvement scheme, for instance.  That is a good scheme.  We have given a lot of money towards it and we are prepared to give more but I do not think it would be for the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture to say &ldquo;We will attach no conditions; we will give the money and you can do what you like with it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Might I be allowed to clarify the point?  My suggestion was that the restrictions which prevent the improvement of land at present, whatever the restrictions may be, with regard to a man's way of life, etc., should be withdrawn.  Let us improve <Col N="2323" /> any land in the country that requires improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, I would be with the Senator in saying that all land should be improved, but there is a variety of other demands on the national Exchequer.  Those who are farmers should get first preference when the money comes to be allocated, but other people who have other means of livelihood, such as shopkeepers who are only engaged in a secondary way in agriculture, should get consideration only after the farmers have been satisfied. These other people who, as I say, have other sources of income, might, and probably will, get consideration then.</P>
      <P>There was just one other point raised by Senator Baxter as to the desirability of quoting in terms of currency the value of agricultural output. I do not know of any other way of doing it.  There is such a variety of things the value of which must be taken into account&mdash;horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, wool, turf, cereals, etc.&mdash; and you have to take some standard. What standard other than currency can you get that will satisfy everybody as a common basis of valuation?  I do not know of any other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what to say with regard to Senator Fitzgerald's speech, he rambled so far afield.  I would not object to following him in the least, not that I think it necessary after the effective way in which he was dealt with by Senator Magennis.  I shall only say that I do not believe the Taoiseach ever went round the country claiming that he and his Government alone were responsible for keeping this country neutral.  He never made that statement, and if I interpreted Senator Fitzgerald's speech correctly, Senator Fitzgerald has said something that is not true in stating that the Taoiseach went round the country making any such claim.  On the question of neutrality I believe that what Senator Quirke stated was true, that this Government, de Valera's Government, made neutrality practicable&mdash; a practical issue.  It is undoubtedly true that this country could not be <Col N="2324" /> brought into a war under the Treaty of 1921 without a vote of the Oireachtas. There could be no declaration of war unless by the elected representatives of the people, but under that same Treaty, as long as Article 7 remained in it, as long as the British claimed and had the right in times of war to decide and select what strategic points they wished to garrison in this country, all the votes of the Dáil and the Seanad combined could not keep us out of the war, if there were certain areas of the country occupied by the British when this war started.</P>
    <P>To give two examples.  There was no declaration of war by Holland and no declaration of war by Belgium, and yet that did not prevent these countries from being blitzed.  It did not prevent hundreds of thousands of their people being blown to Heaven, let us hope&mdash;at any rate, being blown to bits without any declaration of war.  The same thing could easily have happened here if certain strategic points in our country had been garrisoned by the British, as they had the right to do under the Treaty.  Now, I do not want to go any further into that matter.</P>

I tried to answer them as best I could, and I am now giving the Seanad an outline of the type of answer that I gave.  All these things could be backed up with quotations from various documents. We were told by Senator Fitzgerald that the occupation by the British of certain ports here was only temporary, and that the question of their rights under the Treaty was only temporary.  When I heard him make that statement it occurred to me that when a certain great Power went into Egypt more than 60 years ago it went is there temporarily to protect the country, but it is not out of it yet. Another great Power went into Korea about 40 years ago to protect that country temporarily, and it is still there.</P>

      <P>It is quite possible that the temporary occupation that Senator Fitzgerald spoke about might last much longer than the lifetime of Senator Foran or myself, and I hope that our lives will be long lives.  I do not think I will say any more on that subject.  I think that Senator Fitzgerald was most unwise in the type of speech that he made.  I think the epithet that Senator Foran applied to it &mdash;one that we were all familiar with in the days of the Home Rule discussions in the House of Commons&mdash;was quite proper.  I sincerely hope that those who suggested it was Senator Fitzgerald's swan-song in this House will be fully justified.</P>
      <P>Senator Foran asked me about family allowances or children's allowances. I think that both here and in the Dáil, not so long ago, I made the Government's position clear on this matter.  I said here, I think, that if we had any hope of having a Bill, making provision for children's allowances, ready in time to have legislation introduced and passed before this financial year became operative, I would have made that provision in this year's Budget.  It became clear, however, that the Bill could not be drafted in time to enable that to be done.  The Bill has not yet been completed. The draftsman is working on it.  I hope it will be ready for introduction when the Dáil re-assembles.</P>

There is such a number of public servants, men and women, to whom any increase in pension would have to go, that the bill might well be a staggering one.  That is my difficulty.  It is not something that, I could say right off, the Exchequer could enter into lightly.  Any increase in pensions payable to public servants of all kinds, even a small percentage increase, would have to be a big sum.</P>

I am not hard hearted.  I realise that in these times there are numbers of people trying to exist on very small sums, but, as I have just said to Senator Baxter, there is a limit so far as the Exchequer is concerned.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill for the continuation of the Emergency Powers Acts.  The original Act, as most Senators will remember, was passed on 3rd September, 1939.  It automatically lapses after a year, so it has to be renewed every year as from 3rd September. Last year, we had not merely a renewal but also considerable amendment. This year, it is not proposed to make any amendments in the powers conferred by the original Act and the amendments made in that Act up to the present.  This Bill, of course, continues not merely the principal Act, but the amending Acts as well.  In other words, it is to continue the present position.  I do not think it is necessary for me to enter into any explanation of the Bill, which is a very simple measure.  It would be a very long story if we were to go into the powers conferred by the original Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest against what I consider an abuse of the powers conferred under this Act in relation to the wages of the working class. When this Bill was originally introduced, an assurance, or something tantamount to an assurance, was given that it would not be applied to any of the workers.  In the main, the working-class are as law-abiding as any other section, and perhaps more so. Yet the reward they get for that is the application of Emergency Powers Orders Nos. 83 and 166, which are described as Standstill Orders, so far as wages are concerned.  It was said at that time, and it is no harm to repeat, that it was very injurious to the standard of living of working-class people to stabilise wages while prices could rise, and we know the general effect of the application of that Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2328" /> Prices continued to rise, while wages remained stationary, and ultimately the Government felt that they had made a mistake, that perhaps they had gone too far, and they gave us the wages tribunals, which have been fairly successful and fairly helpful to the wage-earners; but as prices continue to rise, with a consequent reduction in the standard of living of the workers, it may be necessary, and I think it is desirable, that there should be a more generous operation of the wages tribunal system in order to minimise the serious effect which these Orders have on the standard of living of the workers.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now generally about the organised workers, about those who have organisations to defend them.  I think the Agricultural Wages Board is to some extent, although perhaps not immediately, concerned in this Order. Here is a very large section, the increase in whose wages or remuneration is not at all commensurate with the substantial increase in the cost of living.  I put it to the Taoiseach that some steps should be taken immediately to balance things.  Prices cannot be allowed to continue to rise and wages cannot be kept down any further. They are both at breaking point.  I think the Taoiseach will admit that during the period of an emergency, there is no more helpful section than the working class.  The number of strikes, of stoppages of work, has been very small, although there was any amount of justification for turmoil and trouble.  Yet, the common sense of these people made them realise the general position and rather timidly acquiesce in the worsening of their conditions.  I put it to the Taoiseach that that can go too far and that as soon as possible, some steps should be taken at least to restore to the workers the standard of living which they had pre-emergency, without talking of improving it.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that they have suffered very severly and I think the Taoiseach ought to see that these people will get some reward for their patience and that, at least, the standard of living obtaining in the preemergency period is restored to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get an assurance from the Taoiseach that in future, before any prosecution or any drastic measures are taken against farmers for breaches of these Emergency Powers Orders, the supposed culprit will have an opportunity of putting his case before some responsible officials of the Department concerned.  We all know that at present quite a number of inspectors are going around, that a good many of them are young men with very little experience of the work they are supposed to do, and that, when they find what they believe to be a transgression of one of these Orders, they exaggerate the case to an enormous extent and that a prosecution or some other drastic action is taken against the supposed offender.  I suggest that before such drastic action is taken the supposed offender should get an opportunity of putting his case before some responsible officer of the Department concerned.  I know of one particular case of a fairly large farmer, a loyal citizen who, so far as I know, never broke any of the laws.  An inspector who visited his place went into his corn lofts and found nothing to complain of.  But beside the hopper of his grinding mill he found what he thought to be some grains of wheat.  He took a sample in his glove and had it analysed and said that there was 20 per cent. of wheat in that particular sample.  There was a very considerable amount of barley and oats on the lofts.  I know that that particular farmer sold 1,000 barrels of wheat last year.  He had 400 or 500 barrels of oats and about the same amount of barley to feed to his live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, on the report of that particular inspector, the Department of Industry and Commerce issued an Order and sealed that mill without giving the farmer an opportunity of explaining the position.  The farmer admitted that, after having threshed out the 1,000 barrels of wheat as closely as he could in the mill, he put the refuse through a winnowing machine afterwards and that after that he had five or six barrels of refuse of wheat left which he did use for feeding stock.  As I said, the mill was only closed for a <Col N="2330" /> week and, if it were only closed for a week and no prosecution was taken, the responsible officials of the Department must have believed the statement of the farmer.  If the farmer had got an opportunity in the first instance of explaining the matter to a responsible official of the Department, I suggest that there would have been no sealing of his mill.  I know that that man was put to a considerable amount of inconvenience, because at the time he was stall-feeding 200 cattle and had about 100 pigs, as well as milch cows and poultry.  The Department must have considered that he committed no offence when they opened his mill after a week.  I say that, before prosecutions or other measures are taken, the farmer concerned should get an opportunity of explaining the position to a responsible official.  I am not finding fault with the Government inspectors, but there is an enormous number of them and they cannot be all men of common sense.  Therefore, I suggest that, when there is a supposed offence, the farmers concerned should get an opportunity of going to a responsible official and explaining the position, and, if there is an offence which demands drastic action, that there should be a prosecution and nothing else.  I hope the Taoiseach will consider that matter.  It would be to the advantage of the country if farmers were not put to such terrible inconvenience when the matter could be rectified by an explanation being given to a responsible official.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very clear recollection of the evening, not quite four years ago, when the Act was passed which is to be extended by this Bill.  I have no idea how many Orders &mdash;I think it runs into thousands&mdash;were made since then.  I presume it would be in order to refer to any of them, but I do not propose to do so, because it seems to me that, on a renewal of an Act of this kind, we should confine our attention to the principle involved and what lessons may possibly be learned for the future through the working of the scheme set out in the Emergency Powers Act.  We can remember the circumstances.  Many of us, including, I think, members of the Government, <Col N="2331" /> had considerable misgivings.  We did not know what we might have to face. Incidentally, I do not think that anybody in this country is half thankful enough for the circumstances in which we find ourselves to-day and, so far as we are concerned, for the fact that we can meet here peaceably and discuss various legislative matters.  When we passed that Act some of us thought it was possible that Parliament would be unable to meet.  We even visualised that the Government might have to move from their ordinary headquarters. We know that that has happened in many other countries.</P>
      <P>Now, looking at this Act, my mind turns to the question: what is going to happen when it ends?  There is a provision that it will end in one year, or that the Government may terminate it in less than one year.  Before the war, one of the much discussed and very real problems of democracy was how to provide a certain amount of devolution of the powers and functions of parliament.  No one would have thought of devolving the powers of parliament to the extent that it has been done in this Emergency Powers Act, and yet I do not suppose there is anybody here who would be prepared to take the responsibility of voting against its renewal.  It seems to me that, having had four years experience, it is desirable&mdash;and I think the time has come&mdash;that we should be thinking about what is to take its place. Frankly, I do not see this suddenly ending.  I cannot conceive any particular date at which this or any other Government that might be in power would simply say, &ldquo;To-morrow is the date on which this can end&rdquo; because a great many of the Emergency Powers Orders have the effect of legislation and before they could immediately cease to have legislative effect they would in many cases&mdash;not all, of course &mdash;require gradual change and amendment in order to come back to the normal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been wondering if it would not be possible, with an eye to our whole future system of government, to have a small committee set up to report to the Government, probably <Col N="2332" /> not until the war, or at any rate the war in Europe, is over, on specific proposals for dealing with the Emergency Powers Orders that are in existence, particularly with a view to the possibility of continuing certain powers for making Orders, which would then not be emergency Orders, by Executive Ministers, and providing an effective and satisfactory method of Parliamentary control.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that we will find it extremely difficult to return to the stage where all these matters which are now dealt with by Order and only occasionally discussed, will be fully discussed in Parliament.  Some three or four years ago, shortly after the outbreak of war, I made some study, in so far as it could be done from books, of the system that was introduced in Sweden.  I do not think for a moment that in every, or possibly in any, respect it would be necessarily suitable to us, but I was enormously impressed by the manner in which a small country &mdash;a country that, like ourselves, has been able to remain neutral&mdash;faced up to the problem of democratic parliamentary government and set out to devise an effective method which would suit that country, without following any other country.  There is there a system of parliamentary committees. I do not want to take up the time of the House in trying to explain it, nor do I claim to be fully competent to do so; but it has occurred to me that it might be possible, by means of committees probably of both Houses, to provide for a continuance of emergency powers for the necessary period after the war and that such changes as would take place would be subject to revision or consultation with committees that would be set up.  In Sweden it has been found that these parliamentary committees can very often deal with various matters.  They can get the attendance of the civil servants concerned, and in time they become to a considerable extent expert. I am suggesting that by that means we might change from the position which is probably necessary during the war period, or emergency period as we call it, when the Minister cannot wait in order to consult Parliament We might gradually change from that <Col N="2333" /> by the setting up of some system of committees.  I cannot deal with it in any detail, and this would not be the time to do so.  I throw it out as a suggestion, because I think it might be a practical way of getting over the interregnum period.  I cannot see a particular date at which you could say all these Emergency Powers Orders which now have the effect of law would suddenly cease to have that effect.  Consequently, I think there should be something for the period in between.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a tribute to this House that the criticism we have had has been largely constructive. I think it is a pity that Senator Foran could not suggest some remedy for the present position regarding wages other than increasing wages and at the same time allowing prices of necessary foodstuffs and other articles to increase.  To my mind, an explanation of the position was supplied to some extent by Senator Counihan.  I mean, there is considerable co-operation in the matter of increasing wages but very little co-operation in the matter of keeping down prices.  It may appear to Senator Counihan that there is no connection between the sealing of the mill to which he referred and the keeping down of prices but the fact that these matters are dealt with under an Emergency Powers Order is an explanation in itself.  In time of emergency you cannot allow a situation where, as suggested by Senator Counihan, the person concerned will be given a chance of putting up his case.  If that were the position, you would have everybody coming along to put up his case and you would have to control the traffic around Government buildings.  To my mind, the only way is to deal with them in a more or less drastic fashion.  I have as much sympathy with the owner of the mill as has Senator Counihan.  I do not know who he is.  I am not saying that Senator Counihan has not the greatest possible sympathy.  He has. But the fact is that there are hundreds of people in the country who have been found to make one little slip.  In every case the story is exactly the same: the inspector went in and found a handful of this stuff and reported <Col N="2334" /> it as a case of wheat being ground for purposes other than the lawful purpose.</P>

There are hundreds of people all over the country that have practically the same story.  I do not say they are all as honest and as decent as Senator Counihan's friend.  I hope they are. The story is the same in practically every case.  The inspector is always wrong.  I am quite prepared to grant that there are cases where the inspector will make mistakes, but generally speaking, the inspectors go out without any malice whatever towards anybody and try to do their best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Senator did not.  In 99 cases out of 100 the report of the inspector is right.  If we could only get the same co-operation in keeping down prices we would get very much further, but the trouble is there is not the co-operation there ought to be in connection with this question. If anybody is charged with an offence under the Emergency Powers Orders with regard to the regulation of prices we get dozens of letters&mdash;I am sure every Senator is in the same position as I am&mdash;asking us to apply immediately to the Minister to have the case settled.  The fact is that each one of these cases helps to build up a position in which the price of the necessaries of life is pushed up.  Before we disband, I would appeal to Senators not to encourage people who come along with such pleas, but to give their co-operation <Col N="2335" /> to the Government in their efforts to keep prices down.  If prices could be kept down&mdash;and I think they could with proper co-operation&mdash;there would be very little grievance in regard to wages.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator Foran's suggestion to increase wages, does not Senator Foran realise that if wages were increased it would entail increasing old age pensions and fixed salaries, and that if they were increased the price of commodities would increase?</P>

The people with small fixed salaries or allowances, people such as old age pensioners, are the people who would have to bear the brunt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the inadequacy of the provisions to meet the increased cost of living to which Senator Quirke has referred.  It is well known that, when the standstill Order was made, the cost of living was rising, but, even with the provisions in subsequent Orders, such as Orders Nos. 83, 166 and 260, the ceiling allowed to meet the cost of living was only 8/-, which represents a 10 per cent. increase in wages as against a 60 per cent. rise in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been all over the country within the past nine months serving as a workers' representative on wages' tribunals and I find there is no hesitation on the part of employers to give increases of wages.  Apparently, they are quite willing to give these increases.  For example, in one town in the South of Ireland about six weeks ago the workers applied for a bonus of 8/-.  When the workers put up their case it was suggested that the workers' representatives and the employers' representatives should discuss the whole position in the absence of the members of the <Col N="2336" /> tribunal.  That suggestion was adopted, with the result that the employers agreed to give an increase of 22/6 a week.  We did not give the workers a bonus, but we increased the amount allowed under the standard wage Order to 22/6, while other cases were disposed of at amounts ranging down to 12/- in the lowest case.  That indicates the readiness on the part of some employers to meet the increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I find most employers very fair when we are dealing with these applications at meetings of the tribunal.  I am afraid the same cannot be said of some of the people who compose these tribunals. I do not want to attack any particular tribunal.  I have served on many of them.  I will say, however, that there is great dissatisfaction at the way some applications are dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said on one occasion that nobody in this country is hungry. From contact with the people in various parts of the country, I can say that a considerable number of people are living on the border-line of poverty.  Every day I see children going bare-footed and in rags.  The reason is that the parents have no money with which to purchase clothes and boots for the unfortunate children. Certain commodities in this city are rationed.  For instance, butter is rationed, yet poor people cannot buy it.  I know that people who have money can get all the butter they require.  I am aware that yesterday in the City of Dublin two poor women were offering ration books to people streaming out of Amiens Street station, heading for Nelson's Pillar.  These poor people have the ration books, but they have not the money with which to procure the necessaries of life.  This is a matter to which some attention should be devoted.</P>
    <P>I do not want to over-paint the picture, and I do not think anyone will accuse me of being a wild man, wanting to exaggerate the situation.  But there is poverty in this city.  I am brought daily in contact with it. Deputy Foran referred to a certain case.  There was never any indication on the part of trade unions, the organised <Col N="2337" /> or unorganised workers, that they would make impossible demands.  On the contrary, there was evidence of proper organisation and a desire to help during the emergency.  I am an official of a union with 1,200 members.  I may say that we have paid out £55,000 of our members' money to something like 150 or 200 unemployed since the war started.  The union is taking care of its members, and those members have paid increased rates in order that the unemployed would be able to meet the increased cost of living.  They paid it into the common pool established to keep these men.  That is one indication where less than 1,000 members have paid more than £55,000 in order to help in the emergency.</P>
    <P>I would like to see help of a corresponding type given by the State.  I would like to see something done for the poorer sections of our people, to put them in a position to meet the increased cost of living.  As it is, we are allowed only the 8/- permitted by the Order.  In view of the ever-increasing cost of living, more attention should be paid to this matter and the ceiling should be raised in respect of the amount that can be secured under these Orders.  I will not overpaint the picture.  We have not had any strikes or stoppages.  If there was never a standstill Order, I believe the common sense of trade union officials would have been sufficient, and no drastic steps would have been taken to dislocate industry or commerce.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas referred to a matter that has been engaging my attention, and that is the position of this country in the post-war period.  I think the Taoiseach, speaking in the Dáil last week, said there was a Cabinet committee meeting weekly to consider the problems likely to arise in the post-war period.  I think it might be well if the Taoiseach were to give the Oireachtas some indication of the problems that are dealt with by that committee and the solutions they have prepared. There can be no question about it, grave problems will arise here after the war.  For one thing, we will be confronted with at least 150,000 people who will come back from Britain.  They will not be left in <Col N="2338" /> Britain a day longer than they are needed.  These people will have become imbued with certain ideas that are fairly generally expressed in Britain at the moment.  We all know that certain people are in power there and the prevailing ideas in that country are not ones I would like to see promulgated here.  Many of our people who are now working in Britian will be imbued with certain ideas and the problems that will arise in the post-war period will be accentuated when those people reach here and start circulating their ideas and opinions. Some effort ought to be made to cope with the wage problem here.  An increase of 10 per cent. in wages is not sufficient to meet a 60 per cent. increase in the cost of living.  Any effort to increase wages has been stopped, but I am sorry that there has not been some move to control prices.  A plea was put forward on behalf of people who transgress the law.  I have no sympathy at all with people who transgress the law.</P>
    <P>I have been to Mountjoy in the capacity of a visiting justice.  I may say there are very few spare beds there, largely because of people who have transgressed the law in connection with prices charged for various commodities.  I have not the slightest sympathy with the people who have been put into jail, because they did not properly realise their duty to the nation and to the common good and, if it were necessary, we should have more jails to deal with such people.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Foran and Senator Campbell have spoken about the standstill Order.  I do not know whether it would be quite in order to discuss that matter now.  It seems to me that, strictly, the matter under discussion is whether or not there was abuse of the emergency powers.  This particular Bill does not cover the standstill Order as such&mdash;its merits or demerits.  As regards the charge made in the Dáil that these powers have been abused, I should like to say that both the Dáil and the Seanad had greater opportunity for discussing this Order than they had for discussing any other Order.  If Senators look over the <Col N="2339" /> records of the House, they will find that more time was devoted to discussion of this Order than was devoted to discussion of any other Order.  It is natural that that should be so because this is one of the most difficult questions with which we have to deal.  I do not think that any case has been made as regards abuse of these powers. Members of the Dáil and Seanad are empowered to bring up for discussion any Order made.</P>
      <P>As regards the merits&mdash;if I may touch upon that matter for a moment&mdash;the suggestion has been made that the same effort is not being made to keep down prices as is being made to keep down wages.  I do not think that that charge is justified.  Certain prices cannot be kept down.  So far as we could do so, we have endeavoured to keep down prices.  But if you want goods badly and these are available only from outside, you have to pay the price which will purchase them, and that price is beyond your control.  As regards food, we, naturally, try to get it grown at the lowest price we can, in the interest of the community as a whole.  But, again, we have to pay a certain price if we want to get the goods produced, so that it is not possible to keep prices down.  It is suggested that we should allow wages to go up accordingly.  If we do that, we shall have prices increasing still more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator Campbell say that he had no difficulty in inducing certain employers to accede to demands made by their workers for increased wages.  Of course, employers will readily consent to increases in wages if they are able to recoup themselves by increased prices for their commodities.  I do not know what commodities were being produced by the employers to whom Senator Campbell referred.  One of the things which the Government have to try to defend the community against is collusion, so to speak, between proprietors and workers by which increases of wages are recouped by increases of prices.  The whole matter is one of extreme difficulty.  What we are trying to do is to prevent increases of wages, which would be followed by <Col N="2340" /> increases of prices, which, again, would be followed by increases of wages, because as the price of goods would go up, the value of the wages in terms of goods would go down.  You would have a continual chasing of prices and wages.  You must stop that somewhere.  When any of these questions arose, we tried to stop it but many things we should like to do are not possible.  We tried to put the balance of burden on the shoulders of those best able to bear it but it is not always easy to do that.  If you put a heavy burden on the shoulders of those on whom you would like to put it, it may mean that, as a consequence, burdens will still be put on weaker shoulders.</P>
    <P>In this case, as in the case of other economic problems, it is extremely difficult to get a satisfactory solution. We are always open to suggestions for a better solution than that which we are applying and these suggestions will be given the greatest possible consideration and attention.  I have been trying to make myself acquainted with what has been done in this connection in other neutral countries.  Various efforts have been made to achieve the same object but it seems to me that, if we applied the devices which have been applied in these other countries, they would not bring more satisfactory results than we are obtaining by our own methods.  The setting up of the tribunals has brought a considerable easing of the situation here and it is more or less on these lines that, I think, we shall have to continue.  No member of the Government has been able to put forward a better solution than that which we are applying.  I do not say that it has been completely satisfactory.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion that another chance should be given to people who offend against these Orders, the offences against the common good which can be committed by people who are impelled by selfish motives to act in a selfish way are so numerous that it is almost impossible to have machinery of such a type as would prevent them from so acting.  The only way to prevent them is to see that those who are caught will pay a heavy <Col N="2341" /> penalty.  You cannot have an inspector at every farmyard or in every shop to see that people will obey the law.  The only way you can secure due obedience to the law is to see that those who disobey will suffer severely, if caught. I do not think that the policy of &ldquo;giving another chance&rdquo; would be compatible with the method which we have adopted.  There ought, of course, to be justice and I take it that an opportunity is given in court to people who are charged with offences to make their case.  In the case to which Senator Counihan referred, the parties concerned did get such an opportunity but a <i>prima facie</i> having being established against them, their business was closed down while the case was being investigated. In view of the circumstances, I do not think that that was a very great hardship, though in a particular case it might mean hardship.  I do not think that there is any other way of dealing with the matter.  When an offence is scheduled, then those engaged in the type of business covered by the item in the schedule will have to be particularly careful not merely to avoid doing wrong but to avoid doing anything that might, so to speak, be construed as wrong.</P>

      <P>If the marks were there, I do not see how experience would enable the official to judge.  I take it that inspectors as experienced as possible are sent out and that they are capable of dealing with these matters.  Every possible step that could be taken to provide in advance that justice would be done has been taken, but the position is that those who are caught doing anything of that sort will have to be dealt with severely.  It is a matter of evidence whether these things are being done or not.  I do not think that there is much hope of the suggestions made being adopted by the Minister, to whom I shall convey them.  With regard to the question raised by Senator Douglas, and the position we have to meet after this, there will probably have to be some powers similar to those we have, continued for a considerable time, but there will be a question of revision, and seeing which of them it is essential to carry on.  I do not know that anything would be gained by the setting up of a committee or of a body to examine it at this stage, because I am afraid we are not near enough to the actual circumstances that will arise, to judge in advance which set of powers are likely to be needed.  There is no doubt that some of these powers will be necessary, and it will be an important matter for the Government of the day, and for the Parliament to consider which of these powers should be continued.  I agree that it is unfortunate from the point of view of proper democratic control that so much power has to be delegated to the Executive as appears to be the practice now in democratic countries.  Governments have to deal with such a variety of matters, and have to deal with them so swiftly, that it is becoming almost inevitable that a great deal of devolution of the powers of Parliament to the Executive should take place.  There is this difficulty which, I am sure, Senators will recognise, that if you have committees, in order that they should come to a proper <Col N="2343" /> decision regarding any particular matter, they should have as complete information as the Government when it comes to a decision on them.  That means that the time of staffs will be occupied with committees as well as with the Government.  You have duplication.</P>
      <P>One of the obvious objections to having committees of the kind that Senator Douglas suggests is that they will have to inform themselves in regard to every matter as fully as Ministers, Departments, or the Government as a whole are informed, when they come to a decision.  That is undoubtedly going to put a very heavy burden on the permanent staffs, perhaps put upon them a burden that they will not be able to carry, because the best advice is generally given by those who have a good deal of executive work to do.  These are the people who are best able to give advice and even at the present their time is very fully occupied in giving counsel and advice to Ministers and to the Government, making it almost impossible for them to have the necessary time for the executive work they have to do.  It is an extremely difficult matter.  However, the suggestion made by Senator Douglas can be examined to see how far it would fit in with our circumstances here.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Seanad, as I assured the Dáil, that I regret when a measure has to be passed in the form of an Order.  I believe these are all matters for discussion in Parliament, because there is a variety of ways of approaching them from different angles by those who have a certain amount of direct personal information which may not be available to members of the Government.  Discussion on that basis is always helpful, but it is a question whether we will have time.  I am afraid, with the conditions which we are likely to have even after the war, the time factor will be a very serious one.  I can only tell Senators that we will look into the matter to see if anything can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Campbell said that he would like if the House could have some indication <Col N="2344" /> of the work being done by the committee that was set up in the Cabinet.  In general terms, we had in mind many projects, even before the emergency came upon us.  These projects were brought to a standstill for one reason or another, in some cases because the staffs engaged in particular Departments had to be transferred to other Departments, and in other cases because certain raw materials which were necessary, and which we had to get from outside, were not available. A number of projects which the Government had in mind, and which would give a considerable amount of employment were held up.  What we have been trying to do is to see that the plans for these projects are brought to such a point that they will be ready immediately the raw materials are available, so that whenever the situation is rectified we will be able to do the work with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>As regards land division, it is a fundamental part of our social policy to put as many families as possible in economic security on the land.  We want to get to the point of getting back the staffs loaned to other Departments, as quickly as possible, so as to proceed with all possible speed with land division, the improvement of holdings, which gives a considerable amount of employment, and also the building of houses on farms which would give employment locally.  There is also the question of a resumption of the building industry and of housing.  We must see if we can get the co-operation of local authorities.  There is also the question of afforestation.  We have been pressing very hard to increase the amount of land planted every year, but various difficulties prevent expansion. Many people talk of increasing afforestation suddenly.  It cannot be done suddenly, because all sorts of things have to be provided for.  We have been trying to push to 10,000 acres yearly, and the moment we get 10,000 acres people may say we should try to go to 12,000 acres.  It is much better to have an attainable object than to say that we want 20,000 acres.  We are taking stock and if we could get 10,000 acres we could see what we would require. There are difficulties about <Col N="2345" /> acquiring land and there is the question of trying to find a solution for that.</P>
    <P>I have given an indication of some of the these projects.  One of them is rural electrification&mdash;what we are to do about it, what are the plans and how far ahead can we get.  There is also the question of drainage.  We have accepted in general terms the report of the Drainage Commission. The drafting of the Drainage Bill proved so difficult that we tried to take a short-cut and, as often happens, it would have been better if we had taken the longer way.</P>
    <P>We have tried to short-circuit the ordinary processes of getting Bills prepared and so on, but we are up against a difficulty.  We find it is extremely hard to draft this particular Bill and what we are doing is, in fact, going in advance of the Act in some cases and running certain risks, before the project has been fully approved, by actually spending certain moneys in trying to get, for instance, the planning of a particular area completed, because we cannot take all the areas at once.  The carrying out of drainage work will require to be spread over a certain number of years and we will, therefore, have to take it area by area.  We have to get a lot of preliminary survey work done and while we are waiting for the Bill to be prepared, we are already tackling that preliminary work.  We have made up our minds as to what areas we shall start with, and we have told the Public Works engineers to get ahead as quickly as possible.  That gives you a rough idea of certain of the work that is being done.  We have already made up our minds in regard to certain projects, and these projects are being planned so that the moment conditions make it possible, we would be able, without further planning, to say: &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There will be a question also of trying to train staffs.  If the work we wanted to have done by the Department of Lands was of such a character as would require additional staff, we would say: &ldquo;Get your staff now to do their training.  Do not put us in <Col N="2346" /> the position that, when the emergency comes to an end, you will still have to train your staff.&rdquo; What I have said indicates the work done by the committee of the Cabinet, and I would like to say we came to that particular method of working because &mdash;as I think you will find, if you look up the Debates of the Dáil &mdash;when we were in opposition we urged very strongly that there should be a planning committee.  That is a very attractive thing to people in Opposition.  You say: &ldquo;Look at the Ministers.  They are engaged from morning until night dealing with everything from a needle to an anchor. How can they give attention to particular jobs?&rdquo; That was my idea, frankly, when I was in Opposition.  I thought the Government should have something like an economic headquarters staff that would be constantly considering these projects, that would put up projects to the Government and would continually supervise them and see how they were being carried through.</P>
    <P>But the moment we came in, and I tried to apply that, I saw all kinds of difficulties which never occurred to me when we were in Opposition.  One of the difficulties is that if you want these things carried out, they have to be carried out departmentally.  The idea of dividing the State into Departments is to have efficient working.  The best people to carry out projects are those who do the planning themselves, because they have considered all the snags that they are likely to come across in the execution of the work, and they have, consequently, if they have been engaged in the planning, the best qualifications to carry out the work.  In fact, it is suggested that anybody who has these ideas is best qualified to carry them out, because Departments must, of necessity, proceed slowly and with reluctance when they come up against difficulties, and find that it is not feasible to do the works in a particular way.  There have been various attempts made by the British to do it, and they have all come to naught.  For the reasons I have indicated, we have Departments doing certain things.  If you want planning done, you will have to get it done by <Col N="2347" /> those Departments, and the committee of the Cabinet is to supervise. It is a small committee, a form of headquarters planning staff.</P>
    <P>Whenever we need assistance from any one of the Departments, we can get that assistance immediately instead of leaving the Department to do all the work itself.  The committee can take up a project of the Department of Lands, and ask: &ldquo;Very well; how far have you gone?  How far have you done so-and-so?&rdquo; and it is passed on to the department to obtain the details. If it is the Department of Industry and Commerce, we proceed along the same lines.  We ask them: &ldquo;What about this project of so-and-so?  What plans have been made?  What is the present position?  Would you be in a position if the emergency stopped to go right ahead?&rdquo; When we have got to that stage, the next thing would be to see that the projects were so distributed over the country as to take up the unemployment we might anticipate in these various areas.  I did not propose to speak about that at all, but as Senator Campbell asked for it, I have given a general indication and I want to assure him that this work is being done.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is being done as efficiently as possible, but it is being done.  My own view is that, with our organisation, it is the best way to get the work done.  I am afraid that we have gone very far away from the terms of the Bill before us, but, as there is a disposition on the part of the Seanad to give us all stages of the Bill, it is perhaps no harm.</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>As this deals with a section of the existing Act, I think I <Col N="2348" /> would be in order in referring to some remarks made by An Taoiseach.  I am trying to make it clear that, at present, legislation may be introduced by means of a Bill which has to go through five stages in the Dáil, and four stages in this House.  Alternatively, it may be introduced by Emergency Powers Order, which may or may not be discussed by way of motion in this House.  My suggestion for a committee was for something which might give a little more public consideration than an Emergency Powers Order, but would not involve the same amount of time as a Bill. The suggestion is that as soon as it is found possible, and, I think An Taoiseach agrees, it is desirable to reduce the number of Orders and increase the number of Bills.  My suggestion is that if the House were divided into committees which would not be very large, it might be possible, once you are prepared to stop governing by Emergency Order except to a limited extent, that this particular type of Order might come before a committee representing either each House, or one representing both Houses, and it would simply pass through a committee and have the same effect as the present Emergency Orders.  But, it could, possibly, be amended in committee by consent of the Minister.  At a later stage, possibly in three to six months, the various committees would report, and their actions would be sanctioned by the whole Parliament, after they had been subjected to discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion is that when you are reducing or amending drastic legislation, and gradually getting it back to normal&mdash;if there is ever going to be such a thing as normal again&mdash;that is a way by which you could get the benefit of public discussion, and it would enable you to ascertain public feeling which, as the Taoiseach said, Ministers are not always fully conversant with, without obliging the Minister concerned to have to go through all the stages of a Bill in every case.  I am just throwing that out as one of the lines on which this might be done and as one which, I think, has merit.  I believe that it might very <Col N="2349" /> well be considered as a system to be followed as between the two extremes: first, the extreme of a Bill having to go through all stages, and, secondly, that of an Emergency Order which need not go through Parliament at all.</P>
    <P>In my reference to Sweden, I did not have it in mind to say that the system followed in Sweden would be suitable here.  I merely wished to point out that Sweden was a country which had found a way of partial devolution while, at the same time, retaining parliamentary control.  There is a danger that once this war is over, if we are not careful, we may find that pure expediency, and the shortage of time to which the Taoiseach referred, may mean that Parliament may never again establish the position it used to have, and I think it would be a pity that that should be the case, but if every measure and every detail is going to be discussed by means of a Bill through all its stages in the House, and if there is no other way except by means of Executive Orders, then I fear that what will happen is that Parliament will become less effective and be less useful, and if Parliament is less effective, as it has been during the war, and if it does not function freely, then I fear that the people will lose faith&mdash;if they have any faith in it now&mdash;in democracy.  If, on the other hand, Parliament is fully representative, and if there is adequate discussion of every measure, then I think that democracy may establish itself again.  I see great difficulty in reviving the idea of democracy without a revival of effective Parliamentary government, and if there is to be no alternative between the issuing of Executive Orders on the one hand, and a Bill going through all stages, on the other hand, you may find that Parliamentary control may not be reestablished. I feel that it would be a good thing that these things should be thought over along the lines I suggest.</P>

It was rather an attitude of despair in connection with the standstill Order and the control of prices.  He gave us no assurance that these things could or would be improved.  Now, as I said earlier, the working people have suffered more during the Emergency than any other section of the community.  We are entirely in favour of rationing, but there is not a bit of use in rationing essential foods if the people have not the wherewithal to buy these goods. Business people, certain professional people, and other sections of the community can get all the necessaries they require because they have money.  I do not know that there is any other section of the community which is impoverished to the same extent as the working class, and as evidence of that you can see the bank balances.  The banking accounts show that there is plenty of customers' money available, and it may be that things may not work out all right at the end of the war and that this money may not be as valuable as these people think it is now.  However, that is a big subject, into which I shall not go now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a great number of our people, their sons and daughters are working across in England and are sending money here.  Without that money, these people here would be in a very bad position.  They would not <Col N="2351" /> be able to get the necessaries of life. We read in the papers, every other day, of the enormous extension in juvenile crime.  I submit that that is largely due to lack of finance, and, because of that, to lack of proper parental control.  These are very important off-shoots due to lack of the necessaries of life.  People are adopting other means of acquiring them&mdash; means which no one wants to encourage and which we all deplore, but it is very important that serious notice should be taken of that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Taoiseach gave us any hope that these things would be improved in the near future, and I again appeal to him to insist on penalising the profiteers and people who are exploiting the black market. A good deal has been done, but a good deal more can be done.  The power is there under the Emergency Orders, and it should be rigidly applied. Senator Counihan talks about these people being given a second chance. Just imagine somebody killing someone else down the country and getting a second chance! There should be no second chance for these people, and nobody should have any sympathy for them, because they are taking advantage of the situation and exploiting it to the detriment of the great mass of the community.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Quirke's attitude towards increased wages, he said that if we were to increase wages we would have to increase old age pensions. Did you ever hear anything more staggering from a public man? Is not the time long overdue for an increase in old age pensions?  Are these people not entitled to an increase, in view of the substantial increase in the cost of living?  Not only are the old age pensioners entitled to an increase, but blind pensioners also. These are matters that might and should require attention at the moment, but for a man to justify the pegging down of wages because an increase would mean an increase in old age pensions shows, I think, a rather poor mentality.</P>
    <P>As regards planning for the future, it does not, of course, come under the Bill at all, but the Taoiseach has been <Col N="2352" /> kind enough to give us an idea of what the Government are doing in this direction.  I think that the departmental officials are not the proper people to deal with such matters.  I believe that a good deal of useful work, information and help could be got from other sections of the community. I submit that the stereotyped, red-tape departmental committee is not the best that can be got to plan for the post-war situation.  However, that is their job, and not mine, but I suggest that other sections of our people should be taken more into the confidence of the Government with regard to post-war planning, because I feel that that would make for better planning for the future.  I do not think I have anything more to say, but it is just possible, in connection with Senator Douglas's theories about parliamentary institutions, that after the emergency they may not exist at all, and there may be no need for them.  Nobody can foretell what the outcome will be, when the conflict is going to end, and so on.  At the same time, we ought to do a little internal planning for our people here. I think the Taoiseach said that we are not near enough to the end&mdash;I do not know if I am misinterpreting him&mdash; to do any planning.</P>

      <P>But that should not prevent our going ahead with our plans. We should not wait until we know that one or the other side is down and out. We must have our plans ready before that.  I think it is not a bit too soon to begin now.  We may have to change our plans; we may even have to throw some of them overboard, but I think we ought to tackle the problem right away.  I do not agree with the Taoiseach that the time is not ripe for doing that.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach was replying he indicated what are the present plans and the post-war plans, but he did not mention anything with regard to food production.  Perhaps <Col N="2353" /> it was that he overlooked the matter.  The Government has done very good work with regard to increasing our food production, but I submit that a great deal remains to be done. During the week-end we had 16,000 people from another country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well then; we had 16,000 people from another part of our own country as visitors in Dublin.  That must be a great drain on the food supplies of the city and of the country generally, and I suggest that that is a pointer to what is going to happen in the future, both during the war and in the post-war period. If we have enough food in this country, people will be attracted here in the post-war period.  They will come here for the food, as well as for the scenery and so on.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that that is one of the matters to which the Government should direct their full attention.  I have already agreed that the Government has done wonders in connection with food production, and I suggest that the more that can be done the better.</P>
      <P>Senator Foran suggested that agricultural wages are not as good as they should be.  We all agree with that, but, if you push agricultural wages any higher without pushing up the price of farm produce, the result will be unemployment.  In connection with food production, it may seem selfish on the part of the farmers to ask for higher prices for their crops, but they do it from the point of view that it is better to have food produced in large quantities even though the price is a little bit higher.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, in his very interesting forecast of the work that he proposes for the Government, left out, inadvertently I am sure, one fundamental matter, the question of education.  Even adequate food production ultimately rests on good education, good agricultural education.  For successful farming, a great deal of intelligence and a great deal of scientific training are required. The help of the women is also essential. To my mind, no farmer can get on unless he has the proper wife, and <Col N="2354" /> the proper wife must be trained for her very important job.  That is only one branch of education.  In everything of which the Taoiseach spoke, education is necessary.  He spoke of the young men who will require to be trained for afforestation and other things.  I hope that students in universities will be induced to abandon training for other professions which are overcrowded and are likely to be more overcrowded, and to take up training in practical spheres for which university training is necessary. I know that the Taoiseach must have this question before him; I merely want to remind him of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>I was afraid that I had given the debate a wrong turn as a result of the remarks of Senator Campbell, and that we were going to have a discussion on post-war planning or on planning generally.  I did not attempt to give anything like a complete list of the things that are being done; I just gave a slight indication of what is being done.  Of course the question of food production is being considered.  As Senators are aware, a committee has been set up to deal with our whole agricultural industry, which we all realise is the basic industry.</P>
      <P>With regard to trying to get people to produce more food, we spent many a day last spring and last winter trying to get the farmers to produce enough for ourselves, enough for man and beast.  We have not yet succeeded to the extent that we would desire, not to speak at all of the position in which, later on, there would be a very big demand for any surplus we would have.  There is, of course, a demand for certain classes of surplus at the present moment.  If we had large quantities of butter to spare, I am sure we could sell it.  If we had large quantities of barley or other things to spare, I am quite sure we could sell them at a reasonable, even if not at a very attractive, price.  The fact is that we are not producing from our land at the present time the food that is required for our own population here, and for the animal stock that we have.  Obviously, the first thing is to try to get that done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2355" /> With regard to the post-war situation, there is a committee which is studying that whole question.  I do not think anything that I said would justify Senator Foran in saying that I thought we were so far away from the end that we could not plan now.  The very fact that we are planning now should prove that.  If I did say anything which could be interpreted in that way, that is certainly not what I had in mind.  What I had in mind is that you cannot now bring plans to a final stage.  Your plans must remain provisional, because they depend upon factors which will not be fully known until the end of the war.  I agree absolutely that that is not a reason why we should not go on with our provisional planning, try to foresee the circumstances, as far as it is possible for human beings to do it, and plan on the basis of those being the conditions in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>We may have to modify our plans, or even to discard some plans completely. There would be reasons for that, but there would be no excuse for not having some plan, a provisional plan, based on conditions as we anticipate them at the present moment.  I can only say that that is being done.  The mechanism for the doing of it is in my opinion a matter for the Government, through a committee, or the Government as a whole on the one hand, and the Departments on the other.  The Departments are there to plan.  It is a part of their work.  For instance, public health plans have to be made by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>If it is a question of education, agricultural education and so on, obviously that comes in as part of the work of the committee which has been appointed.  There is education of various kinds.  There is technical education, <Col N="2356" /> for instance.  If there is to be a great increase in any line where we would not have enough technically trained people, we may have to provide the technical training in advance.  Senator Mrs. Concannon referred, for instance, to increases in the case of afforestation.  If we wanted new staffs, and those were to be trained in the universities, an attempt should be made to do that as early as possible.  That should be done, not merely in times of emergency but, as far as possible, it should be part of our common practice.</P>
    <P>There are, however, difficulties involved that do not meet the eye at once.  For instance, if we tell the universities that we may want after the emergency, ten, 20 or 50 inspectors of forestry, technically and properly trained, a number of people may set out to equip themselves for these posts.  This may not be a good example because it is scarcely likely to happen, but let us suppose that a number of people set out to train themselves for such work.  If by any chance something happened that would prove our forecast wrong, and it transpired that we did not want so many inspectors, the people who had offered themselves for training would have a grievance and they would say: &ldquo;Very well, we trained ourselves on your advice and because of the statements which you made.  It is up to you now to see that we get work.&rdquo; There are all sorts of things of that kind about which one has to be cautious.  Then, again, one can err by too much caution also.  We have to take reasonable risks.  I think, however, that if I were to continue on this line I would not be in order, so I had better bring my remarks to a close.</P>
