      <P>In connection with the business set out on the Order Paper to-day, I desire to inform the House at this point that a rearrangement has been suggested, owing to the circumstance that the Minister for Agriculture, who will be in attendance on Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 7, finds that he will be in a position to attend the House to-day, but will not be available to-morrow. Accordingly, it has been suggested&mdash;and the Minister for Education and Senators interested are in agreement&mdash;that when we conclude item No. 1 we should then proceed to deal with the items in which the Minister for Agriculture is concerned.  The School Attendance Bill will not, under this rearrangement, be taken to-day and, if the House agrees, will be postponed until to-morrow or to the next sitting&mdash;a matter to be arranged subsequently.</P>
      <P>With the agreement also of Senator Douglas and Senator Michael Hayes, motion No. 6 will not be taken to-day, so that all items dealing with agricultural matters can proceed in the order in which I have indicated.  I presume I may assume general agreement to the suggested alteration and also the postponement of the School Attendance Bill.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of the last <Col N="686" /> session of the Seanad I was discussing what seemed to me the essential principle in the St. Laurence's Hospital Bill, and I had just come to the point that one of the principal points apparently underlying the Bill, and provided for in the Bill, is the transfer of the hospital to another site.  That is a matter to which I think the Seanad should give very close and very careful attention.  The Dublin medical school is on somewhat different lines from any other medical school in these islands in the sense that it has sprung up and prospered and has done well in a number of separate institutions.  I am speaking now of the Dublin medical school as a whole, and not of any particular school.  The history of the Dublin hospitals is similar in many ways to the history of hospitals in some other centres, notably, for instance, in London, in that the hospitals were founded at different times and in different centuries by the charitable public almost altogether.  There are some exceptions.  The hospital we are particularly dealing with in this Bill is not one of those which have sprung up as charitable institutions primarily. It started its life as a Government institute, and the Government, both before the Treaty settlement and since, has had a considerable control over the hospital.</P>
      <P>I suggested on the last occasion the Bill was before the House that one of the objects of this Bill or one thing that springs out of the Bill from even a cursory examination of it is that the Government is tightening its control in many particulars above what was practised at any rate in the past&mdash;whatever might have been the legal position of the Government in relation to the hospital. When medical schools as distinct from hospitals came to be founded they were founded quite distinct from the hospital and had little or no connection with the hospital. That is a position which is peculiar, I think, to Dublin.  It does not arise in Belfast to anything like the same extent because there are only two major general hospitals in Belfast and the teaching courses at both of them are recognised by the university in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> Here in Dublin there are ten general hospitals and the clinical course given in each of them is recognised officially by the three medical schools which exist in Dublin at present.  None of them is under the control of a medical school but there is a happy association between the work carried out by the hospitals and that by the medical schools.  One result of that is that the whole course of medical education is not given at one site or in one locality.</P>
    <P>Students attending one of the medical schools&mdash;University College, Trinity College or the College of Surgeons&mdash; can attend any of the hospitals for their clinical courses.  They choose the hospital according to family associations, convenience to their residence or other considerations of that kind.  In London the case is quite different. The medical schools there have arisen as annexes or extensions to the hospitals or <i>vice versa</i>, and the hospital and medical school are either in the same building or are immediately adjacent to each other so that there is only one location which is concerned with the student's education.  Here the student is attending some of his lectures at a medical school&mdash;the three of them are situated fairly centrally&mdash;and he is attending for his clinical instruction at a hospital which may or may not be convenient to the school, but which is generally fairly convenient to a residential district.  It may be convenient both to the residential district in which he lives and to the hospital.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the anxiety that has arisen from the apparent determination to change the site of the Richmond Hospital is due to the knowledge that such a change is likely to interfere greatly with the convenience of students attending the hospital and to interfere greatly with the classes in the hospital.  Hospital lectures begin at 9 o'clock and it is not easy for a student to attend a hospital which is several miles distant from his residence.</P>
    <P>In choosing his residence, the student has to take into account its proximity to the hospital, and also its proximity to the medical school which he is <Col N="688" /> attending.  If the Richmond Hospital, to give it its common name, is transferred from a fairly central position to a position in the suburbs or in the neighbouring countryside, it is likely to interfere greatly with the possibility&mdash; I said &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; a moment ago, but it may extend even to the possibility&mdash;of students attending a class in that hospital, and the class is likely to diminish very much.  Liveliness, or the life of the teaching, depends very much on having a sufficiently large class to encourage the teacher.  There is nothing more depressing for a teacher than to have to address a small class, or nothing more depressing for students than to feel that they are in a small class.  I do not say that very large classes are desirable, but certainly, for clinical teaching, unless there is an active and fairly numerous class attending the hospital, the teaching in that hospital will suffer, and the attraction of that hospital to leading men, surgeons and physicians, seeking staff posts, which are always unpaid, is likely to diminish if they have not a class to encourage them.  I do not overlook the fact that the income of the visiting physician or surgeon depends to a large extent on fees received from students.  He is not paid anything by the hospital.  He gets certain fixed fees from the students.  These fees are set out in the syllabus and the student or his parent knows what the fees are going to be during the student's normal course.</P>
    <P>For both these reasons, an active and fairly numerous class is necessary to ensure that the hospital will retain a thoroughly competent staff, the best staff available.  No doubt the members of the staff get other advantages.  They are teaching students who are going to be the practitioners of the country in after years.  The good word of the students is one of the things that will help members of the staff towards a good practice in future, a consideration that no teacher can afford to neglect. Again, the fact that they are attending patients in a hospital with a good reputation maintains their reputation with the public generally.  From that point of view, the fact that the school may be gravely damaged, possibly <Col N="689" /> almost destroyed, by a movement of the hospital to a site which is not convenient for the attendance of classes is one to which the Seanad should give close attention.</P>
    <P>There is another point of view, which is the essential one as regards the hospital. That is that the hospital must be within a convenient distance of the population which requires its services. The Richmond Hospital is situated in a very congested area of the city but, fortunately, plenty of space is available for building an extension to the existing hospital or building a new hospital.  It is not part of a slum but a slum area comes right up to the door of the hospital.  It is in a very thickly populated area but there is plenty of space available immediately beside the hospital for an extension of the building.</P>
    <P>It has been urged, and urged with a good deal of reason, that hospitals would be better situated in the open country, in country air, than in fairly closely crowded quarters of the city. There is a great deal to be said for that, and the idea has been put into practice in some cases.  Some of the old London hospitals have been moved out into the country or to suburbs just outside the city.  The same thing was done in Birmingham.  A beautiful open site was chosen within about three miles of the centre of the city, but in that case the medical school had preceded it.  The medical school, which had been formerly situated in the city itself, was moved to a building adjacent to which the hospital was built.  From the point of view of the hygiene of the hospital that was admirable. One factor which did not work favourably for education was that there was not available residential accommodation for students in the immediate neighbourhood.  No doubt there is a hostel or residents' house attached to it, but whether that was capable of accommodating all the students, I do not know.  Another discouraging feature was that the patients for whom the hospital was intended did not follow it to the suburbs.  I had an opportunity of visiting the hospital a few years ago, and certainly in the way of hospital <Col N="690" /> building and planning, I could not conceive of anything much better in present conditions.  But, I was informed, the people in the city requiring hospital treatment continued to attend the older hospitals in the city and the new hospital was very much less frequented.  The word &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; was used to me, but I think that that was putting the matter too strongly.  From two points of view, the movement, though it promised very well, appears to have been a failure&mdash; from the point of view of convenience for medical education and from the point of view of the convenience of patients.</P>
    <P>From these two points of view, the changing to any distance from the present site of the Richmond Hospital would seem to be undesirable.  There is plenty of room around the existing hospital for building.  There are the grounds of the old Dublin Union which, I understand, are at present let to a charitable society which, no doubt, could be accommodated elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made clear that he had a certain neighbourhood in his mind as a site to which he would, so far as his power went, transfer the hospital, leaving, as this Bill provides, some part of the old hospital to continue to be temporarily used as an outpatients' department.  That question of keeping the out-patient department in a central situation and moving the beds to a suburban situation raises another point.  At first sight, it appears to have much in its favour but it has this in its disfavour&mdash;that it makes for the inconvenience of the friends of patients who desire to see them.  Patients in a hospital look forward to the weekly or bi-weekly visits of friends and it is important that these friends should have ready and easy access to patients if they are dangerously ill.  If a hospital is removed some distance from the centre of population which it serves, there is a considerable drawback in this regard.</P>
    <P>This question of the site of the hospital has, of course, been very hotly discussed.  It has been a topic of conversation amongst medical and other <Col N="691" /> people interested in hospital problems during the past few years.  The Minister, in this Bill, takes power to buy land for the purpose of accommodating the hospital.  That, in itself, is a useful provision; because the Minister can better deal with the purchase of land than any other purchasing body, such as the board of a hospital, could.  He can deal more efficiently with the matter and make orders which the board of a hospital could not make.</P>
    <P>A similar suggestion was made by other hospitals which had plans for establishing a new hospital by the combination of several.  There is, however, no control on the Minister in regard to his choice of site.  I do not know where the suggestion as to the Cabra site came from.  The proposal in the Bill is that the Minister should be empowered to assign funds from the Hospital Sweepstakes, which are under his control at the moment, for the building of this hospital.  Most of the activities of the Minister in dealing with the Hospital Sweepstakes funds have been after taking the advice of the Hospitals Commission.  I do not know what advice the Hospitals Commission has given to the Minister in this respect.  The Hospitals Commission have published very full and useful reports and have published a great many of their recommendations in these reports.  I do not think&mdash;I have made inquiries from various people on the subject&mdash;that they ever recommended that this hospital should be transferred to a site at some distance from the present situation of the hospital. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to tell us whether or not the views of the Minister, as expressed, though not embodied in the Bill, follow the recommendations of the Hospitals Commission or whether he made up his mind, within the Department, as to this being the best way of dealing with the matter. Whatever criticism the Hospitals Commission have been subjected to&mdash; and any body of men in such a position would be subjected to criticism&mdash;they have exercised a very wise discretion in the advice they have given and they have made a very useful survey of the <Col N="692" /> hospital problem in the State.  If the Minister has not the advice of the commission behind him, then I think the proposal requires more backing, and that it is not sufficient to throw it into the void, as is done in this Bill, and empower the Minister to purchase land for the building of a new hospital.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to satisfy some of the fears aroused amongst many people interested in the hospital service of Dublin and the general social services of the State by the tremendous power given to the Minister in this Bill.  I have dwelt largely on what seems to me to be the most dangerous point, but there is hardly a point in the hospital's administration which is not under the thumb of the Minister.  Though this hospital has been subject to a certain amount of Governmental control throughout its history, it has mainly been managed by a board of governors, which had power so to manage it, though they had not the full powers embodied in this Bill.  I do not think that anybody who has a knowledge of hospital service, as practised in this country, and experience of the people who make use of that hospital service, is enamoured of the proposal to substitute for voluntary service a State-controlled service.  In so far as this Bill appears to be a step further in the claim of the Department to control the hospitals in detail, I think the Seanad should hesitate to approve of it.</P>

      <P>I do not know how far one can discuss general hospital policy on this Bill.  I am anxious, at some time, to raise rather wider issues of hospital administration than could, I think, properly be done in this debate.  At the moment, I merely want to ask the Minister to expedite the issue of the reports of the Hospitals Commission.  I have not before me the date of the last report, but I think I am right in saying that one report took, at least, three years to produce.  These reports lose much of their value when they appear so late as that.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary cannot say much about the matter now, but it is very important that those interested in hospital questions <Col N="693" /> should have the reports of the Hospitals Commission more promptly than they have had them in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to know much about the position of our hospitals and I, certainly, do not know very much about the details involved in this Bill.  The only reason I venture to say a few words is that it seems abundantly clear, after reading the Bill &mdash;and very definitely so after listening to Senator Rowlette, who was clear and, as usual, moderate in his expressions&mdash;that this Bill is intended, so far as one hospital is concerned, very greatly to increase the powers of the central authority, as distinct from local or voluntary control.  It appears to me that during the past ten years or so we have been going too far in that direction.  The whole tendency of our State has been to get governmental, which means either bureaucratic or political, control over almost all our institutions.</P>
      <P>I think our direction should be the other way.  It should be to get the largest number of persons together to work for the good of the country with as little control as possible from the central authority.  There is something wrong with the direction in which we are going.  We started in that way before the war, and the war has accentuated it.  That, I suppose, has been inevitable, but I think our efforts in that direction should definitely be of a temporary character.  I look on this development with the very greatest misgivings, so far as it applies to our hospitals, because if you start with it in the case of one hospital it will spread to the others.  You will have control from whatever building in which the Department of Local Government is contained.  In saying that I do not wish to make any attack on the officials.  We do not know who the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary will be at the time this new hospital is built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that, not because I am in a position to prove that they will necessarily be less efficient than the voluntary system, but because I feel that if you go along in the direction indicated <Col N="694" /> in this Bill you will get a smaller number of people to give their services voluntarily, and inevitably will lose a great deal of voluntary effort so far as hospital work in Dublin is concerned. That work, at present, may be anything but perfect.  One hears complaints here and there, but one also hears a great deal of praise for it.  The fact, at any rate, is that most of us are proud of the reputation of our Dublin hospitals and medical schools.  We are proud also of the large amount of voluntary service given to them by eminent surgeons, eminent physicians, and by a great many eminent civilians.  If you are gradually going to substitute bureaucratic control, under the direction of the Government of the day, for those voluntary services, then, I think, judging by the experience of other countries, a great deal of that voluntary work will gradually disappear. In a country like ours, which is a comparatively poor one, I think that is a wrong direction to take.  I mention that because I think it applies in a peculiar way to our medical services. I am not competent to say how far it applies to this particular hospital, but I, nevertheless, think it is a step in the wrong direction.  The Second Reading of this Bill seemed to me to be the appropriate occasion on which to indicate that point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some information from the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to Section 21 which proposes to give power to the Minister to acquire compulsorily a site for this new hospital in any part of the city.  In my view there is no necessity for the taking of compulsory powers for that purpose.  So far as I understand the position the Minister will be quite free to choose a site in any place he wishes around the city for this new hospital.  His area of selection is fairly wide, and hence I do not think it should be necessary for him to take compulsory powers under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Barniville</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Sir John Keane has said, some of us are not quite clear as to how far we may go in any remarks we may have to make <Col N="695" /> with regard to the Dublin voluntary hospitals in connection with this Bill. Senator Douglas very truly said that Senator Rowlette was very clear and very restrained when speaking on the Bill.  That is the trouble with all of us, voluntary hospital workers.  It is difficult to be restrained, but we are inclined, when we think about the subject even without speaking on it, to lose our tempers.  From the broad point of view, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Sweeps, under which this whole scheme is being run, were instituted originally for the Dublin voluntary hospitals.</P>
      <P>Under the Cosgrave Government an amendment was made allocating 33? per cent. of the Sweep funds to the rate-aided hospitals.  That was a wise proposal.  At that time there was in existence a commission which was under strict Government control.  The commission consisted of three people: a financier, an architect and a Government representative.  Under it everything worked in a perfectly smooth way.  Finally, after certain changes had been made, the Hospitals Commission was established.  To my mind, both commissions were given the task of tackling one of the greatest problems in Western Europe, namely, the problem of the Dublin voluntary hospitals. That problem is extremely involved. It is difficult for the layman to understand the position of the voluntary hospitals in Dublin.  They are all differently constituted.  Some of them have grown up around street corners in the course of centuries, some have been taken over by religious bodies, and some have been taken over largely, or in part, by the county, by the City of Dublin, or by the Government. The financial side of the problem is extremely intricate, even to financiers.  In spite of the Hospitals Commission report, which it took three years to produce, I want to say that in my view the Department of Local Government and the Hospitals Commission have still only a very faint idea of this problem.  I will say no more about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> As regards the question immediately at issue, Senator Rowlette has pointed out the salient facts.  He emphasised the question of clinical teaching, which is a very important one, because, as you all know, the Dublin schools have a very high reputation for their clinical teaching.  I do not like to use two adjectives, but I think, in connection with this hospital, that I might.  In my view, it is fatuous and infantile to think of transferring a magnificent hospital like the Richmond Hospital, a centre for the treatment of sick and poor patients, to the suburbs, particularly when we think what transport conditions are at present.  Take the case of a poor woman in North King Street whose husband has a bad ear-buncle on the back of his neck.  If he has to go to a hospital outside the city, and is there for a fortnight or three weeks, she cannot go see him very often.  First of all, she will have to get a bus to take her to Dorset Street, and another to Cabra or somewhere else. That will cost her at least 3d. each way.  Then the time may come when she will not be able to get a bus.  The upshot will be that she will not get her husband sent to hospital, or else may walk across the river and get him into St. Kevin's Hospital.  The important consideration should be the convenience of sick poor who want hospital attendance.</P>
    <P>I repeat that, to my mind, it is a fatuous thing to change a magnificent hospital like this from its present site, apart altogether from the expense involved. There is another point that may be of interest to the House.  Take the case of the Mater Hospital, which is one of the biggest hospitals in Ireland. There we are supposed to have been building a 500-bed hospital over the last ten years.  I have built practically half of it myself, spending night after night in the office of the architect.  Still there is not a stone upon a stone, and there will not be a stone upon a stone until I am long dead, so why go into this wild scheme of disturbing a hospital which is doing wonderful work and which is one of the best teaching hospitals in the world?</P>

      <P>The debate has wandered over a rather wide field and very little of it has, in fact, been related strictly to the Bill before the House.  I can appreciate the anxiety of Senators who are particularly interested in the hospital question to avail of any opportunity of raising the wider questions for the purpose of discussion; but, at the same time, a full-dress debate on the wider aspects of hospital policy in Dublin and throughout the rest of the State, is scarcely appropriate to the present Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Rowlette, in his opening remarks when this Bill was under discussion last week, complained that I did not emphasise the reputation of the existing House of Industry hospitals as a teaching school.  I must plead guilty to that.  I did not refer to the standing of those hospitals as one of the leading clinical hospitals in Dublin, but that was not with any sinister object in mind.  My approach to the Bill, in the statement I put before the House, was inspired by the desire to inform the House on matters of which it might not have much knowledge.  I assumed that the House would be fairly well informed&mdash; as would anyone interested in hospital conditions in Dublin or throughout Ireland&mdash;of the position that the House of Industry Hospitals occupied as a clinical school in the City of Dublin.  I believe I am still right in that assumption.  At any rate, I want to make it clear that it was not for any other purpose that I omitted to <Col N="698" /> make reference to the standing of this institution as a teaching hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Government in relation to this hospital is, so far from restricting its activities as a teaching hospital, to enable it to continue to rank among the first hospitals of Ireland, and, perhaps, among the first hospitals of Europe.  It is in order that it should be fully equipped to occupy that distinguished position, and continue to occupy it, that it is proposed to provide a new hospital. Senator Rowlette, in the course of his remarks, stated that he did not quite understand what a State hospital means.  He reminds us that, 20 years ago, the British Government repudiated the idea that the associated hospitals known as the House of Industry Hospitals were State hospitals.  That is true.  In 1919, arising out of a demand of the Richmond, Whit-worth and Hardwicke representatives for an increased subvention from the British Treasury, Lord Crawford, speaking on behalf of the British Government in the House of Lords, adopted the attitude that these hospitals were not State institutions. He used that argument, at any rate, as the grounds upon which the British Government refused to increase the grants.  He was very quickly brought to task by no less a person than the secretary of the Board of Governors.  The question was raised in the House of Lords on the 13th August, 1919, and I think the very next day the secretary of the board wrote to the <i>Irish Times</i>, taking Lord Crawford to task for his assumption that these institutions were not State institutions. In the course of his letter to the <i>Irish Times</i>, the secretary of the Board of Governors, Mr. W. Webster Smith, stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;By the Act of 1856, the government of the hospitals was retained in the hands of the Lord Lieutenant, who alone could nominate governors. The Treasury Pension Regulations were applied to all permanent salaried officers in the hospitals, and every foot of ground and every stone <Col N="699" /> in the hospitals was vested in the Board of Works.  These conditions would appear to render the hospitals a State institution, and certainly militate against their recognition by the public as on the same plane as the ordinary charitable hospitals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A few days later, on the 27th August, a letter in somewhat similar terms from the present secretary of the board appeared in the <i>Irish Times,</i> in the course of which he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The House of Industry, whence these hospitals originated and derived their collective name, was established in 1772, by the Act 11 and 12, Geo. III.  Ireland, was continued as a Government institution down to the passing of the Act of Union, and, on the passing of that Act, was adopted and maintained as a Government institution until 1856. By the Act of 1856 the hospitals were continued as a Government institution, the absolute control of which was vested in the Lord Lieutenant as the King's representative in Ireland. The property was vested in the Commissioners of Public Works, while provision was made for superannuation allowance for the staff, subsequently regulated in 1859 by the 22nd Vict.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on he states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Lord Crawford's statement, too, in which he seeks to justify a wrong wantonly inflicted on the poor of Dublin, and on which Mr. Bonar Law unhappily relies, is inaccurate, evasive, and unworthy of one in Lord Crawford's high position...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While, as I say, it is true that Lord Crawford, speaking on behalf of the British Government, maintained that these institutions were not State hospitals, that attitude was immediately repudiated by the representative of the Board of Governors.</P>
    <P>The existing House of Industry Hospitals are State hospitals by Act of Parliament, and not by any new interpretation of any old Act of Parliament. They have been State institutions since they were first instituted and are under the complete and absolute control of <Col N="700" /> the different Departments of State. The Commissioners for Public Works own the buildings, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, as the successor to the Lord Lieutenant, administers and controls the hospitals and may appoint a board for that purpose; and the Department of Finance, as the successor of the Treasury Commissioners, have to be consulted in all matters relating to increased salaries, pension schemes, and so on.  If it were necessary&mdash;it scarcely is necessary; I think it was Senator Douglas who appeared to be completely at sea in relation to the nature of these institutions&mdash;to quote the different sections of the Act of 1856, the House would see at once that these institutions are entirely under the control of the State and that the Minister for Local Government could manage these institutions without the appointment of a Board of Governors at all. He could appoint one, two or three, or any number of governors, or he could administer the institutions direct from the Department.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Senator Rowlette to what he called a diversion of the Sweepstakes funds to rate-aided hospitals.  Such diversion as has taken place has been a diversion by a deliberate Act of the Oireachtas.  Listening to Senator Rowlette when he mentioned this matter, one would feel that the suggestion was being made that the present Government were responsible for this diversion.  That attitude of mind has been corrected to-day, and it has been made clear by more than one speaker that the Act permitting this diversion of funds was passed on 17th July, 1931.  There was general agreement on that policy.  Fianna Fáil was the chief Opposition Party at that time and, speaking from recollection, I believe that we were in favour of the Government of the day adopting that policy and that we supported the Bill when it was considered in the Dáil. I do not make that as a definite statement, but that is my recollection.  I think that the Oireachtas was almost unanimously in favour of that diversion.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Senator Rowlette suggests that the Oireachtas <Col N="701" /> did something wrong in passing that legislation, enabling the institutions of local authorities to benefit from the Hospitals Trust Fund, but, in the light of the fact that that has been the law for so many years, I do not think it is proper to criticise the Government now in power for administering the law.  If the Senator feels very strongly in the matter, perhaps he might consider introducing legislation repealing the Act of July, 1931, the Act that provided for this subvention.</P>
    <P>Examining the matter on its merits, I do not agree with Senator Rowlette or any other Senator who holds the rigid view that the voluntary hospitals alone are entitled to the entire proceeds from the Sweepstakes.  It was not denied that the voluntary hospitals took the initiative in the matter of organising sweepstakes, but neither can it be denied that, were it not for the protection and assistance the State gave in the matter of sweepstakes, and the monopoly given to the Hospitals Trust, the Sweepstakes could not have achieved the success that they did subsequently achieve.  Laying that argument aside, is there any convincing reason why the local authorities, who have to provide hospital facilities for the poor throughout the provinces, should not be assisted in the same way, and to a corresponding extent, as the voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin are to be assisted?  It seems to me that the ratepayers of Dublin City and County and the areas that were intended immediately to benefit from the Hospitals Trust funds, according to Senator Rowlette, have the same legal and moral obligations towards the poor that the ratepayers in the provinces have.</P>

      <P>I am glad I have evoked some &ldquo;hear, hears.&rdquo;  If that proposition is sound, then there is no substance in the suggestion made with reference to the diversion of portion of the funds to the rate-aided hospitals.  It seems to me they are just as well entitled to a share of the Sweepstakes funds as are the voluntary hospitals.  In so far as the voluntary hospitals supply a <Col N="702" /> need that might otherwise have to be supplied by the rates of the City of Dublin particularly, and the City of Cork to a lesser extent&mdash;in so far as they supply a need that would otherwise have to be supplied by the finances accumulated through the rates, the rates are relieved to that extent. Consequently, there is not very much difference in the long run between subsidising the voluntary hospitals that are serving the needs of the local authorities in certain areas, and subsidising the local authorities that are carrying the direct responsibility in providing these services for the poor.</P>
      <P>Apart from that altogether, nobody would suggest that the proceeds of the sale of tickets for any of these sweeps come entirely from the City of Dublin. They do not.  Tickets are sold throughout the whole country, throughout the whole of Europe and, indeed, throughout the whole world, and they have not been sold purely for the purpose of assisting the voluntary hospitals in Dublin.  They have been sold for the purpose of providing a proper hospital system throughout the whole of this country, to be at the disposal particularly of the poorer classes of the community.</P>

      <P>That is not so.  Senator Rowlette also suggested that the Hospitals Trust funds have gradually been depleted.  That statement is, to say the least of it, misleading.  In order that the House may be fully informed on the matter, I shall have to burden Senators with some figures regarding the position of the Hospitals Trust funds.  Probably most of you are interested in the matter, anyhow.  The amount in the fund on the 31st December, 1942, was £8,199,158 15s. 3d. <Col N="703" /> The highest amount recorded as being in the fund was £8,879,380 6s. 3d., on the 31st December, 1939.  There is not a very serious depletion there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, and I am just coming to that point.  The fact that the greater portion of that money, that £8,000,000 that has accumulated in the Hospitals Trust fund, has to be retained invested and is not available for constructional work, is because of the rising annual deficits in the voluntary hospitals.  If these deficits are to be met, a capital sum must be held invested in order to bring in an income to meet them from year to year, and, if we hold money for that purpose, it is scarcely fair to suggest that we are depleting the funds of the Hospitals Trust.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that. The deficit for 1933 was £50,273 and for 1938 it had become £115,690.  For 1939 it was £156,957.  These are all prewar years.  For 1941, the deficit was £209,009.  At 3 per cent., it takes a sum of £6,966,966 to produce £209,009, which means that of the £8,000,000 we have, upwards of £7,000,000 has to be held invested, if we are to pay the annual deficits of the voluntary hospitals.</P>

      <P>Senator Rowlette, in dealing with the question of the appointment of members of the Board of Governors, suggested that these appointments were automatic, under the old régime, in the good old days when the Lord Lieutenant appointed the Board of Governors.  It depends on what you mean by &ldquo;automatic.&rdquo; The Lord Lieutenant made the appointments, but as to what transpired before he became automatic is more than I would venture to suggest. We could truthfully say that the appointments are automatic to-day. The mantle of the Lord Lieutenant has fallen upon the Minister, God help him, in this particular regard.  He now appoints the Board of Governors and I think the appointment is automatic.</P>

      <P>Oh, no; there is nothing done in our Department when we are asleep.  In fact, we are wide awake, <Col N="706" /> and if we were not so wide awake, perhaps the appointments would be more popular with Senator Rowlette. I do not know; the Senator may, perhaps, be fully satisfied with them.  In that issue, in case there is any doubt as to the suitability or popularity of any of the recent appointments to the Board of Governors, I would say that in a recent discussion with the chairman of the Board of Governors and others, he told me that if he himself had picked the Board of Governors appointed by the present Minister for Local Government, he could not have improved on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly for the new members of it.  He was borne out in all that by the vice-chairman, who was also present.  I mention these things lest there should be any suggestion that the Minister packed the board or made any unpopular appointments to it.  I do not ask the House to accept my estimate of their virtues of suitability; I merely quote for the benefit of the House what the chairman of the Board of Governors himself told me.  It was not the practice in the old days that are gone to consult the Board of Governors when vacancies occurred. Neither was it the practice under the previous Government nor is it the practice of this Government.  It is open to the board or to anybody interested in the matter to recommend a suitable person when a vacancy occurs; but, of course, if all the recommendations do not agree, they cannot be given effect to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the site&mdash;a discussion which is of doubtful propriety, too, but the Cathaoirleach is very generous in his interpretation of what <Col N="707" /> is in order and having permitted people to refer to the site, I have no doubt that he will permit me to say a word on it&mdash;I should like to preface my remarks on the question by the reminder that this Bill does not propose to select a site.  This Bill empowers the Minister to select a site in or near the City of Dublin.  That is all it does.  Some Senators seem to think it a very dangerous thing to empower the Minister to select a site.  The thought has been running through the minds of one of the speakers here to-day that a statutory obligation should be put upon the Minister to seek and obtain the advice of the Hospitals Commission.  If such an amendment is put forward, we can deal with it when we meet it, but to my mind it would be a complete absurdity to put a statutory obligation on the Minister to consult a body which is subordinate to the Minister and to the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a statutory duty on the Minister to send to the Hospitals Commission applications which he gets for grants from Sweepstakes funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different matter altogether.  We are dealing with powers to acquire a site&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>And to spend Sweepstake funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the right of the Minister to select a site.  The Minister responsible will seek and obtain the advice and assistance of anybody deemed competent to advise him on a matter like that.  The views of the board will be considered; the views of the Hospitals Commission, if they have any, will be considered; and, if Senator Rowlette has views and submits them, they will be carefully considered.  The selection of the site will not be automatic, but all relative considerations <Col N="708" /> will be carefully considered.  The views of the board will be obtained, but the ultimate responsibility, and the statutory powers, will rest with the Minister.  As matters stand neither the board not the Minister has power to acquire a site.  The board's powers are strictly limited to the powers of management.  They have no power to acquire land; they have no power to erect buildings; they have no power to take down derelict buildings.  Some of the buildings there at present are, in fact, a danger to the public, but they have no statutory powers to remove them.  They have no power to carry out repairs to the existing buildings. It is true that the Commissioners of Public Works, as far as the property is vested in them, have power to execute repairs and alterations.  In fact, the board, without statutory powers, have acquired adjacent property, and that adjacent property, at the present time, would require rather urgently some skilled attention.  The board have no power to deal with that, but if this Bill were law, the board would have the necessary statutory power to deal with such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other question, if we must discuss it, as to whether the hospital should be built on the present site, or built on some other site, we might debate for a long time.  There is a good deal to be said for and against. In so far as the information at my disposal goes, we could not erect a hospital with 550 or 600 beds on the present site.  The space is not available.  It has been suggested that we might acquire adjacent land and buildings and, in that way, extend the site.  How far that would be practicable is a matter that can be examined, but I may frankly say that the Department is not favourably disposed towards extending on the present site, partly for the reason that the locality is unsuitable, that the space available is limited, and perhaps more than anything else, that by reason of the development of the city, and the housing schemes that have been carried out, the density of population in the city has shifted, and the future development of the city, as we anticipate it, will further transpose the density of population in the city <Col N="709" /> and, in building a hospital that we hope will serve the poor of Dublin for a very long time, one has to try to visualise what the position will be in 20, 30 or 40 years hence, as far as that can be visualised.  I mention this matter to indicate that it is not at all a question of selecting a site and getting on with the building.  People in a responsible position, having to make that decision, have to take much wider matters into consideration before reaching a decision.</P>
    <P>I need hardly mention, as I am quite sure Senator Rowlette knows just as well as I do, that the modern tendency in most European countries is to build hospitals outside cities, in the country or on the brink of it.  That tendency has taken practical shape in Italy, France, Czecho-Slovakia, Finland, Belgium, and at the present time is taking shape in Britain. If I were not to weary the House I could quote many authorities of considerable standing and weight to indicate the soundness of that policy.  Apart from the public health point of view, the adoption of this policy has been expedited by the experience gained in the present European war, where hospitals situate in centres of population have been demolished overnight, and where the whole hospital system has been paralysed as a result of air attacks.  It would be all very well to say that we will never be involved in anything like that.  But we have no assurance.  We must plan on the assumption that the fate that has overtaken other civilised communities might sometime overtake this civilised community.  I should also remind the House on this question of site that, from the point of view of the medical students of the future, and of the desire for teaching facilities that this institution would afford, as well as from the point of view of the sick poor, and their relatives, the Bill provides for the gradual closing of the existing hospitals from time to time as the Minister, after consultation with the board, is satisfied that the need for these hospitals no longer exists.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House it will be, probably, a number of years before a <Col N="710" /> stone can be laid upon a stone for the provision of a new hospital.  We cannot hope to begin building until this emergency has passed and until materials are available.  We desire to acquire a site in order that the planning of the institution can be carried out, and that when materials become available, the necessary and tedious preliminary work will have been carried out, and we can then proceed with the hospital.  Even with this hospital established I firmly believe that there will be still a bed shortage in the City of Dublin, and that the need for continuing the existing institutions will be so evident that it will not be possible to close down any part of existing institutions for very many years ahead, until, in fact, the whole contemplated hospital scheme for Dublin has been completed. Even then I venture to predict&mdash;and this is predicting a long time into the future&mdash;that there will be still a need for hospital beds in Dublin.  I do not know how far Senator Rowlette agrees with me, but I believe that the hospital sense is only in process of developing in this country, and that even ten years ago there was considerable difficulty in inducing people, when ill, to go to hospital for treatment, as they would much prefer to remain at home.  They used say to the doctor: &ldquo;If I am to die at all I prefer to die at home.&rdquo;  A more enlightened outlook prevails to-day.</P>
    <P>Many more people are anxious and willing to avail of hospital facilities at the present time than even a few years ago.  I believe that the outlook in this matter is only in the process of development, and that the future will see a much greater demand for hospital facilities than we see even to-day.  If that prediction should be well-founded it is reasonable to assume that the conditions precedent to the closing down of the existing hospitals will not obtain in this country for very many years.</P>

As to the point raised by Senator Barniville, perhaps he misunderstood some of my remarks.  At any rate, I did not intend to impute to him that he had been briefed by anybody in making the statement that he made here.  But, as he has brought himself under fire, I will say this to him: that his argument that it would be fatuous under the present system of transport to transfer the hospital from its present site out to the periphery of the city does not sound at all convincing in the setting that we have here.  There is not any hope of being able to provide this hospital while the present system of transport prevails.  It will be very many years before the hospital is provided anyway, and we all hope that the present system of transport will be very much overhauled and modernised before this hospital is available.</P>

Before it came into operation the rates that were paid to private companies for insurance ranged from 40/- to 67/6 per cent. of the value of the live stock exported, and the insurance at that time only covered the risks from port to port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A board was set up under the Act which consists of eight members and it is laid down in the Act that at least one of these must be interested in the pig trade.  As a matter of fact, the present board is composed of eight members, seven of whom represent the cattle and sheep trade and one the pig trade.  The board when they went into business commenced with a rate of £2 per cent. of the value of the animals exported, and they extended the cover, so that the cover was not only from port to port, but also extended to the time the animals reached their destination on the other side, if that period was within 72 hours.  They subsequently reduced their rate to 30/- on the 30th January, 1941, and reduced it again to 25/- on the 18th November, 1941.  It came down to 20/- on the 25th January, 1942, down to 15/- on the 1st May, 1942, and the present rate is only 10/-.  Even though they have been reducing their rate all the time, they had at the end of the year about £187,000 in the funds and they paid claims during that time amounting to about £85,000; so that we can take it that they collected something like £250,000 in premiums during the time that they have been in office.  If we were to assume that the insurance rate would have remained even at the lowest available at the time this Act came into operation, we can claim that <Col N="713" /> this board saved the cattle trade about £250,000 during the time they have been in operation.</P>
    <P>The Act, as I say, applies only to cattle exported from ports in this State and it does not, therefore, cover cattle exported through the Six Counties of Northern Ireland, and from the ports in the Six Counties. This Bill was brought in principally to cover such exports.  The number of persons on the board will have to be increased in order to give representation to people exporting through Northern Ireland, and it is proposed to bring the number up from eight to nine.  Advantage has been taken of the introduction of the Bill to bring in some small amendments.  For instance, it is proposed that the board now can prescribe minimum rates.  The Act was compulsory in this way: that everybody exporting live stock from ports here had to insure with the board.  But that was largely evaded by some exporters who put down their cattle at a ridiculously low price.  I believe that in some cases cattle were exported which were valued by the exporters at 5/- per head.  Now the board will have power to prescribe minimum rates.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty that the board were up against was that they made assessments which were final.  It was found in at least one case that evidence came to hand later which showed that the board had been wrong, but they had no power to reopen the case.  We are now giving them power to reinvestigate claims if fresh evidence is produced. Another amendment that was inserted in the Dáil had reference to an appeal from the Board of Assessors. There was no provision for an appeal in the original Act, but now that minimum rates are being prescribed, the compulsory feature of the legislation is more pronounced, and it was thought advisable to give a claimant power to appeal.  That is being provided for now in the Bill, and if a person thinks he has a grievance there will be an appeal from any claim to an arbitrator to be appointed.</P>
    <P>There are other small points in this <Col N="714" /> Bill, which are largely put in for administrative purposes and which are not very important in principle.  I think, however, that probably all of us here will agree that the board did extremely useful work during their two years of office and that we would be well advised to pass this Bill, enlarging the scope of their operations so as to permit them to insure live stock going through the Northern Counties, and also to give them the other powers that they think they require.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has explained very fully the provisions of this Bill, and as I, on behalf of the cattle trade, am in complete agreement with the statements he has made, there is very little need for me to say anything at this stage.  I shall move some amendments on the Committee Stage, and the purpose of one of these will be to define the terms of office and the mode of election of the board &mdash;to make an alteration in the present system of election.  The other amendments will be of a minor nature and, as the cattle trade has already discussed them with the Minister, and as the Minister has promised to accept them, there is no need to discuss them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Act has now been in operation, as the Minister has stated, for about two and a half years, and I think I can truthfully say that it has given complete satisfaction to 95 per cent. of the people engaged in the cattle trade.  As the Minister has explained, the Act did not make any provision to include cattle shipped through North of Ireland ports, and exporters from the Border counties have been agitating since the Act was passed to have the stock which they shipped through those ports included in the scheme. The National Executive were convinced of the justice of the claims of these people, and we approached the Minister and requested him to introduce this amending Bill.  I should like to say now that the cattle trade is very grateful to the Minister and to the officials of his Department for the trouble they have taken in framing <Col N="715" /> this Bill and acceding to our requests. It was very difficult to frame legislation dealing with our stock passing through territory over which we have no control, and I do not know yet how it will work, but if any snags should arise when the Act has been working for some time, then we shall only have to come back to the Minister to find out a way of getting rid of these snags. Belfast and Derry are the natural points for shipping live stock from Donegal and other Border counties to Scotland and the North of England. And the fact that those exporters were so anxious to be included in the scheme is proof that the Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Act is a complete success and that it confers great advantages and benefits on the cattle trade.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this insurance scheme should operate on the same lines as a private insurance company and that exporters should have the option of insuring at any value they like to put on their stock, and to stand a portion of the risk themselves. Well, all I can say about that is that the people who advocate it do not know anything about the Act, the present Bill, or the cattle trade.  If exporters could insure, at nominal values, in fine weather and clear sailing, and then over-insure when there was danger of casualties to their stock, the present premiums would not be at 10/- a head, but would be five times that amount, as they were previous to the passing of this Act, and we would not have £187,000 in a reserve fund at the present time.  This is a compulsory co-operative insurance scheme.  It is worked entirely for the benefit of the cattle trade.  There is no division of profits, and there are no directors' fees, and its success is mainly due to the fact that it has the wholehearted co-operation of, I would say, 95 per cent. of the people engaged in the trade.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion on this Bill in the Dáil, and it was stated that the Insurance Board were vindictive and were going beyond their powers in order to victimise some people engaged in the trade&mdash;some opponents, <Col N="716" /> as it was stated.  On behalf of the board, I should like to repudiate that statement and say that the working of the board has been proved to be completely above board, particularly in view of the fact that it has given complete satisfaction to 95 per cent. of the people engaged in the trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I should like to raise on this Bill.  I am glad to know that the Minister has accepted an amendment from the Dáil giving power to claimants to appeal to an arbitrator.  I think that important, because it is a well-known practice in insurance that arbitration is almost invariably provided for by an insurance company.  If that is so in the case of optional insurance, I think it should be essential in the case of compulsory insurance: that an appeal can be made to an arbitrator in the event of dispute with regard to a claim.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the board of this company has done its work extremely well, but even the most perfect of boards and the shrewdest of assessors are liable to make mistakes, and if that principle, as accepted by the Minister in the Dáil, that there should be provision for appeal to an arbitrator, is a sound one, it would appear to me that there should be no reason why, taking into account the fact that this insurance scheme is compulsory, provision should not be made to make this new provision retrospective, and between this and the Committee Stage I should like the Minister to consider the point.  I am not speaking from the point of view of the cattle trade.  I am regarding this question from its purely insurance aspect.  I think that most people would support my view that in any compulsory insurance scheme there should be provision for arbitration, and I think the Minister might consider accepting an amendment to make the provision for an arbitrator retrospective in its effect.  That is all I have to say on this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Brennan has expressed my point of view, and said almost everything I wanted to <Col N="717" /> say.  The original Bill provided that the decision of the assessors would be final, leaving no room for a dissatisfied claimant to appeal to a court of law or to a referee.  The Minister has been good enough to bring in a provision in the amending Bill providing that the claim of a person who is dissatisfied with the award of the assessor can go before the referee.  I think that is a very good feature in the Bill, and I should like to see that provision made retrospective.  The matter was debated at length in the other House, and statements were made, I think, impeaching the character of the assessors and of the board of directors.  I do not want to associate myself with that in any way.  I believe that the board of directors and the assessors did their work to the best of their ability, and according to their lights, but, as Senator Brennan said, there will be mistakes in the best regulated families. Mistakes may have been made in the past, and I think it would be advisable that, where there are dissatisfied claimants, their claims should be referred to the referee.  The dissatisfied claimant will have to lodge £10 in each case, and I think that will be sufficient to prevent any fictitious claim being brought forward.  On the Committee Stage, I hope to move an amendment along those lines, and I will ask the Minister and the House to give it favourable consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being slightly irrelevant, I should like to put to the Minister the fact that this scheme originated as a war measure. We have great numbers of casualties amongst live stock within our own boundaries, and, as far as I know, there is very little effort at compensating the owners for losses sustained, but the moment we proceed to export our live stock we endeavour effectively to insure against losses.  Within our own territory, losses are sustained in transport, through disease and through loss of carcases subsequent to slaughter. That is entirely inappropriate to this Bill, but I avail of the opportunity to put it to the Minister that it is up to his Department to consider losses sustained by the producer and by the <Col N="718" /> subsequent dealers in the live stock&mdash; cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry&mdash;within our own territory, apart altogether from the fact that we are now dealing with insurance of live stock which are being exported to another country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot answer the question asked by Senator Baxter, but I will take a note of it and see if I can get some information by the time the next stage is being discussed here in the Seanad.  The first point mentioned by Senator Counihan was that he proposes to put down an amendment with regard to the terms of office and method of election of members of the board.  The period of office was discussed rather fully in the Dáil.  It was also discussed between members of the cattle trade and myself. I should like very much to meet their point, and I think I may succeed in bringing in an amendment on the Committee Stage that will meet it.  I agree with Senator Counihan and others who hold the view that it is rather a dangerous prospect to see the whole board going out at the one time. It is possible that there might be some revolution in the cattle trade, and the national executive that would be there at that particular time might be inclined to put the whole board out and put a new board in.  That might not be good for the insurance part of the business, anyway, and what I intend to move on the Committee Stage is that, when the five years are up, from that date forward a third of the board would retire each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point mentioned by Senator Counihan was that it is held by some that exporters should be at liberty to value their own stock at their own discretion. I agree again with the points made by Senator Counihan against that contention.  We should look on this as a co-operative insurance company. I think that is the only way we can look at it logically, in order to <Col N="719" /> justify its existence at all.  If there are a few in the cattle trade who are not prepared willingly to co-operate, then unfortunately we have to see that they are made to toe the line.  If we did not do that, and if certain members of the cattle trade were to be influenced more by the weather than anything else in valuing their stock, it would naturally have the effect of raising the premium all round, because the insurance fund must be built up somehow or other, and those who were playing the game would be paying a little more because the game was not being played fairly by everybody.  That, of course, in turn would react upon the producer, because I think we all agree here that the exporter, when buying his cattle at the fair, takes all the expenses into account, including the insurance premium.  He calculates the figure at which he can buy those cattle and sell them at a profit.  If he has to pay a certain premium, he takes that into account, and if that premium goes up he pays a little less for the cattle. From the point of view of the producer, therefore, it is very important that we should not only try to keep the premium down but keep it uniform for everybody who is buying cattle.</P>
    <P>Senator Brennan and Senator O'Callaghan intend, I believe, to put down an amendment to make this arbitration retrospective.  I am not so sure about that.  I certainly will look into the matter to see if it is possible, but there are two considerations that I must keep in mind.  The first is whether it is legally possible.  I have never known of a case like this in which it was done retrospectively. In fact I think it would be considered a very bad principle to bring in any retrospective legislation that would detrimentally affect any person or body of persons, and of course it must be argued that this may have a detrimental effect on the funds of the board. But as this is a type of fund that may be looked at as a semi-public one, that consideration would not be so strong as if we were dealing with private individuals. For instance, I think we could hardly agree at all to legislation that might retrospectively react detrimentally on private individuals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> The second point to be considered is whether or not it is fair to the board. We can all, I think, see the point that, when the board has paid a claim, up to this it was final, and they may not&mdash; I am not sure&mdash;have kept proper records of a claim of that kind when it was finally disposed of, as it was finally disposed of legally up to this Therefore, I want to be sure that the board are in a position to meet any of those cases that have been dealt with if we make this provision retrospective. As I say, I am prepared to investigate both those points to see if the amendment could be met in any way when it is put down by the Senators.</P>
    <P>A much bigger point was raised by Senator O'Donovan, namely, the losses sustained by producers and cattle dealers in ordinary farming and dealing transactions.  It is a very, very big point.  I have no idea as to what the finances of an insurance scheme for live stock in general would be, but I think it would be a very big thing.  I am not sure, but my recollection is that the present premium of any of the live stock insurance companies to insure cattle, say, against mortality of any kind is about 5 or 6 or 7 per cent. That is a very heavy premium, and one can see the enormous cost that would be involved if we have to bring in any sort of legislation or any sort of scheme to deal with mortality in general.  I think at the moment we have 4,000,000 cattle in the country, which must be worth, as they stand, about £50,000,000.  On the basis I have already mentioned, if we were to insure all those cattle against mortality, the cost would be in the region of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 a year.  That is a very big thing to face, a much bigger thing than the scheme under consideration here.  I think that is all that arose on this debate.  As Senator Counihan said, it is a matter for Committee. The general principle has already been discussed on the Principal Act.  It is really an amending Bill and, therefore, perhaps more for discussion in detail on Committee Stage than on this stage.</P>

      <P>That Emergency Powers (No. 181) Order, 1942 (Second Amendment) Order, 1942, Emergency Powers (No. 227) Order, 1942 (Amendment) Order, 1942, Emergency Powers (No. 228) Order, 1942 (Amendment) Order, 1942, Emergency Powers (No. 249) Order, 1942, made by the Government on the 30th day of December, 1942, be and are hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>When we passed the Emergency Powers Act we all believed that the Orders made under that Act would be based on commonsense and would not inflict hardship on any class of the community.  The Orders which I propose should be annulled, in my opinion, are not based on commonsense and, as I am informed and as I believe, they inflict unnecessary hardships on the pork butchers and will not have the effect of increasing the production of pigs and bacon but of decreasing production.</P>
      <P>As Senators may not understand the full meaning of the Orders, I think I should read a circular that was sent to each registered pork butcher by the Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, which fully explains the objects of Order No. 249.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Agriculture to call your attention to the provisions of the Emergency Powers (No. 249) Order, 1942, which was made by the Government on the 30th December, 1942, and under the provisions of which no person shall, after the 31st December, 1942, cure at any premises bacon for sale or for reward unless such person is the holder of a curing and slaughtering licence granted by the Minister in respect of such premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of Section 14 of the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935, whereby registered pork butchers were permitted to cure a certain percentage of the pork used and dealt with by them accordingly ceased to have effect after the latter date and it will not, therefore, be necessary for you <Col N="722" /> to furnish returns on form P.B. 7 to this Department in respect of any accounting period, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, after the month of December, 1942.</P>
    <P>Kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter.</P>
    <P Just="Right">I am, Sir or Gentlemen,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Your obedient Servant,</P>
    <P Just="Right">D. Twomey,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the Pigs and Bacon Act, pork butchers were allowed to cure or pickle 15 per cent. of the amount which they were permitted by quota to kill, but, since this Order came into force, it is an offence punishable by severe penalties&mdash;as all Emergency Powers Orders provide&mdash;a big fine or jail, or jail and a big fine combined.  The whole point is that the practice of pickling bacon is a trade that has been carried on by the pork butchers for centuries.  This Order prohibits any such thing.  There are several portions of pig which are not suitable for sale as pork chops or pork steaks, such as the bellies, heads and other portions.  The age-old practice of the pork butchers was to pickle those portions and sell them as pickled pork.  Anyone who understands anything about the meat trade knows that pork is a very perishable commodity, particularly in murky, heavy or sultry weather.  It gets tainted very quickly. On Saturday night the pork butcher might be convinced that the pork he had on hands would not keep until the following week.  His natural instinct would be to put it into pickle and sell it on the Monday or Tuesday as perfectly good food.  That has been the practice, but, in the present circumstances, he cannot do that.  He can throw it into the ashbin, or burn it, but he is not allowed to pickle it.  I contend that that is inflicting a great hardship on pork butchers.  The Order, instead of conserving bacon or food for the people, will result in a considerable amount of waste if that pork is not allowed to be pickled.  The Minister may say, as he said in Monaghan, that he is doing all this to preserve food for the human population, that if we had more pigs we would have less wheat, and less oats and other foods <Col N="723" /> for consumption by humans.  I do not at all agree with the Minister.  Anyone with a practical knowledge of the country knows that there is plenty of food, sufficient to produce double the amount of bacon that is being produced at present, if an economic price were given for pigs.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the food which, if a good price were given for pigs, would be devoted to producing pigs for bacon, is going to produce forward stores for shipment to England, that is, for producing cattle.  If there was an economic price for bacon, we would produce bacon and produce twice the quantity we are producing at present. For that reason I cannot see any justification for this Order or why the Minister should not give some concession, meet the trade in a reasonable way and allow this practice, which according to the pork butchers has been carried on for centuries, to continue to some extent. The amount which they were allowed to cure under the Pigs and Bacon Act was 15 per cent.  If the Minister is prepared to make some concession, if he would say, for instance, that he would reduce the amount to 10 per cent. of the allotted quota, I would be satisfied.  I think that in all fairness the Minister should pay some attention to the case the pork butchers have made, and give them the concession which I am demanding on their behalf.</P>

      <P>I second the motion.  I think the plea made by Senator Counihan on behalf of the pork butchers is only commonsense.  Anybody living in a town and knowing the conditions which exist in popular pork shops on Saturday nights, will agree that Senator Counihan has given a correct picture of the situation.  I do not wish to delay the House, but commonsense is the common law, and what we should try to brush aside in enforcing these Orders is lack of commonsense. I think the Minister would be well advised to meet the demands made by Senator Counihan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are sometimes blamed for making <Col N="724" /> Orders of this kind without consulting those concerned in the trade, but we could not be blamed on that account in this case.  Representatives of the pork butchers were invited to the Department and were shown the Orders before they were made.  These representatives then said that they saw no objection to the Orders.  They did subsequently, it is true, find that they had some objection to make, and they were again interviewed on last Monday by the officials of the Department.  They then put forward a claim very similar to that which Senator Counihan has outlined in his speech, that, first of all, they should be free to pickle or salt the heads, feet, bellies and sometimes the hams.  Heads and feet are, of course, exempt from the Order.  So far as this Order is concerned, they may do whatever they like with the heads and feet, but under this Order they would not be permitted legally to salt either the hams or the bellies.  They claim that there is a great demand, first of all, for cooked ham.  They say that cooked ham is sold very often in their shops, and they want to be permitted to salt and cure ham and subsequently to cook and sell it as cured ham.  With regard to bellies, they say they cannot be sold as pork, and that the practice was to pickle them and sell them as pickled pork.  That may be all very fine from their point of view, but the object of the Order, as quoted by Senator Counihan, was to help the Pigs and Bacon Commission to distribute as much bacon as possible, as equitably as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Orders had for its object the prevention of illegal curing.  By illegal curing, I mean curing by people who were not licensed to cure bacon for sale.  I am not referring to farmers who kill pigs for their own use.  Curing in that case is all right but we have tried to prevent farmers, shopkeepers and anybody else from killing pigs and converting them into bacon for sale. Up to this pork butchers were permitted to salt or to make bacon out of 15 per cent. of their output.  It was also deemed desirable to stop that business because it was felt that now that the pork butchers are getting a quota, they would use all the pigs they would get under that quota as pork <Col N="725" /> and they could not make the same case for having to convert part of that pork into bacon.  I am not very impressed by the arguments used by the pork butchers, I must say, because in the first place, pigs being so very scarce, we should try to get all the pigs we possibly can converted into bacon, and, secondly, we should get that bacon distributed more in the rural areas than in the towns.  After all, the rural population are consumers of bacon to a great extent and have not the same opportunities for getting beef, mutton and fresh meat generally as townspeople. The people of the towns and cities do not use bacon very much except for breakfast, and I think we will all agree that the countryman's dinner is more important than the townsman's breakfast.  We should try to convert all the pigs we possibly can into bacon, and, secondly, to get that bacon distributed as much as possible in the country.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the conditions with which a pork butcher has to deal on Saturday night.  I think we should discourage the pork butcher killing more pigs than he requires for pork and, if he does overshoot the mark, we should not indemnify him against loss.  Of course, there will not be any loss, probably.  He will find some way of dealing with the stuff left on his hands.  For instance, I have never heard, and I do not know that Senator Counihan has, an ordinary butcher raising any difficulty about the leg of mutton or the side of mutton that he has not sold on Saturday night. He is able to find use for it all right. Probably if one of us went into a shop on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday and asked for a nice leg of mutton he would produce the leg of mutton that he had kept in some place since the previous Saturday night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The pork butcher can do the same thing.  As far as Saturday night is concerned, I do not think we shall have very much difficulty about it.  I think the pork butcher will get over that and that we should not facilitate the pork butcher in carrying over anything he cannot sell in the way of pork.  We should, <Col N="726" /> I think, take the other line more than we have been taking it up to now, and make it difficult for the pork butcher to dispose of any part of a pig other than as pork.  In other words, where he has had a sale for three and a half pigs in the week and he wants to get rid of the remaining half, we will not facilitate him to dispose of four pigs. We shall do our best to bring him down to three pigs so as to let the other pig go to the bacon factory to be converted into bacon, which is wanted very much more urgently.  I think from the public point of view we would have been justified in trying to cut out pork completely, because the people in towns have beef and mutton, and there is no great necessity for pork.  There is much more necessity for bacon.  Of course, we had to have some regard for the people in the trade and, manifestly, it would be unfair to compel the pork butcher to close down entirely. In fact, we are giving him more than his proportion of the pigs under this Order than he got when pigs were plentiful.  When pigs were plentiful pork butchers got 9 per cent. of the total.  Before this Order was operated, that proportion had gone up to something like 30 per cent.  Now it has been regulated at about 15 per cent., so that he is really getting more than his proper proportion.  I should say&mdash;it may be some consolation to Senator Counihan&mdash;that we have listened to the pork butchers and, although I am not at all inclined to accede to their plea that they should be entitled to cure hams in order to sell them as cooked hams, I am inclined to listen to the other story that these bellies cannot be sold as pork and should be pickled.  If we can find a way of doing that without vitiating the whole Order, we shall do it. That is all I can say at the moment.</P>
      <P>I do not want to enter into any deep controversy with Senator Counihan about the price of pigs.  If Senator Counihan would apply the ordinary rule of 5 cwts. of meal to 1 cwt. of pork, he would find that, if he feeds his oats to pigs, it will be worth, under that rule, 43/- a barrel&mdash;which is a very good price&mdash;and if he feeds his barley to pigs, his barley will be worth 50/- a barrel.</P>

    <Title>Export of Milch Cows&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion by Senator Joseph Johnston:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, in view of the tendency of limitation of export of milch cows by reference to available shipping space to depress prices in the home market and widen the margin of dealers' profits, the Seanad is of opinion that such limitation as may be necessary, owing to transport conditions or desirable in the public interest, should be effected by an appropriate levy on the export of milch cows, springers, and in-calf heifers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain that, since the discussion on the last day, I consulted the secretary of the National Executive of the Cattle Trade and he has told me that, within the past four or five weeks, between 200 and 300 export licences for milch cows and springers have been returned unused to him.  It might be well for the Seanad to know that before proceeding <Col N="729" /> with the further discussion of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I moved the adjournment of the debate on this motion on the last occasion.  I was the seconder of the motion, not that I accepted what Senator Johnston proposed, but so that the House would get an opportunity of expressing its opinion on the subject. We have a statement now from Senator Counihan of which I know nothing. He has information form the secretary of some of the live-stock organisations with regard to licences for the export of milch cows.  There is a great deal of confusion of thought about this whole problem.  Frequently, one hears the urban dweller declare that the export of milch cows should be stopped, that it is a disgrace to see our best cows leaving the country.</P>
      <P>The general trend of the remarks is that Government action should be taken to restrict the sale of milch cows by restricting their export.  Coming to this period of the year, when there is an apparent shortage of milk, one hears people loudly declaiming against the export of milch cows.  I am not at all satisfied that Government policy in this matter is fair to the man who produces the cow.  I do not want to see the country left without an adequate supply of milk.  I have voiced my opinion frequently on that subject in this House.  Some of us were prophesying more than two or three years ago what the fruits of pursuing a certain price-policy as regards milk production would be.  Milk is one of our really scarce commodities to-day. The product of milk&mdash;butter&mdash;is, to our discredit, one of the rarest commodities which the housewife finds in her search for food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not as it ought to be.  There are reasons for that situation which the Minister, the House and the country should well understand if we are not going to have a recurrence of it.  The main reason is that the price which the producer has been getting for his milk over a period of years has been altogether too low to keep him in production.  Over a period of years, the income of our dairy farmers has been scandalously low.  Who produces <Col N="730" /> the dairy cow that is going to be exported?  The dairy farmer, of course, and not the grain grower or the feeder of the two or three old bullocks.  The dairymen, in the dairying counties, are producing the good dairy cows that have been exported. The people who say that there ought to be a restriction on the export of milch cows do not know what they are talking about.  Talk of that sort is the right way to go about killing the dairy industry altogether, and to make sure that you will have much less milk and butter in the future.  The one thing that over a period of years has helped the dairy farmer to balance his accounts, was the fact that now and again he had a cow for sale and was able to obtain a good price for her. No sensible dairy farmer is going to rid himself of his six or seven-year-old cow unless he can replace her from his own herd.  Senator O'Callaghan, Senator O'Dwyer, Senator MacCabe and myself are dairy farmers.  We know what the good dairy farmer does.  I am talking now of the man who produces a cow that will bring £40 or £50 to-day.  People should realise that these cows do not spring up like a mushroom overnight.  The cows that to-day are bringing £45 and £50 in our fairs are from three to eight years old.  We started to produce them before the war and, for a good while before that, we had to have their mothers and fathers.  The truth is that it is the limited number of people with good dairy stock, men who have been producing this stock year in and year out, during periods when the price of milk was bad, who are the exporters of our dairy stock to-day and will be the producers of our dairy stock to-morrow.</P>
    <P>Speaking from my own experience of them, I can say that those people only sell their good cows when they can put their progeny into the stalls.  Their system is to try to keep the number of cows up to a certain level and their total milk production to a certain figure.  But the time comes when the dairy farmer has to decide when either the mother or the daughter must go. As a dairy farmer myself, I think it is sounder economics to put the daughter rather than the mother into the stall. <Col N="731" /> When you have kept a cow up to the age of seven years you have taken the best out of her.  From the point of view of appearance she is in full bloom, so that on the market she will probably attract the highest figure that she can ever bring to her owner.  In that situation, what are you going to do with her?  A certain number of such cows may be retained, but a considerable number of them must be exported if you are to keep the dairy farmer in milk production in the future.  That is the situation we are up against on this question of the giving of licences for the export of cattle.  There is also the question whether or not you should, as Senator Johnston has suggested, employ another method.  The present method is not operating fairly as far as the dairy farmer is concerned.  If we want milk for our people here, surely the dairy farmer expects that you will not artificially create a situation whereby he is definitely going to be the loser through the policy of reducing the price of his animal so that the community here may get milk at a price that is actually lower than the real price.  In the long run, I do not think you will achieve your end by the policy which is being pursued.</P>
    <P>This problem of the maintenance of our dairy stock has, for a very long time, been a matter of concern for everybody interested in the maintenance of our herds.  One way to ensure that our herds are going to be maintained is not by restricting the activities of the dairy farmer in getting the best price that is to be obtained in the market for his cows. With regard to licences for the export of cows, I do not know the facts down here to which Senator Counihan has referred.  Dealers in another part of the country have, however, told me that they had bought cows on fairs although they had not got licences to get them out.  They went and bought licences at prices varying from 30/- to £5.  In that situation there is, obviously, a limit put on the price which the dairy farmer can get for his beast.  It may be thought that, in the interests of the people who consume milk and milk products, that is the right thing to do, but, in my opinion, it is not fair to the <Col N="732" /> dairy farmer.  I think that if you are not prepared to give him such a price for his milk as will enable him not only to maintain his herd but even to extend it and to raise its productive capacity up to the desired level: if in the community interest you are not prepared to give him a price for his milk that is comparable with the price paid outside, it is very unfair indeed. It is unfair to restrict him in the sale of his animal and compel him to take a price from a dealer which is from £15 to £20 less than that paid for her when she is finally disposed of outside the country.  We see in the market reports that cows are being sold in Britain at prices up to £70.  That is a very good price for a cow.  In fact, the one that would fetch it should be a very good cow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was told of a cow that was bought at the Dublin market for £75.  She was sent to Belfast, and when she reached there she died.  At the last fair in Cavan I saw good springing cows that could not be sold because the dealers had not got licences.  In the case of my own herd, I have reached the stage that I have got more female stock than I can accommodate or than my farm can carry, so that I have got to sell either my young heifers that I want to put into the herd or the cows.  When the time comes to sell the cows, which have given very good service, I should be able to get the best price possible. The restriction on price by a system of licensing is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of the consumption of more milk, and think we are not consuming half enough.  The dairy farmer has been carrying the burden all along and it is not fair that he should have to supply milk to the producer at a price under the market price.  We are selling cattle in a market where the same currency circulates and the same price levels are supposed to exist.  Just across the Border, however, the dairy <Col N="733" /> farmer is able to get 2/6 a gallon at a creamery in Northern Ireland.  Only a fortnight ago I saw hundreds of gallons of milk being prepared for sending away from that district.  The farmer in Cavan who gets only 9d. or 10d. a gallon cannot compete with the farmer in Fermanagh who is getting 2/6.  We have to meet that situation in some way.  The proposition that Senator Johnston makes is not a satisfactory one, though neither is the system of licensing.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that licences in the northern area are distributed with the consent and approval of our Department here which, in the first instance, determines the number of licences to be distributed.  In fact, however, those licences are going to people outside our jurisdiction&mdash;to dealers in the Six Counties, operating in our markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not objecting at all, but they are operating there to the disadvantage of the dealers within our jurisdiction.  I know that some of the men&mdash;probably some of those with whom Senator Counihan is acquainted &mdash;are not able to procure the number of licences which would compare with the amount of stock they were accustomed to handle in the past.  Those who have the great majority of licences are dealers in the Six Counties.  I do not understand why it is not possible to have the licences distributed to our own citizens here, if there is a preference given at all.  It would seem to be the more sensible way to do it.  There may be some explanation and, perhaps, the facts have not been given fully to me.  I have been informed by some traders that they have to purchase cows which have not licences and that, in order to export them, they must buy licences from dealers outside our jurisdiction. That is not satisfactory, and is evidence in support of the contention by Senator Johnston that those licences are of value.  I cannot see how that fits in with the statement which Senator Counihan made to the effect that, recently, some of those licences have been returned, and that the British are not taking the cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> Those are my views on this question generally, rather than on the motion before the House.  I would beg members of the Seanad to approach the whole problem of our milk production and consumption in the future from the angle that you cannot expect dairy farmers to grow stock and supply the milk at a price not properly related to the cost of production, and later, when the animal&mdash;which has served him well and served you well, too&mdash;has given of her best and has to be parted with, let the State impose certain restrictions on the price.  The problem of increasing the live stock and of getting our heifers into herds all over the country must be solved in some other way than by penalising the man who bred the heifer when he has her mother for sale.</P>
    <P>I am not going to make any proposition here and now as to how we may deal with these problems.  Many of our very good heifers are being exported to make the foundations of herds in England.  We need many of them in this country, but we are not doing much about it.  It is not very attractive to farmers to keep up their stock of dairy herds, from the experience they and their neighbours have had in the past.  That aspect of our agricultural policy requires urgent consideration and, perhaps, some revolutionary method of solution, if we are to increase the number of dairy cows.  I do not think the policy that is being pursued up to the present is the best one.  I do not know to what extent this system of licensing has restricted the export of cows, nor how many more cows would have been exported if it had not been adopted. It operates unfairly against the farmer producer and, therefore, I am not satisfied with it.  Of course, I realise that the community has a claim and that its interests must be taken into account, but I do not think it is right that the State, which comes between the farmer producer and the consuming public, should act against the farmer and penalise him to an extent that discourages the production of dairy stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to endorse the remarks of the last speaker.  I have <Col N="735" /> had experience of dairying for well over 30 years and am sorry to say that I have never seen milk or butter so scarce as at present in rural Ireland. It may be said that that is due to the sale of milch cows and the export of cattle, but I fear that that is not the main cause of the decrease in the milk supply and therefore, of the decrease in the butter supply.</P>
      <P>Early last year, a motion was debated in this House, asking the Minister to increase the price of butter in the creameries.  Unfortunately, the motion was not passed and the Minister did not agree to increase the price of milk.  Some time later, practically at the close of the season, the Minister agreed that our appeal was worthy of consideration and made a small increase in the price of milk to the suppliers to creameries.  It was rather too late, as many farmers who had good cows for sale did not consider they would be wise in keeping the stock over, as the return they would get for the milk in the winter months would not compensate them.  Therefore, they were willing to sell good herds, as Senator Baxter has stated, or sell the cows when they reached seven or eight years of age.</P>
      <P>The whole trouble with the dairying business here is, as everyone will admit, that the farmer is not getting a price which would encourage him to carry on.  For a number of years, he did try his best, even though the price was small, but now it has reached the stage when he cannot possibly do so. Unfortunately, the Government appear to have taken very little interest in the dairying industry.  I think, in order to encourage the farmers to produce more milk, they should get a price that will compensate them for their trouble, give them some little profit in return for all the labour involved.  That is not too much to ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as Senator Johnston's remarks about the ban on the export of cattle are concerned, I would not agree with what he said.  I would rather agree with what Senator Baxter said, that you have to get rid of your cattle at a certain age and, if you prevent <Col N="736" /> a farmer from doing that, you will be doing him a very great injury. I feel that this will give the Minister an opportunity to go into the matter fully.  I hope that he will consider the desirability of giving an increase in the coming season to the milk suppliers to the creameries, because in that way there will be a definite encouragement to them to carry on their herds next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House covers only the fringe of the subject.  The number of dairy cows being exported at the present time is very small.  The big question is the production of milk to meet our home requirements.  Undoubtedly we are facing a period when there will be a scarcity of milk, not only in the large cities like Dublin, but throughout the country generally.  There is a scarcity at the moment.  From the national point of view, that is a serious position.  Senator Baxter mentioned that possibly some revolutionary changes would be required.  Revolutionary changes to some degree have already been suggested, and there have been well-thought-out schemes submitted with the object of improving conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that, nationally, we must tackle is the exclusion of the uneconomic cow.  Everybody who speaks of dairy farming claims that certain cows are uneconomic, not worth their keep.  If they are not worth their keep we should get rid of them as quickly as possible.  That is step No. 1, and step No. 2 is the desirability of producing a high-grade milk.  I suggest to the Minister that, from the point of view of post-war planning, we should forward by every means in our power, with, of course, the Minister's assistance, the production of the highest grade milk.  The production of milk of the highest quality means the maintenance of an increasingly large number of disease-free cows.  I have mentioned here before that at some time it may be necessary for us to guarantee our cattle that are exported as disease-free.  We may be compelled to do that at some time or other and, if we do not make arrangements in advance, we will find ourselves in a <Col N="737" /> very awkward position when the time arrives to give the guarantee in regard to disease-free animals.  There should be a national endeavour, by increasing cow-testing associations, to eliminate the uneconomic cow.</P>
    <P>Having eliminated the uneconomic cow, or coincident with its elimination, we should endeavour to establish the disease-free herds from which the highest-grade milk can be procured, milk that will be pre-eminently safe for human consumption without any need for pasteurisation or for expenditure to ensure purification.  If we proceed on those lines, I think we will have a situation where we will not be endeavouring to export our young heifers and our best quality cattle, our best milkers.  We will then be in a position to get them into our own herds, milk production will be graded, and our herds will be established as disease-free. I refer to cattle being disease-free because some people do not like to use the word &ldquo;tuberculosis&rdquo; Tuberculosis is the big danger to the human being from bovine infection.  I do not want to go into detail on the present occasion with regard to the danger to human beings through the consumption of tubercular milk.  Having established disease-free herds, herds free from tuberculosis, we obviate the necessity of pasteurisation and we can put a healthier milk on the market for human consumption.</P>
    <P>We should make every endeavour, with the full co-operation of the Minister, to increase milk production throughout the country by reducing the numbers of uneconomic cattle and by subsidising the production of highest grade milk.  The motion before the House covers only a fringe of the problem. Whether there are cattle being exported, and whether the profit is exorbitant for this or that dealer, does not concern the average man in the country a whole lot.  If all the cattle could be put into our own herds, possibly we would eliminate the profits that Senator Johnston speaks of, profits gained through cattle being exported under licence.  My opinion of the motion is that it simply covers a very small fringe of a very important subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that Senator Johnston has done a great service by bringing this motion forward. A great many people interested in cattle rearing have been wondering when the export of springing cows and heifers is going to be stopped.  There has been a considerable amount of comment on this subject at fairs and markets throughout the country during the past six months.  Naturally, this sort of thing has a bad effect on the production of these animals.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to make a very clear statement on this matter.  We should like to know from him if any steps are being contemplated to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>Dairy farming at the moment is not very attractive.  The prices which the dairy farmer gets do not tend to make him very happy.  I speak with some experience of different aspects of farming. I take a deep interest in dairying; I have always done a good deal of dairy farming, but at the present time I feel that I will get easier money by following other aspects of farming. At the same time, I like to keep my hand in the business, because I feel that in the post-war period dairy farming may be one of the things that the farmer will have to fall back upon.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan pleaded for encouraging a higher milk production and an improvement in the grade.  I entirely agree with him on that matter. We have made great strides in this country in grading-up the beef producing qualities of our animals.  We made wonderful strides in that direction, and that is recognised by everybody, but the same cannot be said with regard to the dairying qualities of our cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should seriously contemplate the introduction of good dairy cattle from across the Channel.  For the past 25 or 30 years we have been importing Scotch-bred bulls.  These are mainly animals of a good beef-producing type and they have done a lot in improving the beef qualities of our animals, unfortunately to the detriment of the dairying side.  Across the Channel, there are any number of dairy herds because in England they go in specially <Col N="739" /> for dairy farming.  In Scotland, they go in for raising cattle for beef purposes. If some of these dairy bulls were imported from England, I am sure they would do good work here. I know the argument will be put forward that it will be hard to place these bulls with farmers, that they prefer to go in for breeding stores, but, on the other hand, I think there would be a reasonable demand for them and that they would do untold good in improving the dairy qualities of our animals.  The cow-testing movement also tends in that direction, and I think it has to a large extent saved the dairy qualities of animals in the south of Ireland at least.  The people who are cow-testing in the south are the people who produce the big bulk of the bulls used by the other farmers who are not cow testing, and in that way the non-cow testing farmer is benefiting by the work done by the cow-testing farmer.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan made reference to 200 or 300 licences being returned to the Department.  I do not know what the position is in that regard, but I cannot understand that state of affairs. I should like a little more information on it, and perhaps the Minister would give us some explanation.  I am wondering if the distribution of the licences is carried out in a proper way or not and whether the right people are getting them, because I feel that, if the right people got them, they would use them.  The cattle are in the country.  The in-calf heifers and in-calf cows are in the country and available for export, and I am bewildered to hear that such a condition should exist.  I understand that the cattle trade executive has something to do with the distribution of the licences.  I do not want at all to reflect in any way on the credit of the cattle trade, but there seems to be something wrong there, and I should like to have a further explanation of it, which the Minister may be able to give.</P>
    <P>I suppose Senator Johnston will not proceed with his motion.  I am sure that after what he has heard from the various speakers, he will be satisfied that his motion is not a commonsense <Col N="740" /> motion.  That is not intended as an insult to the Senator.</P>

      <P>The urban view is: &ldquo;Stop the export of cows&rdquo;; the rural view is: &ldquo;Pay for butter and milk and you will get plenty of them.&rdquo;  The ordinary dairy farmer who produces milk and sends it to the creamery is the man who produces the springing cow and springing heifer.  I have already stated that, in my experience, dairy farming is not at all attractive at the moment, and if we were to penalise the dairy farmer further by stopping the export of springing cows and heifers, we would be penalising the dairy industry in a most unwarranted way.  Milk production and milk consumption ought to be encouraged in every possible way, and I think that much could be done by the Department by introducing animals of milking strain.</P>

      <P>Having heard Senator O'Donovan's speech, I feel that his approach to the subject is far too academic and far too unreal.  He assumes that if you increase cow-testing associations, you will get a response in the elimination of unproductive cows.  That is not my experience. I know a number of cow-testing associations and the improvement&mdash; I do not say there is none&mdash;comes very slowly indeed.  Year after year, there is a certain number of people in these associations who, in spite of the records, do not respond.  There is considerable expense involved, as well as other financial considerations, which make it difficult for people to respond to the theory, and that is what I feel about many of these recommendations &mdash;they are remote from the personal circumstances of the man himself.  He has not got the means, or very often the education, to respond and to take advantage of all these theories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I favour far more the slower approach of education which is the only really durable method to the method, which was rather suggested by Senator O'Donovan, of perhaps <Col N="741" /> mild coercion or subsidies.  I do not see where we shall ever get if our basic industry is to rely on subsidies. Where are they to come from?  Agriculture is the main source of wealth in this land, and if we are to subsidise agriculture from our main financial pool, we are merely feeding the dog on a bit of its own tail.</P>
    <P>We must rely far more on two things to revive our basic industry.  One is vastly improved technique.  I think that nobody will deny that in other countries the whole method of agricultural production, largely based on the standard of education of the people themselves, is far in advance of ours. That development must be and, I hope, will be, pushed forward in every possible way.  I understand that a body of people is at present examining the industry and that is the line upon which their deliberations are proceeding. But, there again, there is no good in getting too far from the ground.  You must work with the material available and until our people have the education, plus the financial resources, to put it into effect, you will not get very much further.  I know people who are working land beside each other.  One man works hard and is intelligent and he gets totally different results from the man next door.  That is a matter of the personal element, which is most important.</P>
    <P>I am also not at all impressed by the theory that merely because you give money you are going to get results.  I have heard people say that a farmer cannot afford to buy an incubator, that if you give him the finance to enable him to get an incubator, he will get into production and produce this and that. Until he has the education and the intelligence to use all these modern methods, it is simply a waste of money to put financial resources at his disposal. If he is a hard-working man, technically educated, he very often will not want the money at all, because he can find it with his own resources.</P>
    <P>With regard to milk production, I am never satisfied about the practical virtues&mdash;I know the theoretical virtues&mdash;of this high-grade milk.  I agree that we are all living on a counsel of <Col N="742" /> perfection and that if we all had unlimited incomes, we should all like to have high-grade milk; but the world is not on a basis of perfection.  It is on a basis of reality, and I should very much like to see tests carried out to ascertain what percentage of danger there is in the ordinary grade milk, which everybody can afford to drink, as compared with the high-grade milk, and whether people who are drinking ordinary milk are contracting disease to any greater extent than those who, owing to their financial position, are able to afford this high-grade milk.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of fundamental research to be done.  We are assuming too much when we argue that if everybody had high-grade milk there would be no tuberculosis, or that tuberculosis would be reduced to infinitesimal dimensions.  I think that has not been proved.  There are, of course, degrees of tuberculosis in cattle which are distinctly dangerous and should be dealt with, but there are minor degrees of tuberculosis in cattle which will respond to the test whose milk is not in the least dangerous to human beings. I think scientific tests should be carried out in our research stations to determine to what extent, in the case of a minor degree of tuberculosis in animals which react to the test, is their milk dangerous to human beings as compared with those animals which do not react.  That, in my opinion, is the realistic approach to the problem&mdash; not subsidies and not counsels of perfection which suggest that everybody should live on this grade A milk, because only a certain number can afford to buy it and only a certain number can afford to produce it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another side to the question.  The views expressed by those who have spoken are those of people engaged chiefly in dairying and food production.  Let me not be taken as being opposed to farmers getting a good price for milk.  I was reared on a farm and in my young days I attended to and milked cows.  The position in Dublin is that the citizens have to pay a good price for milk and butter.  I do not know if Senator O'Callaghan or Senator MacCabe are aware that <Col N="743" /> poor people are paying 2/4 per gallon for milk, and even at that price cannot get enough of it.  If they want to make sure that they will have milk for their tea they have to go to the retailers early in the day, because there is not sufficient milk available in the city. Senators who have spoken would be nearer the mark if they concentrated in an endeavour to bring about an arrangement, whereby the price of milk to the producer and the price that would be charged to the poor would satisfy both parties.  I tell Senator Baxter that poor people in the city are paying 2/4 per gallon for milk and 2/- per lb. for butter.  The Senator stated that in and around Cavan the price paid producers for milk was from 9d. to 10d. per gallon.  Is not the difference between 9d. and 10d. paid producers and what is charged to consumers in Dublin too big?  Surely there should be some way of bridging that marked difference in prices.  My interest is to endeavour to see that the poor will not be mulcted.  If a levy or a subsidy is paid on the export of milch cows the money must be found somewhere, and the poor in this city, who are taxpayers, will have to pay their portion of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I do not believe that the necessity has yet arisen for the stoppage of the export of dairy cattle.  But I think that Senator Johnston's suggestion was <Col N="744" /> a very good one, that in case there is a necessity to discourage the export of dairy cattle it would be much better to place a levy on their export rather than actually to stop the export; because we should remember that if we stop the export and lessen the demand, it will have the effect of curtailing prices.  It is a suggestion, therefore, which should be borne in mind, because if the export is greater than the supply, then it would be necessary to impose a levy, as Senator Johnston suggested.  I do not think, however, that the time has yet arisen for that and, therefore, no action is called for at present.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane raised a very interesting question when he said that he would like to have it found out what was the degree of danger from drinking ordinary milk as compared with T.T. milk.  So far as we in country districts can see there is absolutely no danger from drinking ordinary milk, because people in the country, farmers, labourers and everybody else, practically all the time drink milk which is not pasteurised, and we never see cases of tuberculosis occurring which can be traced to infection from milk.  These people drink ordinary milk produced in ordinary circumstances from dairy cows and it never causes any infection by giving the germs of tuberculosis to the childern. That is an argument for allowing the milk from outside counties to come into the city, where there is a great shortage.  There is undoubtedly far more danger to the childern from a shortage of milk than there would be from drinking milk from those districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wonder whether it would not be possible to do more in the line of milk powder.  During the summer months there is an abundance of milk &mdash;in normal times we exported it in the shape of butter&mdash;and I often wonder if it would not be possible to have it made into powder, so as to relieve the shortage in our cities in the winter months.  I think the possibilities of that should be investigated. In the post-war period, when materials will be available, I think that separated milk coming from the creameries should be pasteurised and <Col N="745" /> also that milk coming to the city should be pasteurised: I think that in the post-war conditions it would be necessary to have the separated milk pasteurised.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Dwyer, and I think Senator Sir John Keane, rather contended that impure milk, or what we might call unpasteurised milk, has nothing whatever to do with the enormous increase in tuberculosis in humans.  I am not prepared to take the statement of Senator Sir John Keane or Senator O'Dwyer on that matter.  I am more inclined to the view of the people who are qualified to deal with that matter.  One of the most important matters confronting the country to-day is the increase of tuberculosis, not only in the cities, but in the country districts as well.  Many of those who are well qualified in science contend that it is due to the impure milk supply.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane also contended that high-grade milk <Col N="746" /> should be retained entirely for the people who can afford it and rather contended that the low-grade milk was good enough for the masses of the community, as it would be too expensive to have it pasteurised.  That shows a rather extraordinary mentality when speaking on a subject of such great importance as the milk supply of the people.  We have high-grade water supplied to all of us.  Senator Sir John Keane would not contend that people living in suburbia should have a more superior supply of water than the people in the city.  I contend that it is just as important to have a pure supply of milk as it is to have a pure supply of water.  I merely intervened to call attention to that aspect of the question.  Unfortunately I was not here when Senator Johnston introduced his motion, but I do know that there is a very serious shortage of milk in this city at present, and if Senator Johnston's motion would have the effect of making the supply worse still, I certainly am not going to support it.  In view of the shortage of milk, I think the position ought to be reviewed by the Minister in order to ensure that our citizens will have a supply of milk before we think of exporting dairy cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to keep to the motion as well as I can, but I think the discussion has rather gone away from it a good deal.  I think there is no point in Senator Johnston's motion with regard to putting a levy on the export of milch cows or heifers.  If you put a levy on their export, the Exchequer would get more money certainly; but that would be no good to the ordinary people of the country. It would make cattle cheaper and it would tend further to disorganise or interfere with the ordinary way of living of the farming community.  Probably the real effect it would have would be that it would tend to have cows and heifers exported, and even the Exchequer would not benefit any more than would the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I suppose I shall have to go away a little bit from the motion, as everybody else has done so.  I think it <Col N="747" /> was Senator Sir John Keane who said something to the effect that, instead of a levy on the export of cows or heifers, and that sort of thing, the technique should be improved, and I agree with that.  However, the Senator seemed to think that that could not be done until the people were more educated. Now, I think that our people are intelligent enough to improve their technique, provided they get a lead, and the only way to improve our technique, in my opinion, is by improving the testing of cows in this country, and in order to do that we have got to have a greater number of our cows on test than we have at the present moment. I spoke about this matter in Cork some time ago, and I suggested that if we had about 200,000 instead of 50,000 on test, we could do something. Of course, people seem always to want a spectacular increase.  Senator Sir John Keane mentioned, for instance, that the yield of our cows has not increased over a number of years, but I believe that the reason for that is that we have not the number of animals to get it from.  If we had, I believe that we would get it.  In County Cork, for instance&mdash;I do not like this business of going into figures&mdash;where they have over 200,000 cows, only about 10 per cent. of these cows are on test, and in County Limerick also, only about 10 per cent. of the cows are on test. These are the two great dairying counties in this country, and then the figures go down the scale.  For instance, in Tipperary, the percentage is only about 5 per cent., and then the percentage goes down from that to nought.  That represents the number of cows on test, and, after all, if that is the case, how can you expect to have any big increase in the milk yield per cow in this country?  Also, of course, if you have not that, how are you going to select bulls?  We have about 500 to 700 bulls placed every year.  They are placed, probably, from the best herds in the country, but even with that you can do nothing to improve the milk yield.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator O'Callaghan who suggested to the Minister the importing of dairy bulls from England.  I <Col N="748" /> am astonished at Senator O'Callaghan making such a suggestion.  I think that what is happening in this country may have something to do with Senator Johnston's motion, the effect of which is to prevent the export of heifers, and so on.  The English, at the present time, are buying up our heifers in order to establish dairy herds and to increase milk production in Britain, and here you have Senator O'Callaghan asking us to buy back dairy bulls from England in order to establish our herds.  I suggest that what we should do is to build up our own herds, and I think we have as good stuff to build them up here as the English have, if we had the way of doing it and the will to do it&mdash;both the will and the way to do it.  That, I think, is what we really want.  We want what you might call the energy to do it and, as I suggested before, if we had on test a sufficient number of the cows that are supplying creameries in the creamery counties, and if we were to give a good bonus&mdash;I am not in favour of subsidies, and I would make the bonus good for every gallon of milk over 700 gallons that is supplied to the creameries&mdash;I think that that would be a very good inducement and there would be no necessity for any levy.  It would be an inducement to the people to keep up to the best standdards because it would pay them to do so.  It would be a bonus on production, and a bonus on production is something that is realisable: something that will be good, whereas, in my opinion, subsidies are wrong.  I think that subsidies are always wrong.  Possibly, they are something to enable people to tide over a short period, but if you had a bonus on production it would induce the people who are supplying the creameries to produce more milk and to keep to the best standards.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter now into this question of tuberculosis in cows.  I think that our cows in this country are more free from tuberculosis than the cows in any other country, and I think it is a very bad thing to exaggerate anything, even for the purpose of making a point.  That has been done, unfortunately, and I think <Col N="749" /> it is very wrong.  Nobody wants anybody to drink tubercular milk, and if there really was the amount of tubercular milk drunk in this country, that some people talk about, we would all be dead.  In the country, we drink what is called raw milk&mdash;milk direct from the cow.</P>

Of course, there should be no unhealthy or tubercular milk drunk, but the way to deal with that is through the usual channel of the sanitary or public health authorities, whose business it is to see that unhealthy milk is not sold. Samples of milk are taken periodically in the cities by these authorities, and I do not believe that in the City of Dublin to-day there is any tubercular milk being sold, and if there is, after <Col N="750" /> all, it is a reflection on the sanitary or public health authorities, and not on the farmers or producers, because these sanitary authorities can always take samples and say whether the milk is healthy or not.  As I say, these exaggerations have a very bad effect, and it is the people in the cities to whom they do harm, and not the producers, because the people in the cities, who should drink milk, are afraid to drink it as a result of such exaggerated statements.  I do not think I have anything else to say.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to what Senator Sir John Keane said on this particular subject, and I agree with practically everything he said.  I myself have taken the greatest interest in this particular subject for a long time.  Let us take, first of all, the question of grade A milk.  Wherever grade A milk is produced, it is produced because the price covers the cost of production.  Grade A milk is confined, practically always, to the big cities, and it is foolish for Senator O'Donovan to suggest that it should be a universal thing.  It never will be in the country districts.  On the question of having tubercular disease-free cattle all over the country, of course that cannot be done either.  If you wanted to get rid of all cows which reacted to a tubercular test, and cows which had mastitis or contagious abortion, you would have to do away with more than a quarter of the cattle in the country, notwithstanding the fact that our health bill in this country as regards our cattle is a great deal better than it is in any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to cow testing, I have talked to a great many farmers about it, and I find that the great difficulty is the cost of getting a cow-testing association going, and keeping it going.  The cost is very considerable, and under present conditions&mdash;under most conditions, really&mdash;the produce of their farms is so low that the farmers cannot afford those additional costs. Then, what happens when they do have a cow-testing association?  They find that certain cows, from the point of view of milk production only, are uneconomic, but those cows still produce <Col N="751" /> manure and are valuable for the breeding of heifers.  At the present moment, I myself have three or four entirely uneconomic cows from the milk production point of view, but I am keeping them in the hope that they will produce first-grade heifers.  Suppose some farmer wants to get rid of all the cows which do not produce enough milk, he will find when he goes to the fairs that it is extremely hard to replace them with good heifers.  I should like to mention an experiment which we carried out in Kerry for some time.  All the breeders subscribed, and on 29th June each year we used to have local shows all over the county.  I think we conducted five of these shows.  The farmers brought in cows and heifers, and we gave about half a dozen prizes each year, at a cost of something like £75, in the hope that those people would keep those cows for breeding.  At the end of five years we found that perhaps one of those people had kept one of those heifers, but hardly ever were the animals, which we had marked 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the first year, found to be in the same hands on the 29th June in the following year.  In this regard, the desired state of affairs will only come about by degrees, and through very special education, and not in a theoretical way which Senator O'Donovan suggested to the House.</P>

      <P>I was asked to give some information with regard to the question of licences being returned.  I do not know what the number is, but I know it is true that for some weeks past the number of licences issued to exporters for the export of milch cows has not been used; some of those licences have been returned.  I suppose it will be obvious to everybody what the explanation of that is&mdash;the exporter could not buy cows here economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the people at home who want cows are paying more than the English importer is paying at the moment.  I think that no fault can be found with the distribution of those licences.  They are distributed in two ways.  Those issued by Great Britain come across here in bulk, and are <Col N="752" /> handed over by my Department to the cattle trade.  The cattle trade distributes them amongst the exporters, strictly on the basis of the exports by each person in the year, I think, 1940 &mdash;anyway the year before the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  I think that is a very fair basis.  On some occasions when complaints were made to me that such-and-such an exporter was not getting his fair share of licences, I sent an official down to the cattle trade offices to find out whether everything was being done fairly.  I must say we always found that there was a fair distribution.</P>
    <P>There is a different system as regards the North of Ireland.  In the case of the North of Ireland, they issue a certain number of licences every week, but they issue them to exporters from here into the North of Ireland, and issue them on their own basis, whatever that may be.  In connection with that point, I should like Senators to realise that it is the importing country that always has the right to issue licences in all those cases where there are restrictions.  If the importing country, as in the case of Great Britain, does not wish to exercise the power of distributing the licences themselves, they may&mdash;as they do in this case&mdash;give them to the exporting country to distribute.  Perhaps I should also mention that it does not seem to be very clear, according to the speeches made by certain Senators, that it was the British Government that first introduced this licensing system.  They introduced it when exports were resumed at the end of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, over a year ago now.  They issued licences for a certain number of milch cows and in-calf heifers every month.  Some few months ago&mdash;it would probably be six months ago&mdash;we on this side proposed to the British Government that they should reduce the number, which they did, and we have been reducing the number since.  Now, the number of licences issued, between Great Britain and the North of Ireland, is less than 1,000 a week, and all those licences are not being used.  If we were to keep the numbers of licences as they are at present, even if they were all used, we would be exporting very much less <Col N="753" /> dairy cattle than we did in normal times.  It is not easy to make a comparison, because, in the normal times that we refer to, milch cows and springer cows were put into one category. All in-calf heifers were, in most cases, classed with store cattle.  In-calf heifers, of course, are subject to this licensing system.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter talked of the scarcity of butter and milk.  That is a very big question, but I do not think it would be fair to go into it in great detail on this particular occasion.  I would like, however, that Senators should know that there is no abnormal scarcity of butter and milk.  We feel it more, it is true, than we did before the war because we are using almost twice as much butter as we did before the war.  We exported butter before the war, but our production of butter was very little higher than it is now&mdash; it certainly was not 10 per cent. higher than it is now&mdash;but at that time we were able to export comparatively a fair quantity of our production.  Now we are able to export none and we have not enough for ourselves.  The principal reason is that we have no margarine; we have not got very much lard, and other fats are also scarce. People have to fall back on butter as practically the only fat available.</P>
    <P>There is also, as was mentioned here, a scarcity of milk in Dublin at the moment.  That has occurred three winters in succession at this time of the year.  It occurs, roughly, from the middle of January to the middle of February that we have not got enough milk to supply the population of Dublin.  Again, it is not that we have less milk than before the war; it is because we are consuming a lot more milk.  The consumption of milk has gone up considerably in the last three or four years.  It is not so much that we have not increased the production of milk in the country, but that we have not been able to make the necessary arrangements for the transport of milk at this particular time.  We do, certainly, call on a number of creameries at this time of the year to send milk to Dublin that only supply at this time of the year, but even so it is not easy to get enough.  When the <Col N="754" /> middle of February comes, things get right again.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter, however, was inclined to say that all these things are due to the uneconomic price for milk and butter.  Senator Baxter is a most unsatisfactory person with whom to argue a point because he never tells you what an economic price would be. I remember here last year when we were debating wheat, when he was asked what would be a fair price for wheat, he refused to say.  He did not tell us now what would be a fair price for butter or milk.  In fact, Senator Baxter wound up his speech by saying that, although he seconded Senator Johnston's motion, he did not agree with it and he could not make any suggestion as to what would be the proper thing to do.  It is not so easy to argue against a Senator like that. He makes no positive or constructive suggestion but he does say that things are wrong.</P>

At least, I have never heard Senator Baxter saying that the farmer got enough for anything, whether it is wheat, butter, milk, pigs or anything else.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter says a thing with which I find it difficult to agree.  He finds fault with this restriction on the export of cows and he finds fault with that from the point of view of the dairy farmer.  The dairy farmers are the people that have been agitating with me to stop it, and when the dairy farmers come to me about the price of milk in the City of Dublin or at the creamery, one of the big items always in their costings is the price of cows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Baxter made the point that while the dairy farmer was not getting enough for his milk or for his butter he should at least be allowed to get something for his milch cow&mdash;that that might make up to him somewhat for his loss on milk and butter.  I must say that my general impression of dairy farmers all over the country, that is, farmers who supply milk to creameries and to cities, is that they are very much against this high price for cows because if they pay £55, £60 and £65 for a cow and, if the cow is rejected after a year or two, they will only get £14 to £16 for the <Col N="756" /> cow.  But we have got a new angle on this now, that is, if he gets a good price for his cow, it is something that the dairy farmer should be thankful for.  Looking at it even from the point of view of the practical farmer who wants to buy a cow, I wonder would he go to a dairy farmer to buy her. Did anybody ever hear of a dairy farmer selling a good cow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would not go to a dairy farmer because I never knew of a dairy farmer who got rid of a good cow unless she had reached old age&mdash;if she has reached old age she is not much good to him or anybody else &mdash;or unless she had some other fault. In that case, she would not be a good cow, but you would not know that until you had bought her.  At any rate, I do not think I would go to a dairy farmer to buy a cow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another class of farmer in this country.  There are farmers&mdash;fairly big farmers as a rule&mdash; who have a good deal of rough grazing and who go in for the breeding of heifers.  These are the men we had to keep in mind when we were considering the question about allowing the export of cows.  We could have stopped the export of cows and given what I thought up to this would be an advantage to the dairy farmer, that is, cheaper cows than he was getting.  We did not like to do that because I felt that those people who went in for the breeding of heifers on a large scale would be discouraged and would be afraid that there would be a very poor market for their springer heifers or heifers after calving if the export market was completely stopped. Therefore, we did not stop the export of cows completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at this question from a very detached point of view, trying to forget the interests of the farmer and everybody else, would it not be natural to stop the export of cows if we had not got enough milk and butter in the <Col N="757" /> country?  For instance, if we are short of horseshoes, we are told to stop the export of scrap iron.  If we are short of other commodities, we are told to keep the raw material in the country, which is only natural.  If we are short of butter and milk the natural thing is to keep the raw material, which is the cow, in the country and not let her out but, against that, there was the other argument that if we stopped them completely we might discourage breeding and have less cows as a consequence of our action.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan spoke of the desirability of having a much higher standard of milk in this country and he spoke of a revolutionary change. However desirable that may be, I am afraid, if there is any change, it will be more evolutionary than revolutionary in a case like this.  I am very much inclined to sympathise, at any rate, with the views expressed by Senator Sir John Keane.  I think that some people, by giving a name to a thing, expect that everybody is going to fall for it&mdash;names such as &ldquo;high-grade milk&rdquo;, &ldquo;humane killer&rdquo;, etc.  Because a humane killer is so called, it is supposed to be humane.  I am afraid that you will find doctors differing even on this question of high-grade milk. Some will tell you that if you treat growing people too well and absolutely exclude every possibility of disease, these people will not be able to face life at all when they grow up.  There may be something in that.  On the other hand, you will hear other people say that if you pasteurise milk you will destroy the vitamins in it.  I saw in some American magazine an account where a doctor, who did not believe in that, fed a number of rats on fresh milk, condensed milk, boiled milk, pasteurised milk, powdered milk and, I think, some other kind of milk.</P>
    <P>He fed six different sections of rats on six different varieties of milk. After three months, he weighed all the rats and found that they were all exactly of the same weight.  That goes to show that it is very hard to prove anything in this world.  I sympathise, however, with the view of Senator Sir John Keane, that it would be a good thing if we could have some scientific <Col N="758" /> proof that this high-grade milk is all that people say about it.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Senator O'Callaghan that I have no intention of stopping completely the export of cows.  I think Senator O'Callaghan had in mind the point that I have already mentioned, that if we were to stop it completely it might discourage the breeding of heifers.  A point was raised by Senator O'Callaghan, and was also referred to by Senator Dr. Doyle, with regard to the import of some good dairy bulls. I know that the Senator is right in stating that the Department has not been encouraging that particular form of import for many years back. Whether he is right in his other contention, I am not sure.  He says that we import only from Scotland and that the tendency has been to encourage conformation and, therefore, beef qualities rather than milk qualities.  I do not admit that altogether, but the point is worthy of investigation.  I am informed that it is one of the questions that is being examined by the committee set up to examine into the post-war conditions of agriculture and planning for the future.  Senator Dr. Doyle also made a suggestion with regard to the encouragement of cow-testing societies by giving a bonus to creameries receiving milk from milkers of over 700 gallons.  The details of such a scheme would, it appears to me, be extraordinarily difficult.  I am afraid it would be extremely difficult to apply it unless the whole herd was over 700 gallons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDoyle" hpid="Dr. Doyle Dr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested that also&mdash; that a bonus might be given to producers having such herds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The bonus would be passed on to the producers.  If it applied to the whole herd, it might be all right, but if applied to only part of the herd it would be very difficult to operate.  Senators will agree that there would be some farmers who would not be beyond putting down some of their cows as yielding 700 gallons when in fact that was not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDoyle" hpid="Dr. Doyle Dr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole herd would have to show that yield.</P>

    <Col N="759" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case it would be fairly easy.  On the general question, the suggestion was made that we should make production bonuses or production allowances to creameries dependent on having their members in a cow-testing society.  I am afraid that would not be advisable or successful because the cow-testing scheme is a voluntary one, and to drive a person compulsorily into it would vitiate the whole scheme. Unless a farmer takes a personal interest in it, it cannot be done successfully. As far as the motion is concerned, I would not be in favour of stopping exports because it would discourage breeders generally.  As regards the export levy suggested by Senator Johnston, I think it would be most unpopular in this House, and I do not think on the whole that it would be worth the trouble involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion in my name was drafted so as to deal with a very small aspect of a very big question, but the debate itself ranged over a much wider field&mdash;rather to my satisfaction, as I was anxious to have on record the views of Senators and the Minister in the wider field as well as in the narrower one.  The facts given by the Minister seem to alter the case, and I might have drafted the motion differently if I had known that the number of licences, which we are actually receiving here, depends on the will of our Government and that, in fact, our Government are refusing to accept as many licences as the British Government would be willing to give. That certainly has the effect of limiting, to some extent, the outflow of good cows, but the point specifically referred to in my motion is not affected by that consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So long as there is any restriction whatever on the export of cows, then the price which the producers of cows can command in the export market is less than it otherwise would be, and the situation tends to produce the result that dealers who buy cows here for export will command a greater margin of profit on some of those cows than they would if export were absolutely free.  I take it if there is elasticity in the supply of cows for sale, farmers generally will offer for sale a <Col N="760" /> greater number of cows at a high price than they will at a lower price, that in fact there is a direct relationship between the average price per head and the number of cows that would be put forward for sale at that price. That being so, in a free market with no restriction on export, dealers would buy whatever number of cows they reckoned they could sell over again in the export market at their normal margin of profit, which, for the sake of argument, we shall say is a matter of £10 per head.  But when there is restriction, whatever form that restriction may take&mdash;in this case they were restricted by the necessity of having to obtain licences before they could export cows&mdash;and if the number of licences is less than the number of cows that otherwise would be put forward for sale, dealers need only buy the number of cows that corresponds to the number of licences and they are pretty certain to get that limited number of cows at a lower price per head than they would have to pay if there had been no restriction whatever on the export of cows.  Consequently, any restriction whatever on the export of cows is bound to lower the price of cows to the farmers selling these cows, and is likely to add to the margin of gross profits on which dealers operate. My suggestion, if that situation indeed exists, is that the Government should intervene and collect for itself that margin of surplus profit by way of a tax, rather than let it go into the pockets of the dealers.</P>
    <P>That, of course, would make no difference whatever to the price which dealers would still give farmers. Farmers would suffer in the price of their cows so long as there was any restriction on the number of those cows which might be exported.  The situation in that respect is, apparently, no longer urgent in view of what the Minister has said regarding the recent return of surplus licences.  Apparently, the number of licences now issued is greater than the number of cows offered for sale in the export market. Consequently, no differential value attaches to licences.  No effect whatever is had on the price of cows because of the licensing system when the number <Col N="761" /> of licences exceeds the number of cows offered.  But if the number of licences was less than the number of cows offered, then these licences would tend to have a certain commercial value. The whole point of my motion was to suggest that that commercial value of licences should be captured, in some form or other, by the State rather than that it should be allowed to go into the pockets of private interests.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, certain points were raised about which I might, perhaps, say a word or two. The whole question of increasing the number of first-class female cattle breeding stock in this country is one which is frightfully important and, at the same time, frightfully difficult.  The body of which I have the honour to be a member is only too glad to get suggestions from every possible quarter as to how best we can grade up the standard of our milch cows in the country, generally.  This motion does not directly relate to that problem but is closely associated with it and I was glad to have on record the views of Senators regarding it.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the matter is that the State must take care to do nothing which would penalise a farmer for producing a high-grade cow or high-grade heifer or whose business it was to produce first-class cows and heifers. Undoubtedly, any mere restriction on export which went no further than that would hit the producer of the higher grade of cows and heifers harder than it would hit the producer of any other kind of cow and discourage his production. In the long run, it would leave us with fewer good cows than if we had interfered not at all in the export of those cows.  However much we may regret seeing the best cows and heifers leave the country, we must console ourselves, for the present at all events, with the reflection that, in the long run, we are, perhaps, better off in that condition than if we simply stopped that export and destroyed every effort to produce a higher type of cow by reason of reducing the standard of all cows to a lower average level.</P>
    <P>The danger of excessive export of our best cows has been greatly intensified <Col N="762" /> in recent months by reason of the policy of the British Government in subsidising, at a very high level, the price of milk to milk producers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The price this month&mdash;I forget the exact figure&mdash;varies between 2/- and 2/6 per gallon for practically any kind of decent milk.  That price is obtainable by every farmer in Northern Ireland and every farmer in Great Britain who produces milk.  The price of cows in that area has been enormously increased by reason of the subsidy given in the form of a high price for milk.  I feared that that enormous increase in the price of cows was going to tempt our people down here to sell too large a proportion of their cows, instead of keeping them to produce butter and milk at the much lower prices prevailing down here.  As I said on the last occasion, what self-respecting cow would stay here to produce milk at 9d. a gallon when, in Northern Ireland, she could be doing so at 2/6 a gallon?  There is one way in which we could neutralise the tendency of that relatively high price of milk to entice away too many of our cows.</P>
    <P>That would be by following the example of our neighbours in subsidising the price of milk and butter, though not necessarily to the same high level. Whatever may be said about the principle of subsidising, in general&mdash;and I agree with much of the academic talk about the objectionable nature of subsidies, in general&mdash;we are not dealing with this problem in the abstract.  We are dealing with it in a very real world of which we are only a small part.  In deciding what to do or what not to do, we have to take into consideration the things happening all around us in the world.</P>
    <P>One of the most important of these things is the high price paid for milk in Northern Ireland, which may be a temptation to us to sell too many of our best cows.  There may be a situation in which people may run short of milk and butter, because the price of milk is inadequate, and in which a higher price for milk or butter would press unduly on the poorer classes in the cities, raise the cost of living and give rise to clamorous demands for increases in wage levels, bringing all <Col N="763" /> sorts of complications.  When you have that situation, it is dealt with in other countries by the principle of subsidy. The producer is paid at the expense of the State enough to induce him to produce the article in question which is considered necessary, and the consumer pays no more than before.  The difference is made up by a draft on the national exchequer.  That kind of thing is happening all around us.  It is happening in Britain.  It is happening, if I remember rightly, in Sweden &mdash;a neutral country&mdash;and it is happening even in the U.S.A. and Canada. May I read from the October, 1942, number of the <i>Illinois Farm Economics,</i> which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subsidies on milk are now granted in one large milkshed in order to reimburse the farmer for added labour and other costs of production. The practice, probably, will be adopted on a wide scale in the case of milk in order to maintain a high level of milk production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in the U.S.A.  In Canada, which is a smaller country, a similar policy has been forced on the people. This publication says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To help to curb inflation and to be fair to all groups, the Canadian Government fixed retail price-ceilings on all types of commodities.  In some cases, it has been necessary to give subsidies in order to get produced the volume of a particular commodity needed.  For example, it was found that the ceiling-prices on dairy products were too low to get the volume of milk production necessary for domestic consumption and for lend-lease shipments.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Hence, in July 1942, the Government announced that a subsidy of 6 cents a lb. would be paid on all butter fat manufactured in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to point out that the economists considered that it would cost less to the State in the long run to pay the subsidy than allow an increase in the cost of living, with the consequent increase in wages all round that would result from that additional amount being paid by consumers <Col N="764" /> direct.  So that in war time, or in a time of emergency, the question of a subsidy, or otherwise, is one which should be considered on its merits.  In the consideration of it we should take into account the fact that the action of people all round us makes it extremely difficult for us to avoid doing the same thing ourselves, however objectionable we might regard it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much indeed the contributions made by many Senators to the debate.  I should like to pay tribute to my friend Senator Baxter for his speech which, on the whole, I think was a useful contribution.  If I may say so, I think the Minister was rather less kind than he usually is in his treatment of Senator Baxter, but that is a matter of opinion.</P>

    <P>I wonder whether the Minister for Agriculture, in facing this motion, will repeat what he said before he sat down&mdash;that I was a most unsatisfactory sort of person to argue with. On a previous motion, he said that he found it difficult to pin me to anything, and that I did not indicate what exactly I wanted.  I presume he may take up the same line of argument on this motion.  I will forestall him by pointing out that he knew two years ago what I thought about dairying.  I told him that here as well as in the board room of the Department of Agriculture.  If I have committed any fault at all in my approach to agricultural problems, I am afraid it is that <Col N="765" /> I talked too early about what I thought ought to be done.  In this House, right from the beginning, I faced the difficulties which I believed the nation would have to contend with in the period of the emergency.  Any suggestion that I made was, as far as I knew, a concrete suggestion which, if my methods had been applied, would have borne fruit.  The Minister said this evening that we eat butter because we are short of fats&mdash;margarine, lard, and so on.  I do not know if the Minister will remember that I gave all those figures here last spring to indicate that we were going to have a deficiency in fats, and pointing out that that was a reason why we should increase the price of milk so that we might have much more butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not addressing myself to this question in any narrow way.  The problem which our people have to face in this warring and contentious world is not at all a simple one.  What has impelled me to take this line is the fact that I have noticed that the Minister and his colleagues have started on a campaign through the country pressing for a better effort on the part of our farmers to give the nation more food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and his colleagues are doing that with the very best intentions, and I hope that their efforts will meet with success.  The problem of food supplies for this season and, indeed, for probably the next few years is going to be the nation's major problem.  I have no doubt about that.  Therefore, the contribution that any of us in this House or outside can make towards a simplification of it may be regarded as real patriotic work.  I have no doubt at all about the supreme effort that our farmers have made to produce food during the last few years.  What they have done has been really marvellous, that is measuring the conditions through which we are living as against those of our neighbours.  We are at peace and our neighbours are at war. If we measure their compensation in <Col N="766" /> terms of cash as against the compensation that our farmers have received, and measure their total incomes as against our farmers' total incomes, I really believe that half enough cannot be said in praise of our farmers and of their men for what they have achieved during the last few years.</P>
    <P>One cannot think about the farmer and his men, and of the possibilities of our food stocks for the future, without thinking of the land and its potentialities. When I put a question on this to the Minister on a previous occasion I have a recollection of his saying either here or at a meeting somewhere that he had no fears for our soil fertility in so far as that is essential for full production.  That is something which I am not able to follow.  I do not agree with the Minister. I have great fears in that regard, and that is why I refer to the matter now.  Last year one of the Minister's colleagues addressed a gathering of people in our county town on the question of increased production. Senator MacCabe will recollect it. Many present were probably supporters of the Minister.  It was a gathering that, politically, one could not label very definitely.  What those present wanted to talk about mainly was the problem confronting them, namely, the shortage of artificial manures.</P>
    <P>When Ministers go to the various counties to talk about increased production, what they should think about are the difficulties that farmers are up against this year and will certainly be up against next year and the succeeding two or three years.  Unless the situation that we are faced with to-day is altered considerably, our farmers are definitely up against a deterioration in the fertility of the soil, and to such an extent that we cannot measure what the possibilities in our total production may be from that cause.  That, to my mind, is a very grave problem. A good deal of fresh land has been broken in the last five years.  A great deal of land has been broken on which it is impossible to put farmyard manure.  The truth, of course, is that our animal population is not such as to enable us to put into our soil the quantity of farmyard manure necessary <Col N="767" /> to keep up our soil-fertility, taking into account the very great addition there has been to our tillage area.</P>
    <P>I am at a certain disadvantage in discussing this motion, for reasons which the Minister will appreciate, in that I have not any recent figures of our imports of artificial fertilisers or of our exports of the commodities to which I make reference.  I have figures for 1938 of the quantities of the various forms of artificial manures which we imported.  Taking rock phosphate, slag and superphosphate, we apparently imported in 1938 the equivalent of 188,000 tons; and of the other forms of fertilisers&mdash;what we might call nitrogenous manures&mdash;we imported approximately 60,000 tons.  I have not tried to calculate, at the rate of 6 cwt. to the acre, how many acres we could cover with that quantity, but obviously we have not anything like that quantity in these years.  I hope the Minister will tell us what quantity we have, as that is something which should not be a secret.</P>
    <P>The great fall in the importation of artificial fertilisers&mdash;which we utilised in days when our tillage area was much less than it is to-day&mdash;must mean that we have been extracting from the soil more than in 1938, without having anything like the quantity of fertilisers to put back into the land.  There seems to be a very considerable drop in total fertility.  Even in the case of very good land, when two or three crops of grain have been harvested, there is no prospect of a root crop.  Even where we are trying to grow roots after grain and spread the available fertility over such an increased area, we cannot possibly keep up the supply and hope to extract heavy crops.</P>
    <P>I imagine that there was a drop all round in total yields last year as against the year before.  We have no means of measuring it, but I think, though we had a larger area under crops, the total yields of food were no greater than in the previous year. In my constituency, the total yield of potatoes and grain crops combined was certainly under that of the previous year, even though a greater area was <Col N="768" /> tilled.  The same thing probably is true of the area from North Dublin to Galway and across to Northern Ireland.  I know that, in the Six Counties, conditions were much worse than with us, because of the unfavourable season.</P>
    <P>Our potato crop was not much more than 50 per cent. of that in the previous year, and with many farmers it was not even 50 per cent.  That was influenced considerably by the lack of artificial fertilisers.  That consideration will be accentuated to a greater degree this season in the poorer lands all over the country, where there will not be as good a crop as in 1941.  These factors are so important to the maintenance of our human and animal population, that the Department should take action at once.  If they have taken any action so far, it does not appear to have borne any fruit.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter in which the Government alone is concerned, because it affects the lives of our people in towns and cities.  Those people took their food for granted in the past, and it was one of the things they were least bothered about.  Food was there in abundance and it was merely a question of the money.  Amusements, clothes, motor cars and the amenities of life were considerations of much greater importance.  There is a complete reversal of that situation now. It is very interesting to hear some of the Dublin housewives relate their difficulties in getting things which they took for granted in the past.  I fear their difficulties will continue for a long time.</P>
    <P>The question of our bacon supplies for the future is still unsolved by the Minister or his Department, or by the Oireachtas.  The situation is now much worse than it has been at any time.  In the future it will be mainly a problem for the people in the towns and cities, as the people in the country will not be so short, but will manage to provide enough pig meat for themselves. The people in the towns and cities were accustomed to their nice lean rashers for breakfast in the morning, but we are now reaching a stage when a Bank of Ireland or even Bank of England note for £1 may not buy even <Col N="769" /> a pound of rashers on the 1st September next.  Indeed, I think there are places where it could hardly purchase that to-day.  We cannot view this problem with unconcern, and should face it as a whole community and not&mdash;as in Party politics&mdash;as a group of people opposed to another group.  In the past we exported cattle, sheep, pigs, butter and other fruits of our fields like beer and spirits; and in 1938 we brought back to the fields 188,000 tons of phosphates and 60,000 tons of nitrogenous manures of one kind or another.  All that went back into the fields.</P>
    <P>In 1938 we put back, in the form of nitrogenous manures and phosphates, some of the fertility our live stock and our crops took from the land, but the position is deteriorating.  Every year since then we have been taking much more fertility from the land than we have been able to put back.  That cannot go on except with disastrous consequences to the farmers and to the nation as a whole.  We must face that position.  We will have to live somehow after this war and, if we have nothing to live on except impoverished fields, that can yield only half the normal quantity of crops, I do not see how it will be possible for us to maintain a satisfactory standard of living for all our citizens.  If we are going to continue the policy of shipping away from the land cattle and other agricultural products, and if we make no effort to get back in exchange manures for the purpose of fertilising our land, giving back to it at least some of what has been taken out of it, then our economic policy is absolutely crazy. Whatever action has to be taken to remedy the situation, I feel that this House ought to face it as a major problem, not only for this year but for many years to come.  We must face the position with courage and unanimity.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is the kind of problem that can be solved by such methods as we have so far adopted.  I do not think that sending civil servants from here to deal with civil servants in England is the method by which the best results can come to us in a matter of this sort, because this is a matter of major concern.  If we cannot appreciate that it is a fundamental consideration <Col N="770" /> for the people, then we are not going to face up to it in the spirit which is so essential if we are to find a proper solution.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the type of mind &mdash;I do not know if it exists now to any extent&mdash;which believes that we ought not to ship anything out of this country, and that we should take as little as possible from other countries. I never accepted that view, and I do not know if there are many of these people still in existence.  Anyhow, we have had our education and we know how far that type of policy is suited to this country.  We realise now that life on this planet is not possible unless we can have between different countries such exchanges of goods and services as will make it possible for communities, closely associated from geographical and other points of view, to live comfortably.</P>
    <P>I do not think any policy is good for this country that prevents its exchanging goods and services with other people with whom we can find satisfactory accommodation.  I feel that the future is going to be bright for us only in so far as there can be an extension of that policy.  I look on this position that we are confronted with to-day as being neither fair nor sensible for ourselves or Britain.  I think it is clear that Britain, even to-day, is in need of food, and she will probably be in greater need of food six or nine months hence.  I think the big problem of the world, and what may ultimately decide the war, is the food position.  Men are, day after day, being drawn away from the fields everywhere on the earth's surface in order to get behind the guns and naturally the capacity of the earth to produce food for the people will diminish.  It is all right to talk about women land workers, but if they have to plough up hill and down dale and cut corn with a scythe, the food production will fall off considerably in every land.  It is essential that you have men to do the sowing and the reaping.</P>
    <P>In so far as our relations with Britain are concerned I, like Senator Johnston, fail to understand Britain's point of view.  They make it clear that they want food, but at the same time <Col N="771" /> they will not give us the equipment, the means to produce food for them. Part of the material that our farmers require in order to produce food for many years to come will be an ample supply of artificial fertilisers.  If Britain wants meat from us, the amount of meat which she can buy should be regulated by the quantities of fertilisers that she is able to supply to us so as to enable us to give back to our land some of the fertility that has been taken away.  She did not supply us with any fertilisers last year and, up to the present at any rate, she does not seem prepared to supply us with any fertilisers for the coming season.</P>
    <P>Britain can supply the answer to the question.  She can measure our total production by what she is prepared to exchange for our cattle or whatever else she takes from our fields.  I do not know what goods we are getting from England in exchange for the commodities we are sending to her. I do not know that we are sending anything across the Channel outside of the commodities I have referred to in my motion. I should like to know what commodities England is sending to us in exchange for our goods.  One thing I do know is that we are getting only a trifling amount of what we need to put into the land compared with what has been taken out of it.</P>
    <P>There are certain peculiar points in regard to our position.  For instance, the Minister is engaged on a campaign for increased tillage.  In my county and in other northern counties we grow a certain amount of flax.  The production of flax is being encouraged.  I am eager for the production of every kind of crop that our land can grow.  I am for greater production and heavier yields of every kind.  I am puzzled by this, however, that there is obviously a policy to encourage the production of flax.  As evidence of that, it is possible for the producers of flax to procure quantities of artificial manures which are not made available to the growers of other crops.  You can purchase potash if you are going to grow flax, but you cannot go to a merchant and say: &ldquo;I am going to grow potatoes, <Col N="772" /> oats, wheat or barley&rdquo; and buy potash.</P>
    <P>I cannot buy potash for my potatoes. If I am going to grow flax, which had to be exported, I can procure a certain limited quantity, and that is something which demands explanation.  Last year, we had somewhere around 18,000 acres of flax, representing an increase of about 3,000 acres on the previous year.</P>
    <P>I may say, in passing, that we are selling that flax to the people in Northern Ireland, who are paying our farmers a lower price for it than they are paying their own farmers in the Six Counties.  So far as I know very little of what is manufactured from the flax is coming back into this country. I should like the Minister to tell us something about that.  Anyway, it is quite clear that we are producing a crop which we cannot consume within the Twenty-Six Counties, and we are not obtaining, for the manufacture of linen or cotton goods, anything like a reasonable proportion of the yarns which would come from the total yield of this flax.  What are we getting against it, and why is there evidence of a policy of encouraging its production, when nothing is coming back to the land, except the one-half cwt. of potash which men can procure against the growing of one acre?</P>
    <P>When, at a particular point last year, we were apparently hard pressed in regard to wheat for bread, we had discussions about the exchange of barley for spirits against wheat.  I do not know if we were told anything about that, and whether or not there was an exchange of one grain for another, or of the spirits manufactured from the grain for wheat.  I do not know, but it is something on which the Minister can enlighten us.  The major thing, however, is our cattle exports.  There we have a very considerable quantity of food going out of this area&mdash;food which is very valuable indeed for Britain, and food which is not procurable by her anywhere else at present. It could be increased, and it might be considerably increased, by better farming methods here, and by a policy on the part of Britain which would enable our yields to be increased, or <Col N="773" /> even to be maintained at the pre-war level, which it is not at present possible for us to do.</P>
    <P>I feel that we have reached the stage now in relation to our farming policy when the Government, backed up by the people, will have to say to the British Government that the farmers of this country are being forced in these circumstances to take so much out of their land that, unless they can get in exchange for what they take out something which can be put back into it, the national position will be so worsened as to demand probably the complete overhaul of our present agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>It will be argued that our cattle have to be sold&mdash;that the cattle are fat, that they are ripe and that ripe fruit must be plucked.  That is true, but, if needs be, there is a way of preventing fruit from ripening.  There are possibilities of altering our policy in various ways which may mean that not alone would our technique be altered, but our general lines of agriculture would have to be changed, because whatever else we cannot afford to do, the one thing we cannot do and live in this island is to rape the earth, as they have done on the American continent.</P>
    <P>We have 12,000,000 acres of arable land, they say.  I do not know how much of that is classified as first and second-class land.  There is a great deal of it which is poorer than third-class land and a very considerable area must be second-class land.  A great deal of that second-class land used to be cropped, and is being cropped at present.  The yields were never very high, but they were maintained at a reasonable level, mainly by very hard work on the part of the farmer and by the application of phosphatic and nitrogenous manures which he procured in the past.  That is the land which is going to become worthless in a very few years of this type of farming.  The man with 50 or 60 acres, with a limited number of cattle, cannot possibly farm that area as it ought to be farmed.  Our cattle stocks this year are apparently slightly below what they were last year, at the round figure <Col N="774" /> of 4,000,000, so that we are not able to get any more for the soil than we got in the previous year.</P>
    <P>In such a situation, the nation must take serious note of the position, and the Minister for Agriculture has, I feel, a very serious obligation put upon him.  If he feels it incumbent on him to go down the country to gatherings of farmers to urge them to greater effort, the farmers everywhere expect that he and his colleagues will do something on behalf of the farmers for the soil and they have no evidence of its having been done yet.  If I have a very serious job to do, I will not send my man into town to do it.  I will do it myself.  If I have a cow to sell or a cow to buy, I will do it myself.  If the man comes with me, well and good, and at times I am glad to have his point of view, but this is the biggest thing which has to be done for the nation this year and its fruits are going to last into the years to come.</P>
    <P>There is no question that members of the Government have negotiated with the British Government before, and if we were to measure the real value to the nation of what we bargained for then in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, that cash value would not be anything like the cash value of this loss, this devastation which is going on, if it could be measured in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.  For that reason, this matter is something which, if it is to be tackled, should not be tackled by servants of the Minister, but by the Minister himself, or some members of the Government, and, if necessary, the head of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell us that they are getting certain quantities of artificial manures from the British Government. Those of us who live close to the Border believe that there is almost as much artificial manure surplus to the requirements of Northern Ireland as would give a very respectable dressing to the Twenty-Six Counties.  That, at any rate, is the feeling we have, and I have no hesitation in saying that it ought to be possible to argue and debate this question with the British Government, and if it were argued <Col N="775" /> with vigour, with strength and with conviction&mdash;and the cards are in our hands&mdash;from their total production of fertilisers it ought to be possible to get from Britain such an increased quota as would make all the difference to the farmers this year between profitable production and production which may mean a cash loss.</P>
    <P>I do not feel that we ought to go over as beggars.  I do not feel that we have to go as an inferior people, who have neither claims, rights nor status. As the Minister knows we have a claim on Britain to the extent of £300,000,000.  I do not know what we are doing about that money to-day. They ought to be asked to honour more of our claims on it.  It is also a fact that thousands of boys and girls have left this country in the last few years, and that no money could buy for Britain the services that these people are giving.  I do not think it is for us to boast about that as it is a matter which the French in relation to the Germans are trying to side-step as far as they can.  The truth is that our people in England are doing work that English men and women would not be able to do.  If we send cattle to Britain we get cash back, but for the services of these young men and women apparently nothing is coming, except they of their free choice decide to send some of their earnings.  Accordingly, we make a free grant of their services to England and, on top of that, the products of hard labour in our fields.  Can we not make some claim on them for that?  I am unhappy about this situation, that when farmers here produce goods which appear to be surplus, these goods are exported and that payment generally comes back, not in the kind of goods which our farmers require, but in a form that people in cities and towns require.</P>
    <P>In other words, a good deal of the earnings are translated into consumers' products for the use of people in towns and cities.  I feel that, when farmers send out quantities of goods, that represents a slice of our soil, because a beast cannot be raised without taking something out of the soil.  We cannot <Col N="776" /> grow flax, or grain to make beer or spirits, except at some cost to the soil.  These products are going out and farmers see nothing coming here which they can put back into the land.</P>
    <P>Some goods may come back but they become the property of people in the towns.  Someone in the Government has to decide what goods are most essential.  Somebody has to determine, as against artificial manures, what other things may be needed. It may be more important to bring in commodities that are required in cities and towns.  The Minister can tell us what exactly we get in exchange for our exports.  I suggest to the House that residents of towns and cities will have to make up their minds whether they are going to do without commodities, which are essential to human life, and which are the products of our fields, or do without other commodities which come from Britain, that are not essential to life but, apparently, in exchange for the goods that our farmers produce and export.</P>
    <P>Our people will have to decide which commodities they must have.  I do not believe that the present situation can continue.  No matter how hard our farmers strive and no matter what additional numbers of men are employed, if fertility is not put into the land the yield of our crops will fall.  I know that the Minister is an optimist about the fertility of our soil, but, if he was farming, he would see definite evidence of changed conditions.  The Seanad discussed the milk question this evening. I have no doubt about the fall in milk yields, and not alone is there a shortage of milk in the City of Dublin, but in most parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is surely not relevant on this motion.  It has already been dealt with on a previous motion this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that it is relevant, because it is due to the fact that the fertility of our grass land is falling, and also the fertility of land for feeding cattle?  That is going on at such a rate that milk yields must inevitably drop.  I know that from my own experience, and also that of neighbours, <Col N="777" /> who have been accustomed to put dressings of artificial fertilisers on grass lands.  These fertilisers are not now available.  Should that situation further develop I am convinced we are facing a position in which we will undoubtedly reap the consequences.  This question is a major one which ought to be tackled very seriously.  It is one on which the Government should take vigorous action, on which it will have the backing of the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember telling the Minister on a previous occasion, when on a deputation at Government Buildings, that if he went direct to the British Government about the price of butter and told them, if they were not prepared to pay a decent price, the people here would face the consequences by a change of policy if needs be, and even suffer reverses.  I say the same to the Minister now.  I urge that the Government should open up negotiations, not through representatives, but direct, from one Minister to another.  The farmers are prepared to face the position.  It will not be good for either country if it is not faced.  I think that is a situation that will not arise.  It is, however, something on which we ought to be prepared to take risks.  The other way is to pursue a policy which is very bad for our land and very bad for this nation.  It means pursuing a policy, the results of which will be reaped by people in our towns and cities.  It will leave us so impoverished that the possibility of reconstruction will be more difficult here than in some countries <Col N="778" /> that have been devastated by war. There are things that cannot be done with land.  The top of the soil of this country was harmed many years ago, and the descendants of the men who did that have ever since been trying to restore the fertility of the soil and have not yet succeeded.  We will be doing harm like that if we continue the present policy.</P>
