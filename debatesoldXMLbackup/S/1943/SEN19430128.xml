      <P>I feel that the Minister is quite adamant on this subject and that he has gone out and had nails put in his shoes so that he cannot slip.  With regard to the arguments put forward by various Senators, the first one was put by Senator Goulding and was to the effect that the Guards would not be able to exercise effective control.  I was following in father's footsteps, that is to say, the Minister's, when he stated that the removal of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic would ease the difficulties of the Gárdaí&mdash;and now that argument is used against me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are frightful inconsistencies in the whole of this business.  Take the case of 29th June when we have our cattle show in Kerry.  On normal days we can have a drink, but if that day happens to fall on a Sunday, it cannot be done.  Senator Goulding suggested that the general opening of 40 years ago, when we were all young, was a most unfortunate thing, but he cannot deny that the circumstances of to-day are quite different, the outlook of the people is different, and the quality of drink is different, and that if we have a general opening now, there will not <Col N="976" /> be exactly the same type of excesses as those which he witnessed as a younger man.</P>
    <P>I feel that this should be agreed to, but I do not think the Minister will accept it, and I am not prepared to press it in face of his opposition, notwithstanding the fact that I still feel that his arguments have not been entirely convincing.  He did say, and I must apologise for not quoting it yesterday, that he thought it would lead to additional drinking.  It may lead to additional drinking, but that is no offence, provided people do not drink to excess.  There is no reason why they should not have their drink when they want it in the country as people in Dublin can.</P>
    <P>I forgot to quote one more remark of the Minister's at the end of his speech in the Dáil.  He said that the whole idea of the Sabbath would be put on one side if there was this Sunday opening and that there was no fear of that in the city.  If the Minister came down to Kerry and told that to the people there, I do not think he would last very long.  We feel that we are as sober people as they are in Dublin and we should have a certain period &mdash;I do not care what hours are fixed&mdash; in which to drink legally on Sunday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want my position to be misunderstood.  Senator Baxter practically accused me of attacking people in the rural districts, and pointed out that I suggested they were inclined to be rather disorderly when these houses were open.  I did not say that at all.  What I wanted to point out, and to make clear was that we spent quite a long time in endeavouring to overcome the nuisance complained of in the City of Dublin, where certain members of the community make a habit of taking too much drink after hours and making themselves a general nuisance.  That does not refer to the great body of people in Dublin at all, as probably 99.9 per cent. of them are steady, reliable citizens.  It is of a small minority in the city that we are all afraid.  Unfortunately such people can also be found throughout the country, and it is <Col N="977" /> our duty to safeguard that minority from themselves.  If we honestly believe that the opening of these houses would result in this minority making a general nuisance of themselves we are right in taking steps to stop it.  When I indicated that the opening hours might lead to the same disorder, I was referring to that particular section and not to the people as a whole.  I know the people of rural Ireland, and in recent years they have become much more temperate and steady.  I believe that if the houses were open for 24 hours throughout the year these people would be all right. It is against a small minority that we have to guard.  I do not want to have the same type making themselves a nuisance in country districts as these unfortunate people do in the city.</P>

      <P>If I intervene at this stage possibly I might clear the air somewhat.  The Minister and I are absolutely <i>ad idem</i> on the question of <i>bona fide</i> drinking.  Both of us believe that, as it exists, the Act of 1927 is the source of all the trouble in the administration of the Act of 1924.  The Minister did his best by starting off in the Dáil to abolish this nuisance&mdash;I cannot describe it as anything else&mdash;in the present Bill, but had to submit to <i>force majeure.</i>  My proposition might help the Minister and the House.  It might assist the Minister in going back to the Dáil if we could get agreement on these lines in this House, that we would agree, with the Minister, to the total abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic as it exists under the 1927 Act, and that, in return, the Minister would bring in an amendment on the Report Stage making provision for a short general opening throughout the country on Sundays, rural areas included.  I do not know what the Minister's views on that proposition would be, or whether we could get agreement on it in this House.  I realise that the Minister is as keen as I am, but I must confess that I have a bee in my bonnet as far as the <i>bona fide</i> traffic is concerned. If it would in any way strengthen the Minister's position in returning to the other House, I put that proposition to him for his consideration and also for the consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>There is undoubtedly a considerable body of opinion in the Seanad that the <i>bona fide</i> traffic should be entirely abolished, but we are not prepared to do that unless we are quite certain that in return rural workers will get the same facilities as others.  If the argument is made that persons who work on the land are more drunken than persons who work at desks, how is it that a rural worker is allowed to go three miles to get a drink but is not allowed to get it when it is one or two miles only to the local public house?  I think that is a sort of bedlam and that we are taking some strange line that I cannot understand. With a great many other Senators I would be prepared to agree to the total abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, provided an opportunity to have a drink in the normal way at the nearest public house was given them similar to that given to city workers.</P>

      <P>I agree with the principle, but I see difficulties about its general adoption.  A preference would be given to public houses that sold groceries as against houses that did not sell them.  That is a substantial difficulty.  If it could be got over I would be in favour of what Senator The McGillycuddy and Senator Robinson suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal too much emphasis being placed on the requirements of the rural worker.  I know rural workers very well and there is no rush on their part to the public house after their day's work.  As a matter of fact they have no money for such a purpose.  It is as much as the rural worker can do with the wage he earns to support himself and his family.  Anyway, the only time the rural worker would go into the nearest public house or village would be on a Saturday evening.  Therefore, I do not think there is any necessity <Col N="979" /> for making provision for the rural worker, because he cannot avail of it even if it were provided.  He has no money to expend on drink every day of the week.  Therefore, with advantage to himself and everybody else, he can be left out of consideration altogether. With his present earnings it is as much as he can do to carry on his home.  He has no inclination for going to a public house every night of the week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDoyle" hpid="Dr. Doyle Dr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Crosbie's suggestion is a very good one and that the Minister ought to accept it.  As to opening public houses on a Sunday for a limited time, say, from 4 o'clock to 7 o'clock, it is something anomalous that you can travel three miles on a bicycle and obtain as much drink as you like from 1 o'clock until 8 o'clock under the existing law.  People can do that if they want to, but I do not think large numbers do it.  It would be really a curtailment in drinking facilities if the hours were changed and everybody who wants a drink could get it, say, for three hours between 4 o'clock and 7 o'clock on a Sunday.  I am talking now about rural districts and country public houses.  There are men of middle age who would like to have a drink or a little relaxation on a Sunday evening.  They only take a couple of pints and have a chat with their neighbours.  It is absurd that they should have to travel three miles for that little relaxation.  It does not concern the younger people at all because, if they wish to have a drink, travelling three miles on a bicycle is no trouble to them.  I think it would be a good idea to have the public houses open for, say, three hours on a Sunday evening and do away with the present facilities under which in the country they can obtain drink for seven hours on a Sunday by travelling three miles.  You will remove some abuses by having that opening for three hours on a Sunday.  The publican would be delighted with that, because he would have his day free until 4 o'clock in the evening and his usual dinner hour would not be interfered with.  I do not think it would create any abuses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with Senator Crosbie's appeal to the Minister in so far as it affects rural areas.  In some rural areas people have to travel as much as six or eight miles to go to Divine Service on Sunday.  If consideration is given to the city residents, surely that consideration ought to be extended to the rural areas as well.  As I say, these people travel very long distances on Sunday and probably meet their friends only once a week in that way.  There is an old Irish proverb, Ná déan nós, nó ná bris nós&mdash;&ldquo;Don't make a custom or break a custom.&rdquo; The old custom exists of friendliness between neighbours who do not see each other for a week at least.  Therefore, I join with Senator Crosbie in appealing to the Minister to give some consideration to that type of person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to endorse the remarks of Senator Crosbie, because I feel that in the rural areas and the small towns the people are entitled to some consideration.  These people will notice that the City of Dublin and other cities are getting every facility on a Sunday, while the people down the country are getting none. Senator Honan referred to agricultural labourers going to have a drink on a Saturday night or any other night of the week.  That is not correct.  They have not the means to do that.  The only day they would have an opportunity of doing that would be on a Sunday, when they go to the local village or the nearest town.  Surely if we do away with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, which I say we are entitled to do, these people are entitled to facilities for two or three hours on one day of the week during which they can have refreshments with their friends.  I would not go so far as Senator Doyle and say three hours, but if they had from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock on a Sunday, I think it would meet with the approval of the people in country districts.  We could then cut out the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, which goes on until 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been contended that if these drinking facilities are provided, the people are so prone to drink that you <Col N="981" /> will have drunkenness throughout the country.  I am delighted to be able to say that there is a great falling off in the matter of drinking amongst young people in the country.  I cannot speak for the cities, but I know a great deal about country towns and villages.  I have great sympathy for middle-aged boys and men who go to a football match or other amusement, or to meet friends on a Sunday, and who cannot get a drink except at the back door of some public house, with the danger of being prosecuted and being shown up. Therefore, I think the Minister should seriously consider this matter and agree to an opening for two hours on Sunday in the towns and villages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to avoid confused thinking in this matter because the abuses of the <i>bona fide</i> laws have been mixed up inextricably with the proposal to change the existing law with regard to Sunday closing outside the boroughs.  I think that in this case we must take higher ground and that the Minister, as a Minister in a Christian country, would have no right, even to avoid the evils that arise from any abuse of a <i>bona fide</i> privilege, to pass a positive law which would make further encroachments on the sanctity of the Lord's Day.  Already there has been a great deal of that. We have gone away from the good idea of Sunday, the day of rest and the day of reverence.  If this Sunday opening were to be allowed, it would add very much to the difficulties that parents already have in passing on the traditional view of Sunday observance. There may be pastimes on Sunday, but we should not forget that it is the Lord's Day.  In order to obviate the abuse of the <i>bona fide</i> privilege, it would, in my opinion, be very wrong to give further opportunities for drinking on a Sunday to people who, perhaps, under the present law can go three miles to get it.  There is quite a difference between having to go three miles and having it at your own doorstep. Apart from the reverence we owe to Sunday, as such, we must look upon this in a practical way.  Great numbers of people have nothing to do on Sundays and, if added facilities for drinking are given, it might lead to <Col N="982" /> more drinking being done on Sundays than on ordinary days of the week when these people have to go back to business.  Therefore, apart from the fact that Sunday is the Lord's Day, and that we in Ireland should keep it as such, as we always have, I think it is very dangerous from the point of view of the ordinary well-being of our country to give added facilities for drinking on Sundays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with what, I think, is behind Senator Mrs. Concannon's argument, but it does not lead me to quite the same conclusions as she has come to. In the first place, I should like to say that I do not think shops, employing people, should be open on Sundays at all unless it is necessary that they should be open, and I hold that we ought to keep as near as we can to making Sunday a day in which the largest possible number of people will be free from having to work.  Now, we know that, even with that in view, it does not mean that there will not be a certain number of people who, in order to make it possible for other people to be free, will have to do a certain amount of work.  Because I hold that view strongly with regard to the Sabbath Day, and would be very sorry to see any extension of shopping of various kinds on Sundays, I am inclined to have sympathy with what Senator Mrs. Concannon has said, but I have had to look at it from a slightly different point of view.  I am entirely at one with her, as I think she knows, in that I do not want to see any increase of drunkenness on Sunday, or on any other day in the week, but I have a feeling that, so far as the hours are concerned, the most important thing would be to come to some agreement as to hours that can be and will be observed, and that even if you have to make some concession in a direction that, perhaps, you yourself do not like, it might be well to make that concession if it meant a considerable gain in the total effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, the best advice that I can get, both from the country and rural towns, is that it will be extremely difficult to enforce a closing hour so long as the present <i>bona fide</i><Col N="983" /> law continues, and that if a public house closes, on any day, at the legal hour, any person who is there can stay on and be served additional drinks, more or less <i>ad lib</i>, if he has travelled the necessary number of miles, according to the law.  I have not much knowledge of the licensed trade, but I have often wondered how a publican can keep the law under such conditions. I am perfectly certain, with regard to the trade in which I am occupied, that if I had to observe such conditions, I simply could not do it. If I had to inquire, from my customers in the drapery trade, how far they had travelled, and so on, and had to turn certain of them out at a particular hour, while allowing others to remain on, it would lead to the greatest difficulties. From the police point of view, this matter of the <i>bona fide</i> trade has led to the most acute difficulties, because they cannot prove a statement to be false until they go into each individual case and get evidence with regard to each case, which is almost impossible in most cases.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see public houses being opened in the towns where they are not in the habit of opening at the present time, but I think that, for all practical purposes, although the doors of these public houses are not open on Sundays, the houses are open from the point of view of the assistants having to work and of certain customers having to be served.  As far as I understand, that is the case all over Ireland, and the Sabbath is not being observed from that point of view.  It might be well to consider whether it would not be a step nearer to getting Sunday kept as it should be, to have the two hours, as suggested by Senator MacCabe, in preference to the present arrangement, if it would mean doing away with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic. If we were perfectly sure that, by making some concession, we would be able to get away from the present evils, I think it would be better to do so.  For that reason, I am more inclined to support Senator MacCabe's suggestion, and if there was general agreement on having the hours from 2 to 4, but doing away with the <i>bonafide</i><Col N="984" /> traffic, I think it would be a gain. Probably, there is a certain element of risk, but I suggest to the Minister that it might be well to consider whether it would not be better to take that risk in view of the very considerable gain that might be achieved.</P>
    <P>Senator MacCabe has suggested two hours, from 2 to 4, and, in my opinion, the Minister might accept those two hours as experimental, and then he could be given power to change them, by order, if they were not found to be satisfactory.  If the total abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> traveller is accepted, I am definitely prepared to accept the principle, as put forward by Senator Crosbie, but I should prefer it in the form in which it has been put forward by Senator MacCabe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the rural communities are concerned, I do not think Sunday opening is sought by them or that, if granted, it would be of any great advantage to them.  In the rural communities in Ireland, there is a traditional way of observing Sunday. There is Mass, the home, lunch, and then sports or football in the evening, and then back for tea and evening devotions.  That is the usual way of observing the Sabbath in the country districts of Ireland.  Is it now proposed to change that to Mass in the morning, then the public house, then late for dinner at home, and, possibly, no sports or football?  I suggest that that may happen.  I do not say that it will happen, nor do I say that any great evils would follow, because I do not think such facilities would be very much availed of by the country people, but I do say that there would be that very great temptation there if there was to be general opening of the public houses on Sundays, when people are coming from Mass.  Then there would be a difficulty as to the hours of opening. The only thing would be to open either after last Mass or between the early and late Masses.  I suggest that that would be the only thing that would be of use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have an opportunity of speaking afterwards. What I am saying is that these would be the only hours that would be useful but, as a matter of fact, I do not think they would be used at all. Our rural population do not hang around public houses on Sundays.  For one thing they have not enough money to keep body and soul together, so I do not think there would be much danger from that quarter.  Our farmers are a very temperate class.  Of course, certain fairs or markets, such as the famous Puck Fair at Killorglin, and other fairs in western Kerry, are held on Sundays, and I can quite understand that people coming from a long distance to attend these fairs might want a drink, but they would be <i>bona fide</i> travellers in any case, and could get a drink.  Such days, however, occur very rarely&mdash;the days of the big horse fairs, and so on&mdash;and I think it would be reactionary and bad to keep large numbers of people employed on Sundays who at present have leisure to rest.  Apart from the question of rest or leisure, very many of these people regard Sunday as a day of prayer, and you will destroy that as well as upsetting a lot of domestic arrangements, such as the preparation of meals, and so on, if people are to be allowed to adjourn to the public house every Sunday when coming from Mass.  I do not think it would be any advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the proposal made by Senator Crosbie more or less confuses the issue.  If my interpretation of his suggestion is correct, he wants to allow the public houses to open on Sundays, and to abolish <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  I think we should consider the question of Sunday opening on its merits, instead of suggesting this compromise.  I agree with a good deal of what Mrs. Concannon has said.  In the country, I do not think there is any great demand for Sunday opening. Furthermore, in regard to this matter <Col N="986" /> there can be no question of comparison between the city and the country. In the large cities, a licensed premises carry on solely the business of a licensed premises, but in the small towns and in the country it is quite a different thing.  The publican there is usually the draper, the ironmonger and the grocer as well.  If you allow those publicans to open their doors on a Sunday for the purpose of selling intoxicating liquor, you cannot really prevent a man from going in there and buying cigarettes, tobacco, tea, sugar, or any other groceries he may want. In that way, you would be allowing an unfair competition as between the licensed merchant and the unlicensed merchant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a lot about the <i>bona fide</i> traveller, and of course there are certain cases where abuses occur.  The <i>bona fide</i> traveller is a man who travels from a particular area, three or four or six or even 20 miles distant.  He will not go into the local public house in the country for the purpose of purchasing drapery or other goods; that question is likely to arise only in the case of the ordinary residents of the district.  We have heard a good deal about abuse of the <i>bona fide</i> regulations.  Some time ago here, we set up a board to develop tourism in this country, and we hope that when this war is over&mdash;I assume that this Bill is designed to deal with future years&mdash;this country will become a great tourist centre.  If we abolish the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, as suggested by Senator Crosbie, we will be depriving those tourists of necessary facilities.  When those people come here, they like to go out from their hotels for the day, taking their lunch in the car with them, and on their journey they might like to call into the local inn and have a drink there.  I think it is to accommodate such people that that section is left in the Bill.  Therefore, I would not be in <Col N="987" /> favour of a compromise in this matter; I would not be in favour of abolishing the <i>bona fide</i> traffic and substituting the Sunday opening.</P>
      <P>Senator The McGillycuddy referred last night to people coming down from the mountains with their sheep and holding fairs on Sundays.  If we are going to do anything in that regard, I think we should first set out to abolish the holding of those fairs on Sundays instead of opening the public houses to accommodate the people who attend them.</P>

      <P>Senator Hawkins has anticipated some of the points I wanted to make.  Obviously, we are discussing this subject on its merits, because we have Senator MacCabe agreeing with Senator Crosbie, and myself agreeing with Senator Hawkins on the general position.  The amendment refers to the opening of public houses during certain hours on Sundays. The Minister does not want to grant those facilities, because young people in the neighbourhood&mdash;who would not take the trouble of going a distance for the purpose&mdash;may be tempted to indulge in drink.  Yesterday, some Senator&mdash;I think it was Senator Goulding&mdash;was trying to find some other word to describe the <i>bona fide</i> traveller.  He introduced a new definition&mdash;the legitimate traveller. Of course we all know that the <i>bona fide</i> regulations are availed of by people who are fond of drink and would go any distance solely for the purpose of getting it.  A certain number do that.  I should like to say something on behalf of the legitimate traveller. I myself travel a considerable distance on Sundays.  I sometimes travel from here to Galway, or from here to Roscommon.  I will certainly say that, when travelling to Galway, I like to break the journey at Athlone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making a case for myself; I can go without a drink all right, but a great many people who are travelling, particularly in fine weather, <Col N="988" /> would like to be able to get one.  This is especially true in the case of tourists, as Senator Hawkins has mentioned. I think it would not be a good thing to wipe out the <i>bona fide</i> laws such as they are, merely because there are infringements of those laws by certain people.  It ought to be a question of finding some way of dealing with those people and preventing them from breaking the law.  I do not think it is right to deprive the legitimate traveller of those facilities because other people break the law.  As Senator Hawkins has mentioned, we are legislating now for future years. This Bill will become part of the law of the country when the emergency is over.  We have a tourist association endeavouring to develop our tourist industry, and tourists certainly will not be attracted here if we become a pussyfoot or prohibitionist country, and that is what it would appear to them if the legitimate traveller could not get a drink in the course of his journey.  I do not know what attitude the Minister will adopt with regard to the suggestion made by Senator Crosbie.  I must say that, as far as I am concerned, I do not agree with the proposal.  I am sorry that I cannot agree with Senator Crosbie on this matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind Senators that when this Bill was introduced there was no attempt to do away with <i>bona fide</i> traffic on Sundays.  We looked at the matter very carefully, and my opinion, and the opinion of those whom I consulted was that, on Sundays, you really had the genuine traveller.  He might be going to sports, on a cycle run, or for a walk, or, as Senator Conlon said, he might be going a journey in a car, and between those hours there was no reason why he should not get a drink.  The position is that outside the county boroughs there is no opening whatever except for genuine travellers.  Those who go purely for the purpose of getting drink are not genuine travellers, but the difficulty, as I think I pointed out before, is that you could not establish that they went for the purpose of getting drink.  Certainly, everyone will admit that on <Col N="989" /> Sunday there are more genuine travellers on the road, mostly for pleasure, I suppose, but it does not matter if it is for pleasure or business if they are genuine travellers.  That is why the <i>bona fide</i> provision was brought in.</P>
      <P>Being satisfied with that, I did not propose, when the Bill was introduced, to interfere with the genuine traveller on Sunday.  For that matter, if none but genuine travellers had been drinking during the other hours, the Bill would not have been brought in at all, but it was because we well knew that when public houses closed at 10 o'clock, in the county boroughs or other places, people were in the habit&mdash;due, I am sure, to the transport facilities that were available&mdash;of going off and drinking at all hours of the night and early hours of the morning, in outlying districts, not alone in Dublin but all over the country.  Then there was the other business I mentioned about dances. That was what we tried to remedy, not to put restrictions on the legitimate traveller.</P>
      <P>In regard to the alternative, to open for two, three or four hours, I do not think that would be feasible at all because I am perfectly certain&mdash;and I think it has emerged from the debate here so far&mdash; that you would want public houses open all the day to suit everybody. Different hours have been mentioned. I think Senator The McGillycuddy said the demand was mostly in the earlier part of the day&mdash;after Mass.</P>

      <P>It has not been stressed so much here, but in the other House several Deputies insisted that after Mass was the best time to open for a couple of hours.  I have heard suggestions all over the place for different hours.  I think you would really require to have public houses open practically the whole day because you could not cater for one particular section during a particular two hours and for another section during another two hours.  Senator O'Donovan said that sheep would be coming down the hill <Col N="990" /> at all hours, that there is no regular time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not, but I think you could not arrange for them to come down between 3 and 5.  At any rate, in regard to general opening, that is the one point on which I did stick my heels in in the other House, and I am not going to loosen them here because I am absolutely convinced that it would lead to a great increase in drinking.  I am not a pussyfoot in any way.  I am not a strict Sabbatarian, and I never was.  The case was well put by several Deputies in the other House, and it has been put here by Senator Hawkins, and I am convinced that you would have general trading carried on on Sunday.  In the cities it is different.  In the cities licensed premises are merely for supplying refreshment, but in the country places they are practically all mixed houses that sell all sorts of stuff.  I do not think that would be the worst evil, but I am perfectly certain that it would be one of them.  I am certain there would be the same result in regard to drinking on Sundays as there has been in the matter of betting since betting was legalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say the Seanad has been very helpful and I have tried to be as receptive as I possibly could, but on this point I am certainly not inclined to give in at all.  I do not think it would have a good result.  Senator Crosbie suggested that it might help me with the Dáil.  My experience is that it would not, because not alone did they want the <i>bona fide</i> trade, but they wanted this as well.  They wanted both.  There is no question about it.  As I said before, I was practically threatened with our own Party voting against me and I said I did not care; I would not have it.  I think I was right.  I think on the whole, when it is calmly examined, it will be realised that it would be a bad move.  I certainly say I would not be prepared to agree to it and I would <Col N="991" /> not be prepared to agree to the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade on Sunday. I think it is very necessary, apart from tourists.  I do not care very much about tourists.  It is my view that if a tourist comes here he should put up with what he gets.  If he is not prepared to do that, he should go somewhere else.  I do not cater for tourists, of course.  It is not my business.  Some other Minister looks after the tourists. But I think that people who come to this country should put up with the conditions that exist here.  If they are good enough for us, they ought to be good enough for them.  I would not have given in in the Dáil, except I was forced to do it, to abolish the Sunday <i>bona fide</i> trade, because I think it is something that is necessary for the convenience of the general public.  I am perfectly satisfied that it is.  Even if it does mean a change of population, people who go on bicycles have to go three miles to have a drink and they take some exercise&mdash;even though they are not entitled to get a drink if they go only for that purpose.  I think there is nothing wrong in it but the general opening would lead to a great increase in drinking and I am sorry I cannot agree to accept it.</P>

      <P>Certainly, when the Minister is finished putting the Bill through this House, he will be able to say with truth that there has been no lack of suggestions.  Whether they have been helpful to him or not, I do not know.  I am sorry that he, takes the view that my suggestion would be of no assistance to him, and in view of the terms in which the amendment is drafted I do not see how I could put it to a division as the suggestion I made to-day is not at all in keeping with the terms of the amendment as on the Order Paper.  I would like to point out to the Minister and the House that the suggestion I made was the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> traveller as he exists under the 1927 Act, that is, the man who has simply and solely to travel three miles and no more.  I am not particularly athletic, but I can travel three miles on my feet in 35 minutes.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Minister and to Senator Conlon that it would be quite easy to deal with the case of the genuine traveller on Sunday by making an alteration in the distance which he has to travel.  For instance, I made no suggestion that when Senator Conlon is on his way from Dublin to Galway that when he stops at Athlone to have his lunch, he should be debarred from having a drink with his lunch.  If Senator Conlon, or any other Senator or any member of the general public, is travelling from Dublin to Galway by car, I would suggest that he should have a drink with his lunch but I would also suggest that he should not be entitled to drive his car and stop every three miles and, shall we say, put some form of fuel in the tank.  I think it would not be in the interests of either the general public or the motorist that he should be permitted to do that.  At any rate, in view of the attitude taken by the House and by the Minister, I cannot see that I would serve any useful purpose in pushing this amendment to a division.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> Before Section 8 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  A person who is at the one time the holder of a six day beer retailer's on-licence and the holder of a seven day beer retailer's on-licence shall be entitled to have the seven day licence transferred to the premises to which the six day licence is attached, but subject to the condition that on such transfer being made, the six day licence shall not be renewed and that the premises to which the seven day licence was attached before such transfer, shall, for the purpose of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, be deemed not to have been licensed.</P>
    <P>(2)  The application for the transfer of the licence may be made at any sitting of the justice of the District Court in whose District Court district are situate the premises to which the six day licence is attached.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to enable a person who is the occupant of premises to which a seven-day beer retailer's licence is attached and at the same time the occupant of premises to which a six-day beer retailer's licence is attached, to transfer the seven-day licence to the premises to which only a six-day licence is attached.  I might point out that these are premises which have a beer retailer's licence only. They have not a licence for wines and spirits.  The net result of the transfer of the seven-day licence would be that the six-day licence would be wiped out. I understand that under the old laws there is a provision which provides for the transfer of an ordinary licence from one premises to another, but there is no provision whereby a person who has a beer retailer's licence can transfer a seven-day licence to the premises with the six-day licence.  The number of people who would be affected by this provision is, I understand, very small. There are only four six-day licences, while there are something like 147 seven-day licences.  This is a privilege which could apply only to a very small number of people indeed.  Consequently I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

It is whether one can transfer a seven-day grocer's spirit licence to a premises which has a six-day licence. Let me put a concrete case to the Minister.  Take for instance a man who has two houses.  In the case of one he is the lessee of premises to which a six-day grocer's spirit licence is attached.  In the case of the other, in a different townland in the same area, he has a seven-day licence.  He wishes to buy the house of which he is lessee and to which the six-day licence is attached and to dispose of the house which has the seven-day licence.  Can he transfer the seven-day licence to the house where he has the six-day licence, of which he is the lessee and which he intends to purchase?</P>

      <P>This is an amendment which I hope will be more to the Minister's liking.  I do not think it necessary to say a great deal in support of the proposal because members who described what they called Bacchanalian orgies in Dublin on Christmas Eve and possibly at other times and who tell us what happens outside the precincts of public houses at closing time, have to my mind done the job for me.  I must say that I think a great many of these statements have been very much exaggerated, and I should like to point out that, if an enemy of this country got hold of statements like these and splashed them in the New York papers, as the reports of the Casablanca meeting were splashed, it would certainly give an absolutely wrong impression of this country.  I think, therefore, that people should be much more moderate in what they say.  It is possible that two or three people who have taken a little too much drink may give way to a little liveliness or may dance in the street outside public houses.  I must say that I deprecate that type of conduct.  If it be true that there is more drinking than there should be, I feel that this one and a half hours allowed for <i>bona fide</i> traffic after the normal closing time at 10 o'clock in actual fact makes the closing time to which we have agreed midnight because, unless I am entirely wrong, 50 per cent., or perhaps more, of the people who will be sitting in any particular public house at 10 o'clock immediately become <i>bona fide</i> travellers. All they have got to do is to walk out and walk in again, or they have merely to go to another house and represent themselves as living in Dalkey.  Then the whole of the Minister's idea to curtail <Col N="997" /> drinking after hours goes entirely by the board.  I think that the Minister would be very well advised to spend an extra halfpenny on tarring the ship properly and to stand over the proposal, when this Bill goes back to the Dáil, to make drinking illegal from closing time until 6 o'clock in the morning.</P>

      <P>The amendment standing in my name is practically the same as that put forward by Senator The McGillycuddy.  I put it down in that form partly in the hope that I would hear something from the Minister. The Bill, as it stood before the amendment as regards closing hours was made, provided a gap, which will still remain in the country, of one and a half hours.  That is the premises are closed for people residing in the neighbourhood but for an hour and a half afterwards they are open for people who live beyond the requisite distance. That, I think, does not apply in Dublin, because you have not got <i>bona fide</i> traffic in Dublin.  I think that I am correct in saying that.  I cannot see why one and a half hours in the evening should be required to provide for the wants of the <i>bona fide</i> traveller who happens to be in the district.  It seems to me that what the Minister is doing by this one and a half hour period is giving himself trouble in administering the 10.30 p.m. closing.  The reason my amendment differs from that of Senator The McGillycuddy is that, when handing in my amendment, I found that he had one down and, by making half an hour difference, I wanted to find out from the Minister whether or not there was a case for a short period.  I cannot see any case myself but it is possible that there is a case.  Certainly, I cannot see any case for the one and a half hour difference.  I would vote for the amendment of Senator The McGillycuddy in preference to my own amendment because his intention is not to have a period after the ordinary closing hour for serving the <i>bona fide</i> travellers.  Without that period, I think that the law would be more easily administered.</P>

That was my hope in the first instance, but there was no provision on which there was more insistence in the Dáil than this provision for the alleged <i>bona fide.</i>  I believe that this traffic is a farce, but there was nothing on which there was more insistence in the other House than the making of provision for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Some Deputies on both sides of the House stressed the fact that, in and around Dublin, large sums had been expended on public houses, and that the owners would be involved in great loss if this particular trade were abolished.  I believe that that was always an illegal trade, but it could not be so proved.  I do not think that there was much point in that argument, but it weighed with the other House.  The case was also made that, in normal times, people drive long distances through the country, and that it was not unreasonable that they should be able to get a drink up to 12 o'clock.  I tried to resist these proposals, but I did not put the issue to a division.  I am too good a Parliamentarian for that.  I did not want to be beaten on an issue that was not really vital.  The case made for this provision was strongly supported on all sides of the House.  I do not think that any Deputy spoke in support of my argument.  I did my best to hold my ground, but I failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that the case made for people travelling in cars, say, from Galway to Dublin or Dublin to Galway, was reasonable, though I travel from Roscommon to Dublin, sometimes arriving at 2 o'clock in the morning, and the last thing I would think of would be to go into a pub.  When driving a car, I would be nervous about doing that.  Some people, however, think it necessary that these facilities should be given.  In the neighbourhood of Dublin, I think that this trade is simply a farce.  The people who go to these public houses are not genuine travellers.  They go there simply to <Col N="999" /> obtain drink.  There are border-line cases.  In Terenure, public houses must close at 10 o'clock.  When one goes a mile out the road, one finds that the public houses can at present remain open all night.  Even under this Bill, they can keep open until 12 o'clock?</P>

The Seanad has, of course, as much right as the Dáil to back me up. If I had the luck to come here in the first instance, I would have been fortified. Having agreed to a compromise in the other House, I would find it very difficult to recommend something else now.  However, that is not a matter which need concern the Seanad.  I think that a two-hour gap would be too long.  I tried in the other House to have the hour made 11 o'clock but I was beaten.  I tried to get it made 11.30 p.m., but that proposal would not be entertained.  Then we agreed to 12 o'clock.

They travel frequently, late in the evenings, from the home farm to an outlying farm and return to the home farm.  These men are legitimate travellers and they would require some refreshment. Then, there are men who, in the harvesting season, hire out harvesting machinery.  The men operating that <Col N="1000" /> machinery travel from one farmer's place to another about 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock at night.  These men have been working hard all day and are entitled to refreshment.  These may be small cases, but the people concerned constitute a minority who are justly entitled to some refreshment and whose only chance of obtaining such refreshment depends on the public houses being open up to 12 o'clock.  I am not making a case for the people who travel for the sake of getting drink. The case I make is for legitimate travellers.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he was sorry that this Bill did not come to the Seanad in the first instance.  I urged on a Government for a long time, without very much avail, that Bills of a certain type should be introduced in the Seanad.  The Seanad then was differently constituted from the present House, but I think the Minister was quite right in saying&mdash;I do not know whether he was jocose or serious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it was a pity this Bill had not been introduced in the Seanad.  Speaking non-politically, I think it is a great pity that certain types of measures are not introduced in the Seanad instead of in the Dáil, particularly measures of this type on which the lines of division are as between individuals and not political.  If this were done, it would mean that Bills of this kind would get better consideration, than they get in the Dáil, where there is more hurry and where there is sometimes pressure of financial business.  Apart from the fate of this amendment, I am with the Minister in what he said on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned in this case with the <i>bona fide</i> traveller in Dublin <Col N="1001" /> County and the <i>bona fide</i> traveller in the country.  When I had a car, I went around Dublin County frequently, late at night, and the <i>bona fide</i> traffic was a disgrace.  There was no good faith in it at all.  If there are people who have vested interests in the traffic, I have some sympathy with them but their vested interests were acquired at the expense of the legitimate publican inside Dublin City.  While one does not like to see people who have spent money on improvements losing the fruits of that expenditure, there is no case, so far as Dublin County is concerned, for allowing a man to leave a public house at 10 o'clock, travel five miles and get a drink at the end of his journey.  Anybody who has travelled, as I have done, at late hours into Terenure, as the Minister mentioned, or by other routes in County Dublin will, certainly, have come to the conclusion that the fact that you can go the necessary five miles in a motor car in a few minutes means that the whole <i>bona fide</i> business on week nights is nothing but an abuse.</P>
    <P>There is every reason for having the same hours for the <i>bona fide</i> traffic as for the ordinary house in Dublin City. I would recommend the Minister to adopt 11 o'clock as a compromise. After all, he can take his chance&mdash;we can all take our chance&mdash;of what will happen in the Dáil.  With regard to the country, I cannot claim the same acquaintance with it as Senator Goulding.  As regards motorists going from Dublin to Galway, I have done that kind of thing over and over again, and I know that you can always get a drink, if you want one, and a meal in a hotel.</P>

They are very few, I think.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Quirke misunderstands me.  I was thinking of my own experience during the time when cars were plentiful.  I was on the road for political and various other purposes late at night, going here and there, and my experience was that I did not meet so many cars.  I certainly never saw an immense number of cars on the road after 11 or 12 o'clock at night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I happen to have a friend living about four miles from Dublin.  He is a very well-known person, and I have come in from his house at all hours in the morning.  I have frequently remarked the number of cars outside a public house, of people who had gone there for drink. I have seen young people come out of it full of drink, and, without being a pussyfoot or a rabid temperance reformer at all, I want to say that that sort of thing is a disgrace to County Dublin.  Assuming now that motoring will, at some time in the future, revert to its position before the war, I do not know what disadvantage will accrue to people travelling by motor car if they have to adjust themselves to the position that they cannot get a drink after 11 o'clock. They can certainly arrange that, and I think it would be no hardship on them if they cannot get a drink after that hour.  Therefore, I think it would be a very good thing if we were to adopt 11 o'clock, because whatever differences of opinion there were between us with regard to Sunday opening in rural areas, I think there is very little difference between us as to the complete bad faith of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a good deal of what the last speaker has said.  I <Col N="1003" /> would remind him, however, that under legislation introduced by another Minister you must have your car off the streets at a rather early hour in the evening.  Some of us living in the country have to come to Dublin, perhaps three or four times during the year, to see solicitors and attend consultations with prominent barristers. Because of the present law we often find it necessary to leave our cars outside a public house.  I may say that in the case of my own car, it belongs to one who is almost a total abstainer. As I have said, people find it convenient to leave their cars outside a public house where they have an opportunity of meeting people.  I have frequently left a barrister's house at 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, and have then gone to get my car, which I had left locked, in the vicinity of a public house.  One is glad to be able to park his car there, and perhaps to get a drink for your friends.  I do not think that this cheese-paring in legislation and argument about a half hour is a good thing.  People are finding it so difficult to carry on at the present time that any further regulation of their lives will become a real hardship on them.  When people come to Dublin in the circumstances I have described, it is a convenience for them to be able to park their cars in the vicinity of a public house and to be able to get a drink when their work is done.  I think we should be slow to make the proposed change. This cheese-paring in legislation is, in my opinion, an unhappy thing, and we should be slow to do anything that would be calculated to cause further hardships to the people.</P>

      <P>I am familiar with a number of barristers, and if the Senator was consulting them until 2 o'clock in the morning and could not <Col N="1004" /> get a drink, then I am afraid he must have been consulting very strange members of the legal profession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator McGee makes the case worse when he gives as a reason for not being able to get a drink that he was on business.  I suggest to the Minister that, in calculating the number of cars which he and his advisers have seen at a late hour outside public houses in Dublin, he might quite safely deduct from it the number of cars belonging to those visiting barristers' houses since, I am satisfied, the number that will be left will be quite sufficient to prove the Minister's case.  I do not think this is a matter of cheese-paring or of half an hour's convenience.  To me it is a matter of getting the law that we decide on administered.  As far as Dublin City and County are concerned, I believe that the addition of one hour will be quite ample.  If we decide to go beyond that, it will, I believe, be almost impossible to get the law administered. I think 11 o'clock ought to meet the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">

      <P>I agree with Senator McGee that there ought not be any cheese-paring on this matter.  I think that if the hour is fixed at 11 o'clock it may create hardships for people travelling from the country to Dublin. Very often sick patients and others have to be taken to Dublin at a late hour of the night, and the application of the rigid rule in a matter of this kind would be a hardship on those accompanying them.  I would remind the Minister that the number of cars seen parked outside hotels should not be taken as an index of the number of people in the hotel. Very often hotel grounds are used as parking places for cars.  In my view 12 o'clock midnight would not be an unreasonable hour to fix.  Senators should also remember that dog racing is carried on in Dublin City over a great part of the year, and that many <Col N="1005" /> of the patrons of that sport travel long journeys from the country.  Those people are frequently in need of food and refreshments, and facilities should be available to enable them to get both if they need them.</P>

If I did not mention that now it might be said afterwards that I did not tell the Seanad that the demand made in the Dáil was for an 11 o'clock closing for ordinary public houses and 1 o'clock in the morning for the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  These were the demands put forward by many Deputies.  In the end we compromised on a 10.30 closing for the ordinary public houses, and 12 o'clock for the <i>bona fide</i> trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument for an extension to 12 o'clock on behalf of the country traveller is that there is a difference between the countryman's time and the townsman's time.  In the area from which I come, the countryman usually is an hour and a half behind the townsman and 10 o'clock is only 8.30.  When he is finished his work at home, the countryman generally sets out to visit an outlying farm, probably taking back machinery or driving cattle.  That concerns comparatively few people, but they are legitimate travellers who have to walk a considerable distance between two farms and who legitimately require refreshment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Senator Goulding has said.  The Minister said he started out to do away with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, and I am with him in that.  I think the compromise was a good one from that point of view.  One o'clock is not an unreasonable hour, 11 o'clock would only lead to abuses, while 12 o'clock would be eminently suitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be in favour <Col N="1006" /> of closing at 10.30 or, at the very latest, at 11, and cannot see any necessity for a later hour.  I do not agree with Senator Goulding as to the necessity in country districts.  The great majority of legitimate business people are at home at 10.30, or are nearly home then, and the question of refreshment would not arise.  People travelling between one farm and another are generally back at home before nightfall.  Very rarely will you find a farmer&mdash;who is not at a dance or at some amusement&mdash;late at night on the road, and when that happens and he needs intoxicating drink, he can always go where he will get it.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has explained, and as we all understand, the <i>bona fide</i> traffic is 95 per cent. a fraud.  Even though a few legitimate travellers may be affected a few times in their lives by this restriction, there is no reason why we should legislate for them. Closing at 10.30 or 11 would be in the general interest, and the great majority of the people would be in favour of it.</P>

      <P>I know it would be very difficult for the Minister to arrive at a compromise between all the suggestions made.  I know a good deal about rural areas, as I was born in and lived in a rural area.  At that time we had not summer time, and usually 10 or 11 o'clock was very early.  I have now lived in Dublin for a number of years and, from my experience of both city and country, I think 12 o'clock is not unreasonable, and that is the hour the Dáil decided upon.  I understand that that was a compromise, as some Deputies were looking for 1 o'clock.  I may be a person who stays up longer than others, but 12 o'clock is reasonably early to me, and I know very many others in the same position.  It would be a reasonable arrangement for city and country, and we should not endeavour to change the arrangement made by the Dáil.</P>

I am not in agreement with that at all, neither am I with Senator McGee that <Col N="1007" /> it should be 1 o'clock.  Senator Goulding said, by way of argument, that people are changing cattle from one farm to another at 12 o'clock, but if I met anyone doing it at that hour I would take a good look at him.  A good case can be made for farmers who work late at harvest time and then go into town, perhaps to see a barrister, a solicitor or a doctor, or to do some shopping; and 11 o'clock new time would certainly be very early in country districts.  There was a big body of opinion in the Dáil in favour of 1 o'clock and a good deal in favour of 11 o'clock, and I suggest that a compromise might be made by putting it at 11.30, which the Dáil might accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Johnston Mr. Johnston">

      <P>I want to support 11 o'clock&mdash;and earlier, if possible.  I cannot agree with Senator Goulding when he says that people are moving cattle from one farm to another at that time.  They would have to be <i>bona fide</i> travellers and be at least three miles from home, in order to get a drink.  At least 95 per cent. of the traffic after 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock is not that of genuine travellers.  I live in a rural area and know what happens as soon as the public houses close.  If the hours are extended, it will only make matters worse.</P>
      <P>I regret very much that, every time a Licensing Bill is brought in, all sorts of efforts are made to provide greater facilities for drinking and drunkenness, notwithstanding all that happened some 30 or 40 years ago to spread the spirit of temperance and improve the temperance condition of the people.  I hope the Minister and the House will not agree to extend the time beyond 11 o'clock.</P>

      <P>Yes.  There are various arguments being put up and it is very difficult for the House to decide between the two types&mdash;the legitimate and the so-called <i>bona fide</i> traveller.  There is a very definite division.  We want to get rid of the <Col N="1008" /><i>bona fide</i> traffic of a particular kind, but I do not want the Minister or the House to do anything they are not really satisfied about.  I want something on which the Minister can agree, and which he can take back to the Dáil and say: &ldquo;I can stand over this, notwithstanding the compromise which I had to make when this Bill came up first.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have been impressed considerably by the question of summer time in country districts, and am quite ready to accept 11 o'clock, which was Senator Douglas's proposal.  I thought Senator Quirke said 11 o'clock at first and later 11.30.</P>

      <P>If the House would agree, I am prepared to suggest that to the Minister.  Several other points have arisen, like the moonshine stories, one of which Senator Quirke has very ably exposed, in the shape of people going to change their cattle in the middle of the night.  There is one rather important one&mdash;this is more serious.  This is the question of continuous refreshment for a man who is driving a motor car.  I think the Minister for Justice has no doubt in his mind in this particular respect.  He has probably read of a great number of cases where people have transgressed the law as a result of partaking of too much refreshment.  I cannot see any argument for allowing that sort of thing.  Let us say we are living in ordinary times, that there is plenty of petrol and no speed limit.  A man starts out from Dublin with three passengers, all friends, and he finds himself completely exhausted when he reaches Athlone.  They go into a public house and have a round of half-ones, and then they have the other half. Somebody else gets into possession, and finally they have a fourth.  The driver of that car probably had a drink before he started out from Dublin.  He has four more drinks in Athlone, and then he proceeds to drive his car again. That, I think, is a thing which should be cut down as far as possible, and I feel that any extension of hours after closing time helps that kind of thing, <Col N="1009" /> which is a very great danger to the public.  I hope the Minister will give us some idea of what he is prepared to accept in regard to this proposal.</P>

      <P>We have heard the views of Senator Douglas and Senator The McGillycuddy, and also the arguments of Senators McGee, Cummins, Goulding and Byrne.  There is a little problem to be solved, in this sense, that in rural Ireland, in the summer time, midnight is regarded as 10 o'clock, but in the winter months there is quite a different situation.  I think it is quite conceivable that we could reach unanimity and accept the <Col N="1010" /> present proposal of 12 o'clock during the summer months, taking Senator Douglas's hour for the remaining period of the year.  There is no doubt that there are not so many travellers out through the country between October and February.  I think it is accepted that travellers prefer train journeys in the winter season.  In the months when we have frost, snow and storms they prefer to travel by train rather than by motor car.  But from the spring onwards until mid-harvest the position is quite different.  There are more travellers on the main roads during that period.  I think we must take cognisance of that, and the position might possibly be met by accepting the Bill as it is for the summer months and accepting the earlier hour of 11 o'clock for the winter period.</P>

In my opinion, 12 o'clock is an adequate hour to abolish these abuses.  Mention has been made of barristers and others going out to see people.  No reference has been made to healthy sorts of amusement&mdash;other than interviewing barristers.  There are periods in the country districts when threshing is carried out.  There is useful entertainment in connection with that work; people may like to go down there, and an opportunity ought to be given them to have a drink if they require one.  I think we are trying to press the matter too far when we talk about 10.30, 11 or 11.30.  There is a clear-cut hour in the Bill, an hour that will be effective in doing away with a grave abuse such as we know exists in and around the City of Dublin, and I think we ought to leave it at that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 15 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, the holder of a six-day licence may apply at any annual licensing District Court, that in lieu of a certificate for the renewal of the six-day licence there be granted to him in respect of the said premises a certificate <Col N="1013" /> for a seven-day licence and the justice of the District Court, if he is satisfied that a certificate for the renewal of the six-day licence might have been granted, may, if he so thinks fit, grant to such applicant the certificate so applied for.</P>
    <P>This question was raised in the other House.  I do not know what the Minister has to say about it now, but a peculiar situation exists in towns all over the country, where there are six-day licences and side by side with them seven-day licences.  There is a case to be made for giving the owner of a six-day licence the opportunity to be put on the same level with the licensee next door, on the consideration that he pays the duty which the other man pays.  I do not think this proposal would make for any more drinking, but should do away with a certain amount of illicit drinking that goes on.  Obviously, if a man has a client for six days of the week, and on Sundays cannot open, when many people are travelling on buses or to football matches, there is the temptation to carry on a traffic that is not within the law.  The owner of such premises should not be tempted.  I do not know the history of, or the differentiation between the two types of licensed premises but the position is anomalous.  I believe that the owner of a six-day licence ought to be given the opportunity to obtain a seven-day licence.  A situation has been permitted to develop whereby a seven-day licence can be purchased by the owner of a six-day licence and he can have it transferred to other premises.  Six-day licensed houses are well conducted. I do not know how many of them there are.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the change would make for more drinking. It would certainly make for better observance of the law.  If a licensee wants to secure a seven-day licence I think he should be given the opportunity to do so provided his premises were conducted in such a way as would justify the court in giving it.  I urge <Col N="1014" /> the Minister to give the amendment sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar amendment was moved in the other House and I could not see my way to accept it. The position about these houses is that at first it was a voluntary act on the part of the owners.  They could have opted for seven-day licences or six-day licences.  Since the Act of 1902, no new licences could be issued.  There were so many licences in the country that it was laid down in that Act that no more new licences should be granted. The effect of this amendment would be to increase the number of seven-day licences.  There is another aspect to this question.  In the course of time I am sure that these houses have changed hands, and it is only right that those who paid higher prices for seven-day licences should not have the value of their premises depreciated by bringing in people who paid much lower prices for six-day licences.  That is only fair and equitable.  If people with six-day licences are particularly anxious they can buy a seven-day licence, which can be transferred.  That is provided for and made easier by the Bill.  I think that is good enough.  I would not be prepared to increase the number of seven-day licences.  The movement should be in the other direction. That is the view of the trade. Those engaged in it would be anxious to have less licensed houses, the idea being that there would be a better living for those in it and that it would be better for the conduct of the trade.</P>
      <P>The result of this amendment would be to give these houses an enhanced value to which they are not entitled, and consequently to depreciate the value of neighbouring premises.  That would not be fair.  These are the principal reasons why I object to the amendment, as well as the fact that it would increase the number of licensed houses, which is not desirable.  The movement should be in the other direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that it is obviously a very expensive undertaking for the owners of six-day licences, how- <Col N="1015" /> ever suitable their premises, to do as suggested.  Some of these are very fine buildings but to get a seven-day licence for them would mean considerable expenditure and would be out of all proportion to what the owners of seven-day licences had spent.  In my view there would not be any more intoxicating liquor consumed.  I do not know how many people would opt to have a seven-day as against a six-day licence or how the valuation would be affected. The major points are that there would not be more liquor consumed and that it would remove temptation towards breaches of the law, which is undesirable. I am satisfied that the Minister should do something about this matter.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Senator Baxter has overlooked a very important point in connection with his proposal. There are 1,758 of these houses&mdash; I did not think the number was so large&mdash;as compared with 12,000 altogether. If the amendment were accepted, the whole position of the licensed trade would be upset and the value of 12,000 houses seriously affected. I understand Senator Baxter's point. He has one or two houses in mind.  When he was speaking, I thought the number of these houses was much smaller, and that there was a case for the amendment.  His plea is that there is temptation for six-day houses to be on a level with seven-day houses, but there is the equal temptation of people with no licences to trade. In view of the number of licensed houses, I suggest that the amendment should be withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 18 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 61 of the Act of 1927 is hereby amended by the addition at <Col N="1016" /> the end of sub-section (1) of the following words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or a person who is carrying on the business of grocer in premises the Poor Law Valuation of which, if situate in a county borough or the Borough of Dun Laoghaire is not less than £50 and, if situate elsewhere, is not less than £30: Provided that such person produce to the Revenue Commissioners a statement in writing from the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána for the district in which the premises in respect of which the application is made are situate that he has no objection to the granting of such new licence, transfer or renewal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment which I move is to enable reputable members of the grocery trade to supply their customers, when ordering their weekly supplies, with a bottle of wine and thus save them from having recourse to the public house.  Under the 1927 Act, the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, in an endeavour to combat the evil of the wine shop in the back streets of Dublin, abolished the wine retailer's off-licence, save in respect of chemists' and druggists' establishments.  It was, I think, overlooked at the time that a number of these wine licences were held by reputable traders engaged in the grocery business in a substantial way, against whom no complaint had ever been made.  These traders found themselves unable to supply their customers with a bottle of wine for consumption with their meals.  That position still remains and, it is, I think, unjustifiable, particularly as many English multiple houses in competition with local concerns hold off-licences for the sale of spirits generally&mdash;licences which cannot now be obtained.</P>
    <P>I have provided in my amendment all the safeguards I could think of.  I have ensured that the premises must be of substantial valuation, and I have been unreasonably reasonable in providing that the Gárda superintendent must consent before any licence is granted. The last word, therefore, as to the licence remains with the Minister.  The amendment is designed to relieve a <Col N="1017" /> hardship and should be acceptable to the Minister and to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment.  The position is that there are far too many retailers of intoxicating liquors and the business is overcrowded.  Furthermore it would be very difficult to confine it to establishments of, say, £30 or £50 valuation.  It would be very hard to do it in equity.  I also understand that to get a clear definition of a grocer is not too easy.  I believe that if you sell certain things like tea and coffee, or two or three things of that kind, you could come under the definition of grocer.  It would mean a great extension of the number of houses that are allowed to sell wine.  That is the principal reason I object to it.  Outside those who have a spirit grocer's off-licence, I think only chemists can sell wine.</P>

Besides that, it would be difficult to stand over a limitation of valuation, as is suggested here.  For these reasons I am sorry I cannot agree to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of this particular part of the Bill is that it was originally intended that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should bring in a Bill in connection with this matter.  They tried to get my Department to do it and I objected.  I said that I would have nothing to do with a licensing Bill because I foresaw what has happened in connection with this Bill.  It was proposed in the beginning that the Department of Industry and Commerce should bring in a Bill dealing with the licensing of aerodromes.  That is how the Minister for Industry and Commerce came into it first.  The idea was that he was to nominate a suitable person to take charge of the sale of intoxicating liquor in aerodromes and on aircraft.</P>
      <P>I believe the reason the court was left out of it was that it was thought very unlikely indeed that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would nominate a person whom the court would turn down or, if it went before the court, that the court would find great difficulty in turning down a person nominated by the Minister.  Therefore it was not considered necessary to do that.  That was the only reason.  I took that over from that Department when it was decided to introduce this Bill.  I was asked if I would agree to include it in this Bill, and I did so. That was the reason why the Minister for Industry and Commerce came into it at all.  I think there is not much in the point.  There is no authority being taken from the Minister for Justice, because, as Senator Douglas points out, the court grants the licence, and any Minister who nominates a person is unlikely to nominate a person who would not get a licence from the court. As to whether that is legitimate or not, I think it is.  I am sure the court would have no hesitation in giving a licence to a person nominated by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the question of renewal also arise?  We will assume the infallibility of a particular Minister for the purpose of choosing the holder of a licence, which is rather a large assumption to my mind, though the Minister for Justice seems to <Col N="1019" /> assume it.  But, assuming that, he will not go so far as to assume that, because the person is nominated by the Minister, he cannot, possibly, misbehave himself.  Even if you take the Minister's infallibility, you will hardly claim that his nominee will be infallible.  I do not think there is any difficulty arising in connection with an aerodrome.  I certainly do not see why the police in the particular district should not have the same powers of supervision.  I do not see why the court, at any rate so far as renewal is concerned, should not decide on the evidence of the police in the same way as with any other licence.  I am not alarmed; I do not think there will be abuse.  It is not a question of attacking any Minister.  I do not know what Minister will do it.  It is not as though there would be a difficulty.  The court will not refuse the licence.  I think the police should have an interest in it. If it must be a Minister, then it should be the Minister to who the police are responsible; it should be the Minister for Justice.  I think it should be a licence obtained in the ordinary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that that would be a question for the Minister for Finance rather than for me.  However, there is this much to be said: that any appointment of that kind that the Minister for Industry and Commerce might make could be questioned in the Dáil.  In other words, the Minister is directly answerable to the Dáil, and if he makes a wrong appointment&mdash;one that is objected to&mdash;the question can be raised in the Dáil, whereas, in the case of other licences, it cannot be <Col N="1020" /> raised there.  Personally, I may say, that I did not give much attention to this particular section.  I accepted it, almost, as it was drafted, because I did not think that there was any likelihood of abuse, but I can certainly say that there was no sinister motive behind it.  As I have pointed out already, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is open to public criticism in the Dáil, if he makes a wrong appointment, and I think he would be as good a judge in the matter of appointing the proper person for such a position as a district justice would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the two sections here really go together, and the point is that they completely cut out the courts in this matter, and, therefore, so far as the public are concerned, cut out the police, which, perhaps, is a more important matter. In the case of an ordinary licence, an application is made, and the police give evidence in public as to the character, and so on, of the applicant, and then the district justice decides on the merits of the case.  With regard to the last point that was made by the Minister, I think it is a very objectionable thing that the Dáil should be compelled to pass judgment on an appointment made by a Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think it should rather be the Courts.  I realise that there is nothing sinister behind this particular section, but there is, undoubtedly, this tendency all over the world with regard to giving powers to Ministers, and I suggest that that is what is behind this.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is particularly interested in aerial traffic.  He is going to control it, and he is given powers in connection with catering or drinking at aerodromes or on aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, these sections which we are now discussing are part of a general tendency to pick up power for the Minister concerned, and, if you like, for his officials, as against the courts.  I do not suggest that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce has a Fianna Fáil caterer up his sleeve for this appointment. Maybe he has, but I am not saying that <Col N="1021" /> he has, and in any case I think it is much better that the Minister for Justice should be in the position of being able to get up in the Dáil and say: &ldquo;There is no use in asking me why Patrick Murphy was refused a licence; I have nothing to do with that; it is a matter for the district justice; so do not talk to me about it.&rdquo; I think it would be far better for the Minister to be in that position than to put him in the position of having to answer a question in the Dáil as to why he refused to give a licence to Patrick Murphy and gave it to Michael Hayes.</P>
    <P>For instance, with regard to the transfer of licences, it says here, in Section 26, that the Minister may transfer a licence to a particular person, who appears to him to be a fit and proper person to hold such a licence, on the death of the former holder of the licence, or &ldquo;for any other reason&rdquo;.  These are the words, &ldquo;for any other reason&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, of course, the argument is constantly being brought forward that such powers, having been given to Ministers, will not be abused by them or their officials, or will not be unreasonably used.  But there is always that proviso put in: &ldquo;for any other reason&rdquo;, and between the Minister concerned, the draftsman, and so on, the whole idea is to make the thing watertight, so that, if any question should come up afterwards, it can be said: &ldquo;Well, here in the Act it says: &lsquo;or for any other reason&rsquo;.&rdquo;  I do not think it is fair to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce this power. As I have said, it is part of a general tendency, which we discussed here formerly in connection with an education Bill, and I think it is bad.  While one may not think that everything is perfect so far as the procedure of the courts is concerned, I think it would be a really better thing that the courts and the police, publicly, and the Minister for Justice, should have control over this thing.  I think that the fact that another Minister should be given the power of making such appointments, and be afterwards subject to criticism in the Dáil, is a bad thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Hayes, I am quite convinced that there was no ulterior or sinister motive behind this section, but I must protest that it is not the duty, under any circumstances, of a Minister for Industry and Commerce to take any part in deciding as to who shall or shall not be given a licence for the sale of liquor.  For instance, I am sure that the Minister for Justice would not agree, for one moment, to grant to the Minister for Industry and Commerce the power to give or withhold a licence for the sale of liquor in connection with a railway station, a shipping port, a racecourse, or even a fair-green.  Then, why should it be so in the case of an aerodrome? I think the Minister would be well advised to redraft this section before the Report Stage, and to retain to himself and the courts the privilege and responsibility of deciding who shall or shall not be granted a licence to cater at an aerodrome.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has certain obligations and certain powers as regards aerodromes. He is responsible for the proper administration of these aerodromes, and he is responsible for aerial navigation, and so on and so forth, but I think it would be very inadvisable for this House to agree for one moment to add to that Minister's responsibility and give him the responsibility and the right to nominate&mdash;because that is, virtually, what it amounts to&mdash;who should be the licensed caterer for an aerodrome or on aircraft.  I think that it is really a very serious matter&mdash;much more serious than it actually appears in the Bill&mdash;and I again suggest for the Minister's consideration that he himself would probably object strenuously if the Minister for Industry and Commerce were to interfere with his rights or the rights of the court in deciding who are to be the caterers at a railway station or a shipping port.  I do not see why any exception should be made in the case of aerodromes or aircraft, even though aerial travel in this country happens to be in its initial stages.  I do not see why any change in the existing procedure should be made in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who has control of the aerodrome is the Minister, and when it would come to a question of appointing a caterer, I am sure the ordinary machinery for such appointments would be used&mdash;advertisements in the papers, open competition, and so on.  At least, I imagine that is how it would be done.  Just as in the case of the appointment of the controller of the aerodrome, the managing director, or the secretary, which, I take it, is done by means of a selection board or something like that, I am sure that the same process would take place in the case of the caterer.  Accordingly, I think it is scarcely necessary to say that if the Minister, being a Minister of State, selected a particular person or firm to be the caterer, the court would hardly turn him down, and I do not think it should be necessary for the court to have a sort of veto on the Minister's selection, because that is what it would amount to.  I think that if Senators were to look on the matter from that point of view, they would find that the section is not so bad. Of course, if the Minister were to pick a man out of, let us say, a Fianna Fáil Cumann, and appoint him, I agree that that would be very bad, but as I have pointed out, there is a well-established way of dealing with such appointments &mdash;through public advertisements, open competition, and so on.  I imagine that is the way it will be.  He will say: &ldquo;I nominate this person.&rdquo;  Is it conceivable that the district justice will turn down a man nominated by the Minister, or is it desirable that he should be in a position to do so?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the person he nominates.  In other words, the whole modern tendency is to have the Government all-powerful.  You cannot turn on your heel now without permission from some Minister for something. That is more and more the tendency. The whole structure upon which this democratic system is built is that there should be a Parliament to make the laws, a Government to administer them, and courts to see that they are carried out, and that the courts should have superior power to the Government within certain limits.  The Minister is speaking the common language of Ministers, Irish, English and every other kind.  Fianna Fáil Ministers, possibly Fine Gael Ministers and every other kind of Minister, all speak the same language.  They all say: &ldquo;I am going to do it.  Surely you do not think I will nominate the wrong kind of person?  Surely you would not give the district justice any power over my nomination?&rdquo; That is the tendency, and I want to put myself on record as thinking that it is the wrong tendency.</P>
      <P>The railway stations are private property. The railway company nominates a particular caterer.  I presume the police have power to see that the rules are properly kept.  But if the aerodromes are going to be Government property, that puts the Minister in the position of the railway company, and the Minister may make the nomination.  Even there, I do not see why they would not follow the same procedure as the other private business.  Let us eliminate the Minister for the moment.  Let us assume that Patrick Murphy is selected. Patrick Murphy is selected by civil servants, and the Civil Service does not want to submit itself to the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with Senator Hayes, and while I have again and again expressed on the general question views similar to his, I think there is more in this than he says. There is a certain basis upon which a licence can be renewed and upon which it is withheld.  It is withheld largely, if withheld at all, on the evidence of the police, which is given to an independent authority, namely the justice.  The Minister has just said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Can anybody imagine a district justice not renewing a licence on the request of the secretary to the railway company?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly I have more imagination than the Minister, because I have no difficulty at all in imagining it if the police give evidence to the effect that the place is not properly conducted.  I do not think he would hesitate for one moment.  If anything should arise in connection with an aerodrome&mdash;while it is not probable, it is certainly not impossible&mdash;I think the proper way to consider the renewal of that licence is just the same way.  I do not think it is the business of the Minister or his civil servants.  I do not think he is the best person to judge, when it is a matter of police evidence.  If it must be done by a Minister, I think it should be the Minister for Justice, but I do not see the slightest reason why the administration of the law and the renewal of the licence should not be just the same in the case of an aerodrome. However, if the Government wants to do it this way, they have their <Col N="1026" /> majority, and no doubt they can carry it, but I am glad we did not let this pass without drawing attention to it. I would ask the Minister to look into the matter between this and the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is desirable that the Minister should act in a matter like this.  In a way it is rather a trifling matter, but the prestige of the Minister, the prestige of the State as a whole, and our capacity to administer our affairs in a decent and respectable way which will command the confidence of the people, hinge on small things which Ministers have power to do.  In fact, our people can see small faults when they are not able to see great achievements.  I do not know what process the Minister or his advisers will employ to see that they select the best person as caterer in an aerodrome.  In any case, the Minister will be in the position of taking one out of a number of individuals and giving him certain privileges which he will enjoy for the purposes of private profit.  That is a difficult decision to make, and it may sometimes turn out that your judgment and your decision were not very good.  You may discover afterwards that the person selected is an individual whom it is not easy to get to conform to the law.  Even the police have difficulty in dealing with an individual like that who has been appointed by the Minister.  They are perhaps reluctant to have the law applied with the same force and correctness as would be employed if the man had obtained his privileges through the ordinary process of an application through the courts.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to consider this matter between now and the Report Stage.  I do not think that decisions like this should be left wholly and entirely with the Minister. They are a bother and annoyance to him; I do not think he should be troubled with those trifling decisions. The Minister's own prestige should not have to stand or fall on the kind of selection he will make in a case like this.  It is difficult for a Minister to decide what particular individual he <Col N="1027" /> will select from a number of others, giving him privileges which he will enjoy for the purposes of private profit, and it is difficult to convince the public that the decision was made by the Minister on its merits.  I think this is the sort of decision which the Minister should not have to make; some other way should be found.  I suggest that the Minister should look into the matter between this and the next stage with a view to seeing what amendment can be suggested.</P>

As the section stands, have we any guarantee that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is going to take evidence from the police before the courts as to the character of the licensee, and so on?  Personally I see no sinister motive in it.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he is a sensible man, would probably go straight away to the police in the case of each applicant but, on the other hand, we have no guarantee that he will do that.  I would suggest seriously to the Minister that it would be far better that the old rule should hold and that the licensee should be appointed on application to the courts, with the ordinary formalities of evidence by the police as to his suitability, and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5 (a), as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), after paragraph (c), to add a new paragraph (d) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) the employment of a child temporarily in such occupations and at such periods or times as may be prescribed by the Minister in Regulations to be made under this Act.</P>
      <P>I addressed myself at some length to this defect in the Bill on Second Reading. I do not know whether or not it is necessary for me to go over the whole of that argument again.  The Seanad will observe that the sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> In addition to any other statutory prohibition of or statutory restriction on the employment of children, no person shall have in his employment any child who has not attained the age of fourteen years.</P>
    <P>I know that this sub-section was debated in the other House and I know that the Minister's original draft was different from the text which we have now before us.  I am of opinion that the consequences of trying to operate this sub-section could not have been fully adverted to by the Dáil or it would not have permitted the Bill to come to us in the form in which it has reached us.  I do not want to be understood, nor do I want those who agree with me to be understood, as standing for a condition of things which will make it possible for children to be put into employment at an early age and deprived of the opportunities of suitable education.  But if we do not stand for one extreme, we should not permit another extreme to be forced upon us.  For the Oireachtas to put through a measure, which must be operated when it becomes law, in which it is stated that no person shall have in his employment a child who has not attained the age of 14 years is absurd.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with conditions in rural Ireland.  I am not pretending to speak for urban or municipal areas or, indeed, for the type of employment that might be described as industrial. I am not thinking, either, of conditions in which parents might seek to release their children from school at an earlier age than 14, so that they might go into employment of a permanent character even in rural Ireland.  Children are absent from school, because the schools are closed, for about six weeks in the summer months and for a few weeks at Christmas and at Easter. What I want to secure is that I, and people like me, will not be breaking the law if we take into our employment during the holiday season children who had been attending school and who are competent to do work of a certain character on a farm.  I want to be able to exercise the liberty of taking into my employment my neighbour's children, <Col N="1032" /> or other people's children, at a time when their labour may be of value to me and when they are not attending school because the school is closed. The Minister may say that I may be free to do that during the holiday season and will not be prosecuted if I take in boys to drop potatoes in the spring time or to help in the hay or cornfield in July or August.  He may say that no sensible Guard would attempt to prosecute me for doing that. But my attitude is that I do not want to give power to the State, or to any authority here, to pursue me and make me feel that in some way or other I am breaking the law if I take children into my employment&mdash;children who, ordinarily, are attending school and are under the age of 14 years.</P>
    <P>When the original Act was going through, it was recognised that in the rural districts there were periods in the year when children could be of value, and it was permissive to close schools so that parents might have the services of their children during those periods.  The fact was recognised that children could be of use.  Farmers understand quite well that there are all sorts of jobs on the land and around the farm yard which boys of from the ages of 10 to 13 can do quite well. These are difficult days when we ought to be able to have the services of everybody in their off-time.  This is a section which we cannot permit to pass in its present form.  I think it is foolish and stupid if I am to be put in the position that the children of my labourer, who lives on the edge of my farm, cannot go into my fields to drop potatoes during the Easter holiday period, when there is no school, and earn something for themselves by doing a day's work or a week's work, simply because we put a section like this into the Act.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any great necessity to argue this at length. I may, perhaps, be told by some people here that the children will be at work early enough, that many of them may have to go to work when they reach the age of 14, and that they ought not be put in the position of having to look for work for payment earlier than that age.  The thing that is most essential for boys or girls who are attending a <Col N="1033" /> national school and will have to make their way in the world on the education they are receiving there is good physique and healthy bodies, with a facility to tackle whatever job may be given them to do.  In my view, the training of boys and girls should begin in time.  If it is, you can inculcate in them a spirit of industry, of tidiness and efficiency.  The correct way of doing a job will become easy and natural to them.  If you want to make good men and women of them, start them at an early age to do work of a physical character that is not beyond their strength.  There is, therefore, every argument in favour of altering this section so that young people may be employed during periods in their school life when they are not compelled to attend school.</P>
    <P>I think that what I am asking in the amendment is reasonable, and I would expect that the Minister would have no difficulty in framing regulations to meet the case which I am making.  I feel it is essential that that should be done.  Nobody who understands children, and the difficulties that are going to confront those who will have to live by the vigour of their bodies, could possibly support the section in its present form.  In my opinion, the section imposes a definite handicap on children if they are to be restricted from taking up employment of a physical character before the age of 14.  I hope the House will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better explain my attitude to this amendment.  As a Senator has said, the original proposals put before the Dáil were such as to enable the Minister to regulate the employment of children between the ages of 12 and 14, to restrict it in certain ways and to prohibit it completely below the age of 12.  All Parties in the House, so far as I could see, felt that any employment that might be considered necessary to be carried out by young people could just as easily be carried out by children above the school-leaving age of 14 as by children below it.  It was strongly urged, so far as the City of Dublin was concerned, that the Minister for Education in particular <Col N="1034" /> should not allow himself to be put into the position of allowing children, who should be at school, to be taken into employment when, in fact, there were thousands of young people above 14&mdash; let us say, between 14 and 16&mdash;who could be equally employed and to whom would apply all the arguments which applied to the usefulness of giving young people a training in a certain type of work.  Therefore, in view of the volume of opinion on all sides of the House, I felt that I would not be justified in refusing to accept the unanimous demand, and I introduced an amendment to prohibit the employment of children under 14.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;employment&rdquo;, according to the Principal Act, in relation to a child, means &ldquo;employment and occupation in any labour exercised by way of trade or for the purpose of gain to the child or to any other person&rdquo;. Unless it is for the purpose of gain or by way of trade, work by children may not come under the definition of employment. I do not think that there is a great deal of employment&mdash;in the sense of employment for gain, at any rate&mdash;by farmers of children of school-going age, even at the busy season.  If there is demand for additional facilities, if we should be hard pressed for labour or if climatic conditions should be unfavourable, I can always, under the Emergency Powers Act, grant additional powers where necessary.  I have actually&mdash;although it is no longer the law&mdash;given the extra periods which were given to farmers in the spring and harvest time, and I still have that power.  I do not think that any general exemption, even on grounds of agricultural need, ought to be included in the legislation dealing with school attendance.  I feel that such a situation as we have now can be dealt with by the Minister exercising his powers under the emergency legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, there is a very strong feeling, in the City of Dublin in particular, that youngsters of school-going age ought not be employed while there are others above the age of 14 available, and the case was not made against that.  There was no case made, as far as I could see, to show <Col N="1035" /> that it was necessary that those children should be available to farmers at special times of the year.  It can be argued&mdash;and, I think, rightly&mdash;that poor children who have little advantage, in the world which faces them, beyond their education, require all the education they can receive, and that at night time they should be given opportunities to do their home work. Goodness knows, their life at school is scarcely sufficiently long to enable them to get that minimum about which we had so much discussion.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is the duty of the Minister for Education to make exceptions.  In any case, if Senator Baxter wished to make an exception of the holiday period, I suggest that he might have included that in his amendment.  As it now stands, his amendment would simply put the position back where it was under the Principal Act, under which the Minister was empowered to make regulations, governing the various occupations, restricting the employment of children.  Such regulations were never made and, in spite of the fact that my original proposals in the Dáil seem to point to the Minister taking those responsibilities on himself again in a certain measure, I think the House will agree with me that I have not the machinery to make inquiries to enable me to schedule occupations which may be deemed to be legitimate for school children, even if I were satisfied that their employment therein did not interfere in any way with the child's attendance at school or the advantages he might receive therefrom.  The Senator has put in an omnibus clause, in which he proposes to put on me the duty of making regulations; and if I do not choose to make these regulations, nothing happens.  If I do choose to make them, I shall require a large staff to enable me to carry out the necessary inquiries, hear evidence, and so on; and I doubt very much if it is worth it.</P>
    <P>If the broad basis of the principle that we should not have children under 14 employed for gain is accepted, but if it is thought that there should be special exceptions in particular <Col N="1036" /> cases, then Senators ought to indicate specifically the exceptions they have in mind, so that we would have an idea as to whether there is a case or not.  As I have said, the Senator has not covered the particular point.</P>
    <P>I can see there is a point&mdash;and I shall have it looked into&mdash;as regards the holiday period; but even in the holiday period.  I do not think we could agree that children could be employed in the same way, let us say, as adults or for the same type of labour.  Even for the holiday period, the type of labour at which children should be occupied should be more in the nature of recreation and physical exercise than any imposition on their bodily strength or any attempt to make them carry out work which should properly be done by adults.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not suggested in Senator Baxter's amendment.  The amendment itself is not quite satisfactory and was put down largely to see whether the Minister could suggest a satisfactory scheme himself.  I think this House is in agreement with the other House that, in the City of Dublin and such like areas, children under 14 should not be employed at all.  The Minister asked for specific cases.  We must all give cases from our own experience. Senator Baxter suggested certain times of the year when children are employed and when the schools are specially closed to allow them to be employed in the country.  Apart from that, there is casual employment at week-ends, of children under 14, as golf caddies.  They get a certain amount of money; it does not do them any harm, and it does not interfere in any way with their education or the doing of their home work.  This work&mdash;if it is <Col N="1037" /> work&mdash;is done entirely in the open air. The Minister recognises the case in the country where youngsters make a certain amount in that way.  When this Bill becomes an Act, it will be open to the police to prevent that.  It is a small point, but one of some importance.</P>
      <P>The only other point coming under my notice was one last summer where a youngster of 13 was delivering milk, morning and evening, at the house where I was staying.  His father was a labourer on the farm from which the milk came, and that milk was delivered by the boy to half a dozen houses morning and evening.  When this Bill becomes an Act, that will not be possible. It is possible that, in the administration of the law, that could be settled. There are some small cases like that which might make some difference.</P>
      <P>In regard to children under 14, I agree entirely that there should be no such thing as regular employment, and in Dublin no such thing as partial employment; but in the country I do not see that there is any objection, even from the point of view of the training of the children, to certain types of work being done at certain times of the year.  I do not mean the type of work, as the Minister said, which should be done by adults and which imposes any strain, but certain types of work which would do the children no harm, which would be of some value and which is not normally done by adults at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the difficulty the Minister envisages, that this amendment gives him power to do something and that he has not the machinery to make the investigation.  On the other hand, the Minister is the preferable Minister, because he does take into consideration the education of the children, and he would object to their being employed in any way which might interfere with their education.  I take it that Senator Baxter has in mind that no employment should be allowed for children which would interfere with their education at school or out of school.  It would be difficult, I think, to insert in the Bill particular types of employment. The only remedy is to give the Minister power to make such exceptions as experience might dictate; they might not be very many.  The police <Col N="1038" /> would hesitate to take action in regard to certain things.  It is merely a question of agreement where there is difficulty in getting certain machinery into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points that are not clear to me.  In the first place, I do not believe that, through the county generally, where farmers co-operate in harvesting and other work, the children of one farmer are employed by the neighbour.  I imagine they are not employed in that sense but that they come in as helpers.  If the position is that they are employed for gain, I should like to know of cases where that takes place.  I do not think we should make an exception. If the position in the rural areas is that children do assist and there is no question of money payment, then there is no need to make an exception.</P>
      <P>The second point concerns children from the City of Dublin.  They go to farms, say, in North County Dublin, to assist, and there is a strong feeling, which Senator Hayes has again emphasised, that there should be no exception so far as city children are concerned.  I do not see how one could make an exception in respect of children in Cavan or some other area and exclude children from, let us say, the outskirts of the City of Dublin, who may, in fact, be more urgently needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with a good deal of what the Minister and Senator Hayes said, I cannot see that there is any great comparison between city children and the children of agricultural workers and farmers.  The Minister asked were the children of the agricultural workers employed and getting remuneration.  I should like to give him a specific instance.  I am not very anxious to employ youngsters, but I have a number of workmen, and those workmen make special arrangements for the employment of their youngsters during holiday time, thinning turnips and doing other light work.  I know that if these youngsters did not get paid there would be a riot. The youngsters are delighted to get their payment after being employed for three or four days, perhaps for a week or perhaps for a fortnight.  I am in <Col N="1039" /> thorough agreement that youngsters in the towns under 14 years should not be employed, but it is quite a different matter in the country.  If I did not allow the children of my agricultural workers to thin turnips, there would be great dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, I think it is good training for the children of agricultural workers and I believe they should be allowed to work on the land during holiday time even though they are only 11, 12, 13 or 14 years.  I do not think that Senator Baxter wants them to be employed at any other period except during the holiday period.  I think the Minister should agree to frame an amendment to meet the case.  It is a general practice all over the country so far as I know, not alone in County Dublin, but in most other counties, for youngsters to work on the land during school holidays.  I think it is a reasonable request and the Minister should allow that practice to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first saw the amendment I put a note on my copy of the Bill.  The insertion of the word would make the section read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In addition to any other statutory prohibition of or statutory restriction on the employment of children, no person shall have in his employment permanently any child who has not attained the age of 14 years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put down this note for my own use: &ldquo;...save during the school holiday period&rdquo;.  I felt that that would secure the object more satisfactorily than would the insertion of the word &ldquo;permanently&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> With regard to the employment of children in the country, there is nothing in this Bill to prevent any child working with his parent or guardian or any other definition of relative. That widens the scope very much, but, beyond that, there is always the system of what is called &ldquo;coring&rdquo; during the saving of the harvest, particularly at threshing time and at the digging and putting-in of potatoes. In the same connection the term &ldquo;meitheal&rdquo; is also used.  It means a system of co-operation.  A farmer and his boy, even if the boy were under 14 years, would, let us say, go to Senator Baxter's place to do his work to-day and, in a few days' time, Senator Baxter and his boy would proceed to do that farmer's work.  That was the system that I saw in operation and I thought it was a very good system, especially during the school holiday period.  I think there should be no difficulty in children co-operating with a neighbour's children in doing light work on the farm.</P>
    <P>So far as the amendment is concerned, we have had repeatedly in this House objections raised to legislation by Order, and surely the people who have raised these objections should object more strenuously to legislation by regulation&mdash;to the Minister issuing regulations.  I have found from experience that the regulations made under an Act are far more embracing than the Act itself&mdash;they contain much more than is embodied in the Act. These regulations are published, but they are seldom questioned and sometimes the law entailed in the regulations is far more extensive than what is contained in the Act.  We are suggesting here&mdash;and this is the point that has been so much opposed by Senators &mdash;that we should give the Minister power by regulation.  These regulations become the law unless they are, within a certain period, annulled by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The point I am putting to the House is that if we do require an alteration it would be far better to have it embodied in the legislation rather than to empower the Minister to make regulations. Apart from the suggestion I <Col N="1041" /> have made, I can see an objection from the point of view of the Labour people.  If a child under 14 years is required to work outside his own farm, the Labour people could say: &ldquo;Why not employ a child over 14 years of age?&rdquo; There is a lot to be said for that, but to get over that difficulty, I suggest the insertion of the simple phrase &ldquo;save during the school holiday period.&rdquo;  These school holiday periods have been lengthened by the exercise of special powers of the Minister. Schools have been closed to facilitate harvesting and other agricultural work, presumably in order to facilitate farmers in getting the help of their own children.  This question of helping other people does not come within the ambit of the Bill and if we simply insert a phrase which will allow them, during the school holidays, to help their neighbours, it would cover it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire the spirit of reasonableness in which Senator Baxter's suggestion has been met, but my experience is that, in my own parish, 200 children are employed during the summer period for a great deal of time.  The period for which they are employed varies of course according to the crops, but where you have intensive production of potatoes, beet and other root crops, you will have very considerable continued employment for children and I think it would be deplorable if that were stopped.  In our areas they are not as they are in Dublin.  You will not find one unemployed man in certain areas in my district at almost any time and most certainly in the summer you will not find an unemployed boy.</P>

      <P>I know of a case of a donkey and cart being purchased at auction in order to convey three children, aged from 12 to 15 years, to their work.  They cooked their meal in a house adjacent to their place of employment. That system is extensive and is a tremendous gain to the labourers.  In fact, where you have 20 <Col N="1042" /> labourers constantly employed and coming a considerable distance, they will claim that before you employ anybody living near you, you should give a preference to the children of those who work constantly with you.  I had that experience this year on my own holding and it applies all over Louth. The children work constantly at potatoes and beet.  I do not say that takes place during the entire period&mdash;it could not possibly take place during the entire school going period.  The managers are very anxious that their parishioners should be employed at this work.  They appreciate it and there is considerable vying amongst farmers for the services of the children for work in 22 inch drills&mdash;and I think that some of my colleagues growing beet are getting down to drills lower than 22 inches.  I am afraid that Senator Cummins or I would not have much chance of getting into such drills.  It is nice work and does them no harm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will be delighted to know that I would not be so keen on farming were it not for the fact that my job was given to me at ten years of age during my holidays.  It may have damped my brain and I may not have got on as well in the world as if I were in a job like Senator O'Donovan and others, but at the same time it has never curbed my efforts to get through life.  I have held my own in an agricultural way, and so far as I can, honestly, and although I have not been professionally trained, I suppose I am as happy as anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt that the Minister would not be quite so strong against this as I thought he was at the beginning, and I knew he would try to meet the position.  It is a very big difficulty. Apart altogether from the practical aspect, there is the theoretical.  I think the State should give a bounty to the man who employs children, who trains them and who invites their minds to an appreciation of the resources which agriculture gives.  It is a pity to prejudice the outlook on agriculture <Col N="1043" /> of anybody.  When the Taoiseach spoke in Limerick last week he told us that our greatest bargaining power was barley.  To produce barley, the land must be clean, and no one can do that cleaning as well as little children.  When you have something to export, it is not educated men you export but some production of the land, and we should encourage our children to stick to the land by every possible means.</P>
    <P>The year before last a boy left my employment for a job I got him in a barber's shop.  He was away for a year.  He came back and when I asked him why, he said: &ldquo;If the work was as constant as the work I am now doing, I should be inclined to come back again because there is a great deal in it to like.&rdquo;  I do not think you will be injuring the health of the children in any way by giving encouragement to those who employ them on the land.  You will show them what agricultural work is and possibly will be doing them a good turn by making them fond of the land.  They are fond of it, if it only gives them a livelihood.  In my district, there are families of five, six, seven and eight children.  The majority of them are about 16, and, since Christmas, they have been working at beet.  They are not strong enough to hold up a heavy beet, but they are strong enough to clean it and to crack the beets together to clean them.  They are as good crowners of beet at 14, 15 or 16 as some men of 30 and 40, and possibly better.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see the Minister adopting a reasonable attitude.  He did not say all he meant to say, because, when a Minister is being convinced, he does not like to go &ldquo;all out&rdquo;, but he came a long way to meet the position.  I suggest that Ministers should do all they possibly can to recognise that when children are being trained on the farm, a great asset is being conveyed to them.  For that reason, I think it would be a pity to do anything that would cast a slur on the work. It would, of course, be unheard of to employ children at this work if they <Col N="1044" /> were delicate or not properly fed, but where there are four children in a house earning 25/- a week each during the summer, bringing in £5 a week for ten weeks, it represents a valuable addition.  It counts enormously during the months of March and April in connection with potatoes, during the months of June, July and August in connection with the thinning of beet and still more in September and October in the gathering of potatoes.</P>
    <P>These periods are different from the holiday periods and they are periods which are vital.  The Minister might reconsider the holiday period.  If we want the amount of beet and potatoes grown which Ministers ask us to grow and which we know is very vital, they might be prepared to alter the school periods during the emergency.  I am sure that none would regret if, after the emergency, we were in a position to grow the crops and find a market for them which would keep our children employed.  A time of emergency, however, is not a proper time to bring in a Bill to curtail agricultural output, or which tends in any way to do so.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I should go quite so far as Senator McGee has gone, but I agree with a good deal of what he says.  I am glad that he has pointed out to the Minister, as I intended to point out, the necessity for making some provision for the thinning of beet.  In the beet-growing area&mdash;and there is a lot of beet grown in the Minister's constituency&mdash;the handling of the beet is a problem at present.  In the rural areas, as several Senators have already agreed, the number of people available for employment on the land has dwindled very considerably.  Men have joined the Army and we all encourage them to do so; they have gone to work on the bogs, in the mines and other places, and there is a great shortage of employment in the beet-growing areas as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant to say a shortage <Col N="1045" /> of men who could be employed in rural areas.  At the present time that is a problem with men who have a big acreage of beet to handle.  In normal times it was the custom for beet growers with from 10 to 25 acres to make it known in the locality that they would pay so much a drill for thinning the crop.  When that became known it was open to any worker to undertake it.  Children of small farmers and of agricultural workers might thin a drill or half a drill or 100 or 200 yards. I agree with what Senator McGee said that there is a difficulty about insisting on the holiday period.  It was customary for children, even on the way home from school, when passing through a beet garden to thin half a drill and then to go home.  I realise the Minister's difficulty in legislating to prevent abuse of a privilege of this kind.  As to Senator McGee's statement, it would be desirable, if it could be properly regulated, that children of farmers, agricultural workers or shopkeepers in small towns in rural Ireland should have in their upbringing at least some contact with the land. The most pathetic thing that I can imagine is to meet a grown-up person in this country who does not know anything about land.  He knows what bread is made from but he has no idea how a crop of wheat is produced.  He knows potatoes when he sees them in a shop window, but he does not know how they are grown.  If a man of that type, who is 20 or 25 years of age, goes on a farm he is perfectly useless there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man who is brought up on the land has a decided advantage over other men, particularly in this country, where it is desirable that as many as possible of the people, and of the children, should have the necessary contact with land from childhood, so that they would be able to appreciate the difficulties of farmers.  We are unanimous in agreeing that there should be no such thing as child labour.  Nobody wants that.  What we want, and what we hope the Minister will be able to do, is to make it possible for children to have the necessary contact with the land, so that they may appreciate the difficulties of farmers and, at the same time, help in <Col N="1046" /> the production of the food required by our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister has met Senator Baxter's amendment by promising to look into this matter, to see whether he could safely make the Bill a little less drastic. At the same time I hope that he will not go so far as to make it possible to have pretty widespread employment, because a section of this kind could very easily be too wide.  We do not want the general employment of children under 14 years.  It may be that during the emergency there may be a necessity for going further in certain districts than in normal times.  That being the case, the Minister may find, when he looks into it, that he may be driven to come back or to take power to make regulations or to alter what is in the Bill.  It may be necessary to give greater latitude at this time.  The House should be satisfied with what the Minister has said and the amendment might be withdrawn to see what will be done on the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Douglas, I am very largely satisfied with the promise the Minister has given, and it was really the eloquence of Senator McGee that tempted me to intervene, in order to add my effort to his, and to plead with the Minister to reconsider the whole section very carefully, not only in relation to the holiday period but, as Senator McGee suggested, in relation to periods that might fall outside the holiday period. I agree with Senator McGee that we should look on the whole question of agricultural employment in a totally different way from urban employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are entirely different.  Urban employment of children is generally blind-alley employment and does not really train them for the life they are going to live.  Nine-tenths of farmers' sons, if they are ever going to be successful farmers, must begin to get agricultural training at a much earlier age than 14.  Anybody who knows anything about life on the land knows that if a man is going to be a farmer you cannot leave him idle until he is <Col N="1047" /> 14 years of age and then suddenly decide to try to make him a farmer.  He must be learning about the processes of agriculture, even though in an elementary or childish way from the beginning.</P>
    <P>The work children do on the land is not the degrading kind of work that they would do in indiscriminate employment in towns, the kind that leads to blind-alley employment.  I was kept at home from school long before there was a School Attendance Act to pick potatoes.  I do not know that any Senator could accuse my parents of having damaged my education by keeping me at home in that way.  There are occupations of that kind in connection with the harvest for which small children are better fitted than bigger children, and it does not do them the least harm.  I would be inclined to make an exception of some of the work on beet.  Thinning may be comparatively light work, but from what I have heard of the beet crop it is not at all regarded as an easy crop to work.  We agree that nobody wants to have small children turned into wage slaves or performing work that they are not physically fitted for.  I should like to emphasise, as far as I can, that the kind of work small children are normally called upon to do on the farm is not at all degrading or harmful.  On the whole it is good for them and is, in fact, essential for the vast majority if they are to become farmers.  What I feel about the section as it stands is that it is a little too tightly drawn and leaves no loophole for a situation where a good deal of latitude will be required.  I do not think there was ever any great complaint that there was anything in the nature of wage slavery in country districts.</P>
    <P>I do not remember ever hearing that small children were overworked, for hire or anything of that sort.  But there would be a great deal of temporary, or more or less casual, employment in which children could give an immense amount of help on the land, and it would be a great pity if their employers, whoever they might <Col N="1048" /> be, were prevented by law from giving them a small wage.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any harm done by giving a considerable amount of latitude for the employment of children on the land.  On the contrary, I believe that if an attempt is made to carry out that section as it stands it will be a total failure.  You could not carry out that section.  Take, for instance, the question of employment by relatives.  How is any State authority to investigate to what extent children are employed by their relatives for pay?  It is an utter impossibility so far as the country districts are concerned.  You could do that sort of thing in the cities where you have people in compact groups, but you cannot do it with families living on the land.  I should like to urge the Minister to re-examine the whole of that section and to try to draw a clear distinction in it between urban employment and rural employment; and while not, as Senator Douglas said, widening the scope too far or creating a situation in which excessive employment of children would be permitted, to give as much latitude as possible to farmers to use the labour of children, certainly between the ages of 12 and 14, and, if necessary, to pay them a small wage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my agreement with what most of the speakers said with regard to the employment of children on the land.  I think it would be very desirable that children who have not attained the age of 14 should be allowed to be employed for short periods on the land.  In the present situation there is a real shortage of labour in certain districts and the help of children would mean a great deal in saving the harvest.  In ordinary times, in dairying districts, little children could do very useful light work in the harvest time.  They are usually employed in carrying meals to workers and they are also useful in stooking corn and picking potatoes. Undoubtedly their labour is very useful and in the present situation is <Col N="1049" /> very necessary.  Apart from that, there is another reason why their employment should be allowed and that is that in general agricultural labourers are very poor.  Their earnings are very small and the money which the children can earn in this way is a great help to them.  It is also quite an education for the children to be employed at light work like that instead of running around idle.  I think it would meet the situation if Senator O'Donovan's suggestion that the words, &ldquo;during the holiday period&rdquo; were inserted in the Bill.  You might also include Saturdays, because children are often employed on Saturdays. I think that that would meet the situation.  There would be no need to keep children at home from school, but employment of children might be allowed during the holiday season and when the schools are not open.</P>

      <P>In the debate that has just taken place we have an example of the danger of opening a gap.  Senator Baxter put forward what might be regarded as a comparatively modest demand, that during the school holiday period children might be engaged on what he described as light agricultural work.  Then immediately others added a little bit. When they found the Minister was rather inclined to give way or did not show that he was dead against it, we had the demand gradually increased until we came to the time when Senator McGee thought they should be employed during September, October and November in connection with the beet crop.  I think the only work they could do in connection with beet at that time would be lifting it, and, as Senator Tierney said, no child under 14 should be employed at that work.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Baxter says, they would not be very much good at it.  I think we should definitely insist on the principle which is enshrined in this Bill, that no child under the age of 14 should be employed during school hours even by his own parents.  If a <Col N="1050" /> parent is obliged to send his child to school every day, as he is, and cannot therefore employ him on his own farm, surely we must insist that no child under 14 can be employed for hire at such time as school is in operation.  I think we will have definitely to insist upon that.  Reference was made to the holiday period.  The holiday period is not a static period.  It is open to managers of schools to arrange their vacation period for such time as will suit the circumstances of the district. Managers and teachers do that.  For instance, it is well known that in Donegal the vacation is always given in October because the children are employed at that time picking potatoes. That is the case in certain counties in Northern Ireland and possibly in portions of County Louth also.  I think it was Senator Quirke who said something about the extra period given. That extra period that is given during the emergency can also be arranged. In the beet areas it can be arranged to be given during the thinning of the beet.  If there are other areas where it is a question of picking potatoes or something of that kind, the ten days can be given during that period.  I think that that should meet any reasonable demand, and that it would meet Senator Baxter's demand.  But certainly I think the Minister should not give way to the extent that he would allow children to be employed when their attendance at school would be interfered with in any way.  I think he should stand firm on that.</P>
      <P>I prefer the Bill as it stands, but I have no objection to what Senator Baxter has asked for, that during the holiday period it might be open to a parent or a farmer to employ children at light agricultural work.  But I can see the difficulty that the Minister will have if he tries to frame a regulation on that matter, and I think that whatever he decides to do ought to be put definitely in the Bill rather than by way of regulation, so that we will know exactly what we have to meet and have an opportunity of saying what we think about it.  I strongly object to any extension in the direction indicated by Senator McGee or any loosening of this particular section, and I hope the Minister will not agree to it.</P>

      <P>Some of us were rather disquieted by the absolute prohibition in the first part of this section against any person employing a child under 14 years.  As the Bill stands, there is an absolute prohibition with three exceptions, which really are not exceptions at all, as regards their employment.  What I found disquieting was that this absolute prohibition was not related in any explicit way to the purpose of the Bill, that is to secure better school attendance.  The prohibition was absolute and nothing was said about school attendance.  I think it is right that we should get away from the idea that education is only to be got in schools.  There is a certain amount to be got in schools, and our system of education and of the employment of children should be so regulated that the poorest child would be provided with that education free. The child of the poorest parent in this country has as much right to that education as anybody else, but there is another kind of education that cannot be got in the schools, and which is only got, as Senator Tierney pointed out in his splendid speech, through contact with the land.  The farmer or the farm labourer is a very highly trained person, and his training for his work must begin when he is very young.  In my experience, after the age of 14, it is almost too late to give such education. I agree, of course, that there are certain exceptions, but that has been my experience, generally&mdash;that you cannot have a good farmer or a good farm labourer, unless his education begins when he is very young.  I certainly do not want to see the old, bad conditions of child labour in this country, and I am sure that nobody in this country wants to see that, but I also think that our children should not be deprived of the necessary, legitimate education and preparation for their future lives. They must get the proper education in the primary schools, but we should not deprive them of the opportunity of coming into contact with that part of their education which can only be got by being employed on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other reasons, such as health reasons.  From the point of view of health, for instance, I think it would <Col N="1052" /> be much better for children to be employed on the land in light work instead of being cooped up in schools too long.  The training of the body is a very important thing, and in connection with farming, particularly, it is necessary that certain muscles of the body should be developed at a very early age.  These are my reasons for advancing the opinions I have advanced. We have had the Minister's assurance that he would look into this matter, and I hope he will take cognisance of the various points that were made in this debate.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure Senator O'Connell that I had no idea whatever of suggesting that children should be employed during school hours.  I think Senator O'Connell would be agreeable to the idea that children might be employed on light work outside of school hours.  That means that it might be possible for a little boy or girl to do what I suggested; that is, to thin a half a drill of beet or of turnips, perhaps, on their way home from school.  I certainly agree with the Senator that children should not be put to such work as the crowning of beet.  I have had experience of such work myself, and I know what it means.  I know that you would require a full-grown man to do such work, but with regard to the idea, generally, of children helping on the land, I regret that it is not possible&mdash; as, I suppose, it is not possible&mdash;to draft some legislation to ensure that children&mdash;not alone the children of agricultural workers and farmers but the children of every citizen in this State&mdash;should at least spend some of their holidays and some of their lives in the rural areas.  If they could spend some portion of their holidays or of their lives on the dog or on the farm, I think they would be all the better for it.  I think that any boy or girl, up to, let us say, the age of 19 or 20, would be very much better off if they spent their holidays on the farm or the bog, where they would be in touch with the soil.</P>

      <P>The main reason that I have in rising is to repeat a <Col N="1053" /> question that I put on the Second Reading of this Bill, and that is in regard to the power of the Minister to close schools at certain periods of the year under the emergency regulations. I think the Minister referred to it in the course of his speech this evening, and I want to be quite clear as to whether he will still have power to do so after the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <P>That being so, I am perfectly satisfied with what the Minister said to-night.  With regard to the other speeches that were made, one finds that in every one of them there is a good deal with which one could agree, but I must say that the speech which impressed me most was that of Senator O'Connell.  The whole aim of this Bill is to ensure that nothing will interfere with the child's opportunity to get as sound an education as is possible during the period in which he must attend school.  It has been said that the child should start work on the farm as soon as possible. I agree, but what is meant by that phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;?  At what age are we to fix it?  I suggest that that would be very difficult to decide.  In that connection, also, it might be said that boys or girls going into trades in the cities should go in before the ages of 14 or 16, but I feel that you will not make a good farmer or a good agricultural labourer, no more than you will make a good worker in any trade, unless the boy or the girl concerned has got as thorough a primary education as it is possible to get, and the whole aim of this Bill is to see that they get that necessary, primary education.  There was another point that emerged as a result of the discussion on this Bill, which seemed to imply that, by reason of this section, or the Bill itself, agriculture was an occupation of an inferior kind. Surely, there was no word, either in the section or in the whole Bill, that would lead one to that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite convinced that the future of this country depends <Col N="1054" /> in a great measure on the proper education of its people, and that must begin in the primary schools in most cases and must be continued, we are agreed, until the elements are mastered, at about the age of 14.  If that is agreed upon, then one principle upon which we must build is that no child should be engaged in such work as will deprive him of his rights to a sound elementary education.  Now, with regard to the standards to be adopted in connection with urban and country dwellers, I think it was always agreed that the educational syllabus with regard to those two classes should be the same, but in the case of urban dwellers their outlook would be of an industrial character, as they would probably be engaged in the few industries that we have, or else in the transport business, or something of that kind, and their education should be directed along those lines, with a view to their future, and should be given the necessary bias in that direction in their school books and in their general training, whereas, in the rural districts everything should be done to give the education of the children a bias towards our chief industry, which is agriculture.  Now, that has not been done, and the system has been definitely wrong in that respect.  That condition of things should be altered. I agree that it is going through a process of alteration to some small extent.</P>
      <P>Now, when should the education of a child on the land begin?  It must be remembered that the child in a rural community is in contact with the land from the very beginning.  From the earliest days of childhood, one who is born on the land and living on the land has all the objects around him that are bound to attract him, and he is bound to draw knowledge from his ordinary experience and from the talk of the people around him.  That knowledge or education will not come merely by setting a child down, at the age of 13, to the monotonous task of thinning turnips or picking potatoes, or things of that kind, which are merely the repeated, mechanical performance of a very tiring task through the long day. That is not agricultural education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> No one can claim that that is work of a highly educative character.  It is simply manual labour, comparable with turning the handle of a machine in a mill or factory.  It is not manual labour calculated to be of a highly educative character.  I was alarmed at some of the statements made here, because suggestions were made as to the period of the year in which children might be employed; the spring time was mentioned for the sowing of potatoes, the late summer and autumn for the harvest work, and again September, October and November for the gathering of potatoes.  That would mean that for practically the whole of the year children under 13 years of age might be employed on the land.  As Senator O'Connell has pointed out, a good deal of provision could be made for the employment of children during those periods by an arrangement between the manager and the board as to when the holidays might be taken.  In most parts of the country that is done.  In some parts of the south of Ireland we have early harvesting; we have it in early August.  When you go further north, to the colder and bleaker places, the harvest is possibly three weeks later. The same applies to some extent in regard to potatoes.  A good deal of provision could be made, within the present regulations, for the release of children at those times.  But that children under 13 or 14 years can earn 25/- a week is to me rather astonishing. It is news to me.  It is very hard for the rural people to resist such a temptation.  If their children can earn that money, without interfering with their attendance at school during the required period, then I congratulate the parents.  I think they are very lucky. I know how extremely useful children can be on the land, performing light tasks such as weeding, looking after cattle and bringing them home for milking. Those occupations will not do them any harm.  Outside of that, if we are to have educated farmers and educated agricultural workers, the fundamentals of primary education must be thoroughly mastered, and that cannot be done if the children are to do manual work which is not of an educative <Col N="1056" /> character before they are 14 years of age.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the House, I would be glad to withdraw my amendment, and leave it to the Minister to put up something that would be suitable in all the circumstances which have been brought to his notice by speakers from all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to put up anything beyond the holiday period, and I do not want to leave the House under a misapprehension.  There is no use in pretending that the proposals which have come from the Dáil can just be amended now to give them the directly opposite meaning to the intention expressed there.  I hope Senators will not have any such feeling.  I should like to recall to their minds a number of points.  In the first place, there is no restriction whatever on the employment of children over 14 years of age.  I do not think any Senator has made a case for the employment, strictly speaking, of children under 14.  The second point is that there is nothing whatever to prevent a parent or relative from employing a child.  Section 8 (2) (c) is a definite exception to the principle that no person shall have in his employment any child who has not attained the age of 14 years.  The exception is the employment of a child by a relative, if such employment does not prevent or interfere with the attendance of the child at school, or the obtaining by the child of proper benefit from such attendance. Therefore, there is no stoppage whatever on children being employed by their relatives.  The third point is that, so far as the emergency is concerned, that matter can be dealt with.  If the Minister wishes, he can give extra holidays, but I do not see how that is connected with the employment of children under 14 at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might argue from some of the speeches that we would be well advised to close our schools altogether for large parts of the year, and turn the children out into employment which would be of the nature, as Senator <Col N="1057" /> Cummins has rightly stressed, of manual labour and not of an educational course.  Let us not deceive ourselves into believing that, when people employ children at 25/- a week, it is for the purpose of educating them in the rudiments of agriculture.  It is to try to get them to do certain manual labour that has got to be done.  Surely, there is no analogy whatever between the work that Senator Tierney had to do as a child, or between the work that Senators will ask their own children to do on their farms and what the children of poor parents will be expected to do.  If we admit the principle of the employment of children on the land on work that is not primarily educational but is purely manual labour, where are we going to stop?  I refused the applications of poor parents who asked me to allow their children to remain at home from school so that they might earn a few shillings.</P>
    <P>If I were to accept Senator McGee's suggestion that the economic position of the parents is going to be a big determining factor in this issue, and the needs of agriculture are to be first &mdash;I am afraid the Senator did not indicate that he was particularly interested in the question of educational advantage to the children; I may be wronging him, but I think he did not advert to the fact that any exception that would be made should be on the basis that the child's educational progress would be in no way interfered with&mdash;it would be putting upon the Minister for Education the intolerable burden of having to decide in particular cases that the children were getting educational advancement or were benefiting from work, which, in general, he feels is purely of a manual nature.  It has the advantage, undoubtedly, of being done in the open air, and, where parents themselves employ their children, there is an ample safeguard there.</P>
    <P>The parents themselves will see to it that their children will not suffer, although some parents may not be as careful as we would wish.  But I submit that if we were to admit the principle of allowing poor children to go out to work for employers, there <Col N="1058" /> would be very little reason why we should not allow it in the case of shops or factories.  Precisely the same argument could be made in favour of such employment.  In fact, the case has been made to me by a factory manager that it is much easier to train a boy apprentice under 14 years, than a boy of 16.  Nevertheless, we make no allowance for such apprentices.  I really do not feel that the question of employment for gain enters into the matter very greatly, and that, if I consider introducing an amendment to cover the holiday period or perhaps stretching to the uttermost the days when the school is not in operation, that is the very most I should be asked to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to ask the Minister if the definition of &ldquo;relative&rdquo; in sub-section (2) (c) is not a little bit too narrow:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In this sub-section the word &ldquo;relative&rdquo; in relation to a child means a person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) who is the father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, step-mother, brother, sister, half-brother or half-sister of such child, and</P>
      <P>(ii) who maintains such child in the such person's dwellinghouse.</P>
      <P>It very often happens that an uncle or an aunt might adopt a child and stand to that child in the relation of a parent, and could a child under 14 years of age be employed by such uncle or aunt?  It seems to me that the definition does not take cognisance of a very likely occurrence.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in line 34 to and including the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in line 36.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment to find from the Minister what was the reason for confining the powers given in this section to school attendance officers in areas situated in a county borough or borough mentioned in the Schedule. In the rural areas the enforcing authority is the Gárda.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it will save discussion if the Minister will tell me this&mdash;are they school attendance officers in the first place?  Is there a technical definition of school attendance officer?  Is the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána a school attendance officer, or, if not, is the position this&mdash;possibly it may be this&mdash;that the police, because they happen to be the police, have powers as such to do the things that can be done under this section by the school attendance officers in the scheduled areas?  It will be noted that in Section 17 the school attendance officer is given certain powers.  If he finds a child rambling about the roads, who he thinks ought to be at school, he has power to question him and, in fact, to take him to his home and question the parents.  If it is the case that the member of the Gárda Síochána in the rural areas has not that power, I think it should be given to him, but perhaps the Minister would say whether in fact, because of his position as a member of the Gárda Síochána, he has that power already.  Then the amendment would be unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The officer of the Gárda Síochána for the time being holding the rank and occupying the station prescribed in the Order is the enforcing authority outside the borough areas.  The Department of Justice do not like the idea of Gárdaí being empowered <Col N="1060" /> to question children.  While they have power to do so in the case of children of vagrants, it is a power that, naturally, one would like to confine to serious cases, and in the case of suspected non-attendance at school in rural areas the matter will generally come under the notice of the Gárda who represents the enforcing authority and it will scarcely be necessary for him to question the child.</P>
      <P>It is to meet the problem of children in Dublin who, because their parents change their residence from one school attendance area to another, or who in fact may not have ever come under the notice of the enforcing authority, that it was considered necessary that the school attendance officers in the borough areas ought to be empowered to question children.  It was considered that to give power to the Gárdaí to question children indiscriminately would be rather an extreme step, and in any case, to carry it out effectively, even where the Gárda was absolutely satisfied he had good ground for questioning the child, and putting the child in the position of being held up by a uniformed policeman, the Gárda would have to go to the parents' home to question them in order to get particulars of the case. The Gárda Síochana are fully occupied and, personally, I feel that they have not nearly sufficient members to undertake all the duties that are being thrust upon them.  For all these reasons, therefore, it has not been considered necessary, or indeed advisable, to give this power to the Gárdaí.</P>

It seems to me rather extraordinary <Col N="1061" /> that if a member of the Gárda Síochána, say, in Dundalk, Drogheda, Tullamore or Tralee sees a young lad running around, who he thinks ought to be at school, he has no right to question him and that it would be improper for him to question him.</P>

      <P>6 (b). To delete sub-section (2) and substitute therefor the following sub-section&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Where, in a prosecution of a parent for an offence under this section the court either convicts the parent of the offence or (on the ground that the parent has used all reasonable efforts to cause the child in respect of whom the prosecution is brought to attend school in accordance with this Act) applies sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;<Col N="1063" /> (a) the court may, if it so thinks fit, cause the said child to be brought before it and may question (either, as it thinks fit, privately or otherwise) the said child,</P>
    <P>(b) the court may, whether it exercises the power conferred by the immediately preceding paragraph or not, if it so thinks fit&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) order the said child to be sent to a certified industrial school, in which case Part IV of the Children Act, 1908, as amended by subsequent enactments, shall (so far as applicable) apply as if such order had been made thereunder, or</P>
    <P>(ii) order, in accordance with Part II of the said Children Act, 1908, as so amended, the committal of the said child to the care of a relative or other fit person named by the court, in which case the said Part II, as so amended shall (so far as applicable) apply as if such order had been made thereunder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments have become necessary because, as the Bill stands at present, the court of jurisdiction could commit a child to an industrial school solely on the grounds that the parent failed to cause the child to attend school as required by the Bill. Even if the parent satisfies the court that there is a reasonable excuse and that consequently there has been no offence under Section 19, the court may nevertheless be satisfied that the parent has used all reasonable efforts to cause the child to attend school and is empowered by sub-section (2) to make an order committing the child to an industrial school or to some other person than the parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, accordingly, to amend sub-section (2) so that the powers may be exercised in cases where the court convicts a parent of the offence or where the court finds the offence proved but is satisfied that the failure of the child to attend school is not due to any neglect on the part of the parent and is due to continued wilful misbehaviour on the part of the child.  Sub-section (2) <Col N="1064" /> (a) of the amendment is proposed because it is considered desirable that the court should, at its discretion, be able to see the child when considering the sending of such child to an industrial school.  There is no power in the Bill as it stands to require the parent to produce the child in court nor to order the arrest of a child whose parent is charged with an offence under the Bill except under Section 21.  It may happen that a juvenile court will consider it necessary to have the child in attendance.  For example a child may have been kept from school deliberately by the parents or there may be some circumstances in connection with the child which would require investigation. The Justice then, in his discretion, might ask that the child should be produced in court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (b), line 42, after the words &ldquo;attending it&rdquo; to insert the following words: &ldquo;or to the qualifications of any teacher or teachers engaged therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) (b) of this section states that whenever a school is being inspected&mdash;I take it this refers to private schools&mdash;the manager or conductor of the school&mdash;</P>
      <P>shall give to such officer or other person all such information in his possession or procurement in relation to such school or all or any of the children attending it as such officer or other person shall reasonably require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment suggests that he should also give such information as may be required regarding the qualifications of any teacher or teachers engaged therein.  It may be said that he can ask for that information even as the sub-section stands, but I think, even if that is so, it is advisable to put into the section the words contained in my <Col N="1065" /> amendment.  I think it essential that in any inquiries or investigations with regard to a school, or an institution which is setting itself up as a school, there should be some definite regard to the qualifications of persons who presume to carry on teaching there.  I think it would strengthen the section if this provision were inserted so that these who are proposing to set up a school will know definitely that one of the matters on which they will have to satisfy the Minister is the qualifications of the persons whom they propose to employ in the school as teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think under the section as it stands the inspector is likely to report on the general suitability of the school for the purpose of giving the requisite education to the children attending there.  He is likely to advert to the condition of the premises and more particularly to the qualifications of the teachers, but I think it would be going perhaps unnecessarily far to place upon the Minister the duty of considering these private schools from the point of view either of suitability of premises or the qualifications of the teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even many of our national schools, as everybody in the Seanad knows by this time, would scarcely pass the Minister if he were compelled by law to test their suitability having regard to their condition as sanitary or hygienic premises.  As regards qualifications also, we have a good many teachers in national schools who are not trained teachers.  In the same way, as I think I have already mentioned, we have in these private schools teachers who, although they may not have academic qualifications, are doing very good work.  If they satisfy the Minister that the work which they are doing is satisfactory I do not think that the Minister ought to refuse a certificate.  Section 4 (2) (b) of the present Bill contains a provision in relation to suitable education, otherwise than by attending certain schools and provides that the Minister shall not refuse to give a certificate in respect of a child until he has informed the manager or conductor of the school of <Col N="1066" /> the ground on which he proposes to refuse the certificate and has given such manager or conductor a reasonable opportunity of meeting the requirements of the Minister for the purpose of removing the said ground of refusal.  I propose to bring in on Report Stage a similar provision in the case of Section 20 so that in the case of a school up for certification, if the Minister does not propose to grant a certificate, he will communicate that fact to the manager or conductor of that school and give him a reasonable opportunity of meeting the Minister's requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister misunderstands Senator O'Connell's amendment?  The amendment merely gives the Minister power explicitly to ask questions and to get information with regard to the qualifications of any teacher engaged in such school.  If that power is already conferred by the section, well and good; but if it is not contained in the section and must be explicitly added, then it does not compel the Minister to ask these questions nor does it compel the Minister to reject any teacher or teachers because of lack of qualifications.  The amendment is an empowering amendment but it does not commit the Minister to any decision with regard to the qualifications of any of these teachers.  I agree entirely that there are people with no academic qualifications who are excellent teachers, but there is no intention on the part of Senator O'Connell to interfere with them. What Senator O'Connell wants to provide is that in the case of private schools there should be power to ask for information with regard to the qualifications of the teachers.  The rest is left to the Minister.  After that, the Minister can take any action he chooses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not attempted to lay down all the qualifications upon which the Minister should insist.  I have not said that the teacher should be trained but, surely, he should have some qualifications.  For the protection of people who send their children <Col N="1067" /> to private schools, the Minister should take steps to see that the person who purports to teach these children has satisfactory qualifications.  That is all I want to insist upon.  I am dealing in this amendment with only one point&mdash; that relating to the teacher.  The next amendment is of a more general nature.  In this case, all I want to do is to let it be known to those who set up private schools that inquiries may be made respecting the qualifications of the teachers and that they will be expected to give evidence to the Minister that the teachers they propose to employ have certain minimum qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The section in the Principal Act is merely permissive.  We are carrying matters a good deal further in Section 20.  We are imposing a penalty on the manager or conductor of the school if he refuses to give the Minister or his officer such information as he may reasonably require.  There is no reason for mentioning qualifications or any other specific matter.  We may assume that, when information is being sought, particulars will be obtained of the general conditions.  To mention qualifications or premises would attach special significance to these matters.</P>
      <P>It would be necessary, then, to mention every matter by which the certification of a school might be affected. If Senator O'Connell reads Section 20 again, he will find that the Minister has full power in regard to the matter mentioned in the amendment.  As a penalty is likely to follow upon the refusal of the manager or conductor to give reasonable information, it is not probable that the Minister will forget to ask his inspector to report on all the relevant circumstances which would guide him in coming to a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my first reaction to the amendment.  I thought that Section 20 gave the Minister power to do what Senator O'Connell wants him to do.  I must say that the Minister's statements have rather <Col N="1068" /> shaken my opinion.  I thought that the Minister had the necessary power but he himself does not seem to be quite clear about it.</P>

      <P>Surely, the most important thing to inquire about in a school is what kind of teachers are in it.  The most important thing about a school is the teacher.  A school consists really of the teachers and pupils. If you had the most magnificent building possible, with vita glass in the windows and indifferent teachers, you would have a bad school.  I do not understand the Minister when he says that, if he inserted something about the qualifications of teachers, he would have to insert 101 other things.  To anybody who has children attending a school, the most important consideration is what kind of teachers are in the school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new sub-sections (5) and (6):&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) The Minister may as a result of such inspection or of such other inquiries and investigations as he may deem it expedient to make</P>
      <P>(1) certify the school as a suitable school for the purpose of the Principal Act and this Act, or</P>
      <P>(2) refuse to grant such certificate, or,</P>
      <P>(3) revoke a certificate previously given to the school:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided, however, that before refusing or revoking a certificate <Col N="1069" /> the Minister shall inform the manager or conductor of such school of the ground on which he proposes to refuse or revoke the certificate and shall give such manager or conductor a reasonable opportunity of meeting the requirements of the Minister for the purpose of removing the said ground of refusal or revocation.</P>
    <P>(6) Before a school is certified as a suitable school the manager or conductor of such school must satisfy the Minister that adequate provision is made for the accommodation of all the pupils in attendance at the school, and that the arrangements in regard to furnishing, heating, lighting, ventilation and sanitation are satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) of this section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whenever a school has been inspected under this section, the Minister shall, as soon as conveniently may be, inform the manager or conductor of such school of the result of such inspection.</P>
    <P>I want to make the position more definite for the information of the school authorities.  The sub-section does not say whether the Minister is to give a certificate or refuse a certificate or revoke a certificate.  After all, these three things are the only three things he need do as a result of the inspection of private schools.  He has to give a certificate if everything is all right, to refuse a certificate if things are not all right, and to revoke a certificate, previously given, if he finds that a school which was previously sanctioned as suitable can no longer be regarded as suitable.  I think that it is necessary that these things should be specifically set out.  That is why I move this amendment.</P>
    <P>Included in the amendment is sub-section (6) which really relates to a separate matter.  In that sub-section, I ask that, before a school is certified as suitable, the manager or conductor shall satisfy the Minister that adequate provision is made for the accommodation of all the pupils and that the arrangements in connection with sanitation, heating, lighting, etc., are <Col N="1070" /> adequate.  The Minister, in replying to the previous amendment, suggested that there was not the same necessity for making such investigations as for making other inquiries and compared the position with that of national schools.  I suggest that there is no comparison.  These schools are private institutions for the purpose of profit-making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very foolish if they carry on in those circumstances. Before the Minister certifies a school as suitable, he should, for the protection of the people who send their children to the school, satisfy himself that the sanitation and accommodation are satisfactory.  Some of these schools have been opened in back rooms and are not suitable from any point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is necessary, because Section 5 of the Principal Act enables the Minister, if and when he thinks fit, to certify a school as a suitable school within the meaning of the Act.  If the Minister is not satisfied regarding the conditions, he will not grant a certificate.  The points mentioned regarding accommodation and other matters will be considered and it is not necessary for Senator O'Connell to press the Minister to inquire into them.</P>
