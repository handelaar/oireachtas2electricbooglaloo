      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, Section 4, paragraph (A), to delete paragraph (a) (as amended in Committee), lines 33 to 37, and substitute therefor the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on any week day&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  during a period of summer time, before the hour of half-past ten o'clock in the morning or after the hour of half-past ten o'clock in the evening, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  during any time which is not a period of summer time, before the hour of ten o'clock in the morning or after the hour of ten o'clock in the evening, or</P>

    <P>(iii)  during any period, whether it is or is not a period of summer time (subject to the exceptions hereinafter mentioned) between the hours of half-past <Col N="1350" /> two o'clock and half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, or</P>
    <P>This question is an involved and complicated one, because this Bill is really an amendment of the Principal Act. The amendment proposes to amend a decision come to by the Seanad on the last occasion that the Bill was before it, and to have the opening hours in county boroughs from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. in summer and from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. in winter.  As I explained previously I was in favour of 10.30 p.m. closing all round, winter and summer, but I thought we might arrive at some arrangement by which the closing hour in summer would be 10.30 p.m., which really means 9.30 p.m. solar time.  The proposal in the amendment does not increase the number of opening hours but makes them more suitable for the general public.  Amendment No. 5 has reference to places outside county boroughs and has the same object in view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion, the Seanad decided at first on 10 o'clock closing all the year round for the boroughs, with a corresponding change in the morning.  The same proposal was made for places outside the boroughs and a compromise was agreed to.  The Minister agreed to bring in an amendment providing for that change. He has done so, and the amendment appears on the Order Paper.  The present amendment proposes to go back on a previous decision of the Seanad and to fix the closing at 10.30 p.m. in summer, and 10 p.m. in winter. I do not think the Seanad should go back on the previous decision.</P>

      <P>What has the Minister to say to this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My feeling is that I would like to have as much uniformity as possible.  The Seanad decided that the closing hours should be 10 o'clock in the boroughs and, outside the boroughs, 10.30 in summer and 10 p.m. in winter.  The Seanad came to that decision and, naturally, I have to have regard to it.  My own opinion is that, if there was uniformity, it would work. I have always in mind the two-hour gap between the 10 o'clock closing in the boroughs and the 12 o'clock closing in the country.  If we had that in the summer time, we might have an exodus of people from the boroughs, which I do not like.  That may not be so, but I think two hours is rather a big gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the public houses just outside the city boundary be open until 10.30 p.m. instead of closing at 10 o'clock and would not that be difficult to administer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>For all practical purposes, the houses a bit further out will be open until 12 o'clock.  Therefore, it does not seem to be so unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's remarks, I think he is more or less agreeable to this proposal.  He is, of course, leaving it to the Seanad.  I have nothing more to say except that this amendment would bring about uniformity.  It would be ridiculous if, in certain places around the city, some public houses had to close at 10 o'clock &mdash;if this amendment is not carried&mdash; and others at 10.30.  I think it would make it easier for the authorities to carry out the law if the closing hour were 10.30 instead of 10 o'clock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnLynch" hpid="Mr. E. Lynch Mr. E. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On an amendment on the Committee Stage, the Seanad decided that 10 o'clock was a reasonable closing hour.  The Minister also informed us that there was a likelihood <Col N="1352" /> that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would bring in an Emergency Order fixing the closing hour at 10 o'clock because of the difficulties in connection with lighting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlon Mr. Conlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnLynch" hpid="Mr. E. Lynch Mr. E. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the emergency still and it is likely that it will continue for some time.  Furthermore, there was the question of transport in the city closing down at 10 o'clock and the inability of people to get home after that time.  All these factors have not altered in any way and the validity of the case put up by us on the last occasion is as good now as it was when the Seanad decided by a majority a fortnight ago to stand by the 10 o'clock arrangement.  I trust the Seanad will not go back on the decision which it came to on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I might remind the Seanad that we are hoping that this will be a fairly permanent Bill.  The period of the emergency can be dealt with by an Emergency Powers Order, and the question of transport and lighting can be dealt with by an Emergency Powers Order, but we hope that this Bill will be fairly permanent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite clear about this.  The hours in the summer time for the boroughs are to be from 10.30 a.m. until 10.30 p.m., and for the houses outside the boroughs from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The other way round. At present, it is 10 o'clock in the boroughs and 10.30 in the rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the people in the rural areas are indifferent in the matter, but it would be better to even up the hours.  It would be absurd to have a gap of half an hour between the closing of a public house immediately on the outskirts of a borough and a public house in the borough.  If this amendment makes the hours the same, I think it would be better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnLynch" hpid="Mr. E. Lynch Mr. E. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Senator Goulding give us any good or valid reason why the difference should not prevail?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing is that most of the boroughs are closer to the country than say Dublin is.  They are in the nature of large towns.  There is a considerable area of agricultural land in their immediate neighbourhood, and I think the gap between the two would create an awkward situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought to be quite clear about the position.  The position is that this House decided in favour of a 10 o'clock closing at night.  That was carried so far as the boroughs are concerned. It was then proposed, logically, to have uniformity by having a closing hour of 10 o'clock outside the boroughs.  There was some discussion on that.  The case was made&mdash;which I agreed to as a compromise, but which frankly was not very convincing to me &mdash;that there was good reason for differentiation between the boroughs and the rural areas.  Therefore, it was agreed, as a compromise, that there was a case for differentiation.  It looks now&mdash;from the point of view that is being urged, and if the Minister's case is that we should have uniformity&mdash;as if we should make it 10 o'clock all round, and adhere to the position that was taken up at first by the Seanad. <Col N="1354" /> That is assuming that we are now dealing purely with uniformity.  I admit I can see a case for uniformity.  That uniformity ought to be in accordance with the decision of the House.</P>
      <P>There is not an amendment down to make it 10 o'clock because nobody at that time knew we were going back on what was more or less arrived at but, if it is to be 10 o'clock, when we go back to Report there should be some opportunity to decide&mdash;if it is to be uniform&mdash;whether the time be 10 or 10.30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Douglas' statement that it should be 10 o'clock all round to be uniform, if Senator Douglas were conversant with conditions in the country in summer time, he would not advocate that, because many agricultural labourers work until 10 o'clock in the harvesting and hay-making time and it would be a great injustice to them if they could not get a drink without breaking the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not advocating it. I am simply saying that, if that is the case, that is the only way to deal with it.  I am accepting what was agreed to on the last day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was obvious on the last occasion that many Senators were speaking without experience and it is obvious to-day that several Senators are speaking from experience.  There is no reason why they should not voice their opinions, having had experience during the week.  It must have been a great week for the pubs.  There is one argument that I think should be borne in mind, that it would make the law much easier of administration by the Gárdaí if the time were put back to 10.30.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I feel about this is our position as the Seanad.  We have debated the hours at great length and all their effects.  I do not think that, so far, the discussion has revealed any new effects.  We came to a decision by a very large majority.  I am one of those who voted for the hours 10 o'clock to 10 o'clock, and I was greatly influenced by the effect of the <Col N="1355" /> Saturday night drinking hour.  It is proposed now to restore the 10.30 closing hour in the boroughs.  I intend to vote against this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretMaryPearse" hpid="Miss Pearse Miss Pearse">
      <NameTxt>Miss Pearse</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those Senators who have spoken against this amendment, and I will, certainly, vote against it, as I did on the last occasion, because it is bringing back that bad hour&mdash;which is the only way you can describe it&mdash;on Saturday night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. M. O'Dwyer Mr. M. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I also think the Seanad should adhere to its decision on the last occasion.  My principal reason for that is that the present closing hours have been in force for a number of years.  I am sure it was very difficult to operate the law when the hours were originally fixed, but the people have got used to the closing hour both in town and country, and I do not see any reason for changing it. If there is a case of uniformity, as Senator Douglas has said, it should be 10 o'clock all round, and, as far as I know, the people in the country are quite satisfied and are able to carry on their business with a 10 o'clock closing hour.  Therefore, if there is to be uniformity, it should be 10 o'clock in town and country or, alternatively, if different hours are to be fixed, the Seanad should adhere to its amendment and insist on the 10 o'clock closing in urban districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is the same analogy.  As Senator Counihan has pointed out, the reason why we ask for a change in the country is that in summer time what we call 10 o'clock is 9 o'clock, and in a great many places they follow the natural time and 10 o'clock is only 8.30.  Personally, I did not vote on that.  I am altogether with the Minister. I am only interested in what the public want and I do not know what the public in Dublin want.  We talk about uniformity but, even at the moment, we have not complete uniformity.  In Dublin to-day, public houses are closed from 2.30 to 3.30 and, if you were to go to Galloping Green, you could get a drink during those hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1356" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Johnston Mr. Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the suggestion to have uniformity.  I live in the country and have some experience in this matter, being centrally situated between two towns in County Monaghan.  I think it would facilitate the Gárdaí in carrying out the licensing laws if the same hour were fixed for town and country.  I strongly protest against any extension of half an hour or an hour at night.  That would only give facilities to people to spend more of their money on intoxicating drinks and to injure themselves and their families.  I think we should have some concern for the people whom we represent and for those who cannot come here to speak for themselves&mdash;mothers and children and those who are dependent on their husbands' earnings.  I do not think this House should agree to any extension or to any hours different from those that have been in operation for a number of years.  If it were extended to 10.30 it would be an argument for extending it to 12 or having all night drinking.  I am not speaking against licensed vintners who manage their public houses well, but I am opposed to those who do not manage them well.  Those people who manage their business well do not want extended hours.  I have discussed the matter with owners of rural licensed premises and they, certainly, do not want an extension of the hours.  It would mean that they would have to stay up, particularly on Saturday night, until midnight to get their work cleared up.  They do not want it, and I do not think this House should extend the hours at the will of&mdash;I will not say whom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present moment, we know that what is legally 10.30 is 9 o'clock in the country.  If the Government learned sense and applied double summer time which, in my observation where it applies, is a most useful thing, that would mean that people in the country, nominally being put out of the pubs at 10.30, would really be put out at 8 o'clock. Once the law says that the sun's 8 o'clock is 10.30 by law, the people in the country would be put out at 8 o'clock or, at least, they would not <Col N="1357" /> be put out, because they would not be there; they would be at work.  It seems to me that, in this, we have really to think of the rights of the public primarily and, secondarily, of the convenience of the Guards.  I think you have first of all to judge what is most suitable in the country and then to consider whether, without impinging too much upon that, you can have uniformity.  It seems to me that we have suddenly assumed that the only thing that matters is uniformity and that, no matter what goes by the board, we will have that.  It seems to me Senators should consider what suits the general life of people in the country and see if, retaining that, you can have uniformity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but I was asked since.  I said the case that was made in the Dáil was made for the country public houses, because farm workers would be working late in the fields, and that really no effort was made, as far as I knew, to prove it was necessary in the city.  When asked for my opinion here to-day, I said that, from the point of view of the convenience of the Gárdaí, and of the public, to some extent, it would be much better to have the closing hour uniform. I would hold out for the country having the 10.30 closing hour.</P>

      <P>I have not much to say now.  I said all I had to say during the last discussion of the matter.  I would like to point out to Senator Fitzgerald, who argued about the terrible handicap that the observance of sun time would impose on people in the country, that if they were living in Australia and were observing Australian time, they would be put out of the public house the day before.  I do not see any point in the Senator's argument at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if people are serious in their objection to the extra half-hour in the rural districts, they should go the whole hog and say we should not have public houses open at all.  I am in favour of the extra half-hour, and of giving the people who live in the country some freedom, because, so far as the sale of intoxicating liquor is concerned, the experience of other countries has shown that the more restrictions you impose in regard to the sale of it, the more disastrous are the results that follow.  It is not, I suggest, in line with the facts to say that it is going to impose a hardship on publicans in the country if they have to keep open until 10.30.  My trouble when I am in the country, and I spend a good deal of my time there, is to get to bed before 1.30 in the morning. In the country most people do not finish their work until about 10.30.  In this Bill we are pretending to be giving accommodation to them.  If so, then I think we should acknowledge the right of the man in the country to be able to get a drink up to 10.30.</P>
      <P>We are allowing the people in the cities to be able to get a drink up to what we regard as a reasonable hour. It is up to us, I suggest, to go an equal distance so far as people in the country are concerned.  Therefore, we should fix a closing hour that will suit them. If a Bill were introduced to abolish new time in the rural areas, a lot of people in the country would, I think, be in favour of it, and of having uniform hours for town and country. It is a waste of time to be discussing new time and old time for the simple reason that no matter what we say on the matter, or what time the clock in the G.P.O. may show, the people in the rural areas will continue to observe old time.  Therefore, I suggest the Seanad should fix an hour to accommodate the people in the rural districts.</P>

      <P>One would imagine <Col N="1359" /> from Senator Quirke's speech that this Bill was proposing to impose restrictions on the sale of intoxicating liquor. As far as I understand it, it is doing the opposite, because the aggregate hours during which drink may be sold are being extended.  I am inclined to agree with Senator Douglas that if there is to be uniformity it ought to be on the basis of a 10 o'clock opening and a 10 o'clock closing.  On the other hand, having regard to the case put by those who have come from the agricultural districts, there may be some point in the case made by Senator Counihan that the closing hour in the country should be extended to 10.30, especially in view of the hours worked by the agriculturists during the summer months.  I do not see that that is any reason why the hours should be extended to 10.30 in the county boroughs.  Business, industry and commerce close down in the cities between 5 and 6, and surely to goodness that allows adequate time for people to get all the refreshment they are physically or financially able to procure.  I do not think any case has been made for reversing the decision arrived at by the Seanad on this matter on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>We ought, first of all, to be clear on this&mdash;that the question of hours in the rural areas is not under discussion on this amendment. Like other Senators, I listened very carefully to the very long debate that we had on this question of hours on the Committee Stage of the Bill. Having done so, I came to the conclusion that there was a great deal to be said for giving the extra half-hour in the country, as well as for fixing the closing hour in the boroughs at 10 o'clock.  I have heard nothing here to-day that would lead me to change my opinion.  If the Minister, or any other person thinks that serious arguments have been discovered during the week as to why there should be uniformity, or as to why the city houses should not close until 10.30, then we ought to be given these arguments.  It seems to me that this debate is one that will bring home very forcibly to the Minister, <Col N="1360" /> and to everybody concerned, the necessity for coming to some decision soon with regard to the need for having standard Irish time.  I wonder if, in due course, we do come to the conclusion that it is necessary to go back to standard Irish time, will it be possible to do that under the Bill as it stands, or will it be necessary to bring in an amending Bill, or how can it be done.  I imagine that a change to Irish time is not a remote possibility.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to this matter is as Senator Douglas has indicated.  We agreed to extend the hours during the summertime period to 10.30 p.m. outside the county boroughs.  The proposal now is to extend them to 10.30 during summer time within the county boroughs. Apart from the uniformity argument, nothing has been said in favour of the proposed change.  Even the Minister himself seems to be rather lukewarm on the matter.  I do not know whether there is any great demand for the 10.30 closing hour in the county boroughs.  It means an extension of the hours for drinking.  I have never heard any great demand for an extension of the closing hours to 10.30 on week nights or any other night.  On the last occasion, the Minister described how that arose in the Dáil. The hours that we agreed to on the last occasion, 10.30 p.m. during summer time outside the county boroughs and 10 p.m. within the county boroughs, would appear to be the most rational, and the only ones that were argued for.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, Section 4, paragraph (A), to delete paragraph (b) (i) and to insert in lieu thereof a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in the case of the County Borough of Dublin or the Dublin metropolitan area before the hour of 1 o'clock in the afternoon or between the hours of 3 o'clock and 5 o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of 7 o'clock in the evening.</P>
      <P>This amendment is similar to one that I moved on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It makes provision for three periods: an opening hour, a split hour, and a closing hour.  My proposal is that public houses in the county borough be permitted to open on Sundays between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., that they be required to close between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m., and to open again between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.  That will give a four-hour opening.  It seems to me that these hours are reasonable.  On the last occasion I gave my reasons in favour of having the opening hour at 1 o'clock. There are a good many reasons why that should be so.  Many other licensed premises are open at 1 o'clock&mdash;clubs, restaurants, and fully-licensed hotels&mdash; and it would be reasonable to allow the ordinary licensed houses to open at the same hour.  I have seen people going into clubs at 1 o'clock, and, as I said on the last occasion, it would be better if they went into ordinary licensed premises which are under control and where they would be amongst strangers. In clubs, everyone knows everyone else, and there is a likelihood of people taking more drink than they would in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public houses should remain open for, at least, two hours, as a shorter period would be very confusing to the owners and to the public. The time goes very quickly and there would, otherwise, be a general rush. When a place is doing a good business, <Col N="1362" /> it takes a considerable time to get ready for an opening later on at 5 o'clock, and it would not inconvenience the public if the proprietor and assistants were allowed, at least, two hours to have their meal in peace and quietness.  The Minister is anxious that the closing hour should be 7 o'clock, and has given his reasons for that, which are accepted, I presume. It is well to have the places open in the city until 7 o'clock, so that the period between that and 8 o'clock, when the <i>bona fide</i> places close, will be too short to make it worth while for those fond of drink to go out there to indulge in more, as would happen in Dublin or the county borough.  I feel that this is a better arrangement and I have pleasure in proposing it.</P>

It would be unfair to change back to 1 o'clock now.</P>

      <P>Like many other Senators, I find the whole position rather bewildering.  Since the last meeting I have had communications from members of the trade, and have had conversations with several of them. With very great respect to them, I find, as in the case of the Seanad, that they are not by any means in complete agreement.  There seems to be a great deal to be said, from their point of view, for three hours on Sunday, and some would prefer three.  I was originally of the opinion that, while the case had been made by the Minister for changing the hours, three hours on Sunday was ample, and I confess I am still of that opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two proposals before the House&mdash;one by Senator Conlon and the other by the Minister.  The Minister brought in his amendment because the case with which it deals was put up by a few people.  I think his amendment <Col N="1363" /> is not much of a compromise, and that the best hours are not down in any of the amendments.  The best hours would be 1 to 2.30, and 5 to 7, which would be three and a half hours&mdash;a compromise between four hours, originally suggested, and three hours, which is the present position.  I have not consulted any members of the trade, but I have read most of the documents they have given to me, and it is my candid opinion that that would represent a fair compromise.</P>
    <P>I have no amendment down to achieve that, as I either misread it or there was a typing error in the first amendment proposed by Senator Conlon, to make the hours 1 to 2 and 5 to 7.  I had not the courage to propose an amendment increasing the hours proposed by Senator Conlon. I was satisfied to vote for them, so I did not put down an amendment to have the hours 1 to 2.30.  I do not feel very strongly on this point.  It is the Minister's desire to have the houses remain open until 7 o'clock, and I think that should be tried, so I am not going to oppose the hours 5 to 7.</P>

      <P>I was in favour of a 1.30 opening also, as 1 o'clock would interfere with those who play games in the morning.  The matches at Croke Park begin at 11.45 a.m. and there would not be time afterwards to get back for an opening at 1 o'clock.  I do not think a half hour makes a great difference, but there is another side to the matter.  The assistants are supposed to work for four hours on Sunday in order to get the additional weekly half-holiday, and that will not be the case if they work for only three hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have read the documents I have received from interested parties.  The public houses have to be open by law up to a certain time.  The assistant will have an additional half-holiday by reason of their doing an extra half-hour on Sunday.  That means that the owners will not be able to have any holiday at all, if the information I have is correct.  In view of that, I would be ready to hear any case to be made, that equity has been reached by the present holidays the assistants have.  I think 3½ hours would be better than four.  I am not very interested in this national pastime.  I was not quite sure whether Senator Goulding was talking about pitch and toss, which is the most widespread game.  I am more interested in the convenience of the public than in the vested interests of an athletic association.  I do not see why we should be asked to make the public houses open for an extra half-hour on Sundays, in order to add in a half holiday for the assistants.  We should exclude that from our minds, and consider instead the most suitable hours for Sundays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My anxiety was in regard to the hour of 7 o'clock.  I am more concerned with that than anything else.  When fixing the hours, I had to remember that the clubs and hotels opened at 1 o'clock, and that the <i>bona fide</i> trade started at 1 o'clock. I thought, therefore, that 1 o'clock was a more reasonable time.  The assistants came to see me, and they thought we ought not to open in Dublin, in any event, before 2 o'clock. I tried to have that done, and found it very difficult to get agreement. Even yet, I am puzzled as to whether the assistants were more concerned with getting off to play games or with getting these four hours.  I was not a bit concerned with the four hours; I would have preferred to have the three hours, but there would have been a large gap.  My original proposal was 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock and 4 o'clock to 7 o'clock.  If the general public were to be our concern, I imagine that 1 o'clock would be the right time. However, I should not like to see the game of hurling fading out of Dublin. I have always been very fond of the game, and I know that it was mainly played by young fellows in grocers' shops.  That may not be sufficient reason for fixing those hours but, at the same time, those people form a considerable section of the community and I do not want to interfere with their position.  Consequently, I suggested 2 o'clock.  I forget what the precise hours were, but they commenced at 2 o'clock.  As a result of the debate here, we agreed to what I have done.  I think it was Senator Foran who suggested it.  It went halfway to meet the 1 o'clock demand of <Col N="1366" /> the publicans and the demand of the assistants.  As a result of that agreement, I brought in that amendment. Naturally, the Seanad can do what it likes about it.  I have been asked whether the public houses are bound to open.  There is no compulsion; they need not open at all if the owners so desire.  They cannot stay open longer than the hours permitted, but they need not open if they do not feel like it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for themselves. I do not know anything about this bargaining position which has been mentioned.  I heard it raised in this House and in the other House, but it did not influence me one way or the other.  I am told that if the assistants have to work over four hours on Sunday they are entitled to an extra half-day. If they have to work four hours, the cleaning and so on brings them over four hours and, consequently, they are entitled to an extra half-day. That is not a matter with which I was concerned, but I am told that it is so. In any case it does not arise in the Bill.  We are fixing 1.30 to 3 o'clock and those hours were brought in as a result of general agreement.  The whole thing is very confusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Minister's suggestion.  I do so not solely in the interests of those who take part in hurling games on Sundays but also for other reasons. Very large numbers of people go to 11.30 or 12 Mass on Sunday and I suggest that if the public houses were to open at 1 o'clock there would be a drift from the churches to the public houses from 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock, and that would upset the whole arrangements in those people's homes.  I think Senator Johnston said that we should take those domestic arrangements into consideration.  If the opening hour of the public houses is 1.30, that means that those people will have got their mid-day meal.  We all know that the gas is cut off at 1.30.  Consequently, the mid-day meal is over at 1.30 or <Col N="1367" /> 2 o'clock, and anyone who wants a drink will have from 2 o'clock to 3 o'clock to get it.  In the evening also they would have their meal over before going to get a drink.  I think the hours suggested by the Minister are the most acceptable that can be devised.  There has not been any great case made for opening at 1 o'clock, except that the grocers themselves have some idea that the trade which is at present going to the clubs might be diverted to the public houses, but I do not think the club trade is so great as to make any difference.  I do think that 1.30 is a reasonable hour.  As I have said, if the public houses open at 1 o'clock, a lot of people will be induced to drift in there and stay until 3 o'clock.  I think the hours suggested by the Minister are the most acceptable and we will support his amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to say something now in favour of amendment No. 4 which I have on the Order Paper.  I should prefer the hours from 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock, and I think Senator Campbell is not very complimentary to the people when he suggests that they would leave the church and go straight across to the public house.  With regard to the 1 o'clock opening interfering with those who play hurley and other games, I regret to say that, in my opinion, the number of grocers' assistants who take part in those games is very small.  I cannot make an exact statement about that, but I know that in the case of one particular house about which I made inquiries, there were ten assistants, only one of whom plays those games.  However, there seems to be a general opinion that 1.30 would be more suitable. The majority seem to hold that view.  If that be so, I think it would be better to have a break of two hours, from 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  That would <Col N="1368" /> be little enough.  The proprietors and assistants and everybody else, having cleaned up the place, would require some little time for their meals.  I am speaking now in favour of amendment No. 4.  I presume the question will be put as to whether the opening hour should be 1 o'clock or 1.30.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the premises should be opened at 1.30 until 3 p.m., and that then there should be a break until 5 o'clock when they would again open until 7 o'clock. I understand that the Minister's attitude is that he would prefer an opening from 1.30 to 3 p.m., and that there should be a break until 4.30.  I, however, suggest that the break should be from 3 o'clock until 5 o'clock, as some assistants live a considerable distance from the houses in which they work, and it would be a great rush if they had to return within one and a half hours after 3 o'clock for the second opening.</P>

So far as the proposal for a 1 o'clock opening was concerned, I merely wanted to see what was the attitude of the House towards that proposal, and the reason I supported the proposal was that I did not want the clubs to have any advantage as against licensed houses. I do not see why they should have any advantage in that respect.  However, as we could not get agreement on the matter, we have to try to reach the best compromise possible.  If I felt that a 1 o'clock opening would mean dragging a young fellow from healthy open air exercise to attend behind a bar, I should certainly be opposed to it.  So far as I am concerned, I definitely support the last two amendments proposed by Senator Conlon, <Col N="1369" /> and I hope the House will agree to them, so that when the Bill gets back to the Dáil there will be a total opening of 3½ hours on Sunday, as against the four hours originally proposed.</P>

      <P>On the last day on which the Bill was before the House, we had considerable discussion on the question of hours, and we have not so far arrived at complete unanimity.  On the question of facilitating those assistants who play hurling or other games on a Sunday forenoon, I think we would agree that the extra half-hour which the 1.30 opening, would allow them is little enough to enable them to participate in those games.  There must, however, be some little give and take in this matter and I think, therefore, we should not have a two-hour break after the first period of opening. We are facilitating assistants who play games by fixing the early opening at 1.30.  In other municipalities the opening would still be 1 o'clock but we are allowing the assistants an extra half-hour in Dublin to enable them to participate in these games.  The break of two hours is necessary for the assistants as well as for the public, especially for those who frequent public houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to support this amendment even though it means an opening of half an hour less than that desired, by the Labour representatives.  I think the difficulty which they foresee can easily be got over if it is understood that the assistants' work will not cease immediately the door closes.  The hours 1.30 to 3 p.m. were arrived at after considerable discussion, as a sort of compromise and offer the best arrangement provided by any of the amendments. I wish to support it for the reason that it facilitates the assistants who play games in the forenoon.  They are facilitated again later in the day when they have a two-hour break.  The only drawback in this arrangement is that mentioned by the Labour representatives, that the assistants will have to work only three and a half hours instead of four hours.  I think that they should be satisfied by the fact that the assistants will probably <Col N="1370" /> work inside the premises for at least half an hour after the place is closed.</P>
    <P>May I say, as I am on my feet, that my impression is that in this Bill we are legislating for about 10 per cent. of the population.  As far as 60 per cent. of the population is concerned, they would not be worried in the least if the public houses were closed all day for every day of the week or, on the other hand, if they were opened all day for every day of the week. A further 30 per cent like to be facilitated when they want a drink, but it would not make any great difference to them if the public houses were open all day or closed for a certain period. It is for the remaining 10 per cent. who do not know how to conduct themselves when they get drink that we have to pass this legislation.  One unruly person in a bus on a Sunday evening can destroy the pleasure of the remaining passengers, and it is unfortunately necessary to pass this legislation in order to control this remaining 10 per cent. who are unable to control themselves when they take drink. We have to consider them in fixing the hours for night closing and for Sunday closing.  As far as the majority of us are concerned it would not worry us in the least if the public houses were opened for the whole week.  Some people, like Senator Robinson, may talk about restricting the liberties of the people but, as I say, it would not worry the big majority of the people if public houses were open or closed all the week.  We must, however, legislate to control people who are not able to control themselves when they take drink.  I think that amendment No. 4 is the most acceptable of those before the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that I support the agreement which has been arrived at mainly because it reduces the number of hours during which drink may be sold in Dublin from four to three and a half.  Even these hours are, in my opinion, too long because it must be remembered that licensed premises in country districts are not allowed to open at all for ordinary traffic on Sundays.  There is no reason, in my opinion, why any <Col N="1371" /> greater facilities should be provided for licensed premises in cities.

      <P>I should like to support amendment No. 4, in Senator Conlon's name, if it were quite certain that the assistants would not be penalised under it, as they will be penalised if we deprive them of the opportunity of getting compensation for their Sunday work.  Most people are not supposed to work on Sunday, but there was an arrangement by which, if a man worked for four hours on a Sunday in a public house, he would be compensated by getting a half-holiday in respect of that work during the week.  I hope it will be made plain that the work done by these assistants after closing will count for that purpose, and that their work will not be confined merely to the opening hours.  If that could be secured, I would be whole-heartedly in favour of the amendment.</P>

      <P>Listening to Senator O'Donovan, I was almost forced to the conclusion that this was a Criminal Law Amendment Bill and not an Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  I cannot see anything in the Bill, however, dealing with crime or with obstreperous persons in buses.  Certainly, we are not legislating in this matter to control persons who are not able to control themselves.  In regard to Senator Conlon's amendment, it reduces the period of opening from four hours to three and a half hours, and, as Senator Mrs. Concannon has pointed out, this alternative is unquestionably put forward to deprive the assistant of the arrangement secured to him by the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act.  It is manifestly unfair that he should be asked to work a very small period of time less than that necessary to qualify him for the compensation which he would get in the following week if he worked four hours on Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> It must be realised that if this amendment is enacted he will be engaged for a shorter period in actually serving behind the counter, but he has to spend a certain portion of the time tidying up in the shop after the customers have left.  A certain amount of time is also occupied in getting back to his residence where he hopes to enjoy himself for the rest of the evening in the domestic circle.  All these extra times, outside the actual time he is serving liquor, will not be taken into consideration so as to entitle him to some leave by way of compensation in the following week.  That factor ought to be borne in mind by Senators when they come to a decision on this amendment.  Apart from the time in which the assistant is serving liquor, there are certain other factors and I wonder whether they could be taken into consideration in the making up of the four-hour period.  It seems only reasonable that if the assistant is to be brought in for three and a half hours he should get the compensation in the following week, though at the moment he is not statutorily entitled to it.  I think that point should be remembered when we are deciding on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the point raised by Senator Lynch, I am not perfectly certain, but to the best of my belief, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has considerable powers to make Orders providing for a modification of certain provisions of the Shops Act.  I am not quite certain whether he could deal with a matter of this kind by means of such an Order, but the one thing I am quite clear on is this&mdash;that the question of just compensation to the assistants for the extra half-hour they will be working should be dealt with on its merits by the Government, if there cannot be agreement between the unions and the trade, and should not be allowed to influence what are proper or desirable hours for the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are of the opinion that 3½ hours are better than 4 hours, then to say that you must have licensed houses open an extra half-hour in order to meet a peculiar and, to my mind, <Col N="1373" /> badly drafted section of another Act, is absurd.  We should vote on the merits of this proposal as it stands. That it is beyond the capacity of the unions and the trade to find a reasonable way out of this difficulty, I do not believe.  I am of the opinion that it could be done within the Act.  If not, the Minister has a fair amount of discretion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnLynch" hpid="Mr. E. Lynch Mr. E. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Douglas, I would like to point out that the Oireachtas has statutorily given to assistants and other who work four hours on Sunday certain compensation from the point of view of time during the following week.  That is a statutory right enjoyed by workers, a right given them by the Oireachtas.  Does it not seem to be a rather sharp practice to ask a person to work just a little less than the qualifying period&mdash; in this case three and a half hours? Why not make it three and three-quarter hours, or three hours and 50 minutes, or three hours and 59¾ minutes, just so as to deprive the assistant of a right he has been enjoying? That is why we consider that the period might be left at four hours rather than three and a half hours, or otherwise abolish it altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to repudiate the suggestion made by Senator Lynch that amendment No. 4 was deliberately put down in order to deprive the assistants of any benefits they possess. I think it is enough for me to point out that I have submitted an amendment which suggests a period of four hours.  From the trend of the discussion, I have come to the conclusion that the majority of people would prefer 1.30.  That being so, I am strongly of the view that there should be this break of two hours.  I should like to emphasise that amendment No. 4 was put down without any thought of what Senator Lynch suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit we are not legislating for the assistants or for members of the licensed trade.  We are trying to arrive at hours which will suit the general public and which will, in a general way, cause the least amount <Col N="1374" /> of trouble.  So far as the assistants are concerned, they are well able to fight their own corner&mdash;in the past they have done that quite successfully. They derive the full benefit of the Act, which provides that they are to work only 48 hours a week and, if any point arises in regard to half an hour, I am sure that the assistants and the members of the licensed trade will be well able to arrive at an amicable arrangement. We ought to be able to decide this matter on its merits, having in view the convenience of the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that we should legislate only for the general public and not for any sectional interest.  At the same time, I would not like to deprive any section of the community of the rights that they enjoy.  I am not quite clear as to Senator Lynch's point.  At the moment the assistants work only three hours on Sunday.  Do they get half a day in the following week by way of compensation? I do not understand how we are likely to inflict any injury on them, and I should like that point explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position with regard to that&mdash;it is not a matter of dispute&mdash;is that at present they work three hours and do not get the extra half-day under the law.  If it were made four hours they would get the extra half-day.  Therefore, the suggestion is that we should make it four hours so that they would get it. They have not got it at the moment. While I feel that something might be done with regard to the extra half-hour, I object to being coerced into having longer hours in order to get for the assistants something which they have not at the moment.</P>

      <P>I think it is only right to point out that the assistants have not made any representations for a two-hour break.  The impression might be gathered from Senator O'Donovan that he was speaking on behalf of the assistants.  With regard to Senator Douglas' point, at present the assistants work from 2 to 5.  If the new hours come into operation there will be a spread-over of six or seven <Col N="1375" /> hours, from 1 o'clock to 7.30.  There is a very big difference.  Even if they work only an hour extra they are entitled to compensation for that extra Sunday work.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to Senator Campbell that I was not speaking on anybody's behalf. I was merely giving my opinion as to what would be just and fair.  I hold no brief for anybody, but if I were to speak on anybody's behalf, it would be on behalf of those associated with the G.A.A., those who play hurling and football on Sunday morning.  Surely, the hours of workers are not to be regulated by the time that the public house is legally opened and closed?  I cannot picture assistants finishing their employment at the closing hour.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that I would not like to deprive the assistants of any facilities they may have got through legislation.  I think some consideration should be given to the actual hours that the assistants work.  I was in a court last week, and it was stated in one case there that the assistants were fully half an hour trying to clear a public house.  Of course, all we can set down in a Bill is that the door of the public house must be closed at a certain time, and no more drink served. We are not setting down that the opening and closing hours are the hours between which assistants will work.</P>

      <P>I have been interviewed by the assistants and by the employers, and I have been struck by the reasonableness of the arguments put forward by both of these parties. So far as the question of the hours is concerned, I came to it with an entirely open mind, but I must say that, in considering the question of clubs, and the fact that the assistants considered that they should get four hours, I am in favour of the 1 to 3 and 5 to 7.  Apparently, however, that does not find favour in the House or find favour with the Minister and, therefore, cannot be done.  As far as the G.A.A. is concerned, I have been in sympathy all my life with the people who play these games&mdash;or, <Col N="1376" /> indeed, any games&mdash;on Sundays, and I would rather have the hour 1.30 o'clock than one, from that point of view, but it has been suggested to me that the number of people who play these games nowadays is by no means as large as it was in my earlier days, or in the days with which the Minister was familiar.  That, of course, is a matter on which we cannot get statistical or reliable information, but I have been informed that that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnLynch" hpid="Mr. E. Lynch Mr. E. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Senator Lynch does not want to make my speech for me.  I am not basing my arguments on statistics.  I am simply making a statement to the effect that, according to information I have got, dealing with two or three public houses in the city, the number of people employed in these houses would be about 16, while the number of assistants in them who take part in hurling on Sundays&mdash;hurling being, I think, the principal Gaelic game&mdash;is two.  As I say, we have not got the figures as to the number of people who play the G.A.A. games on Sundays&mdash;and I suppose hurling would be the principal game&mdash; and, therefore, we are not in a position to base a case on that.  I am in agreement with Senator Lynch so far as that is concerned, but Senator Lynch did not make a case for his point, either. Therefore, I am anxious to meet the views of the assistants, the employers, and the public.  I have no particular interest in the matter, nor have I much knowledge of the inside of public houses, but, with regard to this question of the half-day, so far as the assistants are concerned, I understand that the position is that if the assistants work four hours on a Sunday, they have to get a half-day off in the afternoon of the following week, and that question of the afternoon makes a great difference.  We should all prefer to get the second half of the day off rather than the first half, but when it comes to this question of the people <Col N="1377" /> who play these games being free up to 1.30, it should be remembered that the people who work in clubs begin their work at 1 o'clock.  I am sure that Senator Lynch knows that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the truth is that, if we consider the matter from the point of view of the public interest, we ought to consider it from the point of view of the hours that would best suit the public, and then leave it to the employers and employees to settle the matter between themselves as to how it will work out. However, if we cannot agree on the 1 to 3 and 5 to 7, I am still in favour of the two-hour break, and in favour of the 1.30 to 3 and 5 to 7 proposal. I feel, with Senator Douglas, that the rest can be settled afterwards between the assistants and their employers.  I think that the argument that has been put up with regard to this question of the three and a half hours is rather unfair.  Certainly, from the point of view of the public, if there is going to be a break at all, it should be a two-hour break, and I think I was the first person to suggest in this House, in the discussion on the Committee Stage, that we should have 1.30 to 3 and 5 to 7.  Senator Foran altered that by making it 1.30 to 3 and 4.30 to 7, in order that the assistants should get their extra half-day off in the afternoon, as contrasted with the morning. That, of course, might lead to extra employment, which might be a desirable thing in public houses where six or seven assistants are employed but, in the case of the smaller houses, where there are only one or two assistants employed&mdash;and these houses would constitute the largest number in the city&mdash;it would mean very considerable hardship upon the employer himself, working, apparently, in a small way.  As I say, I think I was the first person to make the suggestion in this House with regard to 1.30, in order to <Col N="1378" /> meet the Minister's case with regard to the 1 to 3 and 5 to 7, and I think that that is the best proposal that has emerged from our discussion.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the discussion, but as far as I know, there are more of these people playing G.A.A. games now than there were 30 years ago.  I know of one house, for instance, where five people are engaged, and they are all playing G.A.A. games.  I think the Minister will admit that the only people engaged in the industry who approached the Minister were those who played G.A.A. games, and that they approached him from that point of view.

      <P>I should like to say a final word.  As far as I am concerned, I was not influenced in any way by the number of hours which the assistants have to work.  Senator O'Donovan says that he is not speaking on behalf of anybody, but it is quite clear that Senator Lynch is speaking on behalf of the assistants.  I am not speaking on behalf of anybody.  I am expressing my own views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know sufficient about the interests of the people who are engaged in the licensed trade to speak on their behalf, but I think that something could be said on their behalf as well as on behalf of the assistants.  I think that some consideration should be given to them as well as to the assistants.  I forget the number of hours during which licensed premises must remain open, but I think it is 72 hours.  The assistants have to get a day off in the week and, in addition to that, a half-day, as well as every third Sunday, as a result of legislation <Col N="1379" /> that has been passed, but I do not know how the licensed trader can get a day off for himself at all.  At one time, they had representation in this House, but owing to the new system of election they have lost that representation. I do not want to delay the House further, but I wish to point out that there are two sides to every question, and if we are to discuss the merits of one side of a case, then we should also pay attention to the other side.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and to substitute therefor the following four sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a committee of assessors who investigated a claim for compensation under Section 18 of the Principal Act has disallowed, at any time before the appointed day, the claim in whole or in part, then if, but only if, the claimant, within 14 days after the appointed day, requests the board in writing to refer his claim to the standing referee and deposits with the board the appropriate appeal fee, the board shall refer the claim to the standing referee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Whenever a committee of assessors investigating a claim for compensation under Section 18 of the Principal Act or Section 14 <Col N="1383" /> (which relates to compensation in respect of lost or damaged live stock exported via Northern Ireland) of this Act disallows, on or after the appointed day, the claim in whole or in part, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the board shall serve on the claimant notice in writing of the determination of the said committee of assessors,</P>
    <P>(b)  if, but only if, the claimant, within fourteen days after such service, requests the board in writing to refer his claim to the standing referee and deposits with the board the appropriate appeal fee, the board shall refer the claim to the standing referee.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the board refer under this section a claim for compensation to the standing referee, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the standing referee shall rehear the claim and his determination (both as to the right to the compensation and the amount (if any) thereof) on such rehearing shall be final and conclusive;</P>
    <P>(b)  if, on such rehearing, the standing referee reverses the decision of the committee of assessors who investigated the claim, the board shall refund to the claimant the appropriate appeal fee, but otherwise shall retain it and pay it into the Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Fund.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section the expression &ldquo;the appropriate appeal fee,&rdquo; in relation to the reference, under this section, to a claim for compensation to the standing referee, means a sum equal to ten pounds or five per cent. of the appointed minimum value of each animal to which the claim relates, whichever is the greater.</P>

    <P>In sub-section (4) of amendment No. 1, immediately after the word &ldquo;means&rdquo;, to insert the words:&mdash;&ldquo;in case the claim relates to animals exported before the appointed day a <Col N="1384" /> sum equal to ten pounds or five per cent. of the declared value, within the meaning of the Principal Act, of each animal to which the claim relates, whichever is the greater, or in any other case.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This amendment covers the point raised by Senators on the Second Stage.  The effect of it is to make it possible to have claims already settled referred retrospectively to the referee who is being appointed under this Bill to deal with appeals.  I do not think that there is very much necessity to explain the amendment or to argue its merits.  On the Second Stage, I said that if the proposal were practicable I would be glad to bring in such an amendment.  The effect will be that any claim already disposed of since the board was set up can, under the conditions laid down here, be referred to the referee.  Senators will see, of course, that no vexatious claims will be submitted because a fairly substantial deposit must be lodged before a claim will be submitted for re-examination or appeal.  The amendment, of course, embodies the provisions already in the Bill dealing with future appeals.</P>

      <P>The national executive, like most other bodies, object to retrospective legislation but, if the Minister takes responsibility for the amendment, I am instructed to raise no objection.  The insurance board have asked me to say that they welcome the proposal, but the national executive have decided objections to it. The board believe that, if they erred at all in their awards, it was because they were too generous in the amounts they awarded.  Ninety-five per cent. of the exporters are satisfied that their claims have been fairly well and justly met and the dissatisfied 5 per cent., who are now kicking up a row and clamouring for this retrospective legislation, are the people who got the greatest concessions from the board and the greatest consideration for their claims.  They are people who are principally engaged in the export of springers and milch cows and these people had their insurance premiums at the flat rate <Col N="1385" /> which every other class of stock had to pay&mdash;a flat rate at the present time of 10/- per cent.  Previously, under every private insurance company, that class of stock had to pay a premium one and a half times the amount payable on ordinary stock going from port to port or store cattle going up the country.  I think it is a great tribute to the board and it shows that, if anything, they were too generous, that only 5 per cent. of the whole cattle trade object to the awards which they made.  The Minister and the House, I am sure, will agree that if a board of archangels were set up, not only for the cattle trade but for anyone that might have claims, 100 per cent. of the claimants would not be satisfied with the amount of compensation awarded by the assessors.  I think it is a great tribute to the board that only 5 per cent. of the claims were disputed and that only 5 per cent. of all those who are insuring are dissatisfied with the awards.  The Minister is taking responsibility for this retrospective legislation.  The board welcome it and I, on behalf of the national executive, will offer no opposition to it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment prescribes something with which, I am sure, the Minister will agree, but, to put the question beyond doubt and to regularise the matter, I put down the amendment. The national executive are anxious that the referee who will be appointed will be a man of sound common sense, that he will have an intimate knowledge of the cattle trade, but, at the same time, that he should not be engaged in the export of live stock, or have very many friends or relations <Col N="1386" /> engaged in the export of live stock. To ensure that the referee will have these qualifications and fulfil these requirements, I think the Minister should consult the national executive. Of course, the responsibility of the appointment will still be with the Minister, and all I ask for in the amendment is that the national executive will be consulted.  I might say the national executive and the board are two distinct bodies.</P>

    <P>(2)  Each of the persons, who are members of the board immediately after the appointment mentioned in sub-section (1) of this section, shall, unless he sooner dies, resigns or becomes disqualified, hold office until the day in the year 1945 on which the national executive appoint, in pursuance of sub-section (3) of this section, nine members of the board.</P>

    <P>(a)  each of the three (to be selected by the national executive at the time of appointment) shall, unless he sooner dies, resigns or becomes disqualified, hold office until the day in the year 1946 on which the national executive appoint, in pursuance of sub-section (4) of this section, three members of the board.</P>
    <P>(b)  each of three (to be selected by the national executive at the time of appointment) shall, unless he sooner dies, resigns or becomes disqualified, hold office until the day in the year 1947 on which the national executive appoint, in pursuance of sub-section (4) of this section, three members of the board;</P>

      <P>This is to cover a point that was raised by Senator Counihan and other Senators with regard to the rotation of the board.  Senator Counihan pointed out, on the Second Stage, that, as the original Act stands, it is rather dangerous that the whole board should go out after five years, and, possibly, a completely new board be elected.  It is extremely difficult to get exactly what Senator Counihan wanted.  As a matter of fact, under this amendment, the whole board will go out after five years, i.e., in 1945, but from that time forward, there will be a rotation of retirals and elections. Three will go out each year, and will be replaced by three, so that any three members who are elected at a certain time will be there for three years, and it will not be possible, after that period, to have a complete clearance of the board.</P>

      <P>The only difference between this amendment and the amendment in my name is that my amendment provides for continuity of the board.  Under the Government amendment the whole board goes out in 1945, and after that, there will be continuity.  I am <Col N="1389" /> sorry that the Minister could not see his way to accept the amendment in my name, because the board has given complete satisfaction, and it is a pity to put the whole board out in 1945, or involve some of them in the risk of being knocked out.  But, as the Minister has said that it is difficult to frame an amendment to meet that case &mdash;I thought I had done so&mdash;I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of this motion on the last occasion, I had gone far, I thought, to enlighten the Seanad, in so far as it was possible for me to do so, on the necessity for maintaining the fertility of our soil because of the importance to the life of the nation in the future of this very valuable asset.  Generally speaking, I am afraid we have not given enough consideration to this problem because the exhaustion of our soil has been so remote from our thoughts in this century that we have never had to give it much thought. From time to time I have seen various statements which, in a way, seem rather difficult to reconcile.  For example, I read in the daily Press a statement made by the Taoiseach in Tipperary in which he left us to understand that we could go on and on with our tillage policy, that we had enough fertility to draw upon, and that for ten years anyhow we had not to be very concerned about the loss of this fertility. According to him, there was no cause for worry.  At the same time I was impressed by the fact that both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture have adverted to the importance of carrying out our tillage campaign at the present time in those parts of the country where very little tillage has been done in the past, obviously, of course, for the reason that for the period that is immediately <Col N="1392" /> in front of us it is from these lands which have fertility stored up in them we have the best hope of getting such crop yields as will give us an abundant supply of food.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate that I am very concerned about this loss of fertility in our soils.  I will go this far with the Taoiseach that, for a period, we can go on exhausting that fertility and at the same time provide ourselves with a certain quantity of food, but to the extent that we go on exhausting that fertility, and not replacing it, we are leaving the soil derelict, or partially derelict, and so are reducing our capital assets.  The result of that will be that the total crop yields from our soils in the years to come are going to be low.  Consequently, our standard of life, no matter what we may do, will be very low indeed.  In the post-war period, I do not want to see our farmers, because of low crop yields from poor soils, involved in a considerable amount of capital expenditure in order to rejuvenate the land.  I fear that post-war our low yields will be so depressing that our total income will not be anything like adequate to give us, or our labourers, anything approaching a decent standard of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's statement that we can draw on the fertility of our soil to-day, that can only be done at the expense of impoverishing it and ourselves for the morrow. I feel convinced that in the post-war period the struggle is going to be dreadful indeed, even for people tolerably well equipped to meet it.  For that reason, I want to fight as hard as I can to save our capital assets in every respect for the test which confronts us post-war.  We are exhausting our soil fertility at a rather rapid rate.  As the Minister and all of us know, a great deal of our tillage, even at present as well as in the past, has been carried out on our poorer lands.  We have to be continually replacing the fertility in them in order to get a reasonable yield from the crops sown in them.  On a previous occasion I put it to the Minister that over a great part of the country last season the yields per acre were so low that it is <Col N="1393" /> very doubtful if our total food units were any greater in 1942 than in 1941, despite the fact that the area under tillage in 1942 had been increased.  This year we have further increased the area under tillage, and yet I am afraid, because of the poor condition of our soils, that the yields from our crops will not be any greater than they were last year.  Indeed, the yields may be even lower than they were last year. That is an unhappy situation.  These facts can be proven and ought not to be avoided.  This is a national problem that will have to be faced by the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>In this year our total live-stock population is not any higher&mdash;indeed it may be lower&mdash;than it was in 1938. The figure is in or about 4,000,000 head. We have not more farmyard manure this year to put into our land than we had in 1938, although in the latter year we had available something like 200,000 tons of artificial fertilisers.  Obviously, a considerable amount of these fertilisers went on grass land.  The Minister may be able to give us the gross total of artificial fertilisers which he expects. to have available this year.  It is easy to calculate the bulk quantity of fertilisers which we will be able to inject into the soil this year as compared with what went into it in 1938.  It is certain, at any rate, that in this year we are going to draw to a greater extent on our soil fertility than we attempted to do in 1938.  I do not think the Minister for Agriculture will contest this: That you cannot take two or three grain crops, following a root crop, from the land and expect to have healthy soil conditions.  Not only is the fertility of the soil drawn upon by such a process, but the structure of the soil itself is altered.  That will have all sorts of consequences.  Our yields of grain and roots will fall, and if we are putting land to grass the ability to put meat on cattle and draw milk from cows will be affected by such a policy.  The national income of the farming community and the nation will be altered considerably by the lack of health in the soil, as determined by what we draw from it this year as against what we put back.  I fear that we are taking <Col N="1394" /> much more out of it than we are able to put back.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my motion is to urge upon the Minister that action must be taken by him and by the Government. We have no evidence yet that such action has been taken.  I am not saying that the Minister has been idle or that, as between his Department and some Department of the British Government, efforts have not been made to obtain quantities of fertilisers. Whatever has been done, however, has not been effective to the extent desirable and requisite.  If the Minister asked to see his opposite number in Britain, or the head of the Department there whose responsibility it is to distribute artificial fertilisers, in order to discuss with him the whole effect of the shortage on our life here and on the supplies of food available for export from this country, I believe he would be met.  I believe that half an hour's talk between a Minister of this State and a Minister of the British Parliament would bring us at once thousands of tons of artificial fertilisers. That would have a profound influence on the psychological approach of our farmers to the task which confronts them and on our yields of crops this year and in the years to come.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane may have information which I have not.  Apparently, he has the view that Britain has nothing to spare.  I know something about the conditions in the Six Counties.  I know that farmers there have been offered quantities of sulphate of ammonia, at £10 a ton, and I know the price that some of the farmers here would offer and pay for a ton of fertilisers if they could get it. I do not know what is or is not available from Britain, but if I were approaching this, even from the British point of view, I would say that Britain is very hard pressed for food at present.  I suggest that she will be pressed much harder in the next 12 months.  There were days during the last war when she was not very far from surrender, because of the shortage of supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> We have traded with Britain in the past and, as a farmer, I want to continue that trade, and to continue trading with people anywhere with whom it is advantageous to do so.  These are our neighbours.  They have things which we require and which we cannot produce for ourselves.  On the other hand, we have goods which they took from us in the past, not out of love for us, as they took them when their tyranny was at its highest, but because they got good value for the money.  I do not think we are under any obligation to them now, or that we have been in the past, nor do I desire that we should be under any obligation in the future.  It is to Britain's advantage, as well as to our advantage, that there should be the greatest total trade possible between the two islands. I want this trade to be advantageous to us primarily.  A bag of sulphate of ammonia in the Twenty-Six Counties in 1943 can do about 100 per cent. more than the same bag of sulphate of ammonia will do in Britain.  From that point of view of providing a surplus of food here, which can be made available for sale to the people of the Six Counties or of Britain, much more can be done by supplying these artificial fertilisers to us than by retaining very considerable quantities in Britain itself.</P>
    <P>If the people in Britain look out on life with the understanding eyes of men who want to provide their own people with the greatest possible quantity of food in the two or three difficult years ahead, they must realise that no soil anywhere is capable of being exploited in the same fashion, and with the same capital expenditure on fertilisers, as our soil is.  I know the terrific drive there is in Britain to till greater areas.  I know that, for this tillage, it is essential that artificial fertilisers be made available.  I am quite convinced that there could be made available, out of what is going to be applied in Britain, such a quantity of nitrogenous manures like sulphate of ammonia, as would considerably improve the yield from our fields in the coming 12 months.  I do not know <Col N="1396" /> whether such a point of view has been put to Britain or not, nor how the Minister feels about putting that point of view.  He may take the line that we can &ldquo;do without,&rdquo; but I am not satisfied that we can, though I know we can drag along in a rather limping sort of way.  The Minister may have no desire to put pressure on Britain to give us supplies which she says she requires for herself and about which there is no great anxiety on her side to part with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like Senator Sir John Keane and the House to consider this from my point of view as a farmer.  We are sending certain quantities of food-stuffs&mdash;the produce of our soil&mdash;out of the country.  I have the disadvantage of not knowing the figures for our cattle exports.  Each beast is the product of Irish land, from the day the calf is born until it is sent over as a three-year-old bullock or a seven or eight-year-old cow.  Our breweries and distilleries are getting grain, and quantities of the product of that grain are being exported.  In addition, I have pointed out that we are definitely encouraging the production of flax in a way in which the potato crop, essential as it is to our own life here, is not being encouraged.  I have not put down an acre of flax.  I prefer to grow crops which I can either use at home or sell to someone else to be used at home.  But if I proposed to grow an acre of flax, I could go in and buy 1 cwt. of potash.  The whole of last year's crop covered 18,000 acres, which probably yielded 3,000 or 3,500 tons; I do not know what the yield was, but all of that went out of the country. Encouragement of the growth of flax seems to be part of the Government's policy.  For what purpose?  It is not for consumption within the State.  I am not putting our Ministers down as a lot of very stupid people who have not some reason for that encouragement. I feel that they must be getting something out of it.  I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at it from the point of view of Britain, and especially from the <Col N="1397" /> point of view of the industrial community in the Six Counties, I think it would be very greatly to their advantage if more thousands of acres were put under the production of flax here.  In any case, there are definite commodities which our land produces and which we are sending away.  What I am pointing out to the House, and especially in reply to Senator Sir John Keane's interruptions, is that we are getting nothing in return to put back into the fields from which those crops have been taken and exported. That is not fair to the land, and will be detrimental to the national interests.  I think we should state our claim by saying to Britain: &ldquo;We are sending you certain commodities, the produce of our soil, and in return we should get from you certain other commodities to put back into those fields.&rdquo; We had to burn the soil in the old days; I have seen fields that had to be burned.  This policy of drawing away from the soil and not putting anything back is not very far removed from that. I do not know whether or not that is an answer to Senator Sir John Keane.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Senator examined our trade figures?  I understand that last year we imported more than we exported.  I want to be put right on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain disadvantages in members of the House talking about this matter of trade balances, because there are difficulties in obtaining the figures.  My reply to Senator Sir John Keane is that I do not mind how many millions of an adverse trade balance there was&mdash;that used to be unwisely deplored in the old days&mdash;because the main fact is that millions of pounds' worth of goods were taken from our soil and sent out of the country, and no million pounds' worth of goods were given to us in return to be put back into the soil. That is what I deplore.  Now is the time to stake our claim.  I feel I would be lacking in my duty as a member of this House and as a member of the farming community if I did not call attention to those matters.  We have apparently been doing something in the way of bartering or exchanging. <Col N="1398" /> I have got the impression that, in the matter of agricultural machinery, we have been doing something like importing certain quantities of raw material against the export of a certain percentage of the finished article. The Minister can tell us about that.  I feel that there is a basis to go upon, but even if there were never a basis to go upon we should not continue a policy of drawing from the productivity of our land year after year, expecting to supply our own community with enough food, leaving a surplus for Britain, and putting nothing back into the soil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it will be argued that the British have not got the commodities to send us.  I think that all depends on what the British attitude is.  It is quite astonishing what the British can do in the way of concessions when they want to do it.  I think they ought to be convinced that the people over here are thinking about those things, and thinking about them very seriously. I do not want to be taken as arraigning the Minister, because such and such a thing has not been done.  On the other hand, I do not want Senator Sir John Keane, or somebody from some other part of the House, to tell me that everything possible has been done, and that I am only making trouble by raising this sort of an issue at a time like this.  I do not want to make any trouble for anybody, but I do not want to see in this country the continuance of conditions which will make very great trouble for all of us in the days that lie ahead.  I think the Minister should be glad to find that people are prepared to stand up in this House and tell him that he ought to go to the British and say to them that if they want to get certain articles which we have produced and sold to them in the past, and which we are competent to produce in greater quantities in the future if we get a chance, they will have to give us commodities which we have not been given in the last year or two to the extent to which they were requisite to that production. My attitude about our trade with Britain is perfectly clear.  I want our trade to continue, but I want our farmers to feel that they will be put <Col N="1399" /> in a position to give, in the future, products of the type which we were accustomed to market in Britain in the past.</P>
    <P>The question that many of our farmers, in fact most of them, will put is: what are we going to do for artificial manures?  These are not forthcoming and I have no hesitation in saying that I feel it is the responsibility of the Minister or of the Government not to entrust to any lesser person than a Minister of this State the obligation of going to Britain and putting to the British Minister what our position is over here.  I think the Minister's position would be considerably strengthened if he were pressed and pushed from behind by the farming community of this country who are declaiming continuously that we are extracting from our land far too much and that if the people in Britain want exports to continue and want greater yields from our fields, there are things with which they must supply us which we cannot find for ourselves.  In adopting that attitude the Minister would be voicing the opinion of nine-tenths of the farmers.  I am not going into the question of whether or not, in order to obtain supplies of artificial fertilisers, we may have to draw upon our sterling assets.  I think we could put them to worse use but I am really very anxious to know what the British approach to this whole question is.  If the British take up a non-possumus attitude, I am quite prepared to say: &ldquo;I do not like it, I think it is not good for your health or ours and it is a bad portent for the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When you have, as we had the other day, Mr. Claude Wickhart talking about Britain drawing on her reserves of food and an apparent contradiction by the British Prime Minister, which, as far as I was concerned, did not carry any great conviction, I think there is evidence of a somewhat rather grave situation facing the people of Britain in the days ahead.  If they are so blind in circumstances like these as to deny to the farms of this country that kind of medicine&mdash;if you like that kind of purgative&mdash;that would enable the land to give yields far beyond anything <Col N="1400" /> that we could expect this year, with the amount of attention we may be able to give it, I wonder what are the possibilities of our entering into trade relations with them in the days ahead?  In this matter I am prepared to cast my bread on the waters because I do not think the present position makes sense either for ourselves or for Britain.  Unless we can put something into our fields that is not available for us now, the food situation is going to grow more acute and we may be driven to straits which many of us do not like to contemplate.</P>
    <P>Despite the statement of the Taoiseach the other day&mdash;I do not want to misinterpret or misunderstand him; I am sure the Minister will clarify his statement and will indicate what the situation exactly is&mdash;I have the feeling that the Minister and the members of the Ministry are much more optimistic about the condition of our soil fertility than I am.  Last year we had a drop in our beet yields.  We had, apparently, a drop of over a ton or more per acre. I hope it will be higher this year, but I am seriously concerned about the conditions in my own county and over a very large area of the country in which we have been tilling a very bad class of land, having nothing else to cultivate.  We were able to extract only fair crops from this land in the past, when supplies of fertilisers were made available in considerable quantities.  I am seriously concerned about the effect on our farming economy of this reduction in the fertility of our soil.  I think we have faced up to the position in a very courageous way.  I have said in the past, and I repeat it, that I have no desire to put a Minister of State in the position of asking for an opportunity of discussing matters with a British Minister merely to have our Minister turned down.  I do not think that that would happen.  I do not think that opportunity would be refused.  I am quite convinced that he would be received, and that it would be possible on this basis to open discussions which would considerably clarify the whole position for ourselves and for the people of Britain.</P>
    <P>Even if the request were to be refused, I should like to know the <Col N="1401" /> position because if there is a definitely unfriendly attitude on the part of people on the other side in the conditions of to-day, then they, too, are casting their bread on the waters, and it is perhaps a rather dangerous adventure for them.  If the Minister were met with a refusal I would say it would be a sign for the future and perhaps it would galvanise the people of the country into a type of action which in other circumstances we should be sorry to take.  It might make us examine the question of whether the economy we had pursued in the past would be the most profitable economy in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to know where we stand.  That may be a rather extreme line, but I am not asking the Minister to say that.  I am saying it, and I think if other people like me said it, it would be no harm.  It would probably be a considerable help.  Anyway, the knowledge that there are difficulties in the situation should not make us want to avoid these difficulties, but rather should encourage us to surmount them.  Face them as we will, anybody who knows the conditions in the country cannot but dread the consequences of our food campaign policy.  It is going to extract so much from so many hundreds of thousands of acres that there is not the remotest chance for a number of years of restoring its former fertility to our soil.  As far as I am concerned, I feel I am justified in bringing this matter before the Seanad.  I feel that the biggest thing in our food campaign for this year and the years ahead is the question of how we are going to balance the fertility of the soil against the crops which we are extracting from our soil.  Unless we are able to balance this in a rational way, the fruits we shall have to garner from our fields in the years to come will be very few and very sour fruits indeed.</P>
    <P>I move this motion and I hope the House will support me in my approach to the problem.  I approach it as a farmer who feels that the land is our biggest asset, our greatest and strongest reserve, and that unless we are cautious and careful to nurture it, to make it more fertile and keep it in <Col N="1402" /> vigorous health, we shall suffer correspondingly in the future.  I feel that the Government has a great responsibility in that sense, that inasmuch as you take produce from the land and export it, the land has practically first claim on anything that comes to this country from overseas.  Apparently, the policy which is being pursued is that the land is thought of last.  We may be getting other things in exchange for the things which go from the land, but I suggest that the land should have the first claim upon anything which comes into the country. We must try to get much more in the way of artificial fertilisers.  It would be a good thing to pass this motion.  I hope the Minister will not ask Senators to reject it.  I think it is time that all of us faced the situation that confronts us with rather more courage than we have been displaying.  I believe that if, in the past, we were more courageous in relation to matters of this sort we would have got further.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  During the past two years, we, farmers, have been warning the Government of the results which are likely to accrue through additional tillage on unsuitable land and in places where farmers are not expert at the various tillage processes. I do not for one moment say that the Government have not done a great deal to make good this want of nitrates and, in particular, potash, which are so very necessary from the point of view of land fertility.  However much you try, you cannot get sufficient farmyard manure to cope with the increased tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the doctrines we have been preaching for a considerable time are beginning to sink in.  Over a period we had very optimistic speeches delivered by Ministers.  They spoke of yields of wheat running to so many barrels and they assured us that there would be a plentiful supply.  Now, in almost every speech which is delivered by a Minister, and even by the Taoiseach, we get some small indication that the yields they were anticipating are not being realised and that the optimism which Ministers formerly <Col N="1403" /> displayed has not been justified.  There were some of us who knew all along that there was undue optimism on the part of the Government.  You have only to look at the figures to realise that the yields Ministers were expecting from various crops were a very long way beyond the mark.</P>
    <P>I think this motion, although I feel it will not help to procure manures in any large quantities, is well timed.  It will afford the Minister an opportunity of telling the House if the English, or the people in the North, have got surplus artificial manures, and shipping space to transport these manures here, and, <i>per contra</i>, if we have got agricultural products in excess of our requirements to pay for the artificial manures, and when we have got them, if it can be arranged that these artificial manures will be used in such a way as to increase our production and bring conditions up to the pre-war level.</P>
    <P>There was some question just now as to what the actual figures were.  I can only give gross figures, taken from the Statistical Abstract for the year 1941.  Those figures show that our imports were worth £29,000,000 and our exports £31,000,000.  I understand that, in the following year, that balance of £2,000,000 decreased considerably, and we know that at the moment this country is exporting practically nothing except cattle, and possibly a small quantity of flax.  Eggs, butter, and other commodities that we used to export have dropped to very small quantities. I think it is due to the want of feeding stuffs, and that again is indirectly due to the want of artificial manures, which would help to increase our yield.  I could have put another 30 acres under wheat this year if I could get any sort of artificial manure at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about wheat taking less fertility out of the land than any other crop.  I suggest that that depends entirely on the land into which the wheat is put.  I submit that you cannot generalise in regard to this matter, and these statements rather mislead people and make for a want of confidence.  We, farmers, are <Col N="1404" /> doing all we possibly can by tying-in cattle, shedding them, to increase our farmyard manure.  Our only alternative to farmyard manure at the moment is lime.  Until we get an adequate supply of artificial manures, the yields of various crops will not be very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>As regards surplus manures in the North, I very much question whether they are there in the quantities indicated by Senator Baxter.  I hope they are&mdash;I should like to see them there, and I should like to see them brought across the Border.  It is quite possible that the British, even with their increased tillage drive, may have surplus manures which they could send us.  I feel it is quite possible that there is a surplus which we could get from there.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister telling the House that, so far as dealing with the British is concerned, he and his officials and our representatives on the other side&mdash;we have a High Commissioner there, an extremely able fellow, who is in touch with everybody worth while in Great Britain&mdash;have done, or are doing, everything possible in order to have goods sent from our side, even in small quantities, in exchange for artificial manures from the other side.</P>
    <P>At the same time, although this may not be quite relevant to Senator Baxter's motion, I should like the Minister to say whether, since the introduction of the Appropriation Act last year, any important advance has been made in the process of manufacturing any type of artificials, even low-grade artificials, in this country.  Let us go back to the period of the industrial drive.  We were then told that every single thing we required would be made in this country.  Now, when we come down to brass tacks in regard to this very important requirement, what position do we find?  The Minister did explain in a friendly and reasonable way on another occasion that there were difficulties about the qualities of stuff and about certain machines, and we accepted his statement.  But one does feel that in a crisis like this something may have been produced in <Col N="1405" /> the period since we passed the Appropriation Act&mdash;some time in July or August.  We hope, even if they have not been able to get very far during the intervening period, that during the remainder of this year something will eventuate in the nature of a low-grade manure at a reasonable price.  I look forward to hearing, in the course of this debate, some definite statement arising out of our proposal.  I should like the Minister to let us know if everything possible has been done to get whatever surplus of artificial manures the British may have.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that during the present emergency, and with a view to the better utilisation of available transport facilities, steps should be taken, whether by legislation or otherwise, to transfer to the railway passenger traffic between Dundalk and stations intermediate and Dublin; and that the Seanad requests the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take the necessary steps to this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say how grateful I am to Senators Baxter, O'Dwyer, and Sir John Keane for allowing my motion to take precedence of theirs, and to the Minister in accommodating me by his attendance at some inconvenience.  Many Senators might not be very interested in this matter, or think that it is very important, but I wish to put it to the House that it is a matter of vital importance to a great number of people living in the rural parts of this area. I have discussed the proposal with the Minister and with his officials, and I believe that they all feel that something should be done to regulate the traffic in that particular district, but <Col N="1406" /> they feel that the framing of an Order to suit one particular part of the country is a difficult business.  As far as I can judge, that is their only objection, but, at all events, the thing has not been done, although I have been pounding at the Minister, for about six months, to have it done.  This is a train service which would compare very favourably with any district in Eire, even in pre-war days.  I think that the train service there is quite as good now as it was in the pre-emergency days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it is nearly as good.  I think that most of the Senators here know that the towns in the area between Dublin and Dundalk are practically all on the coastline and that there is a big hinterland to the west of them.  The people living in the rural parts of the area adjacent to these towns, previous to the emergency, were supplied from these towns, with all the goods they required, by vans.  That is out of the question now, and if they have not a pony and trap or some other means of transport, these people have to walk.  My main point is that the farmers' wives, the agricultural labourers' wives&mdash;every class of person living in the rural part of that district&mdash;have no other means of getting their provisions except from these adjacent towns, and I feel that they should be able to avail of the accommodation on the buses and that it should not be taken up by people travelling to Dublin from these towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my main reason for asking the Minister to make these people avail of alternative means of transport and leave the bus accommodation to the people who live a considerable distance from the railways.  On the second day of the meeting of the Seanad last week, I was coming to Dublin&mdash;I had a disc for bringing my car to town, but the Minister's Department would not supply me with sufficient petrol for the two days&mdash;having sufficient petrol to bring me to a point at which I could meet the buses.  While I waited there, two buses came along and passed me by.  They were full up and could take <Col N="1407" /> no more passengers.  There were a farmer's wife and two agricultural labourers' wives standing at the same point and&mdash;I suppose I broke the law&mdash; I brought them in my car to Swords. If I had not done so, these people, who had walked three miles to get the bus would have had to walk back the three miles and do without their provisions, or walk four miles into Swords to get them.  I think that is a position which should be remedied.</P>
    <P>There is a very good train service between Drogheda and Dundalk.  There are six trains a day from Dundalk, and ten trains a day from Drogheda, to Dublin, and the same number for the return journey.  I got a time table from the Great Northern Railway Company showing that trains leave Dundalk for Dublin at 8.10 a.m., 10.43, 12.35 p.m., 2.15, 2.45 and 7.45.  The 10.43 a.m., 2.15 p.m. and 7.45 p.m. are express trains, stopping only at Drogheda.  The other are local trains which stop at a number of intermediate stations, such as Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush and Lusk. Trains leave Drogheda for Dublin at 7.40, 8.5, 8.55 and 11.16 a.m., 1.20, 2.48, 3.30, 5.31, 8.17 and 8.35 p.m. The 11.16 a.m. and 8.17 p.m. trains are express trains which do not stop at intermediate stations, while the others are local trains, stopping at intermediate stations.  In addition, there is a bus service to Rush and Lusk station for people who are travelling by train to Dublin, and I think it is damnable selfishness on the part of people who have the advantage of that train service to crowd out the buses, leaving the agricultural community to sit on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>About a fortnight ago, 22 people presented themselves before 9 o'clock in Drogheda for accommodation on the 9 o'clock bus.  The bus inspector said: &ldquo;I will not allow anybody on the bus between Drogheda and Dublin to-day. You must all go by train.&rdquo;  I understand that some of these people went by train, but four of the important people went to a garage and hired a taxi to Dublin.  They did their business in Dublin and came back that evening in the taxi.  They then sent the <Col N="1408" /> bill to the Great Northern Railway Company, and the company paid the bill, because their solicitor advised them that they had no authority to prevent them travelling in the bus when there was accommodation in the bus at the particular place at which they wished to get on.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with the railway company, and they are agreeable to my proposal.  All I am asking the Minister to do is to make this Order giving the railway company authority to divert traffic from the buses to the railway, and to use their own discretion as to what people shall use the buses.  All I want is: That the people travelling from Dundalk to Drogheda, and other towns to Dublin should use the trains, and let the people from the country, who meet the buses on the roads, get accommodation in these buses when they want to go into these towns or to Dublin.  Another point is that a number of school children in that area go to school in Drogheda, Dundalk, Balbriggan, and Swords by bus.  I have seen these children in a good many cases compelled to walk because the bus could not take them up.  I ask the House to request the Minister to make this Order.  It is, I think, one of the most reasonable requests made in this House for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Senator Counihan has put his case very thoroughly, as he always does, and, as he says himself, it is a reasonable request, to which it is difficult to find an answer.  I am perfectly certain that when the Minister thinks over it he will not find it beyond his power to provide a solution which will meet the needs of the area, if not to-night, at no distant date.  Senator Counihan enumerated the trains serving that area.  He told us the trains from Dundalk, and then gave us the trains from Drogheda.  It should be mentioned, however, that, as between Dundalk and Drogheda, it is the same train in six cases.  The train from Dundalk passes through Drogheda, so that we have not got the multiplicity of trains which he indicated.  Instead of the ten and six trains he mentioned, there are in reality ten trains, but the service <Col N="1409" /> is quite reasonable.  The buses are excellent, and cater for a very big area.  The bus which runs from Dundalk through the Monaghan end of County Louth has always to be duplicated on market and fair days.  I suppose the buses through the other parts of the county could be reduced somewhat, if the railway at Ardee were functioning in respect of passengers, but otherwise the Minister and his officials should have no difficulty in providing accommodation on the trains sufficient for the two towns, thus leaving the buses to the people in the thickly populated rural parts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion interests me, as I have a certain amount of local knowledge of the problem.  The train service between Dundalk, Drogheda and Dublin is remarkably good, although not quite as good as it used to be.  I use it practically every day, and, while it is true that the trains are considerably more crowded than they were some time ago, it is also true to say that there is room for more people, especially in local trains.  The express trains are often packed to capacity, but the local trains could easily accommodate a substantially larger number of passengers. That being so, the problem is how best to economise road and rail transport, as a whole, not in the sense of cutting down the already limited facilities, but in the sense of so arranging matters that maximum convenience will be obtained for the community from the facilities that exist.  The whole matter turns on the geography of the district. Probably some Senators are familiar with the position, but others may not be.  The essence of that geography is that you have between Dundalk and Dublin alternative means of transport &mdash;a railway system and a road system&mdash; and, at certain points, these transport lines converge.  They converge at Dundalk, at Dunleer, at Drogheda, at Balbriggan, but do not converge again until they reach Dublin.  Where they bulge out from one another, the area of the bulge is sometimes three, four, or five miles, so that the position that exists is, that people living in Dundalk, Drogheda, Balbriggan or Duleek <Col N="1410" /> have the alternative of using either the rail or the road services, without any inconvenience worth talking about. Consequently, all we ask these people to do is that they should use the railway or, if they do not choose to use the railway&mdash;as, apparently, they do not choose to do in sufficient numbers&mdash; that they should be compelled in the public interest to use the railway, so as to leave more room on the road system for country people living miles away from the railway, and who have no other means of getting to the towns. That is the case in a nutshell.  I think this is an entirely reasonable request, and I commend it to the common sense of the House, and to the Minister for suitable use of his great powers.</P>

      <P>I think everybody will agree that it is desirable that people who can conveniently use the train service should do so.  Those people who are resident in towns on the Great Northern system, from which convenient train services operate, are to be exhorted to use the train services in preference to bus services.  There will be no two views about that.  But Senator Counihan suggests that we should make an Order which will compel people in these towns to travel by rail instead of by bus.  I do not think that an Order of that kind is either practicable or desirable.  I do not know if Senator Counihan has given any deep consideration to its practicability. At one time, officials of the Great Northern Railway proposed to make such an Order but, when the matter was discussed with them, they agreed that it was impracticable. Under the existing law drivers of buses are under statutory obligation to stop and to take up intending passengers when signalled to do so at a lawful stopping place, unless the buses are already full.  The only way by which an Order of the kind suggested by Senator Counihan could be brought into effect would be by relieving the drivers of omnibuses of the obligation, at their own discretion, to take passengers on until the full capacity had been reached.  I think it is, from many points of view, undesirable that that <Col N="1411" /> discretion should be given omnibus drivers.  It is undesirable from the point of view of the public, and equally undesirable from the point of view of the omnibus drivers.  It would place very great responsibility upon individual employees, and put them in an almost intolerable position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the public.  The alternative to leaving the matter to rest with the discretion of an individual employee, would have to take the form of an Order setting forth the circumstances under which people would be prohibited from using omnibus services, including all the exceptions that would have to be made thereto in relation to various circumstances, and the restrictions which would have to be placed upon the powers given to the officials of the company to refuse members of the public the right to get on the company's buses.</P>
      <P>No matter from what angle you examine the suggestion, it appears more and more impracticable.  Leaving aside the question of its practicability, let us examine its desirability. I think it is true to say that any such Order would inconvenience a very much larger number of people than it would convenience.  No doubt, there are in many parts of the country, not merely on this route but on other bus and railway routes, people who are not conveniently situated from the point of view of transport, and if we were to attempt to make such an order for the Dublin-Dundalk route, we would have many requests for similar orders and similar regulations to affect other routes.  These orders would have to be subject to variations from time to time, as the time tables or routes of omnibuses or trains were altered. For example, nobody would contend, from the fact that a train runs at midday from some station in the vicinity of Dublin that that would justify the prohibiting of persons who for a considerable time past were accustomed to travel to Dublin on morning buses to pursue their employment. Even in the particular case to which Senator Counihan made reference, which occurred in Dundalk last Christmas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to an occasion on which a number of people were refused admission to a Great Northern bus on that route by an inspector of that company in excess of his authority.  That occurred in the week prior to Christmas and at the height of the Christmas peak traffic. While it is true that there was a train leaving Drogheda for Dublin, as well as a bus, the train was several hours later than the bus, and one can easily imagine circumstances in which it would be a matter of grave inconvenience to people travelling for business purposes to have to wait several hours until suitable transport was available.  I do not want the House to receive the impression from what Senator Counihan said, that the buses are always full when they reach Blake's cross-roads, where Senator Counihan gets on the bus.  When he first made representations to the Department, I made arrangements to have an examination made of the traffic on that route and detailed statistics, prepared in respect of a period of two weeks in October last, will help us to judge the desirability or the necessity for an order of the kind that the Senator suggests.  An examination of these statistics during the period of two weeks shows that the number of people accommodated on buses travelling from Dundalk to Dublin via Drogheda and Skerries was approximately 9,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One-third of that accommodation was utilised by passengers to Dublin who boarded these buses at Dundalk, Castlebellingham, Dunleer, Drogheda, Balbriggan, Skerries and Rush, towns from which there are also rail services. During the two weeks under investigation only 18 buses out of 192 were filled to capacity before reaching Swords. From Swords there is a very good bus service operated by the Dublin United Transport Company.  Intending passengers from any point on the route could have found accommodation upon the buses of the G.N.R. Company in all except 18 cases.  Out of 192 buses, only 18 were full on reaching Swords. Had the travellers from these towns <Col N="1413" /> which I have mentioned and from which there are also rail services been prevented from travelling by bus, approximately 3,000 people would have been deprived of their accommodation in that two weeks' period.  As the average number of passengers accommodated in each bus was 25 and as only 18 buses were filled to capacity before reaching Swords, the total number of persons who might have been convenienced by such a regulation would have been 450; that is to say, 3,000 persons would have been deprived of the opportunity of travelling by the bus service for the purpose of benefiting some unknown number which could not, and would not, have exceeded 450.</P>
    <P>Further examination of the position discloses the fact that over one-half of the total number of passengers who originated at the station towns and were accommodated on the 18 full buses referred to were passengers from Balbriggan, Skerries and Rush during mid-morning hours.  The town of Skerries is one and one-eighth miles, and the town of Rush is three miles from the railway station, and there is no train service during mid-morning hours.  I think it is also a wrong assumption to make that at all periods of the year there is ample accommodation on the trains on the G.N.R. line. I had occasion during last summer to travel daily to and from a station on that line to Dublin and on no single occasion was the train on which I travelled anything but crowded to capacity; in fact, crowded in excess of its capacity, as there were people standing in every compartment.</P>

      <P>The trains in which I travelled were local trains.  They were trains which came in the morning bringing those travelling to Dublin for business purposes and returning in the evening.  They were probably the most crowded trains of the daily service. The statistics I have given suggest that the problem is not quite as acute as is suggested.  Apparently a substantial number of buses, in fact the great majority of the buses on the route which reach Swords are not completely full.  There are and have been always some buses reaching that stage full and incapable of accommodating additional passengers.  While I agree that the people in these station towns should be encouraged to travel by train, I do not think we can compel them to do so. The problem of devising an effective means of compelling them to do so is almost insoluble, unless we are prepared to take what I consider is the considerable risk of giving absolute discretion to the bus conductors as to who will or will not be allowed to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider allowing the company to charge a higher fare than the rail fare on the buses so as to encourage people to use the railway from Drogheda or Dundalk to Dublin, without increasing the fares from the intermediate stages? That would have the effect of encouraging the people to go by rail rather than by road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be a statutory difficulty in doing that, but no doubt the statutory difficulty could be temporarily overcome by Order.  That possibility could be examined.  We have, however, asked the company to undertake a publicity campaign for the purpose of encouraging people to travel by train from these stations rather than by bus.  They have undertaken such a campaign.  I think we can also arrange to have the matter brought by other means to the attention of the public, and, from my experience, I think the public will respond to an urging of that kind which is obviously designed to facilitate others less favourably circumstanced than they are themselves.  In fact, I should say <Col N="1415" /> that the uncertainty of procuring accommodation on buses on the route has created a situation in which the majority of the people travelling from these towns prefer to go by train.  Certainly they prefer to return from Dublin by train because of the greater certainly of getting accommodation on the train than on the bus.</P>
      <P>I have considerable sympathy with Senator Counihan's position and with the aim he has in this motion, but I regret I could not accept it.  I could not agree that it would be practicable to proceed on the lines indicated by him.  I think it is desirable that a situation should be brought about by propaganda and publicity in which people from these towns which are served both by bus and rail service would be encouraged to travel by rail rather than by bus, and thus leave the bus accommodation available for those who have not got the alternative of rail travel.  Beyond that I would not be prepared to go.  It may be possible to do something on the lines suggested by Senator Johnston in the matter of the readjustment of fares.  There are certain objections to dealing with a problem of this kind by charging more for the facilities which people desire. The solution of the temporary emergency problems in that manner could be represented as imposing restrictions upon those who could not afford to pay higher fares while not discouraging the practice by those who could.  I think, therefore, that, while it might be possible to do something in that way, there are all sorts of arguments against it. What the legal difficulties of adopting the Senator's suggestion are I could not say offhand.  I do not think I have anything more to say.  I agree that we should try to encourage people to travel by train rather than by bus, but I do not think it is practicable to use compulsory powers for that end.</P>

      <P>I can see the Minister's difficulty, but I do not think the matter is as difficult as he made it out to be.  Of course, his officials, like all civil servants, are always anxious to adopt the line of least resistance and they feel that the making of this Order would not be the easiest way to go about it, that it would be simpler to leave things as they are.  I thought I convinced the Minister and the House of the necessity for this Order, particularly when we remember that we are in an emergency and that the Order would operate only during the period of an emergency.  The Minister suggested that the trains offer a good deal of accommodation.  On the Great Southern Railways, on which I very often travel, the trains are crowded, as there is only one train each day to the South and to the West, and a return train.  There may be a goods train at night.  Very often, on the Great Southern Railways, I have to travel by the guard's van.  That does not happen on the Great Northern Railway.  From Drogheda, every day, they have ten trains and three express trains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the case of the 22 people standing in the bus.  My information from the Great Northern Railway Company is that this happened in <Col N="1417" /> Drogheda, that 22 people presented themselves for a 9 o'clock bus.  A bus and a train were leaving within five minutes of each other, and the 22 people were insisting on going by the bus until the inspector said he would not allow anyone for Dublin on the bus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not, but they were at Drogheda and they had a train by which to go to Dublin.  The inspector told the people who were waiting at that particular time that he would not allow any of those who were going to Dublin on the bus, that they should go by the train, which was within four or five minutes' walk.  That is my information. Four of them took a taxi and the railway company had to pay. That does not show a great deal of consideration by people in the towns for people living in the country.  I travel in buses a good deal since the emergency.  I often go to fairs, and have been left behind so that I could not do my business.  About two months ago, the conductor or driver&mdash;I suppose he knew me&mdash;stopped and picked me up, when the bus was full.  He told me that, in doing so, he was breaking the regulations, that he was more afraid of his own inspectors in regard to overcrowding than he was of the Civic Guards, but that he would take me as far as Swords, where I could get accommodation.  On that bus there were 24 women and, I think, 16 children going to the pictures.  That is a positive fact.  A number of people in the country, like myself, who want to go about to do business, are prevented from doing so by people from the towns who prefer to take the bus, which will pick them up in the centre of whatever town they are in and will leave them in the centre of Dublin. The sort of Order I would request the Minister to make is one giving discretion to the railway company to divert traffic from the buses, in the towns only, and between Dublin and those particular towns.  I am not forcing the matter now.  The Minister says he is sympathetic.  He has always been <Col N="1418" /> sympathetic and his officials are quite sympathetic, but I would ask him to promise that, if these conditions prevail, he will make the Order.  If he promises me to consider that, I will withdraw the motion.</P>

Whatever we can do by publicity and propaganda, or whatever we can get the railway company to do by publicity and propaganda, will be done.  I shall consider whether any useful purpose would be served by a revision of fares on buses in respect of travel from those towns at times when convenient rail services are available.  I should not like to say that I will make an Order.</P>

      <P>While I am sure we all agree with Senator Baxter, that it is most essential that everything possible should be done to maintain the fertility of our land, I am sorry I cannot support the motion in its present form.  I am very much more alarmed at the prospect of not being able to secure sufficient tractor fuel to do our reaping and threshing and the prospect of not being able to secure binder twine, than I am at the loss of artificial manures at the present time.  Many practical farmers contend that the artificial manures that are obtainable at the present time are of such poor quality that they are no worth the price and, with the exception of a limited quantity of those artificial manures to grow beet, <Col N="1419" /> potatoes and some roots, I think we should not bother much about looking for artificial manures until after the war.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told us last week in Dublin that the Government were subsidising artificial manures to the extent of £800,000.  I believe he said also that there would be about 28,000 tons of 30 per cent. superphosphates and 17,000 tons of special manures for distribution amongst the farmers this year at a price of £13 and £14 per ton. Surely it does not cost £800,000 to subsidise 45,000 tons of imported artificial manures while the farmers have to pay £13 and £14 a ton for it.  I do not know what other stuff he is subsidising. I am sure the House would be glad to hear from the Minister what is the subsidy per ton of this manure and what is the amount available for distribution. I believe that very much better results could be obtained by subsidising the manures which we can produce ourselves rather than by paying an exorbitant price for the imported article.  For example, lime, which is procurable in practically every county, produces excellent results in most lands.  Seaweed is to be obtained all along the coast, and the best fertiliser of all is farmyard manure.  We have thousands of tons of straw rotting in reeks which could be turned into farmyard manure if the Government would devise some scheme to encourage farmers to produce the manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, according to the statement I have already quoted, is prepared to subsidise imported manures to the extent of £800,000.  I feel that it would be much better to devise a scheme for the production of farmyard manure, and allocate to it some of that money.  The Minister for Agriculture has a decided objection to the payment of a subsidy for stall-fed cattle.  I do not know why that is so, but I am sure he realises that farmers cannot afford to stall-feed in order to produce farmyard manure at the price that we are getting on the other side for our beef cattle.  Further, if these cattle are house-fed for export, they will not realise as much as the out-fed cattle which get a good deal less food. There is a difference of £7 10s. or £8 <Col N="1420" /> per beast in the prices which we obtain in the British market for our cattle and the price which the British farmer gets for the cattle we export after they have been in his possession for a couple of months.  We cannot compete against that position.  If the Minister still objects to the payment of a subsidy on stall-fed cattle, I suggest to him that he should think out a scheme under which he would pay so much per ton for farmyard manure, properly produced.  If he did that I think it would meet the situation, and save his conscience with regard to the subsidising of beef for the British market.</P>
    <P>Listening to Senator Baxter, one would imagine that we received nothing in return for the cattle, flax and beer that we export.  The fact is that our trade balance with Great Britain has at all times been against us.  The Senator, in his motion, says that we should get artificial manures in return for the beef, flax and beer which we export to England.  Will the Senator specify what commodities we are importing from England that he thinks we should cut out and get instead of them artificial manures?  If he were to do that the House could consider whether it would be better for the country to import artificial manures rather than the commodities which we are importing and which, I am asking him to specify, we should not import.</P>
    <P>Senator The McGillycuddy said that our imports from England were £2,000,000 less than the value of our exports.  I have here a quotation from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> dealing with the trade statistics of Éire for the 12 months ending November, 1942.  The figures given indicate that in that period our imports increased from £30,390,551 to £34,654,846, and that our exports increased from £29,817,000 to £34,497,000.  Therefore, the excess of imports over exports fell from £573,544 to £155,000.  In 1938, the last pre-war year, the excess of imports over exports amounted to over £17,000,000. There is a big difference between that figure and the figure of £155,000.  It is due to the fact that our exports increased by, roughly, £10,000,000, and that our imports decreased by <Col N="1421" /> £7,000,000.  Even though at the present time that difference is not very much, it shows that we are still getting from England more than we are exporting to her.</P>

The harvest will be of very little use to us if we are not able to procure tractor fuel and binder twine, and I think the Minister should concern himself in trying to get increased supplies of both fuel and twine for us.

      <P>I have just a few comments to make on the terms of the motion and on some of the speeches that have been made, so far, on it.  I do not intend to take up much of the time of the House in discussing it, for one reason that it is a discussion that might tempt one to go rather too far. One could easily overstep the bounds of prudence and say things that had better be left unsaid.  As I have followed the debate so far, it might be divided into two parts, firstly, that Senator Baxter is anxious to convey to the British Government and to the British public that they might run their business much more efficiently, and that the manner in which they are running it may be fraught with very severe consequences for them.  The other section of the debate concerned itself with an appeal to the Government to negotiate with the British Government for an adequate supply of artificial fertilisers.  As I have said, I am not going to concern myself with the first part.  With regard to the second part, there are a few remarks which I would like to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter and the other speakers are a long time in public life and it must have occurred to them that, before getting up in this House or in any other responsible quarter to make a speech, they should acquaint themselves with all the facts of the position <Col N="1422" /> that they are to discuss.  Had that been done in this case, they would have discovered that, since the beginning of the war, this country has been operating on a priority system, so far as imports are concerned.  In other words, the approach of the Department of Supplies to this whole problem of imports is that of putting first things first.  If inquiry had been made, it would have been found that artificial manures are very high up on that list.</P>
    <P>I gather that Senator Baxter feels that it is the lack of money which prevents us from getting these essential imports, as he remarked that some of our external assets should be used, if necessary, to make them available.  If he examined that point carefully, he would have found that there is nothing in it.  Something more than a lack of money prevents us from getting these supplies.  If we had no sterling assets, if our assets were in the form of francs, marks or dollars, we would be in the same position.  There is some other factor, of which he must be aware&mdash;other than the lack of money or, perhaps, other than the lack of good will on the part of Britain.  Had these two points been carefully considered, Senator Baxter would not have put this motion down at all.  It occurred to me, when listening to him, that he was adopting tactics quite common elsewhere&mdash;by-passing a certain objective.  If he did not by-pass, there would have been nothing left for him to talk about and he would not have been able to make the speech he did.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the comments about the decline in yields, I am sure there is something in them.  Some time ago, when it became known that all was not well with the production of beet, it occurred to me that I should find out something about it.  I went to a very practical farmer, a distinguished member of the other House who has been producing beet himself from the word &ldquo;go.&rdquo;  He gave a very reasonable explanation for the apparent decline: it was that many of the people who had recently been going in for beet should not have been allowed to do so at all, as it requires a fair amount of experience to produce it satisfactorily.  Owing to the price <Col N="1423" /> offered, many people without experience came into production and their yields were not up to standard, with the result that they influenced the total.</P>

      <P>As far as the average&mdash;the nine tons mentioned by Senator Baxter&mdash;is concerned, they influenced it to the extent that it showed a reduction.  I am not saying that we should not watch carefully anything in the nature of a report that crop yields are declining.  At the same time, I cannot help recalling some very gloomy debates in this House last year on the question of wheat.  When the harvest came, we were astonished that some of the people who made those very gloomy speeches came forward and claimed publicly that they had achieved records in their yields. That announcement drew forth a spate of letters from other people claiming higher yields still.</P>

      <P>If Senator Baxter and those who agree with him were in downright earnest and if this were to be pushed to its logical conclusion, they should have added to this motion, or have put down another motion immediately: &ldquo;That, if the British Government does not make available to us what we consider an adequate <Col N="1424" /> supply of artificial manures, we should cease to trade with Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <P>I am very serious about it.  I wonder if the Senator would be able to induce some of his friends in the other House to put down a motion to that effect, as that is the only logical conclusion: that in the event of Britain refusing to give us what we consider an adequate supply of manures, we should refuse to trade with her.  We might as well face the implications of this question.</P>
      <P>In its way, the motion is a harmless one.  <i>(Motion read.)</i>  If Senator Baxter is told that negotiations are being carried on continuously for supplies of fertilisers as well as of other commodities, what reply will he make?  It is quite obvious that negotiations are being carried on continuously for an ever-increasing supply of artificial manures.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Senator, I did not say I was not so sure.  I said I should <Col N="1425" /> like to know definitely from the Minister whether they are there.  I do not want to be misquoted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>We know from the records of court proceedings that everything is not moving as smoothly as it might in Great Britain in regard to many things; that there have been wastage and fraud.  Possibly, there is wastage and fraud in connection with this matter of the distribution of manures.  I think Senator Baxter will have rendered a service to agriculture here as well as to agriculture elsewhere in bringing that matter to the notice of the British Government, because I am sure that whatever he has said in that regard will, in due course, be brought to their notice.</P>
      <P>There is just one other point which occurs to me, and that is with regard to Senator Counihan's suggestion about the production of more farmyard manure.  I noticed in a certain area which I visit from time to time that the farmers&mdash;they are undoubtedly amongst the very best tillage farmers in Ireland&mdash;have adopted a scheme of carrying the straw from the fields and throwing it around the gates.  They tell me that they are able to accumulate a great deal of farmyard manure in that way.  I think it is just as well to pass that suggestion on.  There seems to be something in it as far as those farmers are concerned, and there might be something in it for farmers all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all impressed by the motion as it is down, because I believe&mdash;as a matter of fact I am pretty sure&mdash;that there are continual negotiations going on with the British in regard to this particular matter, as well as in regard to other matters.  I am also pretty sure that the whole approach to this question of supplies is through that system which I have described as priorities, and that artificial manures are very high on the list. Another reason why I am not at all impressed by the motion is that the Senator who put it down did not push it to its logical conclusion and declare that we should refuse to trade with the British Government in the event of <Col N="1426" /> their refusing to give us what we consider an adequate supply of artificial manures in all the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should like to intervene at this stage because it might be well to deal with some of the points that have been raised and to give whatever information I can.  I may not be able to supply certain information that was asked for, but I think I have taken a note of all the points raised, and I hope to give the information as far as it is available.  I think that Senator Baxter according to his speech as reported the last day, is, first of all, somewhat misinformed.  He is basing his arguments on a false premise, and even where he bases them on a sound premise I do not agree with him very often.  First of all, he says here early in his speech that, when Ministers go down to the various counties and talk about increased production, what they should think of are the difficulties which the farmers are up against this year.  Is not that exactly what brings Ministers to those meetings?  Is it not quite obvious that, if there were no difficulties at all, if the farmers were getting very attractive prices for wheat, beet, barley and oats, if they had any amount of artificials at their disposal and any amount of machinery to get in their crops, there would be no necessity for us to go down and talk to them?  The very fact that we go to those farmers and talk and listen to them is proof in itself that Ministers realise the existence of difficulties.  I think Senator Baxter might have realised that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, he said: &ldquo;I hope the Minister will tell us what quantity we have in the way of artificial manures; that is something which should not be kept secret.&rdquo;  I certainly have made no secret of it.  I have addressed a great number of those meetings and have also spoken in the Dáil on a number of occasions in the last two or three months, and I do not think I ever omitted to mention what I thought would be the amount of artificial manures that we are likely to have for the coming year.  I have stated over and over again that, in the first place, the farmers were to get the amount of <Col N="1427" /> artificial manures that they got in 1942 from their own merchants.  The merchants will get the same as they got last year, and the farmers, in turn, should get the same as they got last year.  In addition to that, this year we hope to be in a position to give a special mixture for certain crops.  One of the crops for which artificials will be supplied is the beet crop, for instance. They will also be supplied to persons growing seed under an approved scheme, for instance those who grow beet seed under a scheme inaugurated by the sugar company, those who grow, say, other root seeds under a scheme by approved merchants, those who grow certified seed potatoes and allotment holders will also get some artificial manures.  All those approved schemes of seed growing will be recognised in that way by an allocation of artificial manures.  That is as far as I can go at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to deal with individual cases if we can.

Those individual cases can be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to say that a person who is tilling now and was not tilling in 1940 would come under that particular exception.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we would not have enough to enable us to deal with a large number of exceptions.  But I was going to say this, that that disposes of the amount of artificials we have in sight at the moment.  We are trying to get more.  If we do, personally I should be inclined, as far as I have examined the position, to favour two further lines.  One is to go a little bit further in dealing with exceptions, but I think the main line of procedure, if we got more artificials, would be to deal with the smaller farmers in the congested districts.  I do not want to dwell on that because I am afraid we may not have the extra supply, but, if we have, I think that would be a very useful thing to do.  I am sure every Senator, even though he is not from the congested districts, has at least seen the conditions there, and knows how easy it would be to have famine conditions if there should be a failure of the potato crop.  It is, therefore, most important to try to do something special for the congested districts if we get a little more artificials than we have in sight at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Minister but I should like to be clear on this point.  Do I understand that the 45,000 tons or 50,000 tons of artificials which he has mentioned refer rather to nitrogenous manures and phosphates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The total weight, of course, is very small.  The manure will be issued in two categories.  The first will comprise ordinary super-phosphate of 30 per cent.  That will be issued to farmers on the same conditions that they got artificial fertilisers last year.  Then there will be a mixture containing a small percentage &mdash;I am not in a position yet to say what that percentage will be&mdash;of potash and nitrogen which <Col N="1429" /> will be issued to those various people I have mentioned, such as beet seed growers and allotment holders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy of the Reeks The McGillycuddy of the Reeks">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>What will be the price of these manures?  Of course, the Minister is aware that the price of the manures at present is out of all relation to the price of the produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price is fixed.  It was fixed originally at the beginning of the season at £15 per ton for 40 per cent. superphosphate, which is a very high percentage.  The manure to be distributed will not have anything like 40 per cent., but there will be a grading down in price according to the percentage of soluble phosphates.  The next point in Senator Baxter's speech dealt with the decline in crops.  He mentioned the decline in crops in 1942 and in the same paragraph he talked about the very poor return in the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He made it plain in that particular instance that it was due to the very bad weather.  We have not got the official returns yet, either from here or from England, but so far as I have seen reports in the British farming papers, I think everybody is agreed in England that they had a rather poor crop last year, generally speaking. The wheat crop was not as good as it might be and the beet crop was certainly not as good as it might be. That is what I gathered, reading the reports in these papers, but I have not seen anything official yet.  That was evidently due to the very bad year.  I remember an expert stating on an occasion some time ago that unless you have a good deal of sun in the autumn, and particularly in the month of September, you cannot have a sugar content in beet.  I think it is also held by those who are in a position to speak on wheat crops that you are not likely to have a very good yield of wheat unless you have a good <Col N="1430" /> aggregate of sunshine in the year, whether it comes in May, June, July or August.  We had not quite a lot of sun last year, and that may account for at least some of the trouble and for the fact that the yield from some of our crops was worse than in previous years.  On the whole, I do not think that the wheat crop was very bad.  Most farmers I met were quite pleased with the wheat crop.  In fact the general consensus of opinion amongst farmers in my own county was that it was the best wheat crop they had for many years.  I do not say that that was general, but in that particular county it was held to be very good.  I do not want Senators to gather from what I am saying now that one can expect to have quite as good a yield without artificials.  I am sure we cannot and that we are going to have a decline in yields certainly, but it may not be so disastrous as was suggested in some of the speeches here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if we have any check-up ourselves of what the yields were like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not yet, but we shall.  We shall have that figure of yields early in the year.  It comes from three sources.  I cannot recollect one source but I know that the county instructors give their estimate.  Then there is a number of farmers throughout the country&mdash;it runs into hundreds &mdash;who have always communicated with the Department of Agriculture since the Department was set up away back in 1900, and they give their estimate of yields every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would these be the yields on their own farms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>These would hardly be the average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised that these farmers are well above the average. Of the three returns they usually show the highest yields.  The county instructor <Col N="1431" /> is asked to give an average for his county and he goes to quite a lot of trouble to ascertain that average. Then, as I say, there is a third source from which we receive returns&mdash;I think it is the dealers in wheat seeds. The average for the country is struck in that way.  I do not say it is absolutely correct.  It is not possible to get a really scientific return of yields, as everybody knows.  All you can do is to get the opinions of certain people.</P>
      <P>With regard to one point which Senator Baxter raised, I must say that I came to the same conclusion as Senator O Buachalla.  It looked to me at one stage as if Senator Baxter were going to say that if we did not get satisfaction from the British Government we should, well, issue an ultimatum immediately.  The Senator said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I feel that we have reached the stage now in relation to our farming policy when the Government, backed up by the people, will have to say to the British Government that the farmers of this country are being forced in these circumstances to take so much out of their land that, unless they can get in exchange for what they take out something which can be put back into it, the national position will be so worsened as to demand probably the complete overhaul of our present agricultural policy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, I take it that Senator Baxter in talking of agricultural policy to-day had in mind the particular item of exporting our surplus to Britain.  I thought he was coming to the point of saying that we would have to change that policy and to stop that particular export.  He did not develop the point, however, so I suppose we may look forward to the Senator's summing up at the end of the debate to ascertain whether he had really intended to go so far or not.  The big point that Senator Baxter made was that he did not think that such a big question should be handled by servants of the Minister, but should be tackled by the Minister himself or by the head of the Government.  That, <Col N="1432" /> of course, is a very big question.  I am sure that Senator Baxter did not mean to put the matter in a contentious way in order to make the position awkward, but I think it must be accepted by any Dáil or any Seanad at any time, that the Government of the day is in the best position to make up its mind on a question like that. I think it might also be accepted by either the Dáil or the Seanad that no Government would refuse to send Ministers across if they thought it was the best thing to do.  I think it might be accepted, therefore, that the fact that Ministers are not going across is proof in itself that it is considered that Ministers could not do any more than is being done by officials or, as Senator Baxter calls them, servants of the Minister.  That is another point to which I must return.</P>
    <P>I think, on this question of fertilisers, before we go on to the point about negotiations, that the good farmer always seems to get on fairly well, in spite of all difficulties.  I am aware that farmers&mdash;I know them to be good farmers&mdash;have succeeded in keeping up their yields.  They are carrying out their obligations so far as the tillage Order is concerned.  Some of the farmers I have in mind are tilling even more than 25 per cent. of their land and they seem to be able to keep up the yields of their crops by making plenty of good farmyard manure, manuring their root crops with it and then following up with a cereal crop, generally wheat.  At any rate, they seem to be carrying out their obligations and getting quite good yields from their crops.</P>
    <P>We are not confined to a rotation of this kind for our supplies of wheat. We have been appealing, as every Senator is aware, to the owners of very fertile land in Meath and the midlands, generally&mdash;land that has not been broken up for many years&mdash;to break up some of that very good land and sow wheat in it.  I think the returns have been very good.  Officially, I should say I have no fault to find with the Meath farmers.  They have done well and are producing good crops.  In that land in Meath, which <Col N="1433" /> has been grazed for so many years and where the fertility has been stored away, we probably will not do very much harm by getting three or four crops in succession and, when the war is over, the fertility can be quickly built up again.</P>
    <P>We are, undoubtedly, using up our soil-fertility&mdash;I will not argue that with any Senator&mdash;but I do not think we need be so very anxious about the position as some Senators appear to be.  We should be able to go on for many years without reaching a critical position.  We are asking for 700,000 acres of wheat this year.  That is on the assumption that there will be a lower yield than there was last year. But 700,000 acres of wheat out of a possible 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 acres&mdash; nobody appears to know what the arable acreage of this country is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not suggest that every acre is capable of growing wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the arable land that will grow wheat and it would probably be 10,000,000 acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be something like 16,000,000 acres, if we take in all tillage and pasture.  Of course, there is a lot of it mountain pasture that we would not regard as arable. We might take 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 acres off for that.  It does mean, however, even if we come down to 8,000,000 acres and take them as capable of growing wheat, that it is not necessary to put the same land, the same fields, under wheat more than once every six or seven or ten years. I think it will take quite a long time at that rate to exhaust the fertility of our land to any alarming extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Minister?  Let us suppose you have a farm and that certain fields on that farm will grow cereals, the remainder being looked upon as not <Col N="1434" /> being properly arable.  In that case, you have to follow the usual circle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the arable portion of a man's land.  It is very hard to know what the extent of our arable land is, but, even cutting off 33? per cent. of our total tillage and pasture, we have a fairly substantial amount of arable land still left. Another thing we must remember is that nature will not permit us to exhaust the fertility of our soil very rapidly, because nature has a very peculiar and, perhaps, a very praiseworthy way of doing things.  The fertility goes down very slowly and the yield goes down very slowly.  If we keep on growing cereals, as has been done by way of experiment, it will be found that the fertility after each year is very little changed.  It takes many years to make a big difference in the fertility of the soil, and it takes a good many years to make a big difference in the yields.  From that point of view, we should not be alarmed about the question of fertility.  We should, on the other hand, at the first opportunity, try to restore the fertility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter talked about exporting so much of what is produced on the land and not getting very much in return. I have not tried to work out&mdash;of course, it should be possible and scientists could do it&mdash;how much in the way of phosphates, potash and nitrogen is going out of the country, in the form of cattle and other agricultural products, and how much is coming back in the way of artificials.  I dare say the result of such an investigation would be that we are losing instead of gaining fertility, though I do not know to what extent.  Senators have asked whether we have been trying to get artificial manures.  We have been trying to get them.  We have pointed out to the British Government on many occasions that we could grow much more food here if we had an abundance of artificials and that whatever we might grow here in excess of our requirements would in all probability go to England.  If we can increase our production, all that is surplus to our requirements is likely to <Col N="1435" /> go to Great Britain.  I think they accept that argument all right, but, on the other hand, they say: &ldquo;We have no artificial manures to spare.&rdquo;  We cannot, short of the type of ultimatum I have referred to already, do anything more about it.  We tried to persuade them, but we failed.  You cannot press too hard in a case like that.</P>
    <P>We have argued, both from their point of view and our point of view, as best we could on this question of artificial manures and we cannot do any more.  They were very anxious to get bacon from us, but when we said that we wanted all the bacon for ourselves and had none to spare, they did not question us further.  They did not question our wisdom as far as the control of our own house is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that.  I was over there in 1941 and I met Ministers and discussed this question with them.  So far as I know, the British Government has no interest in our cereal production.  I take it they feel that we want to grow more cereals and that we will require them for our own use.  We will want more wheat, barley and oats and, naturally, they do not see that there is any great use in giving us artificial manures to grow more cereals when they are not going to benefit by it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <P>What about potatoes?  If we could produce more potatoes, we could produce more poultry and pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It was pointed out that if we could produce more barley and oats, then we could produce more pigs, poultry, eggs and bacon, and so on, which they wanted, but they were not very encouraging in offering prices for these commodities.  In 1941, when we were over there, I think most of our time was spent in arguing as to the price they would offer for bacon and butter.  Now, the price they would offer for bacon, if we had any bacon to spare, was 131/2 per cwt., which <Col N="1436" /> would enable the factories to pay the producers 100/- per cwt. deadweight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the deadweight price they pay for pigs in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is 135/-.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but when we pointed out to them that they were paying more in Northern Ireland, they told us that the price they paid in Canada was much less than what they paid us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>They have advanced that price since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, at that time we had an exportable surplus here, but they insisted that they would not give us any more than I have mentioned.  These were some of the things that we were up against at that time, and they go to show that it is not so easy to get the British Government to see things from our point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be a wise thing to subsidise those prices so as to ensure the carrying on of these things until the crisis ends?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but take the case of butter.  When we had a surplus, the price they were giving then&mdash;and we were paying a subsidy at that time&mdash; was only sufficient to pay our producers 5d. per gallon for milk, and I believe it would be the same now, if we had a surplus.  As you know, we are now paying 9d. a gallon to the producers, and I think I can say that the producers do not think it is too much; but at their price, if we were to produce a surplus of butter over and above our own requirements, we would <Col N="1437" /> have to sell it to the British Food Controller at the rate of 5d. a gallon.</P>
      <P>As regards eggs, I think they are all right and that, on the whole, the producers are satisfied; but with regard to the other two commodities, the prices are very unsatisfactory.  It was considered&mdash;in fact, it was put up to us&mdash;by the Food Controller in England that as we paid a subsidy for butter and bacon before the war, we should continue to do so while the war was on.  The way I looked upon it was this: that we had done that in the hope that the world price for butter would continue to rise to such an extent that the producers here could carry on, but that has not been the case.  I do not think that anybody in this country, whether a Deputy, Senator or anybody else, would like to contemplate paying a subsidy for all time, and after all, if we cannot get an economic price from the British Food Controller in a time of war, I think it is very unlikely that we will get it when the war is over.  So I do not think there is very much use in subsidising butter now to keep it going until the war is over.</P>

      <P>When the war is over, will the position be that we will have no exports at all except cattle and pigs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>And when the lease-lend supplies arrangement comes to an end, they might have to pay an economic price for butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Now, with regard to this question of barter, I suppose that in times like this money is not so important as supplies, and there was an urge even before the war to try to get rid of as much of our goods as possible, and to take as little as possible in return.  Since the war, that has been completely reversed, and we are trying to get everything we can, because we want the goods rather than the money.  Now, I should say that I do not think there has ever been a definite signed agreement between the two countries as regards barter.  The <Col N="1438" /> general understanding, I think, was that the old trade should remain; that we should try to send them what we sent to them in the past and that they should try to send us what they sent us in the past, so far as it was reasonably possible to do so.  I think it will be agreed that they fell down more than we did in that respect.  For instance, they fell down in the matter of coal more than we did in the case of bacon and butter.  Our cattle, of course, continue to be sent, but that had a kind of association with coal, and we are not sending them bacon and butter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>How about eggs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we are sending eggs. We are sending more or less the same amount as we sent before, but my point is that the British fell down on their part of the agreement more than we did.  As regards artificial manures, I am sure they would admit that there was an agreement to send them.  The only argument is the argument made here by Senators, that if they send us artificial manures, we will send them things that they want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, they sent us sulphate of ammonia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they did, but that has been cut down to almost nothing. Now, with regard to the three things mentioned by Senator Baxter: cattle, flax and beer; we do think that we should get something in return, and last year we got something in return for our flax and beer.  After all, I think it was better for us to put wheat into our bread instead of the barley that we had, and to let that barley go into beer for export to Great Britain, because it did facilitate us here in keeping certain farms going, and in every way I think it was an advantage for us to keep to that exchange.  That is one thing.  For this coming year there is no agreement yet as to any barter arrangement for beer, but that agreement will have to be made in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> As regards flax, I think that flax is one of the most important crops we have from the point of view of barter, because it is the only crop we grow here with a fibre content, and fibre is of great importance in every household, in every shop and in particular to the fishermen and to the farmers. The fisherman depends entirely on his nets&mdash;if he has not got nets he cannot get along&mdash;while the bigger farmer depends very much on binder twine.  If we did not grow flax, I am afraid we would have very little bargaining power for these things.  We can always make an attempt to use our own flax for making fibre, but so far we have been lucky enough to get the fibre we want in exchange for flax and I think we will get a fair exchange this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would not take all the flax we grow to pay for what fibre we got?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be interesting to have the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The acreage required to produce our own binder twine, if we had to produce it, would be very big. Probably the greater part of the flax we grow would be required for binder twine alone, if we had to make, or could make, binder twine out of flax. That is one item alone which would take the greater part of the crop. I am speaking now of weight for weight; I could not speak about values, and I do not think that values matter very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what the acreage of flax last year was?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>18,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that we have never lost sight of the point made by Senators that we should get in return the things we want, so far as is reasonably possible.  We do not want to be unreasonable by any <Col N="1440" /> means.  Butter is scarce here, but we certainly would not think of asking the British for it because it is scarcer still with them, but, so far as is reasonably possible, we want something in exchange for what we send across. To Senator Baxter, who mentioned flax in particular, I should like to say that flax is one of the crops which has been most helpful to us in getting what we want.</P>
      <P>So far as beer is concerned, we got our grain last year and, within the next few weeks, we shall have to make up our minds as to what we will get next year, if that trade is to be carried on. I think that 1st March, for some peculiar reason, is regarded as the beginning of the year in that particular trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not try to get sulphate of ammonia for it?  We got 31,000 tons in 1938, and if we had it this year it would be of immense value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator The McGillycuddy said that Ministers were unduly optimistic about yields.  I must confess that I agree with Senators that we shall have declining yields, but, as I said already, I do not think that decline will be disastrous.  It will be a slow process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I never suggested that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot afford to let the decline be disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might satisfy the Senator to know that in asking for 700,000 acres of wheat, we are budgeting for a lower yield next year than last year.  I was asked also if any progress had been made in the manufacture <Col N="1441" /> of artificials from home sources. The only source, I suppose, is in the Clare phosphates.  There is a small amount of potash to be got from kelp and that, so far as I know, is being done.  We do get a certain amount of sulphate of ammonia from our gas works.  I do not think anything is allowed to go to waste there, and we get what is available.</P>
      <P>I have not been in Clare myself, and, even if I were, I would not know as much as the engineers, but, so far as I can gather from the reports, there are grave difficulties and obstacles to be got over in getting any increased supply out of Clare.  There will, however, probably be an increase as time goes on, and if the war continues for very long we shall get an increased quantity. Next year, we may have some artificials because certain boats have been allocated to that particular business, and if these boats are spared, we may have more brought in from foreign sources for next year than for this year.  I do not think it would be practicable to give a subsidy on farmyard manure.</P>
      <P>When you give a subsidy on an article, there are two things you must always keep in mind: first, that you will give it to everybody who is entitled to it and, secondly, that you will not give it to anybody who is not entitled to it, and it would tax the ingenuity of any Administration to give a subsidy on farmyard manure under these two headings.  I do not know how it could be done.  Senator Counihan is concerned about the kerosene position and the position in relation to binder twine.  I have already mentioned binder twine.  I did not go into any great detail on the point and I am not in a position to do so.  I think we shall have&mdash;and I emphasise the word &ldquo;think&rdquo;&mdash;a fair supply of binder twine, but I am not sure yet.  With regard to kerosene, I think we should have as much kerosene for agricultural purposes as we had last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I have tried to answer as well as I could the questions which have been put to me.  It is, of course, impossible to answer some of the questions in any detail.  There are some questions, such as an exchange for our exports of beer this year and the prospects of getting a good supply of binder twine&mdash;to give two examples&mdash;which I am not yet in a position to answer with any exactitude but, so far as I could, I have dealt with them.</P>

I think that is quite unfair to a number of farmers.  I do not mind the Minister's Department making regulations in respect of the growing of beet and root crops, but the farmers pay their contribution to this £800,000, like everybody else, and to <Col N="1444" /> select a number who bought artificial manures in 1940 as against those who did not is quite unfair.</P>
