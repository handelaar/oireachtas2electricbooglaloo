      <P>I have received notice from Senator Baxter that on the motion for the adjournment this evening he proposes to call attention to the restrictive effect of the Potato Order on farmers procuring sufficient supplies of potatoes for seed purposes in the present season.</P>
      <P>I am accepting that notice and the matter will be taken up at the conclusion of to-day's business, but if that business has not been concluded by 8.30 p.m., the proceedings will be interrupted at that hour to take Senator Baxter's notice.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to facilitate voters in their exercise of the franchise at the coming general election, a considerable rearrangement of pre-existing polling places and polling areas has taken place.  The purpose of the rearrangement has been to provide, so far as it could possibly be done, a polling place for each elector at a distance not exceeding, approximately, one and a half miles from his residence.  This has involved a considerable increase in the number of polling places and widespread changes in the polling arrangements to which electors have been accustomed.  Accordingly I have felt it essential, if considerable confusion and inconvenience to the electors is to be avoided on the day of the poll, that every elector on the register should be <Col N="1930" /> informed of the place where he is to vote at the election.  It is proposed to do this by making it obligatory on returning officers in each constituency to send out as soon as may be&mdash; naturally, in any event, after the day of nominations&mdash;a card to each person on the register informing that person where he is to vote and informing him also of his number on the register.  The information as to the polling place is required for the information of the elector; the information as to the elector's number on the register is required for the convenience of the presiding officer.</P>
      <P>These cards will, as I have indicated, be sent out after the day of nominations. We cannot send them out before the day of nominations.  If it happened in any constituency that only a sufficient number of candidates would be validly nominated to fill the seats allocated to that constituency, there would be no poll.  The card will be in a prescribed form which, in addition to conveying the information to which I have referred, will also emphasise to the person who receives it that the receipt of a card carries with it no entitlement to vote and that possession of a card is no proof of identity, and that, therefore, the card is, as I have said, merely for the purpose of information and for no other purpose whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Provision is included in the Bill to ensure that if by inadvertence on the part of the returning officer, or through some misdirection in the course of post, an elector does not receive a polling card, the non-receipt of that card will not constitute a ground for challenging the return in any constituency, and will not give the person aggrieved by its non-receipt a cause of action against the returning officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the main provisions of the Bill, and, as I have said, the purpose is merely to facilitate the electors in exercising the franchise and, to some extent, to convenience presiding officers in dealing with new areas and districts.  I trust the House will be agreeable to give me all stages of the Bill to-day.  We have done a considerable amount of preliminary work in <Col N="1931" /> arranging for the printing of the cards, but it is desirable that these cards, of which there will be a considerable number, should be printed off and sent to the respective returning officers at the earliest possible moment, so that they may arrange to have them addressed and ready for despatch as soon as possible after nominations in those constituencies in which there will be a poll.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister on what has been done on this problem up to the present, particularly in regard to the rearrangement of polling places.  It is a very welcome change and one which was overdue.  The electorate are being given a chance which will enable them to do their duty as citizens.  With regard to this further effort to indicate to electors where they may record their votes, I feel it is a further step in the right direction.  There were a great many anomalies in every constituency and voters had often to go ridiculously long distances to the polling stations.  No effort should be spared to bring the new situation to the notice of the electorate.  I wonder if some people will actually believe the changes that have occurred when they receive cards.  The Minister might be well advised to take steps to bring the development to the notice of radio listeners because of the present lack of communications and other facilities.  It is, no doubt, going to add considerably to the work of returning officers, and indeed to the postal staffs.  It may well be that it is an undertaking they will not welcome, but it will be unfortunate now that the decision has been taken if the last &ldquo;t&rdquo; is not crossed in the effort.  The co-operation of all services will be essential and the last card should be delivered by the postman to the most remote voter in time if this Act of the Oireachtas is to bear full fruit.  I welcome the Bill and I think the country will be satisfied that it is an effort which was very badly needed to suit the convenience of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my friend, Senator Baxter, I am sure every section of <Col N="1932" /> the Oireachtas welcomes this innovation. It was long overdue.  I complained here before that voters have often to pass a polling station and to travel a couple of miles farther on to vote.  That has been adjusted now and it will not occur again.  When the Minister remarked that a card will be posted to every voter, it struck me, in view of the shortage of paper and postal facilities, that it would be quite sufficient to send one card to every householder.  There may be five or six voters in one house and it is obvious that whenever a polling station is fixed for one member of a family it will be the same for the others.  It would reduce the number of cards considerably if only one card was sent to each householder.  That is a matter which is worthy of the Minister's consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the practical effect of Senator Honan's suggestion, but I hope the Minister will not accept it, because it seems to me that this way of reaching each individual elector will have a psychological effect. It will bring home to each elector that it is his or her privilege to vote, and that the power which the Government and the Oireachtas exercise derives under God from the people.  It is not only a step forward for the convenience of the electors to send this card, but it is really a very timely reminder of the importance of the election, and of the duty of the electors to exercise the power which God has given them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion which has been made about the use of the radio in this respect is a timely one. When pointing out to the electors, by means of the radio, the method which is being employed to inform them of the place of polling, why not couple with it a lecture on the duties of individual citizens in connection with the elections?  There must be a considerable number of citizens who never exercise the franchise, and a few words broadcast now and again to those people would have the effect of reminding them of their duty to do so.</P>

      <P>What is the position in the case of electors who have changed <Col N="1933" /> their residences?  I am speaking chiefly of people who had been living in the City of Dublin.  As you are aware, Sir, houses have been built in the suburbs, and a number of people have been rehoused there, perhaps long distances from their former residences.  If those cards are sent to the addresses which appear on the register, and the people to whom they are addressed have gone out to the suburbs, how is it expected that the cards will reach the people for whom they are intended?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Johnston Mr. Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Honan's suggestion that it may be sufficient to send a card to the head of each household, I think if he were living in Monaghan where there are large numbers of McKennas and Flynns and so on he would realise that, even then, it would be as much as the rural postmen could do to deliver the letters properly.  I welcome this Bill, and I congratulate the Minister on taking this step to facilitate the voters in exercising the franchise.  Ten or 12 or even 15 years ago I raised this matter with the county council, but was informed that those facilities could not be provided except by Act of Parliament, and I am very glad that this step has now been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it a very valuable suggestion that we should use the broadcasting system to inform the people of the changes that have been made in the existing system of polling stations, and to ask them to take particular care of the cards which will come to them giving information as to where they are to vote.  With regard to the suggestion made by Senator Honan that perhaps a block intimation to each household would be sufficient, I can only say that we considered that matter, but I am sure the Senator will appreciate that in many households different political views are held by members of the family, and if everybody in the household was not made aware of the contents of the card perhaps unworthy suspicions might be engendered, causing family dissensions. Accordingly, we decided that the best thing to do was to address a card to each voter on the list, even though it does mean a slight increase <Col N="1934" /> in the quantity of paper that will be required, and perhaps some additional burden on the postmaster.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Healy's question as to the position of people who had formerly lived in the City of Dublin, if my recollection is correct the Senator raised this matter on the Bill dealing with the municipal elections, and I think I pointed out to him then that a person appears on the register and is entitled to vote in respect of the place at which he was residing on 15th November.  When the register for the following year is being compiled, of course a census is taken of all the residents of the city, and it is in respect of the places where they are then dwelling that their names appear on the register which comes into force on 1st June.  This election will be fought on the new register coming into force on 1st June, and in that new register the addresses of voters will be given as the places in which they were residing on 15th November. I do not think there will prove to have been any such wholesale change in the places of habitation of the workers of Dublin between 15th November and the coming 1st June as to cause any confusion whatsoever, so I think the Senator's mind can be fully at rest in regard to that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion about persons who have changed their residence there may not be many such people but there is undoubtedly a certain percentage who have done so since November 15th and these people would be in a different residence on election day.  If the suggestion that cards should be sent to every householder were adopted they would have to be sent on to the address of those persons who were residing in the house when the register was made and it would devolve on owners of houses to send on the cards to the places of abode of <Col N="1935" /> the electors.  They might not do that and in that way the purpose of the Bill would be defeated.  That is one valid objection to that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what Senators are thinking of with regard to the register.  My recollection of the register is that if there were Baxters on it the Baxters were put down in alphabetical order and nobody knew who was father, mother, son or daughter.  The names are not classified and it would be quite impossible to identify the householder.  That is the real objection to that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Mention has been made of change of addresses since November 15.  We all know that there has been a huge exodus from the country, and naturally the addresses of all those people will be changed.  In these and other cases where people have gone abroad, the postman should not deliver a card where it is known that the person entitled to it has gone out of the country.  I make that suggestion, as it is very necessary that some safeguard should be adopted, in view of the large number of people who have gone away.  If a person entitled to the card is not here, he may be voted for unless steps are taken to prevent that.  I suggest that one way would be to have these cards returned where the person concerned is not in residence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you pass from that section a question has been put to me I would like to answer.  I wish to make it clear that the sending out of these cards by the returning officer is not being done in substitution for the existing right which every candidate has to send a postal packet to each elector.  I will bear in mind the point the Senator has raised in regard to absent voters.  I think that that might be done administratively, if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the postal authorities could give instructions to the postman that if he <Col N="1936" /> gets a card which is addressed to a person who he knows is out of the country he should return it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is advisable to interfere too far on this particular point because, after all, while I have not the slightest doubt about the Minister and the Department wanting to be fair to all, the onus is being placed on the postman and the postman may have his own political points of view.  It is too heavy a responsibility to put on the postman, and in some areas it might cause serious dislocation of the whole objective which the Minister is aiming at in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the administration of the proposal that has been put forward would have to be carefully watched.  A postman knows that AB is away or he knew it the day before, but that man may come back.  We have built up a machinery to prevent impersonation and other illegalities.  It was never very effective, and this is not going to make it much more effective. I think that the idea was that if the postman sends back one of these cards and the information reaches the Department the voter concerned is assumed to be away and if anybody tries to vote for him it will be assumed he is being personated.  The Minister agrees that the card will tell the voter that the receipt of it does not guarantee anything.  It is merely like an advisory committee.  I do not see much in that.  If the Minister had tightened up the machinery for preventing impersonation&mdash;I am not prepared to lay out a programme for him &mdash;so that anybody attempting to vote for somebody else would be more rigidly dealt with there would be something to be said for it.  Frequently when somebody tries to steal a vote and prostitute the whole democratic system it requires the swearing of evidence to convict them when they are brought before a magistrate, and I remember that in recent years they were discharged with a caution as though it was a minor offence.  I think it ought to be made a major offence. That would possibly make parties and <Col N="1937" /> individuals much more chary of trying that sort of trickery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Fortunately or unfortunately we cannot deal with the whole problem of personation in this Bill. I am inclined to agree with Senator McEllin that it would be a mistake to put the onus on the postman.  I do not believe the Minister can devise any means by which all these cards will be returned.  At the same time there is a good deal to be said for inviting their return.  The card might possibly have a space on it showing that it is to be returned if the person is away.  I do not think that all householders will be got to return cards or to prevent personation, but quite a number of householders would do so.  That applies particularly to places where there are employees. If cards are simply sent to the house they will just lie on the hall table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The card means nothing more than an indication where the voter is to vote and gives a number. If he is not there it means extra work for the postman to bring it back and in that way serves no purpose.  Presentation of a card does not entitle anybody to vote.  There is a limit of three days in which it must be sent before the election.  I assume that generally the cards will be distributed in a week, or eight or nine or ten days before that.  The Parties will also be sending out cards and if the other cards are sent out late they will cause congestion in the post offices.  If the postman has the official card and the cards or postal packets of each of the candidates on the same day he will want a donkey and cart to bring them around.  I suggest that the State card should be sent out as early as possible. The cards sent out on behalf of individuals or Parties will be sent out near the eve of the poll.  The only effect will be that the postman will have to get a few auxiliaries to help him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to Senator Foran's suggestion, I should like to say that I think that the postman would only be obliged to return these postcards in cases where, <Col N="1938" /> of his own knowledge, he knew that the persons concerned had left the country.  I am not so certain that the same purpose would be served if we required every person, who received a card, addressed to a person who had resided in that particular household on the 15th November, and who had not left the country, but had gone to some other address to return the card.  Perhaps, the best thing in that case would be to request the householder to re-address these postal packets to the former resident at the latter's new address. After all, these people are entitled to vote in respect of the place in which they resided on the 15th November and they would have to vote at the place appointed in that area.  I think, therefore, that it might be better for the present householder to re-address the letter to the former resident at his new address.</P>
      <P>I should not like anybody to think that there is not a point in what Senator Foran has said.  I have not, perhaps, as detailed a knowledge of the wiles of personators at elections as some members of the Seanad seem to have, but I do know that in Belfast it was always regarded as a very desirable thing to know the registered number, and so on, of the person for whom you were going to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see anything to be alarmed about at all so far as this matter of sending out postal cards is concerned.  The only purpose that is served by the sending out of these cards is to facilitate the voters, by telling them their numbers on the register, and the places where they are to vote, and if the cards are not delivered, I do not think anybody can do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with a lot of what Senator McEllin said in regard to the matter of placing the responsibility on the postmen.  I suppose we may take it for granted that most of our postmen are non-political.  Some of them, of course, might not be non-political, <Col N="1939" /> and I still see no harm in letting the postcards go out.  I should like Senators, however, to realise what a burden the return of such postal packages would mean on the Post Office authorities and also on the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  Such a proceeding would involve a great deal of work, and might even mean doubling the staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that some members of the Seanad seem to have such a poor opinion of our postmen. Our postmen, generally, carry out their duties with the utmost care and satisfaction, and I think it is a pity that any doubt should be cast on their integrity on a matter of this kind.  My idea, in mentioning this matter, was to try to limit the possibility of personation at elections.  There is no doubt that a certain amount of personation goes on at elections in this country, and I think that if it were known by possible personators that the card of an absentee had been returned to the returning officer, and that the latter had marked the register &ldquo;absent&rdquo; in the case of the voter concerned, the intending personator would hesitate before trying to vote in some other person's name.  That is what I had in mind, and I think that if you had something like that in connection with this method of sending out these postal cards, it would tend to limit the abuses that, undoubtedly, do occur in connection with democratic elections.  If these cards were returned, in the case of absent persons, and if, in respect of each such person, the register were marked &ldquo;absent&rdquo;, people would be very chary of presenting that card and voting in the absent person's name, because they would know that the returning officer had already marked that person, on his register, as being absent. I do not think there is anything that could give rise to any excitement in trying to extend this very beneficial idea a little more.</P>

Take the case of a man who comes back on the day of the election or the day before it &mdash;if the onus was on the postman to send back the card, what position would the voter be in then?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad requests the Government to introduce proposals for legislation having for their object to make more secure the secrecy of the ballot for blind persons voting at Parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>I have to apologise to the Seanad in the first instance for not being able to introduce this motion at an earlier date, and I also wish to say that I am grateful to the Seanad for permitting me to hold over the motion until I could attend.  This may not be an opportune time for introducing the motion but, on the other hand, it may be opportune to introduce it now, since we have the Minister for Local Government and Public Health here, and since we have just been discussing a Bill dealing with the question of accommodating voters, in general, at the forthcoming election. The resolution that I am proposing is to the effect that the Government should make special accommodation in regard to a certain class of voters, who, by reason of their disability, are a good deal hampered in regard to the secrecy of the ballot, which is guaranteed by our Constitution.  All I am asking is that the Government would consider the introduction of some measures to safeguard the secrecy of the ballot in regard to blind persons who may be voting at Parliamentary elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that this is a very small point on which to ask the Minister to exercise Parliamentary legislation, but, as a matter of fact, it is not so small a point as one might think. The number of blind persons in Ireland is very considerable.  The number of blind persons on the electoral lists must also be very considerable.  In Éire there are between 7,000 and 8,000 known blind persons.  That is, probably, an understatement, but I understand that that is an official figure. What happens when a blind person wishes to exercise his right to vote at <Col N="1942" /> a Dáil election?  He has the power of voting, but he has not the power of ensuring secrecy in marking his vote. In order to record his vote, he has to dictate his choice to the presiding officer in the presence of and subject to the observation of the agents of the several candidates.  While the ordinary voter can vote in strict secrecy by marking the paper where nobody can see it except himself, the blind person has to publish, certainly to three persons, and, possibly, to a dozen or 15 persons, the manner in which he is voting.  It is quite clear that the observance of secrecy diminishes in high proportion as the number of persons increases to whom the &ldquo;secret&rdquo;&mdash; the word &ldquo;secret&rdquo; being in inverted commas&mdash; is confided.  It is hard to believe that, where the vote of the person concerned is of any interest to members of the public and when a dozen people know about it, it will remain secret.</P>
    <P>The blind person has the same right to secrecy in exercising his vote as has any of the rest of us, and it is inconsiderate to him if the present method cannot be varied so as to preserve the secrecy of his vote.  This could be done extremely simply.  There is in force in Great Britain an Act which gives a blind person the advantage of voting in complete secrecy as regards any of the officials present at the election.  He is entitled to bring with him into the polling booth some intimate friend who, according to the English Act, may be a near relative. To him he dictates his directions as to how his vote is to be placed on the ballot paper.  The person who acts as amanuensis&mdash;almost as a mechanical amanuensis&mdash;is, as I have said, usually a near relative or intimate friend of the voter and is nominated by him. He is bound to secrecy just as much as are the dozen persons who watch a blind elector voting in this country. As he is chosen by the voter with full confidence in his discretion and honour, there is little chance of the vote becoming known to other people who have no right to the knowledge.</P>
    <P>When I put down this motion some weeks ago, I had hoped that it would be possible for the Minister to give it <Col N="1943" /> full consideration in view of the forthcoming general election.  It might be somewhat optimistic if I were to express that hope now.  But I do hope that it will receive full consideration and, if possible, be inserted in the law of our country before another general election is held.  The Minister may tell me that it would be impossible in the time available to implement this motion.  I do not see how the impossibility arises.  The matter could be dealt with in a Bill of a few clauses.  I do not think that that Bill would raise even as much discussion as took place to-day on the Bill with which we have just dealt.  In any event, I hope that, by moving this motion, I have not started as many unexpected hares as were started in the earlier discussion by some of my friends.</P>

      <P>I second the motion and I should like to support the case made by Senator Rowlette with all the force and feeling a man can have. Some Senators may have friends and others may have relatives who have had to face one of the biggest tragedies a man or woman can have to face&mdash;total blindness.  The feelings of these afflicted people are not to be equated with the strict legal forms of a statute.  We ought to make every possible concession to such people.  It is not that I think returning officers would not be thoughtful and kind and extremely just to these people that I say this but it is because of the peculiar psychology of the blind.  Allowance has to be made for that.  I do appeal in this matter, if not to the heads of Senators, to their hearts.  I have had something to do with blind people and I know how they feel their affliction.  I know how that affliction comes up against them in many ways. It is the duty of any Christian to lighten their burden if he can.  I appeal to the Minister to make an effort, even in respect of the forthcoming election, on the lines suggested by Senator Rowlette's motion.</P>

      <P>I presume that the members of the Seanad are in full <Col N="1944" /> sympathy with the object of the motion.  We are told that blindness is the worst possible affliction.  Insanity, I think, is the worst, but blindness is next in degree.  I suggest respectfully to Senator Rowlette that he should alter his motion and after the word &ldquo;blind&rdquo; in the third line insert the words &ldquo;and illiterate&rdquo;.  If it is humiliating to a blind person to have to make known his views on polling day in the presence of the personating agents of the different candidates, I am sure it is also humiliating to an illiterate voter, who has to make known his views in the same way.  I suggest to Senator Rowlette that he should extend the terms of his motion so as to cover illiterate persons.</P>

      <P>I understand that, as the law stands, anybody who is not capable of marking his ballot paper has to vote in the same way as an illiterate voter.  The blind person has to run the gauntlet the same as the illiterate voter.  That means that somebody has to mark the paper for both.  I understand, too, that anybody who is not physically capable of marking his ballot paper must have his paper marked for him in the same way.  If we cater for the blind and illiterate voters in this motion, we shall have to go a step further and include anybody who is not capable of marking his ballot paper.  I have seen this method of voting carried out and I did not think it was humiliating.  It is necessary as a result of the unfortunate disability from which the person suffers.  It is unfortunate that a person should suffer from illiteracy and doubly unfortunate that he should suffer from blindness and that he cannot, therefore, mark his paper as he could if he had his sight.  I feel, however, that this is a question that cannot be very easily solved because somebody must do it for him and I do not think there is very much publicity attached to the fact that the presiding officer marks the paper in the presence of people who are there to see that he does so in accordance with the wishes of the voter.  In a rush of an evening a presiding officer may not take illiterate voters.  Usually these people <Col N="1945" /> vote at a time when the booths are practically empty so that I do not think there is very much publicity attached to the present system. Naturally we should all like to see voting by these people made as private as possible, but I suggest that this question affects a greater number of people than those who are actually blind.</P>

      <P>I am in thorough agreement with the motion, and I do not think anyone will dispute the necessity for some such proposals as are suggested in it.  I do not think any comparison can be made between the illiterate voter and the blind voter. The number of blind persons in the country is fairly considerable while illiterate voters are comparatively few.  I think, therefore, that we should not go outside the motion as it stands on the Order Paper.  With the spread of education, the illiterate voter will practically disappear.  We can cure illiteracy but we cannot cure blindness.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Dr. Rowlette indicated the real kernel of this question, that blind people are often highly cultured people and that they are very sensitive in regard to the restrictions imposed upon them in exercising the franchise and in being classed with illiterates.  I think if it has been found possible in other countries to devise means by which the self-respect of these people is preserved in such a simple matter, we should not be behind in making similar arrangements. I would therefore plead with the Minister to give very careful attention to the case which has been made by Senator Dr. Rowlette.</P>

I think we should not allow this matter, which is a comparatively simple matter, to be mixed up with a question which is to a large extent another problem.  To the best of my belief, the arrangements which have been made in England apply only to the blind, and to my own knowledge a certain number of blind voters in this country do not vote at all because of sensitiveness.  If a voter is competent to express a preference in favour of any particular candidate, he should be quite competent to choose a person who would act on his behalf in voting for him.  In that simple way the matter could be dealt with with the maximum of satisfaction to blind persons and without any conceivable danger to the State.  I am sorry that this question was not raised earlier, but Senator Dr. Rowlette unfortunately became ill.  I think we are all to some extent to blame in not raising it a year or two ago when it could have been dealt with at our leisure.  The fact that there is a system in force in the neighbouring island, that there has been some experience of that system and that as far as we know it has worked to the satisfaction of all concerned, should indicate that it is quite possible to put through, for this election at any rate, a simple Bill as quickly as the last Bill was put through.  I would urge the Minister carefully to consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that there are a number of conditions affecting this matter that Senators who have spoken in favour of the motion may possibly have overlooked. I may say that the question of formulating legislative proposals to amend the procedure by which blind and other physically incapacitated persons may have physical assistance in marking their papers has been under consideration, and that that consideration has disclosed a number of fundamental principles which have to be regarded when we are dealing with this <Col N="1947" /> matter.  These fundamental considerations are, first of all, that we must be sure that the person casting the vote is the person rightly entitled to do so; secondly, that the secrecy of the ballot is preserved and thirdly, that the vote is cast in accordance with the wishes of the rightful voter.  I think that the provisions of the existing law have been drawn as appropriately as possible to secure these three ends.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, not alone the blind, but persons suffering from physical incapacity who cannot mark their own papers, may request the presiding officer, but only the presiding officer, to assist them in having their papers marked.  The presiding officer, as we know, asks the voter to state the candidates for whom he wishes to vote, and in what order.  He then marks the paper in the presence of the agents who may be lawfully present, and here the question of preserving the secrecy of the ballot comes in.  The only people who may be present when a vote is being marked in this way are people who have taken a declaration of secrecy, and it is proper to point out that a breach of a declaration of secrecy involves a very severe penalty. I am not sure that it would be possible to devise any other procedure which would give the same guarantee of secrecy as the existing procedure.  If the presiding officer alone were allowed to mark the paper, unseen by anyone, it is clear to the House that the secrecy of the ballot would be well preserved, because not alone would the presiding officer be bound by his undertaking to preserve secrecy, but, in addition, he would have so many papers to issue that I doubt whether it would be within the capacity of any man to remember at the end of a polling day how a particular person voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But we have to remember this: that the person voting has not himself a sole and exclusive right of ensuring that the ballot paper is marked in accordance with his wishes.  Every candidate in the election, and extending the idea further, I may say that every elector in the constituency and in the <Col N="1948" /> country has an interest in securing that where a ballot paper has to be marked by an agent on behalf of a voter, that the paper is properly marked in accordance with the voter's expressed wish.  Unfortunately, the history of elections, not only in this country but elsewhere, has been such that when this procedure was devised, very few would have been prepared to trust a presiding officer absolutely to do this, and therefore the law provided that the paper must be marked in the presence of the agents of the several candidates, those other people who, as well as the voter, have a statutory right to see that proper precautions are taken to ensure that the voting paper will be marked in accordance with the wishes of the rightful voter.</P>
    <P>Again, in order to preserve the secrecy of the ballot, the agents or other interested parties who are present are also bound to secrecy, and the fact that they are present when the paper is being marked is a guarantee that it will be marked as the voter desires.  If a relative accompanies a blind person and marks the paper it is a presumption, but it is only a presumption, that the relative will mark the paper in accordance with the voter's directions. There can be no check and the relative will know and will certainly remember how the blind person voted. Therefore, secrecy of the ballot under the procedure which has been suggested would, in my view, be more greatly endangered than it is under the existing method.  It is true that a blind person might not be compelled to tell his relative; he might prefer to entrust the marking of his paper to the presiding officer rather than to a member of his own household.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have gone through elections over a considerable period of years are well aware of the fact that members of the same family very often do not want to allow other members of the household to know how they voted.  We know there may be different political opinions within families, that, husbands and wives often take separate sides as well as parents and children in these matters, and we have no guaran- <Col N="1949" /> tee, therefore, that one of two things may not happen.  First of all, the blind person may be unwilling to ask a relative to mark his ballot paper, and secondly, what I think is more important, we have no guarantee that the relative will comply with his wishes. It is clear, therefore, from what I have said, that to do exactly what the motion requires, that is to say, &ldquo;to make more secure the secrecy of the ballot for blind persons&rdquo;, is not so very easy.  If some supervision be not exercised over the agent employed by the afflicted voter, there is the possibility not only that the confidence of the latter may be abused but that wider interests than personal interests may be affected.  Again, I want to emphasise the point that no voter has a sole and exclusive right in seeing that his ballot paper is marked in accordance with the way in which he wishes to cast his vote.  He has the sole right to cast his vote, but other people are interested in the procedure which is adopted to ensure that the wishes of the voter are carried out to the letter.</P>
    <P>The question of voting facilities for the blind, however, I may say, warrants examination from another point of view.  As the law stands at present, if a blind voter presents himself or herself at the polling booth before 5 o'clock in the afternoon, he or she is entitled to vote, and for that purpose the booth or room in which the vote is taken is, as a rule, cleared of every person other than those lawfully entitled to be present, that is to say, other than those who have taken a declaration of secrecy.  Blind and other persons physically incapacitated often present themselves after 5 o'clock at which time the presiding officer may disregard their requests for assistance in marking their papers.  To disregard such an appeal seems inconsiderate and harsh, and may, and to my own knowledge often has, occasioned an unpleasant scene, but, on the other hand, to give way or accede to it, may inconvenience a multitude of voters who sometimes may even be deprived of their vote by the closing of the poll. This is an aspect of the matter to which I have been giving consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1950" /> I am not so sure at all that, if this motion were being discussed in the other House where people, perhaps, are more familiar with the difficulties which attend the taking of a poll than members of the Seanad are, there would be any great demand for a change in the law at all, but, looking at it from another point of view, from the point of view of general convenience, and the right of the general body of the electorate, I am having the question examined, and if I am satisfied that the Bill will have an easy passage, I may be able with the approval of the Government to do something to deal with the situation in time for the coming election, but I want to impress on the House that it is not at all the simple matter which is being represented to us here.</P>
    <P>There are vital and fundamental considerations to be taken into account, and if, for instance, I were satisfied that there was danger that the secrecy of the ballot would not be preserved, or that the new procedure which has been suggested would be abused&mdash;and I am not clear in my own mind that that procedure might not be abused, and that the machinery which would have to be provided to prove close relationship with the voter would not be too cumbersome&mdash;I would consider drafting a Bill.  But as I have said, the Bill would have to run the gauntlet of persons very experienced in these matters who can see all the objections I have mentioned, and could perhaps even see stronger objections to the course proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt disappointed with the greater part of the Minister's speech, but he gave me some gleam of hope at the end when he said he would consider the matter.  If he were able to see around some of the objections which loom large in his mind and the minds of other people, probably his advisers, he said he would examine if anything could be done in the direction I have suggested.  When I say I was disappointed at the greater part of his speech, I do not mean that I was disappointed because he was not accepting my suggestion&mdash;<Col N="1951" /> one hardly expects a Minister to be always ready to accept a suggestion made to him&mdash;but because of the weakness of the case he made in criticism of what I put up in favour of this change in the law.  He is, naturally and properly, very anxious to maintain the secrecy and efficacy of the ballot as representing the opinions of the separate voters, but I would point out to him, without repeating what I have said, that the secrecy of the ballot would be very much better preserved under the system I am suggesting than under the present system.  There is no secrecy where a dozen people are in the secret; it ceases to be a secret.  To say that they have taken a declaration of secrecy does not mean that there is no danger of a leakage.  Under the alternative suggestion which I have made, that the voter would bring in his own amanuensis with him, who would also make a declaration of secrecy, only one person is in the secret, and it is much more likely to be well preserved than where a dozen or more people are in it.  The Minister is anxious, of course, that the voter's wish should be explicit on the ballot paper.  I suggest that that is better secured or as well secured by the method I have suggested.  The vote must be in agreement with the voter's wish; it is in order to make that more efficacious that I put forward this suggestion to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking of the method in vogue in England where they have had several years' experience of special methods of voting for blind voters, I said that the amanuensis&mdash;the person who actually marks the paper&mdash;was usually a relative of the voter.  In fact the British practice is that the person who marks the paper is either a person entitled to vote at the election or the father, mother, brother, sister, husband, wife, son or daughter of the blind person.  The blind person has a wide choice, and it is a strange thing if even a blind man cannot choose one honest person from amongst that list.  There are no grounds for the suggestion that the secret is not as safe in the hands of that one person chosen with the confidence of the voter <Col N="1952" /> as it is in the hands of a dozen people who are strangers to him.  The point as to whether the officers present in the polling booth have any desire to know how he votes is entirely outside the issue.  The point is that his vote is known to a dozen people.  Whether or not they have an interest in the matter is beside the point.  The Minister's rather pathetic reference to the differences that exist in families&mdash;it is an obvious fact, of course&mdash;would be met if a clause similar to that in the British Act were in force here, so that the person who marks the paper may be either a near relative or another voter at the election.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the suggestions&mdash; which I anticipated&mdash;that were made by Senator Healy and Senator O'Donovan as to other persons who are disabled to the same extent as blind persons.  I had that point in mind, of course, and thought it might be met.  I have no objection to those persons being included, but I have raised the single question of blind persons, and you, Sir, have ruled that I cannot go beyond that.  If the Minister thinks fit to bring in a Bill giving relief to those persons who are physically disabled or illiterate, I certainly will give it what support I can in this House. It is a somewhat different principle from that dealing with the blind, and at any rate I am debarred from discussing it to-day.</P>
    <P>There is another advantage which would be gained by adopting the method I have suggested, and that is that not nearly as much time would be wasted.  At present we are told that from 5 o'clock onwards, that is within four hours of the closing of the poll, a person who wants assistance in regard to casting his vote may be refused by the presiding officer, because there is a danger of having the polling booths crowded and other people prevented from voting.  That, of course, is a reasonable precaution.  Under my suggestion, instead of having anything up to a dozen people concerned in the vote of the blind man, only two people are concerned&mdash;the amanuensis who comes with the blind man, and the presiding <Col N="1953" /> officer who hands out the paper and who administers the oath, if an oath is necessary, to the amanuensis.  Under that suggestion, much less time is taken than if the whole party present in the polling booth have to inspect the method of casting the vote.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some remarks that I think may have been misunderstood. I certainly would have misunderstood them myself if it were not that I knew that the more obvious meaning was one which it was impossible for him to intend.  I refer to his suggestion that all the voters are interested in how a particular voter votes.  The public, the whole electorate, is certainly interested in making sure that his vote is cast in accordance with his wishes that his vote does really express the wish of the voter, but the number of times which the Minister repeated that they were interested in it as well as the voter&mdash;he did not say as much as the voter, I think&mdash;suggested that they have the right to inspect the vote.</P>

I realise that that could not be what he had in mind, and I am glad he has made that explicit. But the whole force of the greater part of his argument falls to the ground with that admission which the Minister has made now.  I have listened with every sympathy to the Minister making the case against my suggestion, but I found no argument or statement in it that I did not meet when I introduced the resolution half an hour ago.  I welcome the degree of sympathy which the Minister has given to the question, and his statement that he is prepared to give further consideration to methods for protecting the interests of the blind, and, if he chooses, of those who are handicapped in marking the voting paper or are <Col N="1954" /> illiterate.  I hope that, when he gives more study to the question, he will take a different view, and pay less attention to a study of the bogies which seem to exist mainly in his own mind to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In asking the Seanad to give a Second Reading to this Bill, I think it well to give a little bit of the history of the policy that we are now seeking to complete.  About 16 years ago a motion was brought into the Dáil to deal with the proprietary creameries at that time, resulting from a sort of war between the proprietors and the co-operatives. As a result of that war the co-operatives were compelled to pay a higher figure than the economic price for milk, and some of them were hardly able to continue.  Some of them, as a matter of fact, failed.  Some of the proprietors, of course, failed also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme was introduced at the time for the taking over of these properties by a holding body and the intention was to hand them over to the Dairy Disposals Board as it is now known. It was formed for the purpose of holding these properties and it took over the Newmarket Company and the Condensed Milk Company and also a toffee factory.  The Condensed Milk Company comprises not only the condensery in Limerick but also a condensery in Drumkeen and two creameries in Tipperary.  The greater part of the properties were handed over to co-operative societies but for one reason or another some were held by the Dairy Disposals Board.  In the case of the Condensed Milk Company there was no body of people here, whether co-operative society or company, prepared to take over the condensery and work it.  In other cases, for reasons of re-organisation and so on, the creameries were held.  Now, as time went on, the Dairy Disposals Board <Col N="1955" /> was more or less forced into the position, or at any rate it accepted the position of taking over co-operative societies that were in a bad way financially and of reorganising them and handing them over to other co-operatives, dividing them or retaining some of them.</P>
    <P>Later still, the Dairy Disposals Board went into the business of developing new areas.  Now the development of new areas was a very interesting development of this body, and I think that everybody will agree that these areas would never have been developed were it not for a body of that kind.  If you take areas like West Cork and South Kerry where farmers were getting very poor prices, it was not possible to get any co-operative society to develop them because the chances of success looked so poor. The only hope of getting development in these areas was by some big company, a financially backed company of this kind, that was encouraged to do so by the Government and insured against loss, if loss there would be.  I remember, as a matter of fact, going before the Dáil with an estimate for the areas of Cahirciveen, Kenmare and Castletownbere and asking for £40,000 for the purpose.  I stated in the Dáil that I could give no guarantee whatever that the money would ever be returned to the Exchequer, and that it was quite possible it might be a loss. As a matter of fact, these areas turned out to be a great success.  I think they are probably on a paying basis by now. The Dairy Disposals Board now hold a large number of concerns, a large number of creamery units and so on. A question that will have to be dealt with on another day is, what is to be the future of the Dairy Disposals Board.  Well, the organisation that I refer to that commenced in 1927, was, in my opinion, well-timed because the world depression in butter prices came about 1929, and it was a great thing that the competition between one society and another and the competition between co-operative societies and proprietors had to a large extent ceased by 1929, because the creamery industry as a whole could never have <Col N="1956" /> withstood the world depression if it had been organised as it was organised prior to 1929.  The Dairy Disposals Board since 1927 has taken over 182 private concerns, 114 of which were owned by one firm.</P>
    <P>It was always intended, of course, that this policy of taking over the proprietors would be completed, and it is proposed now in this Bill to complete the business.  What we are doing here is not by any means original. The history of the co-operative movement in other countries will at least give us some precedent to go upon. In most countries, as far as I have read about co-operation, there are actually laws which compel the minority to come in when there is a substantial majority already in the co-operative movement.  That majority is defined by different percentages in different countries but usually where, say, two-thirds of the producers in a particular agricultural industry agree to co-operate, then the other third must come in and join the co-operative movement.  In the particular case we are dealing with here I think that there is only about 4 per cent. remaining outside the co-operative movement, that is, if we regard the property held by the Disposals Board as being co-operative, as I think we must for this particular purpose, because the Dairy Disposals Board is holding these properties in trust for some future co-operative societies.  The Bill gives me power to compel the remaining proprietors to sell.  As the Bill is set out, it gives first an opportunity for agreement with regard to sale.  When the Bill is passed the proprietors that are there will make returns of the properties and then the Dairy Disposals Board and the proprietors will try to come to agreement. If they fail to come to agreement, then an arbitrator will be appointed to determine the price and the proprietors will then have to accept that price and hand over the properties to the Dairy Disposals Board.  I am not, unfortunately, in a position to give an estimate of what this is going to cost, because I cannot naturally determine what an arbitrator is likely to decide.  Whatever <Col N="1957" /> the cost may be, there will be in this, as in all these transactions, an element of subsidy.</P>
    <P>I want to explain what this element of subsidy is to Senators who may not have given detailed attention to the activities of the Dairy Disposals Board.  The Dairy Disposals Board takes over a property, let us say, a creamery which is an individual unit. They buy the goodwill which includes the milk supply and the premises.  The Board, if they come to agreement, buy at the best price they can, but if it goes to arbitration they have to accept whatever the arbitrator decides.  The Dairy Disposals Board will make an estimate of what the co-operative society will ask them to pay, but there may be this difference, they may only want the milk, and may not want the premises.  As they cannot sell the premises for a creamery it will have to be sold for some other purpose.  Possibly, it will not be worth as much to another person as it would be to a creamery proprietor.  Therefore, there will be a loss and that loss will be put down in the estimate to be met by subsidy.</P>
    <P>Now, another question that may be asked is whether this is going to finish all competition between one society and another, or between one buyer of milk and another.  Well, this Bill will go a long way towards the elimination of any such thing as competition.  After all, the co-operative societies seldom carry on what has come to be called a milk-war.  On a few occasions such a thing has happened but, so far, we have succeeded&mdash;although there is no law to stop such disputes occurring&mdash; in making peace between the people concerned.</P>
    <P>It is intended, at some future time &mdash;in fact, before very long, I think&mdash;to bring in a Bill dealing with the question of co-operation in general, and I expect that in that Bill there will be provisions dealing with the question of competition as between one co-operative society and another.  For instance, I take it that there will be spheres of influence laid down and that there will be no necessity or, indeed, even an opportunity, for competition <Col N="1958" /> between such societies.  That Bill, however, has not yet seen the light of day, but when it appears, the question of competition between co-operative societies, as well as many other questions in regard to this matter, will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Another point that has been raised was whether the Dairy Disposals Board are competent to carry out this business, and whether we can come to any conclusion, as a result of the working of that Board in the past, as to how they are likely to fare in the future.  I should like to give the Seanad some general idea of the finances surrounding the operations of the Dairy Disposals Board from the beginning of their operations up to the present time.  I have said already that the Dairy Disposals Board have been dealing, up to the present, with four separate concerns&mdash;the Newmarket Dairy Company&mdash;which was the first big group of creameries taken over in County Cork in 1927&mdash;the Condensed Milk Company&mdash;which comprised a condensery in Limerick, a condensery in Drumkean, and two creameries, Tipperary and Knocklong&mdash;also the toffee factory in Limerick, which was a separate entity and, in addition, something like 17 or 18 groups of creameries&mdash;some of them held since they were taken over from other proprietors, but mostly such creameries as were developed by the Board in new areas.  The Board operate all these concerns and, in discussing the finances of the Board, I am taking the finances of all these concerns together, without going into the details of one concern or another.  The total amount of capital voted by the Dáil since 1937 is, roughly, £1,172,000.  Now, the Dáil, in voting that money from time to time, were made aware of certain facts that I have mentioned here already in regard to expenses, subsidies, and so on, and therefore we must deduct certain sums from that amount in order to find out how much money is due to the State by the Dairy Disposals Board.  First of all, there is an item of £53,000, which was voted by the Dáil for expenses in connection with the taking over of these concerns, and with the provision of compensation <Col N="1959" /> for redundant staffs and so on.  That sum of £53,000, therefore, is not held as a liability against the Dairy Disposals Board, because it was felt that that ought to be a State charge.  In every deal that is undertaken the Dairy Disposals Board give an estimate to my Department, and it is more or less to the following effect: &ldquo;We estimate that we can buy this concern at such-and-such a price, and resell it to a co-operative at such-and-such a price.&rdquo;  The difference is put down by us as a subsidy.  The total amount of subsidy, estimated on that basis, since the Dairy Disposals Board started operations, was £215,000, but actually they have only utilised, by way of subsidy, £90,000 so far.  They have repaid to the State, £187,000 of the capital.</P>
    <P>Now, I am sure that Senators will recollect that, about nine or ten years ago, there was a good deal of talk about what was often referred to at that time as the £3 per cow.  When the Dairy Disposals Board took over the proprietary concerns they did not ask for cash down, because many of these proprietary or co-operative concerns had not cash in reserve, and they were given eight years in which to pay. The price was £1 per gallon for the milk, and there was also 2/6 per year to be paid.  That was raised, usually, by the co-operative societies, on the basis of the £3 per cow.  Sometimes, of course, it was lower than that, but at any rate a good deal of money has been collected in that way by the Dairy Disposals Board from the co-operative societies, and they make repayments each year to the Exchequer.  They have repaid to the State excluding certain interest £187,000 of the capital.  We have three sums to be taken into account here, which I have already given to the House.  First of all there is the compensation to be paid to redundant staffs, which amounts to £53,000; then there is the sum of £215,000 regarded as a subsidy, estimated on the difference between what the Dairy Disposals Board buy a concern at, and the figure at which they can resell it&mdash;of which they have only utilised £90,000 so far; <Col N="1960" /> and finally the sum of £187,000 repaid. If you subtract these three sums from the amount originally advanced you get a total, up to date, of £717,000 which might be regarded as legitimately due by the Dairy Disposals Board to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The next point that I might be asked about is whether there are any assets there to meet this.  I cannot go into that question in any great detail, but I think I can satisfy any Senator that there are at least sufficient assets to meet the amount involved. In looking through the balance sheet, the first item to be noticed is that in connection with liquid assets&mdash; and, in speaking of liquid assets, I am excluding the matter of travelling creameries, transport, and so on&mdash;the amounts due on foot of sales of property, milk supplies of co-operative creameries, and so on, amount to £428,000.  In addition to that, we have the amount due on foot of sales of properties, milk supplies, co-operative creameries, and so on, amounting to something like £30,000; and then we have transport and travelling creameries.  We have fixed assets in connection with such companies as the Lansdowne Creameries, the Condensed Milk Company, the Toffee Factory, and also miscellaneous small proprietors down through the country, attached to these units.  At any rate, there is certainly more than sufficient to meet the liabilities to the State.</P>
    <P>There is one other item that I should like to mention.  I think that Senators will remember that, in or about 1933 or 1934, I came before the Dáil and asked for an Estimate of £112,000.  The condensery had been losing money from the time it was taken over up to 1932 or 1933, and I was pressed by the Minister for Finance to regularise the position by making the Dáil aware that this Government-owned property was losing money.  I came before the Dáil with an Estimate of £112,000 to cover trading losses.  That sum was voted. The trading losses went on increasing and, by the end of 1933, the losses had reached £137,000, including the £112,000 already voted.  Then, the tide turned and things began to look better. <Col N="1961" /> In the balance sheet for the year ended 31st December, 1941&mdash;I have not yet seen the figure for 1942, but it is not any worse&mdash;that loss of £137,000 had been converted into a profit of £51,000.  The years from 1933 to 1941 were very good and the condensery had recovered all its losses and had a trading profit of £51,000 at that time.</P>
    <P>That is, perhaps, all the financial information that it is necessary to give of a general nature.  If any Senator wants more detailed information, I shall try to give it to him so far as possible.  However, we have to keep in mind that these properties are held by the State, the intention being to sell them at some future time.  When asked for information with regard to the value of any of the properties concerned, we must have regard to that fact.  Before concluding, I want to say that the Bill is a very simple one. It may be a far-reaching Bill but it is easy to understand.  It provides for the possibility of agreement between the present proprietors and the Dairy Disposal Company with regard to the taking over of the properties.  If that agreement is not forthcoming, then an arbitrator will be appointed and the properties will be taken over on the valuation of the arbitrator.  That is the big point in this Bill.  Everything else is subsidiary to the taking over of the creameries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Ordinarily, one would be expected to welcome this measure or, at least, to give it what would be termed a favourable reception but, if there is one aspect of the Minister's policy with which I and a number of others are gravely dissatisfied, it is the aspect with which we are confronted in this Bill.  I was a member of the other House when the late Mr. Hogan introduced the original Act.  I refreshed my memory recently by reading his very interesting and, indeed, quite remarkable speech on that occasion.  His view in 1927, when the original Act was introduced, was that it was essential to the progress and development of the creamery industry that all the creameries should be put upon a solid, economic basis by bringing them all under co-operative control, eliminating <Col N="1962" /> redundant creameries and creating a situation in which competition for milk amongst creameries would cease.  That was his first aim.  He went on, then, to say that the next move in the situation would have to be the introduction of a Co-operative Bill to bring all the co-operatives within one federated organisation, compulsorily if need be. After that, he considered that the passing of an Agricultural Credit Act for the purpose of financing farming generally would give the whole agricultural industry a fair field and an opportunity for development which, at least at that stage in its growth, was not available to it.</P>
      <P>That was in 1927.  This is 1943.  The Minister indicated somewhere recently that during the period from 1927&mdash; before he came into office&mdash;until 1932, about 46 creameries were taken over and that in the ten succeeding years, to date, only nine creameries had been handed over to co-operative societies. If my figures are not correct, the Minister will, I hope, set them right. My quarrel with the Minister&mdash;it is not my quarrel only, but it is the point of view of members of the co-operative societies&mdash;is that, while his predecessor obtained and while he is getting in this measure powers compulsorily to acquire certain properties and purchase certain vested interests, he has, in fact, submitted to the establishment of other vested interests and has permitted a situation to grow up which is very undesirable and which has been a rock on the road to progress by the co-operative movement. The truth of that statement may be challenged.  That is my opinion after many years rather intimate experience of the movement and knowing the position we had hoped to see brought about under the original Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the Minister's speech in the other House and I have listened to him now.  I do not think that the original Bill would have got through the Oireachtas if members were of opinion that we were merely buying out Newmarket Dairy Company and Lovell and Christmas to set up a number of civil servants, however admirable and competent, to run <Col N="1963" /> a very large branch of the dairying business, as they have been doing and are doing.  Apparently, we are satisfied that that position should continue. To-day, the Minister gives no evidence of how or when these people's responsibilities are to be taken from them and handed over to a group of co-operators.  If that picture had been presented to us in those early days, it would not be one which we would have welcomed and the situation would not be one which we would have attempted to create.  Now, a holding body was necessary.  That has not been disputed at all.  There was a period of transition and considerable reorganisation had to be carried out, but a stage was reached in the development of the reorganisation plan when that was completed. However, the holding body that was thought to be a holding body merely for the purpose of taking over and passing on these concerns, has literally become a holding body and has held on so firmly that we have no evidence to-day that the 17 creamery groups which they hold are any nearer passing into the hands of the organised, or to-be-organised, co-operatives than they were when the Minister took them over ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of the introduction of a Co-operative Bill.  I have raised this matter on, at least, a couple of occasions.  It must be eight or nine years ago since a deputation went from the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society to the Minister's Department.  At that time I remember discussing the matter with an official, who has long since gone to his grave, and to-day we see no evidence whatever that we are any nearer the introduction of that Bill than we were seven or eight years ago.  There is no question about it that, throughout the co-operative movement generally, there is grave concern at the policy that the Minister has tolerated in the continuance for so long of these creameries in the hands of the Dairy Disposals Board.  Co-operatives feel that until they are all brought together in one solid whole, organised with a common purpose, their development along certain well-defined lines is not really a <Col N="1964" /> practical proposition.  The Minister has said I think that the Dairy Disposals Board are holding for future co-operative societies 4 per cent. of the creameries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the proprietors have 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon.  It may be said that these 17 creamery groups are no very considerable factor in holding up the forward march of the co-operative movement generally but, if there are members of the House who think along these lines, I should like to disabuse their minds of that idea because the amount of milk they collect and the quantity of butter they handle is a very considerable proportion of the total produced in the State.  My quarrel with the Minister is that he has permitted this to continue far too long.  Generally the co-operative movement is inclined to believe that he is persuaded that the present plan is a better way to run the dairying industry than the transference of these concerns into the hands of organised farmers.  It may be that that is not arguable, but that is the general impression and judging from the facts as we see them, we must accept it as being arguable.  We know that approaches have been made on various occasions to the Dairy Disposals Board for the purchase of the concerns which they hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us some figures with regard to the finances of the Dairy Disposals Board.  It is, perhaps, one of the disadvantages of this form of organisation that these figures are not available to the public.  We have heard a great deal&mdash;perhaps the statements are untrue&mdash;about losses that have been sustained by the Dairy Disposals Board.  The Minister gave us the figures of the amount unpaid to the Exchequer as being £718,000.  He told us that there were liquid assets to the amount of £428,000 and that generally there was sufficient in the hands of the Dairy Disposals Board to meet all liabilities to the State. When the Minister makes that statement, I should like to know whether it is made on the basis of certain <Col N="1965" /> values put on the properties which the company hold at the moment as the price at which they are prepared to sell to the farmer because I have some experience of the figures quoted to co-operative societies when offers were made to purchase some of these properties and some of the figures were regarded as quite unreasonable. Those who were externally interested, apart from those who were actually interested in the purchase, were never able to judge by what precise calculation the Dairy Disposals Board arrived at the figures which they set down as being the value of these properties. I should like to have some clarification of that matter from the Minister.</P>
    <P>When the Minister first came into office&mdash;I presume he has not changed his views since, although some of us think he has&mdash;we were quite satisfied that he was a very ardent co-operator. That was so in the early days, even before he came into the Dáil at all. We feel now that he is divided in his allegiance between what is a concept of a semi-State organisation and the form of co-operative development which we think is best.  Perhaps I should not call it a semi-State organisation; it is altogether a State organisation, and we think that the running of a business like the production and sale of butter, if there is any other way of conducting it, is not a matter for the State.  While the men in charge of this enterprise may be very competent men in a particular way, they are men who have not been trained in the kind of business world in which they must work and operate that business.  There are bound to be, in commercial circles, questions that are rather disturbing when one sees a rather powerful organisation with the finances of the State behind it engaging in an enterprise of this kind, one might say financed by the State, under the wing of the Minister carrying on business in a sphere which business men believe is their domain.  All these things have been said before to the Minister.  They have been said by deputations, across tables and in every other way.  The truth about the matter is that very good work was done by <Col N="1966" /> the Dairy Disposals Board in its early days in organising creameries in Clare. That was before the Minister's time. The work done in Kerry was also of value; we are not disputing that fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he asked the Dáil for £40,000 to develop dairying. He expected to lose it.  I do not mind whether you are prepared to put £40,000 at the disposal of the Dairy Disposals Company or any other body for the organisation of dairying.  I think you would have got another body to do it equally well, but that is not a reflection on the way it was done.  If you are prepared to lose money on the organisation of farmers and the development of a particular branch of the industry, I think you would increase production and the capacity to produce more and to sell quite well.</P>
    <P>What is holding up the transfer of these properties?  When does the Minister visualise the coming of the time when they are to be handed over? I do not know whether the Minister will say that there has been no demand among the farmers to have these creameries transferred.  Some of the creameries could have been bought by co-operative concerns.  There was considerable reluctance to sell and the prices put on them were such as to make it very difficult to buy.  In the districts where those creameries are, who is going to create a demand on the part of the farmers?  Is there a desire on the part of the Minister and the Dairy Disposals Board to see the farmers organised co-operatively?</P>
    <P>I feel that the result of this policy is that productive effort will not be increased.  It will not be more effective from the point of view of production, nor will it be intelligently directed if we absolve the farmers from the organisation of production in their own districts.  Far from holding back and making excuses that there is no demand in the district, a vigorous effort ought to be made, either by the Minister or through some channels which he can control, to place on the shoulders of these people the responsibility of taking over these concerns, handling them, increasing their production and doing the management of the business themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1967" /> I say definitely that that is the Minister's responsibility.  It is the finale of this whole plan, which was developed by the Minister's predecessor in office. From what the Minister has said to-day, I am no more satisfied that we are coming nearer to the liquidation of the Dairy Disposals Board than we were in 1932.  I believe we were nearer to it in that year than we are to-day. At least, the Minister is no more positive and no more definite.  That, I think, is very undesirable.  I feel very strongly that this is not the way in which the farmers' business should be done.  If there are certain branches of the business which may be described as technical and commercial, it can easily be pointed out that some of our creameries have engaged and are engaging in a type of production that might be termed commercial or industrial and are doing it quite well.  As the Minister knows, a few of our creameries are blossoming out into other forms of agricultural production, all of which ought to be welcomed, but I think it can be said, and with truth, that development of co-operative effort &mdash;certainly from the point of view of dairying&mdash;and the advantages that could flow from the proper organisation of co-operative effort are being impeded and held up by this sort of enterprise on its flank, which is never really going to be part of it and can never be part of it until the Dairy Disposals Board has ceased to exist.</P>
    <P>It would be inconsistent of me to stand against the passing of this Bill, because I strongly supported the original measure when it was introduced. I should have liked, however, to have had something more definite from the Minister than anything he said to us.  I should like to know when and how these 17 creameries are to be handed over to co-operative groups of farmers.  Who is going to organise them?  Are they to be told by the board that they are to get out and that the farmers themselves can organise and take over these enterprises as other groups of farmers are doing in the same counties?  These creameries are in the country side by side with co-operative <Col N="1968" /> creameries, and are we to be told that what one group of farmers can do efficiently in one parish cannot be done by another group of farmers in an adjoining parish?  We have the example of Knockmeal, of Mitchelstown, and of Dungarvan.  Why should this body on the flank of the co-operative movement hold up this kind of development which a number of us visualise as the proper function of the co-operative movement in the future?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have much more specific and definite information as to when we may expect to see the winding up of the Dairy Disposals Board in so far as it operates as the owner and manager of co-operative creameries where milk is converted into butter.  I would like to know from him when he gives us these figures whether sufficient resources are in the hands of the Dairy Disposals Board along with their liquid assets to meet all their liabilities to the State?  Are there certain fixed sums placed on every creamery group which they hold and must get before they pass over to co-operators, and is it because of this situation that it has not been possible or practicable to pass them over to the management of co-operative groups of farmers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Dairy Disposals Board is purely a holding body and that it is in possession of these assets until such time as it can get rid of them without loss to the State.  I am sure that it will be of interest to many people in the country to learn that this money which was advanced from time to time for the purchase of the various proprietary creameries has been lent and not given as a grant.  Many people in the country believe that it is money advanced by the State for all time as a gift to co-operative societies and has not to be repaid.  At the time there was a rather strong feeling of unrest that the co-operative societies were being unduly favoured at the expense of the rest of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter is very anxious to know when the Dairy Disposals Board holdings are to be finally handed over <Col N="1969" /> to co-operative societies.  Is it possible that these groups of farmers for whom Senator Baxter speaks are endeavouring to get these assets at a sacrifice value?  It is the duty of the board to get fair value for the assets they hold and not to give them away at a sacrifice and, perhaps, if those co-operative societies were prepared to meet the board more favourably, it is quite possible that the holdings could have been handed over long ago.  We will hear from the Minister, probably later on, what the difficulty is.  In the meantime, there is this question of the co-operative societies branching out into other forms of industry. Senator Baxter has adverted to the fact that some of these creameries have gone a long way in that direction, and have taken over other work or other business which is not usually connected with the farming industry. I am in touch with the areas served by the creameries spoken of by Senator Baxter, and I can assure the Senator that there is a very grave feeling of unrest in many of the towns in County Waterford as a result of the activities of those creameries.  The old question of the cobbler minding his last enters into this.  The various traders in the towns in the South are taxpayers of this State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am slightly out of order.  We are dealing with the creamery industry, and Senator Baxter adverted to the fact that the creameries are now engaged in activities outside their immediate work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>It may impress Senator Baxter to learn that the co-operative societies are now going into the licensed trade, and that is, I think, slightly outside the scope of their work.  Of course the result will be that the creamery societies will eventually own practically all the industries in the country.  I think it was <Col N="1970" /> the Minister who pointed out that the creamery societies have now practically got rid of competition.  I do not know that they have.  There is a certain amount of jealousy between the creamery companies.  For instance, if a farmer had been supplying one of the creamery companies, and if, as a result of the transport difficulties at the moment, that particular creamery company is unable to take his milk, the neighbouring creamery company refuses to take it.  I am thinking of a particular case at the moment, and there probably are other cases throughout the country.  In this particular case, that farmer is now left without a market for his milk, although I understand that a neighbouring creamery could take it, but will not do so.  I think pressure should be brought to bear on those creameries to ensure that they will not allow that sort of jealousy to interfere with their main work, which is the protection of the suppliers of milk in this country. If co-operation means anything at all, it should mean that if a farmer supplies milk to creamery A, and if for the moment he is precluded from supplying that particular creamery as a result of transport difficulties, creamery B should accept his milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I am very glad to learn that those various sums advanced by the Exchequer from time to time are to be repaid.  I take it that the delay in the handing over of the assets&mdash;of which Senator Baxter complains&mdash;by the Dairy Disposals Board is due to the fact that the board is endeavouring to get the best terms it possibly can for those assets, in order to ensure that the amounts advanced by the State from time to time are refunded to the Exchequer.  I am sure there is no other explanation.  What reason has the Dairy Disposals Board for holding on to those assets?  Is it possible that the people in the places served by it are quite satisfied with its work, and quite satisfied with the way in which the board is treating them? It is quite possible that the farmers have no anxiety to take over those places, and that they are quite satisfied. If they are, how does Senator Baxter make out that it is the Minister's <Col N="1971" /> fault that they will not take them over?  Is the Minister supposed to compel those people to form a society and take over the assets of the Dairy Disposals Board?  However, I take it that the Minister will explain the whole situation.</P>

      <P>For many years I have followed closely the development of the co-operative movement, and I have certain special knowledge of the activities of the societies which I think Senator Goulding had in mind when he was speaking.  Perhaps I would not be in order in pursuing that, but, speaking generally, I do say that the co-operative movement has conferred an enormous boon upon the country.  It has put more money into the hands of the primary producers. It has established financial reserves which enable purchases to be made in bulk at the best price.  It has made the system of distribution very much more economical, and, although certain vested interests may have suffered, that is inevitable under any efficient system.  With those few general remarks, I will pass on to deal more particularly with the matters affected by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House no doubt is aware of what was in the minds of the Government when this Dairy Disposals Company was founded.  I have here an extract from their articles of association.  It was founded as a private company under the Companies Acts, with a share capital of £10.  The objects of the company were chiefly to facilitate and promote the disposal and distribution of all or any of the undertakings, property and assets of the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland, and the Newmarket Dairy Company to and amongst co-operative creamery societies, whether then in existence or thereafter formed, and to dispose of such of said undertakings as should not be transferred to co-operative creameries; to carry on the business of said companies during such time as the Minister for Agriculture should think fit; to facilitate the establishment of co-operative creameries with a view to sale to such societies of properties of the said companies.  This <Col N="1972" /> then was a body intended to acquire certain proprietary interests which were working in competition with and against the interests of co-operation generally, and in the course of time to transfer those interests to the co-operative movement.  I would suggest that that has not been carried out to anything approaching a satisfactory extent.  I realise that some creameries were transferred, and that other redundant creameries were closed. But 15 years or more have now passed since this company was formed, and not only has it been dilatory in the disposal of certain assets which essentially, under the Government's policy, should be embodied in the co-operative movement, but it has, I suggest, gone entirely outside its articles of association by starting to promote creameries in new districts. In fact it has usurped the functions of the I.A.O.S., which body receives a Government grant for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister will say that that society could not promote creameries in West Kerry and Clare like the Dairy Disposals Board has done.  That statement would not bear examination if the society had the funds, and the State finances, that the Dairy Disposals Board had.  The I.A.O.S. was eminently more fitted for that.  It was its job and it had years and years of experience in the business of promoting creameries.  There is no evidence that the Government is taking this matter seriously.  There is involved something much more than these specific transactions.  There is the principle of education, and there is the essential purpose for which the whole movement was founded.  Even assuming that it was necessary to bring in outside money in the formation of societies in Kerry and Clare and even assuming that this work was done&mdash;I suggest wrongly done, and I would go so far as to say that it was outside their powers&mdash;by the Dairy Disposals Company, the time has now come when the Government should make an honest effort, in co-operation with the I.A.O.S., to get local societies to take over these concerns.  In principle, this element of State trading is most undesirable. I do not say that there <Col N="1973" /> may not be exceptions and, to a certain extent, the Dáil sanctioned the establishment of the Dairy Disposals Board as an exception, but with clear and express intentions of the handing over of their assets to the co-operative movement as soon as possible.  I do not intend to make an attack on persons, as when one mentions civil servants who cannot defend themselves it is always said that one is acting improperly.  The position now is that where a few civil servants have got a taste of power they do not want to give it up.  It is a nice position to be in&mdash;to be autocrats in a specially sheltered capacity&mdash;and be able to carry on trade.  I do not say that they are not doing it quite well but, naturally, what they have like to cling on to.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the Minister is serious in this matter, but the results are unsatisfactory.  More should have been done to carry out the original intentions and liquidate the assets of the Dairy Disposals Company. I come first of all to the very belated figures that have been given us.  Here we have for years past a Government company with the directorate entirely civil servants, operating without any accounts whatever, obtaining over £1,000,000 of Government money and giving to Parliament no information whatever about its operations. That is an undesirable position and it is one that the Dáil&mdash;if I may say so without attempting to dictate to the other House&mdash;should have long since taken notice of.  Now, as the result of a good deal of pressure in connection with this Bill, the Minister has caused to be produced a consolidated balance sheet and suggested that is all we need want.  It is far from being all we want to know. It was merely a consolidated balance sheet of about five undertakings.  I think we had only £10 of the capital held by the Dairy Disposals Board and there is a sum £21,000 paid-up capital. What company is that held by?  There is a credit balance of profit and loss of some £64,000.  To which concerns does that credit balance apply?  I do not think it is treating Parliament in a proper manner to give us this omnibus information when £1,000,000 <Col N="1974" /> of State money is involved and tell us that is all we want to know.  We should have that information all along as Parliament and the country should have information as to the financial activities of these companies.  There should be accounts as there are accounts of the Electricity Supply Board and most Government trading concerns.  I do not say there was not Parliamentary sanction, but it did not require legislation inasmuch as these properties were acquired by agreement. We have this company proceeding to go on trading for 15 years and not telling a single thing about it. Now we are in the position that the co-operative movement wishes to acquire the Newmarket Dairy Group. That is essentially a business which should fall to the lot of the co-operative creameries.  For reasons best known to itself the Government is holding up the transfer.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is right that there should be rivalry and antagonism for 15 years between local co-operative societies and the Dairy Disposals Board.  There should be an honest attempt to get this done, even let it go to arbitration.  I have no doubt whatever that the societies wishing to acquire this property are quite prepared to go to arbitration and if the Minister were serious and if the Dairy Disposals Board really wanted&mdash;I think that is the fly in the ointment&mdash; to divest itself of its powers and functions it would put up a scheme of arbitration and let the matter be settled. As it is the Minister is holding out for a certain sum of money and also for a plebiscite of societies as if the co-operative movement would have ever been founded at all if it was based on a plebiscite of farmers.  The co-operative movement is recognised.  Why can it not go on instead of setting up rivals, the co-operative movement on one side and bureaucracy, a Government Department, on the other?  Implicit in the whole thing is a warning not only in this particular case but for the future, that if the Government is going into business, which God forbid, it ought to make public what it is doing. Here we have a Government company operating for 15 years and the public knows practically nothing about it. <Col N="1975" /> The public has been given a balance sheet that some of those financial magnates who are criticised for not giving information might well have given. I remember in other days in the P. and O. Company there was criticism of the information that Lord Inchcape used to give shareholders.  The Government has given us no more information than the P. and O. Company gave to the public.  That is what is likely to happen when the Government gets itself into business, and I should like to ask the House to impress on the Minister the desirability of getting out of this business as soon as possible, so as not to have people regarding such organisations as the Dairy Disposals Board as a rival organisation to their own.  I think it would be better for the Minister to get out of this business and carry out the original intention which brought this board into existence.  I may not be right in this, but I understood the Minister to say that he proposes to introduce legislation in the near future with regard to the Dairy Disposals Board.  Did I understand the Minister aright in saying that such a Bill is coming along?</P>

      <P>Well, I hope that when the proposed Bill comes along it will carry out some of the suggestions of the late Mr. Hogan, and the original purpose&mdash;repeated again and again&mdash;was that this particular body would be only a transitory body.  It seems now, that, instead of this being a transitory body, it is entrenched here, with a debt to the State of over £700,000.  In such circumstances, nobody could compete with them, particularly when no interest is being paid on the capital.  I think that it is a very wrong form of government to permit no competition in such a case as that, and I hope that the Minister will give the House some assurance that the original intentions in regard to the operation of the Dairy Disposals Board will be carried out.</P>

      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this <Col N="1976" /> Bill.  I feel that it was absolutely necessary to introduce this Bill at the present moment, and I am confident that the milk suppliers, the shareholders, and the guarantors of the creameries that are now to be taken over, will also welcome this Bill.  A certain amount of criticism has been directed against the Dairy Disposals Board with regard to the holding up of the matter of the transfer of certain co-operative societies, but I did not hear the Minister state on any occasion that he wanted to hold down any of these creameries for an indefinite period.  On several occasions, as a matter of fact, it was made known to the farmers that, when they were in a position to take over those creameries, and pay whatever liabilities were due, the Minister was willing to hand them over.  The trouble, unfortunately, that we have had in this country, so far as the dairying industry is concerned, was that we had too many small creameries starting off in one district or the other every year.  The result was that there was a good number of creameries which had not sufficient milk with which to continue in business.  Eventually they went into debt with the bank, and had to close down rather than continue incurring debts with the bank year after year. The only body that was prepared to come to the rescue of such creameries was the Dairy Disposals Board, and that board relieved a large number&mdash; perhaps 90 per cent.&mdash;of the farmers in such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the question has been raised of the taking over by a fairly large co-operative creamery of the milk supply of a small creamery, which might be a redundant creamery that has been closed down.  I do not think it would be any compliment to pay such a creamery a substantial sum so as to enable them to repay the State for the money originally advanced.  There is also, of course, the question of the money advanced by the Dairy Disposals Board, and, in that connection, I should like to say that in my conversations with farmers down the country and with other people concerned in this industry, I have been informed that they are quite satisfied <Col N="1977" /> with the price and they also say that there is no difficulty with regard to management.  Therefore, it would appear that, so far as these people are concerned, there is no real anxiety to take over these creameries.  I do not think we would be justified in dictating to these people what they should do with regard to the control of the creameries, if they are satisfied themselves. If they feel that they can take over these creameries and run them, then I think that nobody should interfere with them and, certainly, I do not think the Government should interfere with them.  While I would not agree that the Government should hold on at all times to these creameries, I do say that the State is entitled to see that these creameries are run in a proper way until such time as the farmers can carry them on for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this Bill.  I think it is a step in the right direction and that it will be a real help to the dairying industry in this country.  Certain criticisms have been directed against the Bill by people on the other side of the House, particularly with regard to the taking over of creameries by the Dairy Disposals Board.  I think Senator Baxter said that from 1927 to 1932, 46 creameries had been handed over, whereas, since 1932 only 19 had been handed over.  Again, in that connection, the Minister has pointed out that there was a levy of £3 per cow in those districts, and I think we ought to realise that that was a serious barrier to production in many districts and that it imposed a great hardship on farmers in such districts. I wonder whether it is the lack of the co-operative spirit on the part of our farmers that is the cause of the delay in the handing over of these creameries. I do not think it is due to any lack of goodwill on the part of the Minister.  I am convinced, from what the Minister has said, and from his attitude generally, that he is a faithful disciple of the previous Minister for Agriculture, the late Mr. Hogan. Senator Sir John Keane said that the I.A.O.S. would be a more suitable body than the Dairy Disposals Board <Col N="1978" /> for dealing with this work, but I do not think that the late Mr. Hogan shared that view.  If so, I am sure he would have mentioned it.</P>

I have met people from County Clare, County Cork, County Kerry and other counties, and they all praise the work that was done.  It was never the intention that the Dairy Disposals Board would go on <i>ad infinitum,</i> but, when people are ready to take over these creameries, they should be given the opportunity of doing so, and I think that that is the spirit in which the board are acting.</P>
      <P>Senator Goulding referred, I think, to Mitchelstown, Dungarvan, and other districts, that have gone into co-operative farming.  I think that that is a very good suggestion, and that these farmers should be encouraged to carry on with that.  I think the Senator was referring to the question of pig-feeding, and so on.</P>

I should like, however, to refer to the matter of our dairy cows.  At the present time, the milk yield is less than 400 gallons.  In continental countries, the average is between 600 and 800 gallons.  I think that that is a matter to which the Minister and everybody else in this country should direct their attention. The cow-testing movement is aiming at a better type of cow and better winter feeding.  I am satisfied that the Dairy Disposals Company has been sympathetic and helpful to the cow-testing movement wherever it is operating in their areas.</P>

      <P>My reason for intervening in the debate is that I live in the centre of three groups of creameries. I may say, incidentally, that I fully approve of the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said by somebody. I exonerate the Senator.  We had some experience of both the I.A.O.S. and the Dairy Disposals Company in Clare.  The Kilrush creamery is under the control of the Dairy Disposals Company, and it is supposed to have the biggest output in Europe.  It has gone from strength to strength.  The North Clare creameries, with a manufacturing unit at Ennistymon, have also been wonderfully successful under the Dairy Disposals Company.  On the eastern side&mdash;in the Scariff area&mdash;there was a manufacturing unit and four or five auxiliaries run as a co-operative concern.  That was a pronounced failure.  It was run co-operatively under the I.A.O.S.  It was going down and down until they had, ultimately, to appeal to the Dairy Disposals Company to take it over, which they did.  They had to pay their debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised to hear it suggested that it would be a good idea to transfer these creameries from the Dairy Disposals Company to the I.A.O.S. Late in 1941, the Dairy Disposals Company conceived the idea that there was money in fowl and eggs.  About September, they commenced to organise that end of the business.  It was very successful up to the end of the year, but 1942 was the first complete year in which they dealt with those two minor industries.  They bought eggs and fowl through the auxiliaries and brought them into the creamery at Kilrush.  The eggs were tested and graded and expeditiously exported. The price was very remunerative for the farmers, with the result that, in addition to their butter export in the <Col N="1980" /> year 1942, the manager of that single unit at Kilrush paid out £37,000 to the farmers who were supplying his creameries with eggs and fowl.  I do not believe that any co-operative system we could have organised in Clare would have given that result.</P>

      <P>You have not given me any figures in connection with those creameries.  We had co-operative creameries established in Clare prior to the establishment of the Dairy Disposals Company and every one of them was a failure.  The people of Clare are as intelligent as those of any other county.  At any rate, they have that reputation.  If the farmers of Clare were asked to put up money in order to take these creameries from the control of the Dairy Disposals Company, I do not think that £200 would be invested, whereas £200,000 would be required.  I hope that, if the idea of Senator Baxter and Senator Sir John Keane is ever put into force, it will not be compulsory to have creameries transferred from the Dairy Disposals Company to the I.A.O.S. or any other co-operative concern.  I know for certain that the farmers of Clare would not take any part in such a move. They are thoroughly satisfied that the Dairy Disposals Company is disposing of their products at very good prices &mdash;much better prices than they could get themselves.  So long as they are not forced to change, I do not think that they will ever change from the administration of the Dairy Disposals Company.</P>

      <P>As a co-operator, I have been extremely interested in the debate on this Bill which has revealed certain aspects of thought, altogether apart from the Bill itself, that are very interesting.  The Minister has been severely indicated because of the tardiness shown by the Dairy Disposals Board, which took over these <Col N="1981" /> creameries, in returning them again to co-operative societies as was the original intention of the people who framed this scheme.  Having listened to the debate, it seems to me that there is probably some satisfactory reason, apart from those alleged by Senator Baxter and Senator Sir John Keane, why there has been some tardiness in dealing with this matter in the manner originally intended.  Sufficient information is certainly not at my disposal this evening to enable me to say whether the Minister has been unduly tardy or whether he has not been as efficient in carrying out this scheme as he should be but, I presume, by the time the debate is ended, those who have rather severely indicated him may be satisfied that the indictment was not well founded.  I think, however, that to meet the views expressed here we should have infinitely more information as to why there has not been this return to co-operatives of the creameries, as appears to be desirable. To my own personal knowledge, there is some public opinion on that matter and I think it well that that public opinion should be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter and Senator Sir John Keane seem to be of one mind in dealing with this question.  Senator Baxter stated that a holding by the State of 15 years was not the best method of carrying on this industry. Senator Sir John Keane, although he did rather apologise for the remark, alleged that perhaps civil servants who have been for some time accustomed to control this industry, were rather reluctant to yield up that control.  That, in my opinion, is a rather superficial view.  The question as to whether the State should hold on to these properties for some lengthy period, or perhaps for an indefinite period, is one that requires, in my opinion, some very serious examination.  The question whether the State or co-operatives should run this industry is one of supreme and paramount importance, not alone to those who are engaged in the industry, but perhaps to the country as a whole.  In this matter we are dealing with a vital food and its efficient production.  We are also dealing, perhaps, with a certain ideal in industry.  Senator Baxter and Senator <Col N="1982" /> Sir John Keane heartily approved of the method of control by co-operative societies.  I have some experience as chairman of a co-operative society for a number of years and although that was an urban society, nevertheless, through that society, I had rather close contact for many years with the I.A.O.S. in Thomas Street and attended many of the conferences of the movement throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I make plain in speaking here in relation to the principle of co-operation that I have had actual contacts and administrative association with the co-operative movement, and during the number of years in which I was associated with that movement, I naturally got some idea as to the desire, as well as the capacity, perhaps, of our people as a whole for the purpose and principle of co-operation. That experience leads me now to view this question, as to whether the State should be permitted to continue the control which it now exercises, or whether we should advise immediately, and without further ado, the return of these creameries to the co-operative societies, as one requiring close examination, and if they are to be returned, in my opinion the Minister would be well advised&mdash;and I am sure he is already well advised&mdash;to see whether or not there are that capacity and desire for the return of these organisations to be carried on co-operatively.</P>
    <P>In indicting the board, Senator Sir John Keane stated that one of the grave objections was the lack of information about its activities.  I am one of those who believe that the greatest possible information should be given on all matters where the State is dealing with the citizen, but I would remind Senator Sir John Keane that other organisations are rather reluctant to give information of the same character.  I could not help remembering that on one occasion when the late Sir Walter Leaf told Mr. Montague Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, that there was only one item on the balance sheet of the bank which he understood and that was the monetary value of the bullion, Mr. Norman said he was not quite sure that he himself understood <Col N="1983" /> even that item.  You see that people in great positions like that of the Governor of the Bank of England can be equally reluctant to give information of a very necessary and vital character.  Senator O'Callaghan, who has intimate associations with the agricultural community, also gave us the impression that he was not quite satisfied as to whether the farmers in these areas desired the return of these organisations in the industry to their control, and one has to be impressed by that view.</P>
    <P>A co-operative society can, unquestionably, be of the greatest value and importance to the rural community. In fact, things are developing to-day in such a manner as to cause them to think co-operatively, and as to whether co-operative societies may not be the agent for integrating the rural community and perhaps keeping it from falling asunder.  Objections have been urged by Senator Goulding to-day and on previous occasions, as to the extended activities of the co-operative societies.  Naturally, they are affecting, and must affect to some extent, private enterprise and private control, but only to the extent that private enterprise and control fails to satisfy necessary social needs can the co-operative society advance and perform its necessary functions.  The State, then, versus the co-operative society in this industry, seems to me to be the outstanding idea which developed in this debate.  Naturally, we hear many objections to the State performing industrial functions, but we see that, in time of war in all countries where the State is menaced by an external enemy, it has to step in very largely and to take control of nearly all vital industries.  Without extending that precedent too far in peace time, it still seems that when the State or the country is menaced by economic insecurity or external enemies, the State is the only authority which is capable of coming forward and meeting the adverse circumstances or the external enemy.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the objections urged against State intervention are that the State should not enter into competition with <Col N="1984" /> its citizens; that those who perform those services for the State are civil servants and that they have not the training in commerce necessary to carry out their functions satisfactorily; that there is a tendency&mdash;we had that thought expressed here this evening&mdash;on the part of such persons to become bureaucratic.  The last objection is that the whole thing becomes inefficient.  We have had State organisations&mdash;the Army, the Navy, the police, the sheriffs and so on&mdash;for a long time, and we have the State setting up organisations such as the Electricity Supply Board and even semi-State organisations like the Sugar Board.  It is inevitable in such circumstances that the State is compelled to intervene.  Such large-scale industries, when they receive this support, only do so because it has become necessary, and perhaps in the case of the Dairy Disposals Board&mdash;where the board has not performed what probably is its original and paramount function&mdash;there is a good and substantial reason as to why it has not performed that function.  I cannot say whether it has been unduly tardy in this; whether it has failed to do it; whether it is bureaucratic or whether it is not.  But I certainly think there must be some sound and substantial reason why it has continued in that position for 15 years.  The Minister has told us, in reply to a question, that there is a Bill forthcoming to deal with this whole matter.  It may be that, on the information at the disposal of the Minister, he is satisfied that there is not a sufficient demand for those societies to be run co-operatively.  If that were so, and if it could be proved that there are not that necessary demand and desire in the rural community for the taking over and running of what is a commercially difficult and sufficiently onerous proposition, then it seems to me that <i>festina lente</i> is the motto which we should adopt in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>If I were asked to decide in a moment as to whether the State should continue to carry on this industry in the manner in which it has carried it on up to the present, or whether it should hand it over to the farming <Col N="1985" /> community, I would say that I should have to be very much further informed on the whole issue.  My view is that, if there is not that desire in the rural communities to take and hold this industry, I think it were better that the Dairy Disposals Board should continue to act in the nature of a mandatory authority towards the industry, at all times watching and waiting to see how it may fulfil the original purpose, but at the same time not fulfilling that purpose before there is complete evidence that the purpose should be fulfilled.  If the local organisations were compelled to take over and run the industries before they were capable and competent to do so, then perhaps our last state might be worse than our first.  It may be undesirable that things should continue as they are, but at the same time perhaps it were better to bear the ills we have than fly to those we know not of.</P>
    <P>Another point, apart from the general purposes of this Bill, to which I desire to refer is the question of compensation for employees disturbed by any transfer.  I see that this matter has been debated in the other House, and I think the Minister has continued the assurance given by his predecessor in office that compensation to the extent of one month's salary multiplied by the years of service will be given to any employee of a proprietary creamery taken over, but in my opinion that amount of money, especially in the case of an employee of long years' service, is entirely inadequate. At the end of 20 or 25 or 30 years' service, a person is not in a position to enter into the service of any other employer, and that amount of compensation would not in my opinion be sufficiently large, say, to buy an annuity, so that he might continue in some degree of security for the rest of his life.</P>
    <P>I rather favour dealing with such an employee on a pension basis.  I think that in such cases, where there are redundant employees, a gratuity is not adequate to the circumstances, nor is it equitable having regard to the period of service which the worker has given to the industry, and to the likelihood that he will not be absorbed <Col N="1986" /> into any other employment.  Consequently such a person would probably be destitute when the amount of compensation is exhausted.  In those circumstances I think that the provision of a pension is the only adequate and proper means of dealing with such an employee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielCorkery" hpid="Mr. Corkery Mr. Corkery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corkery</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object of this Bill is to take over the remaining creameries that are in the hands of proprietors.  A good deal has been said about co-operation, and the good work it has done.  It undoubtedly has done a lot of good work in some parts of the country, but it is also true that a lot of the co-operative societies have failed and have had to be taken over by the Dairy Disposals Board.  That failure, in my opinion, was due to the fact that they paid little attention to the dairy industry which they were primarily supposed to guard, and devoted most of their attention to looking after other business.  Senator Sir John Keane said that the work of development should have been done by the I.A.O.S.  Well, the work was not done by anybody in South Kerry, in West Kerry or in West Cork until the Dairy Disposals Board came along.  There is a big undeveloped area in West Cork where those proprietary creameries are about to be taken over.  There is a very strong co-operative society in that area.  That society has made no effort whatever to develop the district, except the richer portions of it.  They go into the good districts and start an auxiliary creamery, but the poor areas are left undeveloped.  The farmers in the poor districts can do whatever they like with their milk, and in most cases they are in a fairly bad way.  I am sure that the Dairy Disposals Board, when they do take over those creameries, will develop the whole district, the poor areas as well as the rich ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will find a market for the poor farmers as well as for the man who is able to look after himself.  In this way I do not think that there will be so many workers out of employment. There is room for development in the area, and redundant workers can be absorbed.  I am glad to know that the Minister is introducing a Co-operative <Col N="1987" /> Bill.  I hope that Bill will make clear what co-operation really is.  Co-operation is not understood in some places. In some places when a group gets together that is called co-operation, when it is no such thing.  If we are to have co-operation it should mean co-operation in such a way that everybody will be helped and nobody will suffer. At present some co-operative societies are out to make their own societies stronger, no matter who may suffer, and I hope the Minister will bring in a Bill to make clear what we really are aiming at.  The Dairy Disposals Board are doing excellent work and will continue to do so until the country and the dairy industry are properly organised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my support of this Bill.  With regard to the point made by Senator Lynch in regard to the existing co-operatives, I think the case made for this Bill came, in the first instance, from concerns affected by the continued existence of proprietary creameries.  For a number of years there was a sort of cut-throat competition in these areas in regard to prices.  That competition was not for the good of the dairying industry. This Bill will eliminate that.  It is our duty to do what we can to help the Minister to put the dairy industry on a more prosperous basis.  This year dairy farmers are going to be in a very difficult position, as the problem of finding labour is increasing.  There is great reluctance on the part of paid hands to milk cows.  I heard recently where a dairy farmer hired a boy who said he would do no Sunday work. When the farmer asked: &ldquo;Do you feed on milk and butter on Sundays?&rdquo; the boy said: &ldquo;I suppose I do.&rdquo;  The farmer then remarked: &ldquo;You might as well refuse to do so to spite the poor old cow.&rdquo;  That is the position dairy farmers are confronted with now. The same thing happened during the last war.  There was difficulty in finding hands to milk cows.  At that time a great many milking plants were available.  I installed a milking plant in my home in 1918, because of the impossibility of finding hands.  I suppose in war time people get high notions that they do not have in normal <Col N="1988" /> times.  For that reason I feel that we should give the Minister the assistance he requires in making it easier for farmers to carry on their business.  In regard to the big question of a Co-operative Bill there are many things that require attention.  Creamery managers have no security at present. They should be placed on the same footing as people in equally important positions in other walks of life. Creamery managers should be entitled to pensions.  That is one of the things that will, I am sure, be dealt with in the wider Bill that is to be introduced. I would like the Dairy Disposals Board to continue for the purpose of developing areas that are more or less not looked after by existing co-operative concerns.  I wish to express my support of this Bill and I hope the House will give it a speedy passage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed that the Bill was ignored in the debate. I think that the only person who referred to the Bill was Senator Colbert. There are provisions in this Bill that I thought might have been discussed, the taking over of the proprietary concerns and the terms and so on, but evidently there is no Senator interested in that.  We had a very interesting discussion, however, of a wider nature, a sort of economic philosophy, principally around the benefits or merits of the co-operative system.  On that matter Senator Lynch took at least a more practical view than Senator Baxter or Senator Sir John Keane, both of whom are keen co-operators.  I am afraid that if they were to get their way they would ruin the co-operative movement in this country.  Do they expect me to go down to Clare and Kerry and force co-operation on people who do not want it, or to force a creamery on people who do not want it?  I think that would do more harm to co-operation than anything else.  In the case of Clare, as Senator Honan pointed out, co-operation was there.  Co-operation was, as a matter of fact, in Kilrush before we came there.  In Scariff there was co-operation before the Dairy Disposals Board came.  Co-operation failed in County Clare, and if we were to attempt to organise a co-operative <Col N="1989" /> society, and if that co-operative society failed it would take centuries before the movement could succeed. That is what Senator Baxter wants. He says we should go and organise it and make them take over the place. If we really are in favour of co-operation I think we should not push it in that way.</P>
      <P>A question arose about the Newmarket group of creameries, for instance, as a test, and it was suggested that neither I nor the Dairy Disposals Board was inclined to give co-operation a chance.  It was suggested that a co-operative society had been formed there, that they were anxious to take the creamery over, but that we would not give it to them.  Well, the Dairy Disposals Board thought that the creamery concerned was worth a certain price, which the other people would not pay.  The Dairy Disposals Board came down a little in their price, but still the others would not give it.  Now, I think it is a great thing to see the farmers in a district prepared to carry on their own business, and able to compete against the proprietary interests or anybody else, and if they are prepared to stand on their own feet, why not let them do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if the Dairy Disposals Board thinks that a creamery is worth a certain amount, I think they should be entitled to hold out for that price. You can calculate the price on various bases or according to various circumstances. For instance, you can take the capital value of the creamery as it stands on the books, allowing for depreciation, additions, and so on, or one might take, as a basis of valuing a creamery, the milk supply during a period of years&mdash;since, let us say, 1937.  Thirdly, you might try to estimate the value as an ordinary businessman would, and say: &ldquo;Here is a business that is making a certain profit, and I must decide what I should pay for the taking over of that business.&rdquo;  I think that if you take the prices offered by the Dairy Disposals Board on any of these three bases, you will find that the price offered is a reasonable one, and if the co-operative society concerned thinks <Col N="1990" /> that it can run the business as well as the Dairy Disposals Board, and that they can make the same profit as the Dairy Disposals Board were making, then the price asked is not too much, and they should be prepared to pay it.</P>
    <P>I have also been asked when will these creameries be given over.  I think that a person like Senator Lynch should see the difficulty there. If I were to reply to that question, I would have to reply in the same terms as Senator Lynch suggested, because in some places there are no co-operative societies, whereas in other areas the co-operative societies that existed have failed, but they will have to remain until a new group comes along and forms a co-operative society.  In some of these new areas a co-operative society will not be formed until the people see whether it can be run on a paying basis.  If you take certain areas, such as Castletownbere, Cahirciveen, and similar districts, if the people do not want a co-operative society, no body of men with any idea of business will come along and buy up that business if it has paid only for the last two or three years.  They would want to see it paying for a little longer.  Accordingly, there are various reasons why some of these creameries should be held over for a certain period.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long that period will be, but I am sure that Senators will take the view expressed by Senator Lynch as to the desirability of State ownership.  I do not know why Senator Sir John Keane says that State trading is not a desirable principle. I do not know what he has in mind, but I expect that we will hear more about that when the Bill in connection with the Dairy Disposals Board comes on for discussion.  It is not true to say, as Senator Sir John Keane said, that I am insisting on a plebiscite, but when I am convinced that a small group, and I do not mean the Newmarket group, were trying to exploit the situation, not in the interests of co-operation, but in their own interests, and when it was fairly evident that they had not 5 per cent. of the milk suppliers with them, <Col N="1991" /> surely, then, it was only a matter of ordinary common sense for the proprietors to ask whether there was a majority of the producers behind the society in taking over the creamery.  I do not think we could possibly have a plebiscite in a case like that, but I think we should have some assurance from the majority of the suppliers that they want to take over the creamery as a co-operative society.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Sir John Keane that the co-operative movement has conferred a great boon on the community generally, and that it has given great advantages to the country in many areas where co-operative societies were properly organised and well run.  Where such societies have been properly organised and well run they have put the farmers in a much better and stronger position than that in which they were formerly.  It is a peculiar thing, however, that co-operative societies succeed more in some parts of the country than in others.  In fact, it is quite noticeable. There are some counties in Ireland where such societies will succeed, whereas in other areas co-operative societies will always fail.  Perhaps it is something in the character of the people that accounts for that.  I do not know how you will explain it, but it is a fact nevertheless.  However, as far as we are concerned in this Bill with that aspect of the case, I would like to tell Senators that we propose taking over, under this Bill, if it becomes an Act, certain proprietary concerns.  I do not think Senator Baxter quite understood my point, but I estimate that the remaining proprietors are doing only about 4 per cent. of the business, and that is not very much.  Most of those will go over to the co-operatives, and in most cases they will give over any milk supplies that they have.</P>
    <P>There is one district, Skibbereen, where they may have to be held over because a reorganisation is necessary, but as soon as that reorganisation is completed it will be open to a local co-operative society to take over the group as organised.  Co-operative societies in that district seem to do <Col N="1992" /> very well, and I think that in a short time&mdash;whether it be six months or a year and a half, I cannot say&mdash;these properties will go over to the co-operatives and not be held by the Dairy Disposals Board.  In any event, the greater part of the properties we are dealing with in this Bill will go over to co-operatives immediately and will not be held by the Dairy Disposal Company at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch referred to redundant employees.  I did mention in the Dáil that there is nothing in this Bill dealing with redundant employees. Neither was there anything in previous legislation dealing with this point.  But I did say that we were going to be more generous this time than was the case in the past so far as redundant employees were concerned.  In 1927, the scale of compensation was from 13 to 26 weeks' pay.  A person could not get more than six months of his retiring salary, or wages, as the case might be.  In 1934 there were about 13 or 14 men, left after the 1927 reorganisation, who had failed to get new posts.  I succeeded at that time in getting the Minister for Finance to revise the compensation offered in 1927, bringing it up to a year's salary for those under 50, one and a half year's salary for those between 50 and 60, and two years' salary for those of 60 and over.  On this occasion, we are doing better still. It is proposed to give one-twelfth of the retiring yearly salary or wages for every year's service.  That, in the case of men with long service, will amount to three or four years' salary or wages, as the case may be.  I admit that nothing in the way of compensation makes up for the loss of employment, but I am fairly confident that very few men will be redundant.  Most of them will get employment under the reorganisation that will take place.  The number that will prove redundant will, in my opinion, be very small.  The Creamery Managers' Association, which is the association dealing with men who will more likely prove redundant than the lower-paid men, are, I think, satisfied with that scale. What they asked for was one- of the yearly salary for every year of service, but they were satisfied to have <Col N="1993" /> a three-year limit.  I propose to give one-twelfth, with no limit, so that any man with more than 36 years service will do better under what I propose than he would under the scheme which the Creamery Managers' Association suggested.</P>
    <P>I have heard only of three cases of probable redundancy and in these, three cases the men, who have long service, will do better under the scale proposed than they would under the scheme put forward by their own association.  The scale of compensation is as good as has been given in similar circumstances.  As Senators know, there have been many cases in which the Government, by legislation, caused redundancy.  For instance, the Railway Acts, the National Health Insurance Act and, I think, the Electricity Supply Act, involved redundancy.  Various scales of compensation were laid down in all these Acts.  What I propose to do in this case is as good as the scale laid down in any of these Acts.  On the whole, it should prove satisfactory.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators spoke about the Co-operative Bill which is to come along.  That Bill has been many years in preparation but it is not right to say, as Senator Baxter did, that we are as far away from it now as we were in 1932.  The difference between Senator Baxter and myself is that I think it will come and he does not.  If I am right, we must be nearer to it.  It should be introduced in the course of the coming year.  It has reached a stage now which it had not reached in 1932; it is with the draftsmen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in the opinion of Seanad Eireann, the Government should keep in close touch with Governments and organisations abroad engaged on schemes of post-war economic recovery to ensure that plans may be made for such an increase in our agricultural production <Col N="1994" /> as will enable Eire to make the largest possible contribution to the re-establishment of normal conditions in Europe after the war.</P>
    <P>I do not know what may be in the minds of Senators as to what my purpose is in moving this motion.  I believe that our material interests in this regard will coincide with what we would regard as being in the best interests of humanity in Europe, that is, from the point of view of the necessity, after the war, of making our contribution so as to bring about stability and order in the social life of the Europe of the future.  I am not approaching this question from the angle that some people might imagine &mdash;that I had something very derogatory to say of the Taoiseach or his Department or of our own attitude in regard to our external policy at the moment.</P>
    <P>Looking at the future of agriculture in the world as I see it now, I am convinced that as we go on, week after week, month after month and year after year, the problem of the world's food supply will become more alarming. We have such evidence in our own country, where we all believed that no man or woman could go short of essential foods; we have the experience of these days and we can learn from it.  We can judge what conditions are going to be like outside if the Taoiseach's prophecy about the duration of the war is justified.</P>
    <P>The situation in Europe pre-war from the point of view of the food supply was very interesting, and it is frequently misunderstood.  Far from importing very considerable quantities of grain for human consumption, the situation actually was, with regard to wheat, that Europe was really importing something like 8 per cent. of its total consumption.  Rye imports also were small, although the consumption of rye was about half that of other carbohydrates, such as wheat.  We had the position in Europe frequently that they did not find it essential to import wheat to any extent from abroad.  Presumably the situation has not worsened considerably in that respect, from the point of view of the production of cereals, anyhow.  It may very <Col N="1995" /> well be that, under the stress of war, the productive effort in the matter of wheat or rye is little less than it was in pre-war days.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to study exactly the situation as one sees it with regard to food production in the world outside Europe.  You have on the Continent of America, and indeed in Australia as well, huge quantities of grain being built up, tremendous colossal quantities, probably a greater storage than anything the world has previously seen.  Side by side with that you have in all countries everywhere evidence of a very considerable decline in the production of live stock and live-stock products, and when I ask this House to say that the Government should keep in close touch with Governments and organisations abroad engaged on the problem of post-war economic recovery, so that we should make a major contribution to the re-establishment of normal conditions of life through our own agricultural productive effort, I am asking the House to say that, from the figures available to us to-day, normal conditions in European agriculture and in the social life of Europe can only be brought about by this little island making its contribution to that desirable result.</P>
    <P>It does not matter who wins the war; hunger and starvation are going to be the lot of millions of people on the Continent of Europe, not only at the end of the war but for a number of years afterwards. For us here, such a situation can only be one that we must not alone deplore but make the greatest possible effort to alter and to end. Outside this island to-day the thoughts of men are being concentrated on this problem of agriculture in the future. It is interesting to look at the sort of situation with which those people are confronted, and to examine that situation and its bearings on our own possibilities of production and to examine, from our point of view as well as from theirs, what contribution we can make towards making things better.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to all judging from the figures available to us as to the conditions <Col N="1996" /> at the end of the last war that the situation in Europe with regard to the live-stock population must be very unsatisfactory indeed.  In the four years from 1914 to 1918 neither Holland nor Denmark was suffering from a blockade, yet the pig population fell in Denmark from 2,406,706 down to 620,888 and in Holland from 1,350,106 down to something round 600,000.  In Germany itself, the cattle population fell from 21,800,000 down to 18,000,000, and the pig population in the same period, 1914 to 1918, fell from 25,000,000 down to 10,000,000. That is, there was the equivalent of a 60 per cent. reduction in pigs and a 15 per cent. reduction in the cattle population in Germany.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to cattle was graver than these figures revealed for although these cattle lived, they just barely lived.  They were all skin and bone.  They could provide the people with neither meat nor milk&mdash; not for years afterwards.  We all know from people who went there what the situation with regard to facts in Germany was for many years after the war.  That was the situation resulting from the last war.  I do not think anybody will pretend that the situation can be any better to-day.  Not alone is this decline in the live-stock population a normal consequence of war on the Continent but on the American Continent the situation is something like this at present.  The Canadian Acting Food Administrator, Mr. F.S. Grisdale, addressing the Canadian Federation of Agriculture at the end of last January declared that serious and growing shortages of primary foods confronted Canadians.  They were entering, he said, the fourth year of the war with cattle, sheep and hog shortages much more serious than in the fourth year of the last war.  There had been a decrease of 10 per cent. in the cattle population between 1914 and 1943, while the human population had grown from 8,200,000 to 11,500,000. That is what is happening in Canada to-day.  Go to the United States itself. Mr. Hoover, the former President, addressing a meeting of the national conference of industrial boards at New York at the end of January said <Col N="1997" /> that there was a limit to the food resources of the United States, and pointing to the increased slaughterings of cattle during recent months, he said that cattle coming to slaughter were from 30 to 40 lbs. lighter than a year ago.  Dairy cows were being slaughtered at an alarming rate, sheep slaughterings were 200 per cent. up on last year, and sows were being killed off.  The slaughtering of female stock would allow a temporary increase in meat supplies but, in the long run, would be disastrous.  Although the United States was shipping less than one-half the food shipped during the first great war, the nation's live-stock output had decreased in proportion to the population.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the House what the situation on the Continent was in regard to the live-stock population there as a result of the four years of the last great war.  It takes no great flight of the imagination to picture what it must be like to-day, because the truth is that while the Continent might have been able to supply itself or its human population with the requisite amount of cereals, it was actually importing something like 90 per cent. of the animal concentrates necessary in Denmark, Holland and Belgium.  None of these is available to European agriculture from the point of view of assisting to maintain their live-stock population to-day.</P>
    <P>You see what is happening in Canada and the United States.  At the same time, Canada, the United States and Australia, as I have pointed out, have built up great reserves of wheat.  Just how far these are going to meet the needs of suffering humanity at the end of the war is something on which I am unable to pass judgement.  I think there is, perhaps, a considerable amount of exaggeration in the minds of people even in the United States, as to what they are going to be able to do to alleviate distress with the supplies at hand and especially when you remember that it was stated at an International Labour Conference in the United States some time ago that practically 50 per cent. of the population of America were not being fed on a dietary standard up to the nutritional <Col N="1998" /> scale necessary for good health.  But, be that as it may with regard to the cereal position in the world, there is no doubt whatever about the trend in regard to live-stock production throughout the whole world.  There is no doubt whatever about the situation that will confront us in the future and our duty in this matter ought to be clear.</P>
    <P>Recently I came across a small book entitled <i>War and British Agriculture,</i> by Dr. Harkness, in which he sums up the situation rather well.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It must be concluded, therefore, that after making every allowance for the difficulty of forecasting the position that will exist when hostilities cease, there is no present reason for planning for post-war agricultural reconstruction otherwise than on the basis of following the assumptions:</P>
    <P>1.  There will be a surplus of bread grain crops available throughout the world due (a) to the extension of wheat and rye production in Europe under the stimulus of war conditions, and (b) to the supplies from the great corn-producing countries overseas becoming once more freely available.</P>
    <P>2.  The supply of live stock and live-stock products will be drastically reduced and will not be readily capable of expansion from either European or overseas resources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the situation, I think, which will confront the world.  I do not know how far the planners are conscious of this fact, or what their plans are to restore normal conditions in the shortest possible space of time, but I have put down this motion mainly for the purpose of getting some indication from the Taoiseach as to his attitude, and the attitude of the Government, towards a problem which for us is not only internal but international.  I have tabled the motion in the hope of getting from him an expression of opinion as to what he, as the Head of the Government, would plan to do, in the hope of hearing from him exactly what contacts he has made with outside nations with whom we are on friendly terms and about whose minds, <Col N="1999" /> to a degree at least, one would expect the Taoiseach would have some evidence in a matter like this and an idea of what might be expected from us or what it would be possible for us to do.  I know that the Taoiseach and his Government may find themselves in a rather difficult and invidious position, but whatever their relationships with outside peoples may be, whether they be neutral or belligerent, I think we here ought to take stock of the world's position as it is.  We ought to look to the future, not with the attitude of men who are fearful of it, or so fearful of it that we feel ourselves incapable of making any contribution towards making the future better and brighter than it appears likely to be, but rather with the attitude of people who felt we could make a contribution and who would declare we knew we could make it and would plan our own lives and our own way of life so that we could do it.</P>
    <P>There has been called together in the United States these days what is termed the United Nations Food Conference. The agenda for that conference has been issued.  It is very long and very interesting, and it is not without interest to us&mdash;very considerable interest indeed.  The agenda is under many heads.  A number of these deal with the question of food under the heading of &ldquo;Consumption Levels and Requirements.&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  Character and extent of consumption deficiencies in each country.</P>
    <P>2.  Causes and consequences of malnutrition.</P>
    <P>3.  Measures for improving standards of consumption (education, etc.).</P>
    <P>4.  Reasonable national and international goals for improved food consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The agenda continues under the heading of &ldquo;Other Essential Agricultural Products&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  Pre-war consumption levels in various countries as influenced by prosperity or depression and by buying power of the population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2000" /> 2.  Reasonable national and international goals for improved consumption with sustained employment and expanded industrial activity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, there are measures for the direction of production towards commodities the supply of which should be increased.  That is really fundamental. I think we could not but be interested in that.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Measures for shifting production out of commodities in chronic surplus.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be very interesting to see what products are in chronic surplus.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Measures for improving agricultural productivity and efficiency; measures for development and conservation of agricultural population; facilitation and improvement of distribution; the relation of national and international economic policies to agricultural problems, with special reference to the facilitation of the movement of agricultural products in commerce; the expansion of international trade; broad policies for ensuring increased production and consumption in general; the improvement of agricultural marketing, processing and distribution; special measures for wider food distribution; improvements of consumption of low income groups; international disposition of commodies in over supply; buffer stocks and commodity arrangements to assure equitable price and adequate supplies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Taoiseach whether we are examining our situation here under the various headings in that agenda.  I do not think there is any country in the world, relative to its size, which can make the same contribution as this island of ours towards restoring to normal the world's food supplies.  If we are ignored in this matter, I say that the peoples collected there are not doing their job to the full, and are not making the right approach towards a solution of the world's most difficult post-war problem.  Here in this country, relative to its size, we have the finest and purest live stock in the <Col N="2001" /> world, full of health and vigour.  I am convinced that normal agricultural conditions cannot be restored on the Continent of Europe without the aid of live stock from Ireland.  We ought to plan our internal affairs in such a way that, when the time comes, we will be able to make a major contribution towards the restoration of normality there.  I should like to feel that we are internationally recognised as being capable of making such a contribution, and that we ought to declare publicly to all the peoples concerned that we are prepared to make such a contribution.  I feel that there are all sorts of things which we need to do with our live stock here.  We may have to regulate its production, its slaughter or its retention from slaughter in a way which, at the moment, may not appeal to quite a number of our citizens.</P>
    <P>I put down this motion because I feel that, in the situation which exists in the world to-day, we are fortunate not to be engaged in arms, but we ought to be planning to meet the post-war conditions.  I hope the Taoiseach will be able to tell us whether or not he has contacts with people abroad with a view to ensuring that we will be aided and advised as to how we can make a major contribution to European agricultural recovery and the establishment of conditions of social order which can only be brought about when men and women have enough to eat.  The motion asks that the Government should keep in close touch with Governments abroad.  That is the kernel of the question.  I think we can do something in a positive way, and I think we should be at pains not only to make that known but to proceed to carry out our work.  There are aspects of this matter from the agricultural and technical point of view into which it is perhaps undesirable that I should enter.  I think I have said sufficient to put before the House my general approach to the question.  I hope the House will agree that the motion is worthy of support, and that we will have from the Taoiseach such an indication of policy as will satisfy us all that the considerable reserves of this country will be utilised <Col N="2002" /> to the full for the betterment of suffering humanity.</P>

      <P>I second this motion.  I raised this matter on the Central Fund Bill before now in the presence of the Minister for Finance, but he was unfortunately unable to give anything in the nature of an answer to me, or to Senator Foran on the question of labour, as to what was going to be done in regard to post-war planning for this country. To-night we have the honour of the Taoiseach's presence, which makes one realise that the question is assuming greater importance.  We have seen reports in the Press of statements by the new Prime Minister of Northern Ireland to the effect they have already been taking steps for post-war planning, and intend to accentuate those steps in the near future.  Therefore, we must not be behindhand in helping our own agricultural organisation, on which everything else depends.</P>

      <P>I now move the adjournment of the House until 3 p.m. to-morrow.  The matter of which I have given notice may seem a small one, but I regard it as a serious one. <Col N="2003" /> The Minister, I suppose, is conscious that there is, to put it mildly, a considerable amount of confusion with regard to the purchase and sale of potatoes.  I am not going to discuss it in its wider implications but I am going to raise a point because I feel that it is of considerable importance. I will just tell the Minister what is taking place and what I saw happening in the market-place of Cavan. Something ought to be done to rectify the situation.  The Potato Order obliges a farmer who brings potatoes to market for sale, if he is selling as a retailer, not to charge more than ? per stone.  I suppose conditions differ in different counties and even in different towns in the same county, but few of the farmers who take the potatoes into the town of Cavan take the equivalent of a ton.  Some of them may take half a ton, some seven or eight cwts., and some take a few sacks.  The Gárdaí intervened in every case yesterday where potatoes were being sold higher than the price fixed. There was considerable annoyance and disappointment.  I went up to people who had sold and to others who had bought.  I think some three sacks had been sold at 1/9 per stone and they were taken away and paid for.  The man was buying seed potatoes at 1/9 to take home to his field to set.  I feel that what is going to result from this is that in considerable areas where the potato crop is not fully in the ground, the restrictions that the Minister has imposed will have the result that on the next market day there will not be a stone of potatoes for sale in the town.  A number of poor people, labouring men and farmers, are purchasing seed potatoes now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the farmers are confronted with that situation I think it may be in a limited way disastrous.  Quite a number of people who have the soil ready for seed may not be able to get it.  I felt that this was a matter of such urgency that I had to draw the Minister's attention to it.  In this city people could not get potatoes for 2/- and 2/6 a stone for seed.  There is no provision in the Order for regulating <Col N="2004" /> the price of seed potatoes or for allowing seed potatoes to be sold by one farmer to another for seed purposes. The situation is such that there ought to be some change or relaxation of the Order.  The farmers who go into town to buy potatoes for seed will find that they will not be there.  The net result will be that many a cottier who ought to have potatoes set will not be able to have them.  That is the problem.  I do not want to exaggerate it unduly, but it is of such an acute nature that the Minister had better look into it. It seems to me the Minister ought to have made provision which would have enabled a man who is selling for seed purposes to be able to get a higher price.  I am suggesting that without thinking of all the implications of it. Be that as it may, people who are purchasing potatoes for table purposes need not be hungry for a week or so. There are ample supplies of bread, and with potatoes at ? a stone I do not know that any advantage is secured. I feel that if we had not had these Orders and if the price had gone up the supplies we have would have made the price go down.  The situation as it seems to me is such that many a man will not be able to get potatoes for seed purposes, and whatever the Minister is able to do to rectify that it requires to be done now, as it is really an urgent matter.</P>

      <P>In order to deal with this matter in the most intelligent way I am afraid that I will have to go into the whole question as briefly as possible. We were getting reports from time to time from our inspectors throughout the country and reports from representative farmers and so on, and it did look, I must say, from January to March and April, that we might just have enough potatoes, but they began to disappear a little more rapidly than was anticipated about the month of March.  We saw there was going to be a shortage, but it may be regarded as inexplicable, and many explanations have been attempted.  One explanation was that in some cases more potatoes have gone bad in the pits this year than usual, and another was that more potatoes were fed to animals, because they were not able to get other food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> Various other reasons might be given.  I would like to mention also that they had the same experience in the North of Ireland and in Great Britain that potatoes disappeared rather unexpectedly about that time. They are facing not as an acute shortage as we are, but they are facing a shortage.  We saw that we had to face the shortage somehow or other, but I would like to explain to Senator Baxter and other Senators that it is not true that very little consideration was given to the matter.  A great deal of consideration was given to it for a long time.  The reason the Order was delayed is because we were certain that if once we started making the Order the price would go up.  We have experience that if you fix a price of a thing people who have that thing think it is of more value and that they ought to get more than the fixed price.  That is exactly what happened.  People who had potatoes thought that they should get more than the fixed price, and those who wanted to buy potatoes were prepared to pay more.  The wholesalers could not do it, but institutions and certain retailers could.  After a few days it was apparent that any potatoes that were coming to Dublin would not go through the wholesalers but through other sources of supply, and the only thing to be done was to make the whole thing a matter of fixed distribution.  That is the background of the Orders that have been made.</P>
    <P>The question of seed potatoes arose, and whether, as Senator Baxter has suggested, we should leave seed potatoes out or not.  It is very hard, however, to fix a price for seed potatoes.  For instance, there are certain rare varieties of certified seed potatoes, which would fetch a high price, and it might not be advisable to fix a price for seed potatoes generally.  On the whole, we thought it better to leave seed potatoes out.  If, for instance, people want to buy certain rare varieties of seed potatoes, such as Golden Wonders, and if they are prepared to pay a high price for those seeds, well, then, let them pay that price, whereas, if they want to buy some of the more common varieties, such as Kerr's Pinks and so <Col N="2006" /> on, which they can get at a lower price, then let them do so.  I do not know what Senator Baxter had in mind when he spoke of a farmer bringing in seed potatoes to Cavan market and being held up by the Guards for selling potatoes at 1/9 or 2/- a stone.  After all, if the potatoes are available at all, they can be sold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the farmer does not know how he stands, and in the case I mentioned the Guards did not ask either the buyer or the seller about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is a very curious fact that the people in Dublin here knew about it, and they sold them in Marlborough Street and Moore Street at so much a stone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have in mind is that in my part of the country there was this particular case of one man who lived about ten miles on one side of Cavan town, and the other man about five or six miles on the other side of the town&mdash;a distance of about 15 miles apart&mdash;and when one man bought the seed potatoes at 1/9, the Guard came along and took the names of the buyer and the seller.  It seems to me that the situation should be clarified in that respect, because the result will be that potatoes which could be sold for seed will not be brought into the towns at all now.  I think that such people should be allowed to sell seed potatoes at a higher price than ? a stone.  In fact, I think that in a time like this, people should be allowed to pay even 2/6 a stone for seed potatoes, because the usual experience is that if there is a shortage in one year there will be a more serious shortage the next year. It must be remembered that in about three weeks from now it will be too late, and I think that anything a man could pay for seed potatoes now would not be too much, in view of the emergency. I think it should be made clear that farmers can get more than the fixed price for their seed potatoes, and I should like the Minister to clarify that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
