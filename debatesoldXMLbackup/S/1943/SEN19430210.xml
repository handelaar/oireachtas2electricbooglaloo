      <P>This matter seems to come properly under Section 5, as the section provides for the establishment and the constitution of the board, and gives the Minister very wide powers to alter the constitution of the board, as well as the appointment of all the members.  I take it that the board will have complete power over the staff of officers and servants mentioned in Section 12.  The Minister appoints the board and the board appoints the staff. Could the Minister say precisely what power this board, which Section 5 establishes, will have?  Will it have complete control of the medical staff, the appointment of visiting and house physicians, hall porters and nurses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The board will appoint all the officers, the medical staff, servants and employees, subject to the sanction of the Minister. As the Bill is drafted, all appointments are subject to Ministerial approval, but the Minister is given power to exclude (by Order) any appointments that he desires to exclude from the class that would require Ministerial sanction.  These exclusion Orders will come into operation, in consultation with the board, after the Bill becomes law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Minister gets complete control of <Col N="1256" /> the hospital, in so far as he appoints the board, and appointments made by the board may, in effect, be deemed to be appointments by the Minister.  The Minister has power to veto appointments by the board.  With regard to this hospital the Minister will have more power over it than he has over hospitals under local bodies, which are subject to a code, and have to submit appointments to be made by them to the Local Appointments Commissioners. The Minister will be given complete control of all appointments to this hospital, medical, surgical, nurses, clerks&mdash;if there are any clerks&mdash;radiographers, radiologists and hallporters, so that this scheme, which we are putting into operation by constituting this board gives the Minister for Local Government and Public Health control over the hospital.  In other words, it puts him back to the privileged position that the Local Officers and Employees Act, which constituted the Local Appointments Commission, was intended to abolish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>My mind is working very much on the same lines as that of Senator Hayes.  There has been some doubt&mdash;the Minister may say that there is no doubt&mdash;in the public mind as to the position of this group of hospitals.  In the past, I understand, the board was appointed by the Lord Lieutenant of the day, but the buildings were owned or controlled by the Board of Works, or whatever was the corresponding body.  In all essential matters, the board of governors had full power.  They had not that power over the buildings, because they were not their property, but there was power of management.  Subject to correction, the board was autonomous. This whole thing is being altered now and my contention is that we are practically setting up a State hospital. The board are entirely, the creatures or instruments of the Minister.  He appoints them and dismisses them and has to approve of all appointments. That is why, in its essence, we are now setting up&mdash;I think I am right in saying&mdash;the first State hospital in the country.  It is important to get this point quite clear in view of matters I <Col N="1257" /> have to bring up later in connection with this Bill and, generally, on my motion, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary should deal specifically with the point: is this, or is this not, in all essentials, a State hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to find that there is any confusion of mind as to the status of these hospitals either to-day or at any time previously. These hospitals are definitely State hospitals&mdash;always have been&mdash;and the Minister is not seeking any power in this Bill which he does not enjoy at the present time.  The board of governors has always been appointed by the Minister, and the Minister is seeking no more control over the board of governors&mdash;in fact, less&mdash;than he has under the existing law.  Before the setting up of this State powers which are now vested in the Minister for Local Government were enjoyed and exercised by the Lord Lieutenant.  He appointed the board of governors and, in fact, he was under no obligation to appoint a board of governors at all. He could govern the hospitals in any way he thought fit.  He could run the hospitals from his office in Dublin Castle.  He could appoint a person or he could appoint a board.</P>
      <P>The practice in the past has been to appoint a board of governors, and to delegate certain powers of management to them.  He could remove any member of the board at will; he could reconstitute the board at any time he thought well to do so.  I am surprised to find that Senators are not aware of that position&mdash;if, in fact, they are not aware of it.  But the Bill does not seek any power which the Minister does not enjoy at present.  So far as Ministerial control is concerned, so far as the status of this group of hospitals as State institutions is concerned, the position is absolutely unaltered.  If it were a matter of controlling the institutions by a Department of State, it was altogether unnecessary to have this Bill at all.</P>

      <P>There is a general scheme for appointments to the public service and for appointments to the local services.  Under this measure, which we are now reenacting&mdash;assuming it is law already &mdash;the Minister enjoys a power of patronage which he does not enjoy with regard to local bodies in the country and hospitals under their control.  I think that is an extremely bad scheme, particularly if the Parliamentary Secretary is going to exercise it, because he is a politician more than anybody who ever got into the office before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>The question Senator Sir John Keane asked is an explicit one: &ldquo;Is this a State hospital?&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary answered that by saying that it is a State hospital. He forgets that the claim of the present Minister to exercise any control is inherited from the Lord Lieutenant, and that the British Government repudiated in definite terms any claim to this hospital as a State hospital.  The British Government definitely denied that it was a State hospital, and refused to have any responsibility for the liabilities of the board of governors.  I am aware that the hospital did not accept the point of view as the Parliamentary Secretary stressed the other day.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister are not claiming their authority from the board of the hospital, but from the British Government and the Lord Lieutenant.  As the Parliamentary Secretary told us the other day, the Minister is exercising the powers of the Lord Lieutenant, and is, therefore, claiming to exercise functions which the Lord Lieutenant and the British Government repudiated absolutely and determinedly. They stuck to their repudiation of the claim that it was a State hospital, in spite of the protest of the board that <Col N="1259" /> it was a State hospital and that the State had some responsibility for it. The Parliamentary Secretary should not overlook that fact when giving a categorical answer to the query Senator Sir John Keane put up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear on this.  I am not concerned much with the legal, or what I might call the constitutional, aspect of the past or future of the board.  I am concerned with the fact that I understand that in the past, whatever the indirect powers of the Lord Lieutenant might be to remove governors, in practice the Lord Lieutenant did not exercise a veto on the appointment of the medical staff, or the other staffs of the hospital. I understand now that the Minister intends to keep in his own hands the approval of all appointments.  There is a definite and distinct difference. Will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether or not I am correct in drawing a very clear distinction between the past and the contemplated future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane says the Lord Lieutenant did not exercise a veto.  I am not in a position to contradict him.  I am not aware whether he did or did not.  What I am well aware of is: that the Lord Lieutenant had the statutory right to exercise a veto.  During the past 20 years, since these institutions come under the control of the successors to the Lord Lieutenant in this State, a veto has not been exercised on the appointment of any member of the staff.  But the right to exercise that veto is there, and that right has been maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know under what enactment or section of any Act the Lord Lieutenant had a right to exercise a veto.  So far as I understand, the Minister's right was only indirect through the power to remove the governors.  If I am wrong, will the Minister enlighten me as to the section of any Act under which the Minister has the right to act as the Minister now proposes to act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better quote again&mdash;I quoted it already I think&mdash;the relevant section of an Act for the better Regulation of the House of Industry Hospitals and other Hospitals in Dublin supported wholly or in part by Parliamentary Grants&mdash;an Act of the 29th July, 1856.  Section 4 of that Act states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Lord Lieutenant shall, subject to the approval of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, and to the provisions hereinafter contained, regulate and determine the number and description of officers and servants to be kept for the said House of Industry Hospitals as he may think fit, and the salaries to be paid to them respectively, and the Lord Lieutenant may from time to time appoint or remove such officers and servants and upon every vacancy by death, removal, or otherwise, in any such office may appoint some other person to such office, and may fill up or not, as in his discretion he may think fit, vacancies among such officers and servants.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get this clear.  The Lord Lieutenant had power to appoint the board.  The board made other appointments.  The Lord Lieutenant may or may not have exercised a veto with regard to appointments that were made.  One would assume that the Lord Lieutenant did not, because the board was his creature.  He had the power to remove the board.  Therefore, he merely gave somebody power to act for him in making the appointments and it would be assumed that he would not contest the appointments because he had already selected the board.  If the board was appointing people that he did not care for, he could get rid of the board.  Reference is made there to the Act of 1856.  When this State came into existence, the Government on whom devolved power previously legally held by the Lord Lieutenant or by the Crown or by others, were heir at law to wide powers of patronage. At a later stage, the Government brought in legislation to implement a line of policy&mdash;the abolition of patronage to a very large extent.  There was <Col N="1261" /> patronage, I should say, in the giving of jobs in local government bodies and in the Government service itself.  You are going back and saying: &ldquo;Here is the position in 1856 and the Government is heir to that position.&rdquo;  The Government was heir to many other positions.  Since then, the Government has willingly denuded itself and has denuded local government bodies of this power of patronage.  There may be a number of exceptions to that but, as far as I have followed the debate on this Bill, there one glaring exception to it in the case of this particular hospital.</P>
      <P>I believe there are appointments to the board that can only be explained on the ground of mere Party affiliation. I am not sure of that, but I heard things that lead me to believe that.  The Government appoints its board&mdash;it is really only the creature of the Government, as far as I understand&mdash;and that board is to have power which the Government by a solemn act has taken away from itself and from local government bodies here, namely, the appointment of people in positions merely at its own will.  The Government, at expense to the taxpayers of this country, has set up appointments boards, and so on, in order to see that people will be selected for positions in relation to their peculiar qualifications for such positions, and not on the whim of somebody who is temporarily vested with power.  It seems to me, therefore, rather irrelevant, certainly to Senator Hayes' point, to go back to what was the position in 1856.  In 1856 there were enormous powers of patronage in this country, which were mitigated considerably before this State came into existence, and were, by special legislation, practically eliminated altogether by the Bill setting up local appointments boards and the Civil Service Commission.  Here, the Minister is very carefully keeping to himself this power of patronage in the appointment of the board, and, through the operation of the board, the power of patronage in regard to professional appointments in this hospital. If I am wrong, I should be happy to be corrected.</P>

Every single member of the old board who was in this country or who was alive was invited to become a member of the new board, and every member who was available for membership of the new board was appointed by the present Minister.  It was only the consequential vacancies, through death or otherwise, that were filled.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not dealt quite specifically with this question of the differentiation in the method of appointment. He said that because, in the past, the appointments to this hospital &mdash;which was in a rather hybrid condition&mdash;were not subject to the Local Appointments Commission, they need not be in the future.  Surely, it is quite within the competence of the Minister now to insert in this Bill a provision that all future appointments shall be made in the same way as, I think I may say, all other Civil Service appointments, or appointments of a similar character, are made.</P>

      <P>The Local Officers and Employees Act was passed in 1926, and the Parliamentary Secretary wonders why it did not include a specific reference to these particular hospitals.  I did not draft the Bill.  I had nothing whatever to do with it, and the Parliamentary Secretary, I take it, is well aware of that.  The Ceann Comhairle does not draft any Bills.  I take it the Parliamentary Secretary is well aware that the present Ceann Comhairle does not draft any Bills that the Government bring in.  I did not draft the Local Officers and Employees Bill.  I was not consulted about it, and did not know anything about it, but the reason why this hospital was not included, obviously, was that the Government did not regard it as a place in which State appointments were being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But here, in this particular section, whatever way the present board is constituted, there is complete power in <Col N="1265" /> a Minister&mdash;the Minister for the time being, whoever he may be&mdash;to appoint the board and to alter the constitution of the board under sub-section (4) &ldquo;at any time and in such manner as he thinks fit&rdquo;.  Thus the Minister gets under this section, copper-fastened, and with every loophole closed, whatever powers, and other powers, the Lord Lieutenant possessed in 1856.</P>

      <P>What I mean is, that if the present Parliamentary Secretary desires to make this board into something which will do his own will, he can do it.  I have no doubt whatever that if the Parliamentary Secretary sees any chance of giving a job to a supporter, he will not neglect that chance.  In this particular section there is ample power to have a board which will be the creature, as well as the creation, of the Minister, and which will do the kind of job the Minister wants it to do.  There can be no doubt whatever but that this board, which will be the creation of the Minister, will enjoy more power and patronage than, say, any board constituted under a county council.  As Senator Fitzgerald has said, when this State was set up the Government inherited the patronage possessed by the British Government, their predecessors in title.  They divested themselves of those powers in respect of the Civil Service by the Civil Service (Regulation) Act of 1924. They went a step further in 1926 by passing the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, which set up the Local Appointments Commissioners, a body which is still at work.  But all the posts in this group of hospitals, <Col N="1266" /> including those of doctors, surgeons, nurses, clerks, porters and messengers will be subject to the board which will itself be subject to the Minister and be entirely his creation.  In other words, if we assent to this particular section we are, as far as patronage is concerned, putting the clock back and putting patronage into the hands of a Minister, going back from 1926 to 1856, which is a long journey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there would be a technical difficulty about that. The Local Appointments Commission is a statutory body.  It deals only with local appointments.  This is a different type of hospital from the local or county hospital.  The governors are nominated in a different way from the way in which local bodies are constituted. The Minister takes responsibility for the appointment of this board.  Therefore, I do not think that, whatever means may be taken to obviate the dangers of patronage which some people seem to have found in this section, bringing in the Local Appointments Commissioners will get over the difficulty.  Speaking as one who knows very little about these things, <Col N="1267" /> I do not think that the Local Appointments Commissioners, as at present constituted, could take on this particular job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can set Senator Mrs. Concannon's mind completely at rest on that point by saying that if we were to insert in this section, or in any other appropriate place in the Bill, an amendment giving power to the Local Appointments Commissioners to make these appointments, that power could surely be legally exercised by them.  This, in fact, is a hospital under the direct control of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The Local Appointments Commissioners deal with appointments, normally, which require the sanction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Therefore, this is a completely analogous case, and would appear to be something with which the Local Appointments Commissioners could deal.  I agree with Senator Foran that an amendment to that effect would, of course, settle the whole problem.  I can understand Senator Robinson's great anxiety to shorten debate, but it is only certain kinds of debate that the Senator would like to shorten. That is the trouble.  The debate could be shortened now if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell the House that he is in agreement with Senator Foran and myself.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be desirable to depart from the system of appointment that at present operates. The board makes the appointments under the present law, and the board will make the appointments under the Bill when it becomes an Act.  Certain appointments, in fact any appointments, can, as I have already stated, be excluded from the scope of Ministerial sanction.  It is intended, when this Bill becomes an Act, to draft exclusion orders so as to give maximum autonomy to the board of governors in the matter of appointments. Only the more important appointments will be subject to Ministerial sanction.  I do not think there is any good ground for depriving the <Col N="1268" /> board of the privilege of selecting its own officers and staff.  In the past, that system has worked well.  In the last 20 years, there has never been any interference with its selection of staff. We have heard, and quite properly, tributes paid by Senators to the excellence of the staffs of these hospitals as well as to the excellent work done in them.  I would be very slow indeed to take from a board that has done its business as well as the board of governors of these hospitals has done its business, the power of selecting its own staffs in the future, a power which it has satisfactorily exercised in the past.</P>

Undoubtedly, the board will be created by the Minister, and, as some Senators have already said, will do the Minister's will.  He will see to that by the appointments that it makes.  This section leaves it open to people like Senator Fitzgerald to make allegations of the kind that he has made.  In the Minister's own interest, and in the interests of ordinary every-day regulations, these hospitals ought to be put on the same basis as other similar institutions, so as to have the whole thing beyond reproach, and so that it cannot be said that people obtained appointments because of their political associations or affinities.  The Minister should give some encouragement to an amendment for the Report Stage, that all appointments of a certain kind shall be through the Appointments Commission.</P>

Let me state that my remarks have no reference whatever to the attendance of members of the present board.

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 43, to delete the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; and after the word &ldquo;accounts&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;in a form to be prescribed by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put down this amendment in order to raise, in general terms, this question of the method of keeping hospital accounts.  I have been examining fairly closely the statistical information provided by the Hospitals Commission in their reports; and, if I may say so, a very creditable effort has been made towards the segregation of the purely financial accounts in relation to each unit.  The items are brought out in the case of the occupied bed, the domestic services, medical services, dispensary charges, and so on. However, an enormous difference is revealed is these figures.  Where one hospital is spending £27 for certain provisions, another may be spending <Col N="1272" /> £50.  It makes one rather suppose that there is no close and specific direction as to the manner in which these accounts are kept.  Of course, I know that they are all right as regards the financial integrity of the transactions, and I do not suggest any question as to that.  I suggest there may be considerable difference in the method applied in the allocation of payments.</P>
    <P>I have always been a great believer in the use of accounts for the purpose of administrative control, and I am perfectly satisfied that no accounting method hitherto adopted, no mere segregation of the financial accounts and cash payments under these headings, will ever be of any real value for the purpose of executive control.</P>
    <P>In order to get full value out of control, and to get the full benefit of accounts to the management, you must have some form of cost accounts, and units of responsibility.  For instance, the X-ray department in a hospital is a unit of responsibility, and you should aim at having all the expenses of that department segregated, stock taken at the beginning and end of the period, and results shown more or less on a commercial system, so that you can tell what is the cost of that unit.  The same thing applies to operations; you would attempt to get the cost per operation.  I apologise to the medical gentlemen present for getting so near to their technical side of the question, but I do not intend to go any further, and I think my suggestion is quite within the province of the layman.  In the out-patients' department, there is a very large amount of expenditure. I would suggest in some cases a vastly improved control in respect of outpatient costs.  In order to get any accounting control in that department, you must segregate all expenditure. That does not apply only to expenditure on salaries; you must allocate in some way to that unit all the drugs and material used there.</P>
    <P>The next point is that you cannot suddenly go to an accountant and say: &ldquo;I want you to put in straightaway a system of costing suitable to a hospital.&rdquo;  You have to approach this <Col N="1273" /> matter by stages; I might say by a system of trial and error.  You could put in a tentative method of costing, and if you are wise you will put in a fairly simple skeleton method at first. As a result of experience, that system could be modified and developed.  You would have regard to any extra staff involved in compiling the figures, and so on.  I am perfectly satisfied that the only way in which you will ultimately arrive at a proper costing system on a uniform basis for hospitals is by some hospital specialising and working along those lines.</P>
    <P>This is a State hospital under the Minister's Departmental supervision, and the object of my remarks is to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that there is a real, methodical, systematic attempt made towards building up a proper system of hospital accounts&mdash;it would take about three or four years to do it&mdash;which, when it is found to be feasible in operation, could be universally applied to all similar hospitals.  In that way, you would get figures which would show anybody who is interested the relative costs of different hospitals, and place in the hands of governors and managers a most valuable instrument of control.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that this is not entirely my own idea.  This method of accounting by units of responsibility is recommended in a standard book on hospital management by a gentleman named Stone, who was secretary to King Edward's Hospital.  It is a common-sense method; it is the only way in which accounts can be of any value for the purpose of control.  As I said, my object in raising the point is to ask the Parliamentary Secretary seriously to consider whether he cannot, from the inception of this new hospital, introduce under accountancy advice some method that will ultimately lead to a working system of costs, which, when proved in operation, could be universally applied to hospitals, and would provide valuable comparative figures as to hospital costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection at all to the principle embodied in Senator Sir John Keane's amendment, <Col N="1274" /> but I doubt if it is necessary to put a statutory obligation on the board to keep their accounts in a form to be prescribed by the Minister.  It is not necessary that I should tell the House that this particular hospital is very well managed; in fact, it is one of the best, if not the best, managed hospitals in Dublin.  We have not experienced any difficulty whatever in securing the full co-operation of the board in any reforms that are deemed to be in the interests of the institutions. I have no doubt at all that we can get that co-operation in regard to the form in which the accounts are to be kept, without putting a statutory obligation on the board.  As I say, I have no objection to the principle, but there is just one drawback.  If the Minister prescribed by Order the form in which the accounts are to be kept, experience will show&mdash;as Senator Sir John Keane will be the first to admit &mdash;that it is necessary from time to time to modify the Order.  That would mean a new statutory Order every time any change in the system of accountancy might be deemed to be desirable. In fact, preliminary steps have been taken to have established in this and in some other hospitals, but particularly in this one, a system of costings segregating the different units, and I believe that in the course of time a system will be evolved which probably can be uniformly applied.  The Hospitals Commission have been devoting their attention to this matter, and have taken it up with most of the voluntary hospitals.  It has been a tedious and difficult process to get anything approaching uniformity, but I think we are on the road towards it now, and that we can get it by negotiation and interchange of views rather than by statutory Order.</P>

What I want the Parliamentary Secretary to appreciate&mdash;I doubt if he is convinced of it in his own mind&mdash;is the enormous value of proper hospital costings.  His attitude is: &ldquo;We are doing something in that direction now, and we will get somewhere some day.&rdquo;  I think the Minister has a unique opportunity now.  Here he has a hospital under his own control; it is very different from other hospitals, where he would have to go in and be more or less interfering. If he appreciated as I do the enormously valuable, almost pioneer work that he could do in this matter, he would say to me: &ldquo;I am in full agreement with the Senator's object. I intend to use all my power and influence, although I do not want statutory Orders, to get as soon as I can a system of costings introduced and developed to such an extent that, when it works satisfactorily, it can be available for other hospitals, and be applied to them if they so wish.&rdquo;  I need hardly say that when a system of costings is working satisfactorily any hospital would be only too glad to apply it.  As I have said, a system like that can only be developed by experience. Would the Parliamentary Secretary say that he is in general agreement with my suggestion, and with my general approach to this subject, and that he will make this hospital a sort of pioneer institution in this matter of costings?</P>

      <P>May I point out that a few years ago a very wise suggestion was made by the Hospitals Commission that a hospitals association which could study exactly such matters as this and other questions such as combined purchasing should be established. The various voluntary hospitals were willing to join that association and many of the rate-supported hospitals were also anxious to join.  It would <Col N="1276" /> be quite impossible for the voluntary hospitals to finance this association on their own, but with the larger income that would be provided if the rate-supported hospitals were willing to join the association, there was every prospect that the association would be a very valuable help to every hospital in the city and the country.  Unfortunately, the Minister decided that he would not permit the rate-supported public hospitals to contribute any funds by way of subscription to the association.  The very wise recommendation of the Hospitals Commission was choked in the Custom House by the Minister's decision.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that what Senator Sir John Keane has put forward as regards costings would probably be more amicably arranged if the hospitals could come to some decision between themselves.  I know there are difficulties, but I think Senator Sir John Keane is on the right line.  Yet I am afraid the great danger is that a stumbling block will arise in the Custom House as it did five or six years ago.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> (2)  The Minister, before acquiring such land, shall obtain the advice of the board as to its suitability as a site for the new hospital, and shall not act in opposition to the advice of the board.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that this section gives the Minister very full powers.  The Minister may for the purpose of providing a site for a new hospital acquire, either by agreement or compulsorily, land in or near the City of Dublin.  It gives him power to act entirely on his own authority with the statute behind him, to put the hospital wherever he thinks fit, in or near the city.</P>
    <P>The object of my amendment is pretty clear, namely, to put some slight limitation on the Minister, to which I think he would probably submit even if the amendment were not inserted in the Bill.  The amendment suggests that the Minister, before acquiring such land, shall obtain the advice of the board as to its suitability as a site for the new hospital and shall not act in opposition to the advice of the board.  I think that would be a wise check on any Minister.  Some Ministers may not be so wise as other Ministers as time passes and it would be well to put some limitation on the absolute power which the section as it stands proposes to give to the Minister.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be willing to accept the amendment. It should not really limit a proper discretion by the Minister because such discretion could not be exercised unless the site were such as the members of the board would approve.  This question of the site has been the subject of considerable debate both in this House and in the Dáil.  I do not propose to take up much of the time of the House in discussing it now, but there are some points to which I think it is right to draw attention.  In the debate on the Second Reading, I put a specific question to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I asked him if he could tell us what advice, if any, the Hospitals Commission had given to the Minister on this question of a site. We know from the published reports of the Hospitals Commission that they were in favour of establishing the new <Col N="1279" /> hospital in place of the old Richmond Hospital on the present site and that they expressed the opinion that the present site was adequate and suitable &mdash;I think I am quoting the exact words &mdash;for the establishment of such a hospital.  In my question, when we were debating this point, I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he would inform the Seanad whether the Hospitals Commission had withdrawn the advice which appeared in one of their earlier reports and whether they have now given a recommendation in favour of removing this site.</P>
    <P>I noticed a very interesting feature of the debate in the Dáil which took place a considerable time ago.  It was stated by a Deputy&mdash;a member of the Minister's Party by the way&mdash;that every Deputy representing Dublin was against the removal of the site from its present position.  That statement was made by Deputy Cooney, who used these words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that all the Dublin Deputies, of all groups, are keenly interested in this hospital being built on the site of the present Richmond Hospital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the Dublin Deputies, representing the general opinion of the people of Dublin, are entitled to express an opinion, an opinion to which much weight should be given, as to a suitable site for the hospital.  In the Dáil it was made clear by Deputy Cooney, and by members of all Parties, that they did not think a movement from the present site would be for the convenience of the people of Dublin, particularly for those living in the neighbourhood, or for the improvement of the hospital, which would suffer by removal to a less accessible site. Many of the Dublin Deputies gave their opinion on that matter.  I refer to one in particular, because I think there was, perhaps, no member of either House who had a more intimate or a more loving knowledge of Dublin than the late Deputy Thomas Kelly.  He expressed the opinion that the hospital should not be removed from its present site.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> On the question of the site, we had the recommendation of the Hospitals Commission, and we do not know whether that has been withdrawn or not.  We have the opinions of Dublin Deputies, persons who have a more familiar knowledge of the place than would be possessed by members of the Dáil or Seanad who are not resident in Dublin, as to the convenience of the people likely to use this hospital.  In the debate on the Second Reading I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he would give us any reason why the site for the hospital should be removed. The only reason he gave was in very general terms, that there was a general opinion among town planners and people of that sort that the hospital should be on the outskirts of the city rather than in the centre.  He said, referring to me:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am sure Senator Rowlette knows as well as I do that the modern tendency in most European countries is to build hospitals outside cities, in the country or on the brink of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that that was the tendency a few years ago, but that tendency, quite apart altogether from the war, was beginning to be questioned, and there was a good deal of difference of opinion as to whether it was wise.  I think a decision should not depend on a general statement like that.  I think that all the circumstances of the case should be carefully taken into consideration before arriving at a decision.</P>
    <P>In the last debate I gave various reasons, which were supported by other Senators, why, in the particular case of the Richmond Hospital, such a move would be inadvisable.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not give us his views on that, other than on the lines of the general statement to which I have just referred.  The position at the moment is that the board of the hospital has, in the past, objected. What the present board wishes, I am not in a position to know.  I am informed that the staff of the hospital unanimously passed a request to the Minister not to take steps to alter the site of the hospital.  Some of the members <Col N="1281" /> of the staff are members of the board, and some are not.  I understand that that information, given to the Parliamentary Secretary, has not been in any way withdrawn, so that we have a body of informed opinion, informed both from the medical side and from the point of view of the public, against any proposal to move the site.  On the other hand, the Parliamentary Secretary stated here that the Minister was very unwilling to proceed with the building of a hospital on the present site, a site which, in the view of the Hospitals' Commission a few years ago, was both suitable and adequate.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question regarding a matter which has been puzzling many of us for two or three years, and that is why this Bill was suddenly stopped in its rather hampered course through the other House and put in cold storage for two and a half years or thereabouts.  It was considered in the Dáil in the month of May, 1940, and it was not until the autumn of 1942 that the Dáil was asked to resume its consideration of the Bill.  What was the reason for holding up the Bill in that way?  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary will give us any information on that point.</P>

      <P>Whatever the Chair orders, but this may have a special relevancy to the point I am discussing. There may have been a good reason for holding up the Bill, but I do not think that this or the other House has had any explanation of that long period of inertia.  What I propose in this amendment seems to me to be an entirely reasonable request to make.  I suggest that it should be accepted that the board of governors should have some say in the matter of selecting a site. That will be assured by having this amendment inserted in the Bill.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary will find that the board of governors, the old board or the present board, will be unreasonable in that matter. <Col N="1282" /> If they do not agree to the suitability of a proposed site, surely their judgment is as much to be relied upon as that of the Minister or his staff?  I think it is quite reasonable that the people who have carried on this institution for more years than I can recall should have a voice as to where the new hospital is to be situated.  Their main interest is in the institution itself and in making it useful to the people of Dublin and to the people of the country, as it has been for some 150 years.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this matter I have a perfectly open mind, but I would like to remind the Seanad that several hospitals in Dublin are seeking sites for new institutions in the suburbs or in the open areas around the city.  For instance, Grangegorman Hospital has selected a site in Santry; the Cork Street Fever Hospital Board has purchased a site at Blackditch, Ballyfermot; a site for a new T.B. hospital has been purchased in the same locality, and a site for a new T.B. sanatorium has been purchased on the way to Lucan, near the old tram station.  As I have said, I have an open mind in this matter, but I think Senator Rowlette will agree that the surroundings of the present site of this hospital are not the most elevating.  I might mention that St. Vincent's Hospital has also purchased a site for a new building out on the Merrion Road.  So that, every day, the inclination is to endeavour to procure sites for hospitals in the open air. Apart from that, we must realise that our city is fast expanding in the north-west&mdash;towards Cabra, for instance&mdash; where a number of buildings have been erected recently.  In that connection, and with reference to the remarks made by Senator Rowlette regarding a Deputy who referred to this matter in the other House, I do not know whether it would have any effect on the Senator's mind to know that the Deputy concerned happens to be a representative of the North-West Dublin area.  However, what I want to point out is that the inclination here in the City of Dublin, so far as the <Col N="1283" /> different hospital boards are concerned, is to secure sites for hospitals in the open air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to this matter is rather different from that of Senator Rowlette.  I do not feel competent to offer an opinion as to whether a hospital would be a better hospital if it were situated in a populous centre or in the suburbs.  I feel that that is a very open question, but there are financial considerations to be taken into account, and in that connection I should like to have more definite information.  When this Bill passes, is it mandatory on the Minister to build the new hospital on a new site, or is it merely permissible?  Even from the point of view of the Sweepstakes there may be no money.  There may be no money to provide for such hospitals, except the money provided by the taxpayer. However, apart from such a contingency, is the Minister under a statutory obligation to acquire a new site and re-build, or can he leave the question stay as it is, and repair or re-build the existing premises?  I consider that this is a very important point, because it does not merely affect the proposed St. Laurence's Hospital, but it impinges on the whole question of hospitalisation in this country, and I should like to have a specific answer on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDoyle" hpid="Dr. Doyle Dr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Rowlette's amendment.  I think the amendment reads to the effect that the Minister, before acquiring land, shall obtain the advice of the board as to the suitability of such land as a site for the new hospital, and shall not act in opposition to the advice of the board.  Now, I think that the real thing there is the advice of the board of the hospital, and I think that the old Richmond and its associated hospitals are in a different position from the other voluntary hospitals in Dublin from that point of view.  The suggestion is that the Minister is taking powers to himself to do away with the board, and to transfer the site of these associated hospitals, I believe, out to Cabra.  That is what I understood <Col N="1284" /> from reading the debates in the Dáil. Now it seems to me that Senator Rowlette's amendment is perfectly reasonable.  Its purpose is to let the Minister consult the board and be advised by them.</P>
      <P>It would appear that because the Hospitals Sweepstakes have been in existence for some time and moneys have been subscribed for the purposes of hospitalisation, the Government are taking control of the voluntary hospitals in Dublin.  That, at least, is the fear of the people concerned.  These people feel that this is what you might call the thin end of the wedge, and that, simply because, under the old régime here, the Richmond Hospital and those associated with it had certain connections with the then Government&mdash;such as that the Government, or the Lord Lieutenant, had the right to nominate members to the board&mdash;this is the reason for the present Government taking control.  It appears to me that that is the fear in the minds of the people concerned.  Accordingly, I think it would be an evidence of good faith on the part of the Government if they would accept this amendment, the purpose of which is that the Government would consult with the existing Board of Governors, or any future board of governors, of the hospital, as to the site of the hospital or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this amendment is necessary at all, because I think that the advice of the board, inevitably, will be sought by any Minister when discussing any change.  In any case, I do not think, in view of the previous discussion here, that the question of agreement would be necessary, because the argument that was advanced here before was that the board would be the creation of the Minister, and, if that were so, I feel pretty sure that it would consent to the Minister's point of view.  Apart from that, however, I cannot understand why medical opinion in this House seems to be so much in favour of the hospital concerned remaining where it is.  Unfortunately, I have had experience of visiting the Richmond Hospital fairly frequently, and if there is any hospital in Dublin which <Col N="1285" /> is absolutely inaccessible, either by any means of transport or on foot, it is the Richmond Hospital.  If I were on O'Connell Bridge, let us say, and were asked whether I should prefer to go to the present site of the Richmond Hospital or to Cabra, which, I understand, is the proposed site, I should certainly prefer to take the route to Cabra, because the present site of the Richmond Hospital is almost inaccessible by any means of transport, either available to-day or in the recent past, or, apparently in the near future.  The hospital in its present position is almost inaccessible, and I would be prepared to walk the distance to Cabra rather than to approach the Richmond Hospital in its present position, because it is dangerous to traffic at the present time; it is also dangerous to pedestrians, and unless the whole district were to be subjected to a new town-planning scheme, it appears to me that the hospital is in a very inaccessible position for doctors, nurses or patients.</P>
      <P>Candidly, I cannot understand why there is such opposition from medical representatives in the House to the proposed change, particularly in face of the fact that, according to world opinion generally, the preferable site for a hospital would be in the neighbourhood of a city rather than in the heart of a city.  Then, as far as the buildings themselves are concerned, the greater portion of them is derelict, while other portions are almost derelict. There is only one of the three associated hospitals which appears to be in a proper condition from modern standards, and one would not like to see that abandoned, but it seems to me that the other portions are either derelict or semi-derelict.  That is all I want to say with regard to the amendment. I think the amendment is unnecessary, and I do not think that the opinions that were expressed so adamantly by medical representatives in this House were justified because of the conditions that exist, or justified because of professional opinion, so far as the building or reconstruction of hospitals is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment sets out that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" />&ldquo;the Minister, before acquiring such land, shall obtain the advice of the board as to its suitability as a site for the new hospital, and shall not act in opposition to the advice of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the amendment were passed, not only would the Minister be under a statutory obligation to consult the board as to the suitability of the proposed site but to accept the site selected by the board.  That position cannot be accepted at all.  I doubt if it is appropriate that we should have a detailed discussion as to the merits of building in the country or building in the centre of a thickly populated district, inasmuch as the measure before the House does not select a site.  The measure merely gives the Minister power to acquire a site, and why we should have all this detailed discussion as to where the hospital is to be placed ultimately, before the Minister or anybody else has any statutory power to acquire a site, is something I cannot understand very clearly, and neither did I understand very clearly why the discussion took the same trend in the Dáil.  As I say, the Bill provides that the Minister shall be empowered to acquire a site.</P>
    <P>Might I point out to the House that it is not proposed to close the existing hospitals immediately, nor is it proposed to close the existing hospitals when the new hospital is built, equipped and ready for the reception of patients.  It is proposed to continue the existing hospitals until such time as the bed shortage in the City of Dublin has been fully met.  Anybody with any knowledge of this problem will, I think, agree that there is no likelihood, for a very long period of years, of the bed shortage in Dublin hospitals being fully satisfied.  Consequently, we may assume that the existing institutions will continue for a very long number of years.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to believe that Senator Rowlette is in full earnest when he suggests that not only should the Minister be bound by statute to consult the board as to the suitability of a site which he proposed to acquire, but should be bound to accept the expressed <Col N="1287" /> views of the board on the matter. In other words, we are going to reverse the normal process.  The Minister appoints the board of this hospital, which is a State hospital. Every brick and every stone of the existing institutions belong to the State and the Minister has full power to remove the board at any time, to reconstitute it or to alter its constitution, and yet it is suggested that the Minister is to be placed in a subordinate position to that board.  I think the suggestion is nonsensical and I could not consider accepting it.</P>
    <P>It might interest the House, and perhaps surprise some members, to learn that the suggestion of building in the country originated with the board of governors of the House of Industry Hospitals.  As far back as 1936, the board of governors submitted a proposal to the Department that they should be allowed to provide an auxiliary hospital in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>Auxiliary, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>To provide an auxiliary hospital in the country.  They represented that a similar arrangement had been found satisfactory in London and elsewhere; that there would be a saving in site costs, cost of construction and cost of administration; that there would be more rapid convalescence in the country branch of the hospital; that the country would provide a suitable place for convalescing patients who should not be left to convalesce in tenement dwellings; and that the removal of chronic patients from the city hospital would facilitate nursing.  These headings are lettered A, B, C, D and E.  Here is heading F: The scheme would be elastic, and it would be possible to provide more beds in the country branch, when required, to meet the future growth of Dublin.  The present scheme is a very slight modification of the scheme submitted to the Department by the board of governors in 1936.  The existing hospitals are being continued.  It was suggested that an auxiliary hospital rather than a new hospital would be built in the country, but all the advantages which were put <Col N="1288" /> forward by the board of governors in favour of having a branch institution in the country will be available as soon as the new hospital is provided.</P>
      <P>Senator Keane raised the question of whether it is mandatory upon the Minister to provide a hospital.  If the Senator will refer to Section 21, he will see that the Minister may, for the purpose of providing a site for the new hospital, acquire, either by agreement or compulsorily, land in or near the City of Dublin.  The Minister is not under a statutory obligation to acquire land.  The Bill merely empowers the Minister.  It is an enabling section, to empower the Minister to acquire a site. We might have a very long discussion on the arguments in favour of going out to the country, and on such arguments as could be advanced as to why an effort should be made to build this institution in a thickly populated area of the city, but I do not think it is appropriate to the Bill inasmuch as the Bill does not select a site.</P>
      <P>I have also stated more than once&mdash; I stated it in this House on the Second Reading&mdash;that the Minister will consult the board.  I stated that the Minister would consider the views of anybody who had views to express on this important subject.  If the Senators from Dublin City are particularly interested in this matter, when the Minister is given power to acquire a site, it is open to them to make representations to the Minister.  Those representations will be considered and the views of everybody who submits views will be considered, but the ultimate decision must rest with the Minister.  There may be differences of opinion&mdash;there very probably will be&mdash; but it is right and proper that if there is a difference of opinion the Minister should finally determine the issue, and that it should not be determined by somebody else, in the light of the fact that this is admitted by everybody now to be a State hospital, under the full control of the Minister, and that the property will be vested in the Minister as trustee for the State.</P>

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has answered my <Col N="1289" /> point.

      <P>I have been very interested in the discussion that has taken place.  I cannot say that I am altogether surprised at the refusal of the Parliamentary Secretary to accept this very modest amendment, but some of the remarks which I have heard interested me a good deal.  I am glad that Senator Healy came, I think unintentionally, to my relief in pointing out that Grangegorman Hospital was endeavouring to leave its present site, which would leave an adequate space for five Richmond Hospitals. He pointed out that the authorities of many hospitals in Dublin were anxious to leave the city and to get sites in the country.  That depends upon the kind of hospitals concerned.  Patients in Grangegorman have no special advantage in being in the city; it would be an advantage if they were in the country. The same is true of tuberculosis hospitals, and of infectious disease hospitals such as Cork Street.  An important point about Cork Street is that it is not open to visitors, except when patients are <i>in extremis.</i>  Consequently, the inconvenience to friends and relatives of patients in such a hospital would not be increased by the movement from Cork Street to a country site.  Senator Healy did not make any distinction between hospitals for different classes of diseases.  That is an essential point when considering the convenience of the patients.  There is also the question of staff, education and tuition to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to relieve Senator Sir John Keane's mind with regard to the Sweepstakes.  The Sweepstakes are reviving. It was a pleasure this morning to be able to announce that the receipts were well over those of the Sweepstakes held last year.  The last three or four Sweepstakes have shown a steady improvement in receipts, but nothing, of <Col N="1290" /> course, like the astronomical sums realised a few years ago, a great proportion of which went to the relief of the rates and also a great proportion to the relief of taxes.  I do not know if we are going to get back to the time when we received large sums of money, but it is encouraging that the Sweepstake receipts are gradually improving in spite of the hard times.  I was very interested and entertained by Senator O'Donovan's views on walking.  I believe a young man like Senator O'Donovan would prefer a nice country walk if he had to visit a hospital to see a sick friend, rather than going around by the dangerous streets that lie between the quays and Richmond Hospital.  I should point out that there is a very straight road from the quays, if the Senator chose to take it.</P>

      <P>I have often been along it.  I do not know if it has become crooked since my last visit. Is it the same, however, for a woman who has to carry a sick child, or who has to be back home in time to get her husband's dinner or to attend to household duties?  Senator O'Donovan said that he would prefer to walk, but the poor people who make use of the Richmond Hospital have not money to spend on bus fares to country districts. I suggest that if Senator O'Donovan was not quite so loyal in his attachments, he would not have put forward such an argument but, if he will permit me to say so, would have advanced one with more commonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important question, from my point of view, was raised by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I noticed that he did not pay any attention to the question I asked him and, I presume, is unwilling to answer.  I asked if the proposal to change the hospital was made on the recommendation, or against the recommendation, of the Hospitals' Commission.  We know what the recommendations of the Hospitals' Commission were, but we do not know whether or not they were changed or whether the Minister has overruled them.  The Parliamentary Secretary could have strengthened his <Col N="1291" /> case if he had seen fit to be frank in reply to that question.  I also asked him if he could tell us why this Bill had been kept on the shelf for 2½ years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any charge against the Chair.  The Chair made a suggestion that I understood to be for more regular order. I am content to raise the matter on the Fifth Stage.  For the first time in the debate in this House, and in the Dáil, the Parliamentary Secretary has fallen back on a request made by the board of the hospital as long ago as 1936.  That has no relation to the present proposition.  The Parliamentary Secretary said the present proposition was closely allied with it. There is no relevance.  They asked that an auxiliary hospital&mdash;not an alternative hospital&mdash;should be built in a country place.  For what purpose? For the use of convalescent and chronic patients.  Anybody who knows anything about hospitals would agree with that.  Some Dublin hospitals have convalescent homes, either attached to them directly, or associated with them, in some cases under the care of religious Orders who run hospitals. There is a close connection between such institutions.  That is an admirable arrangement.  Nothing could be better.  Convalescent patients have <Col N="1292" /> the opportunity of convalescing more rapidly by getting to country surroundings. I think every physician and surgeon practising in Dublin, as far as possible, makes use of such homes whether they are attached to the hospitals or run by other charitable bodies.  Speaking for myself, every week I recommend patients who are fit to leave a general hospital, to go to convalescent homes, and try to make arrangements, very largely through the charity of religious Orders.</P>
      <P>The proposal before us is to build a new hospital.  We all know that it is impossible to build a new hospital at the present time.  That is the only safeguard for the present Richmond Hospital, assuming that the Minister remains firm and carries a vote of this House against the amendment.  We all know that the proposal must be held up for some years and that some of us will never live to see it carried out.  I do not think it is right to suggest that the recommendation of the Richmond Hospital authorities to make their existing hospital more useful by having a country annex&mdash;because that is what it came to&mdash;or auxiliary hospital has any relation to the proposal to remove the old hospital to a new site and keep a few wards or a few out-patients departments going on the present site.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made another remark which I thought at first was a bit helpful.  He was unwilling to accept that the Minister should be bound in any way by the advice of the governors, but he remarked that the governors might submit their views and, no doubt, they would be given attention.  That seemed very good, but he spoiled it by the next sentence, when he said that anyone could submit views and that these views would get fair attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, the governors are in a better position to submit views on the suitability of a site than anybody else&mdash; any Tom, Dick or Harry.  I do not think that it was really very helpful to say that the governors may submit views, that they have the same right to submit views as anybody else.  A busy-body may submit the view to the <Col N="1293" /> Minister that the hospital should be built on the top of Howth Hill, or some place else, and that view will be considered with the same care as the considered views of a responsible body of men&mdash;such as the governors of the hospital.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise a point on Section 23.  Is it usual to give a Minister unrestricted powers to sell property?  I think that Parliament imposed all kinds of restrictions on the Government leasing property.  I do not know what the distinction is.</P>

      <P>Exceptional safeguards were imposed in the matter of leasing property.  They were subject to being tabled, and so on.  Should not similar restrictions apply to the sale of property by a Minister?  I would like to have that point dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There is similar power in relation to the disposal of surplus land acquired for housing or public health purposes.  The Minister, in order to be able to acquire a desirable property, may have to acquire more land than is actually necessary for the site of the hospital, and the purpose of the section is to enable the Minister to dispose of any surplus lands or land that he may have to acquire above what would be necessary for the hospital site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that quite answers my point.  The Constitution imposed all kinds of safeguards in respect of the Government leasing land.  Why should not similar safeguards <Col N="1295" /> apply in the case of the sale of land?  That puzzles me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to enter into a debate on that.  I am explaining to the Senator why it may be necessary to acquire more land than will be required for the purposes of the hospital. A man may have an estate for sale.  He may be prepared to sell the whole of his little estate if you are prepared to buy, but may not be prepared to sell a portion of it.  It may be good business to acquire the whole of the property, notwithstanding the fact that less of it would do but, if you do acquire the whole of the property and it is not necessary for your purpose, it is necessary that you should have statutory power to dispose of the surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I see the point about the acquisition of surplus land, but is not the Minister empowered, without any restriction, to sell the site of the existing hospital when it is no longer required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <P>May I ask what is the purpose of these political histrionics, of putting in one word in Irish and then suggesting that there is not even an English equivalent for it?  I do not see what is being aimed at.  It would be quite logical to say that the whole Act should be in Irish.  The whole Act will appear in Irish on the Statute Book, since there will be an Irish translation of this Bill.  The only official publications without a word of Irish are the Income Tax forms one receives.  I can never find a word of Irish in them, but in every other Government publication you find somewhere, in the title or on the margin, a word in Irish.  Frankly, the whole thing is ridiculous.  This is calculated to make us look ridiculous&mdash;to have one word in Irish stuck in, and then suggesting that there is no English equivalent for it.</P>

      <P>In reply to what Senator Sir John Keane has said, my idea was to prevent the Seanad from making itself ridiculous, since you can have no proper translation of an Irish word like &ldquo;Lorcán&rdquo;.  To translate &ldquo;Lorcán&rdquo; into &ldquo;Laurence&rdquo; simply makes the whole thing ridiculous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it going to be translated from Lorcán into Laurence? The Bill was drafted in English.  There were old pre-Christian names of pagan origin.  When Christianity came in, those names were correlated with Biblical, or specifically Christian, names.  The name &ldquo;Lorcán&rdquo; was pagan.  When Christianity came in, it was correlated with the name Laurence, after Laurentius, an early Christian saint.  The original name in <Col N="1298" /> this Bill, as well as I remember, was St. Laurence O'Toole.  Perhaps some of the Gaelic experts can tell us whether, at his Baptism, Lorcán O Tuathail, in being called Laurence or Lorcán, was called after a specifically Christian saint whose name was Laurentius.  Now we are being told that you cannot have an English equivalent for an Irish name.  I do not purport to be a historian with regard to the Irish saints, but I think, if investigation is made, it will be found that this is just St. Laurence <i>simpliciter</i> who has priority in the Breviary, the original Saint Laurence. If it was Lorcán O Tuathail, I think you will find that he had the name in respect of a saint whose name was Laurentius, of which the English is Laurence, and to which, at a later stage, the Irish name Lorcán was arbitrarily correlated.  I do not think there is any point in the argument that you cannot find an equivalent in English for this word.</P>

      <Col N="1300" /> SECTION 29.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 29 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring before the House a question of principle which embarrasses me very much, and would probably embarrass me even more if I were the Minister. Whatever the past status of this hospital, I think we are all pretty well satisfied now that it was, in essence, a State hospital.  When the sweepstakes came along, they were intended, I think, primarily for voluntary hospitals, but I accept that as time went on the principle was applied that all sick poor should benefit from sweepstake funds.  I am not going to labour the point that whereas there was no intention in the original scheme to benefit State hospitals, they ultimately received the benefits of it, and that so far as the sweepstakes are concerned, all hospitals, rate-aided&mdash;subject to a certain proportion&mdash;general and State, can participate.</P>
      <P>What I do not like about it is that the Minister takes power to pay for this hospital out of sweepstake funds.  At present I venture to say there are no adequate funds to pay for the building of any new hospital.  There are, roughly, £8,000,000 capital in the possession of the hospitals' trustees, and virtually the whole of the interest on that sum is required to finance deficits. The last deficits, I think, amounted to £210,000, and 3 per cent. on the capital amounts to £240,000; so that you are practically getting to a position&mdash;and the deficits are almost certain to increase this year&mdash;in which the whole of the available money is required to finance these deficits.  You could begin to dissipate the capital, but I do not think anybody contemplates that; so that if you are to find capital for rebuilding, you must wait for the sweepstakes to revive, or find it from State funds.  I do not propose to pursue that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the Minister, being human, cannot be a fair judge, and it is not fair to give the Minister power to deal on his sole initiative and responsibility with that fund.  It is <Col N="1301" /> only human that he should give priority to his own hospital, to the State hospital, and I am profoundly dissatisfied that there is not some protection in the Bill for other hospitals which have an equal right to rebuild when the time comes.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will tell the House what his intentions in this matter are because he is at present an absolute dictator over the Hospitals Sweepstake money.  He can take advice from this person or from that person, but when it comes to the last resort, he can say, without anybody questioning him, that a sum of, for instance, £1,000,000 available in the Sweepstake Fund for rebuilding shall all go to build the St. Laurence Hospital and that other schemes can wait until further moneys become available.  It is a profoundly unsatisfactory system to have the Minister an interested party in one participant in that fund.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will reassure us and, if he sees fit to do so, give some statutory protection against that very alarming possibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as outlined by Senator Sir John Keane. The Minister under the Bill will have complete power to give priority to this hospital.  There is no getting away from that.  It is doubtful if, in the near future, it will be possible to build any of the larger hospitals in Dublin which are in contemplation.  I do not think the Senator desires to have a discussion on that matter, inasmuch as we have a specific motion dealing with the whole problem of the hospital situation in Dublin, on which details of the position and the prospects will probably have to be discussed, but I think the House can assume that all the hospitals will get fair treatment. It is natural to assume that there may be a leaning towards the institution which belongs to the State; on the other hand, it is hoped that it will be possible to provide the four Dublin hospitals, of which this is only one, as soon as the emergency has passed and building materials are again available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to continue to develop the argument as to how it is proposed to make moneys available for that purpose, <Col N="1302" /> I should be anticipating the discussion which must take place later on on Senator Sir John Keane's motion, but I do believe that, if the emergency were over the sweepstakes would revive.  We have heard from Senator Rowlette to-day that, even during the emergency, there has been a growing improvement in the sweepstakes, and that the sweepstake at present being held has been substantially more successful than recent sweepstakes, and in fact than any since the beginning of the emergency.</P>
    <P>There is, however, no alternative to taking the risk that the Minister will give priority to this institution.  After all, this institution, while it is a State hospital, will serve exactly the same classes of the community as the voluntary hospitals or any of the other institutions in the City of Dublin or throughout Ireland serve.  While it is a State hospital, it is not being reserved, and it is not intended that it should be reserved, for the medical treatment of State officials, such as Guards, civil servants, or Senators, if they come into the category of State officials.  If it were being reserved for servants of the State, there would be more substance in the line of thought suggested by Senator Sir John Keane, but in fact the hospital will continue to serve in the future, as it has in the past, mainly the poor of the City of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat confused by the discussion between Senator Sir John Keane and the Parliamentary Secretary.  Under the second sub-section of Section 29, there is no discretion left to the Minister, except in respect of one small point. Senator Sir John Keane's criticism was that it was invidious and difficult for the Minister to use a free discretion where a hospital, in which he was more directly interested ministerially than in another, was concerned, but, in sub-section (2) &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo;&mdash;it does not say &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;make from time to time to the board, out of the Hospitals Trust Fund,&rdquo; grants for a particular purpose.  Whether that is for better or worse, from the point of view of Senator Sir John <Col N="1303" /> Keane, I do not know, but there is no discretion there, except in the interpretation of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;which, in the opinion of the Minister, have been reasonably incurred.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not relieved my anxieties in the very least.  He has admitted that the Minister can give priority to this hospital.  Further, in seeking to justify such action, if it were taken, he says: &ldquo;What does it matter giving priority to this hospital?  It is the poor who will benefit.&rdquo;  I cannot accept that.  Other hospitals have equal claim on those sweepstakes, and I think that they would have very solid grounds for grievance if they found that £1,000,000 or £500,000 which had been accumulated had suddenly been bitten off entirely by the Minister.  I shall be dealing with this matter again on the general motion.  The whole thing is profoundly unsatisfactory.  There is uncertainty as to the magnitude of the fund in the future.  There is uncertainty as to the gambling propensity in the future.  There is uncertainty as to whether the State can maintain this whole method of sweepstake legislation. Once the Minister starts building this hospital he is committed to it.  He has to finance it out of sweepstakes moneys; he seems to have no alternative unless there is amending legislation. We will find all the sweepstakes moneys, or a substantial portion of them, going to this one hospital, and the other people can wait.  They will be dependent entirely in the future on the uncertainty of gambling, and all the rest of it.  I think there should be in the Bill some form of words providing that, before embarking on a scheme, regard must be had to the claims of other hospitals in respect of their schemes, because there are other schemes in being, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows.  I can see very clearly that this particular scheme will get priority, and the other schemes will have to wait indefinitely.  There are further consequences of that which, as the Parliamentary Secretary has suggested, are not appropriate to this discussion, and which I will develop at <Col N="1304" /> a later stage.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary be averse to putting in some form of words which would direct the Minister to have regard to the schemes that other hospitals have&mdash;the authorised schemes, I might say, of other hospitals&mdash;before he decides to commit himself to the Saint Laurence scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I shall have to ask the House to trust the Minister in this regard.  No restriction has been put on the Minister's discretion in the matter of priority under the Hospitals Trusts Act.  Since he became responsible for the disbursement of those funds, it has been open to him to give priority to any institution that he thought well of giving priority to.  I do not think the Minister has abused that power.  It might be suggested, if people wanted to be particularly polite, that some future Minister might abuse a power which the present Minister would not abuse.  The only answer I can give to that is that any future Minister, having had sufficient Parliamentary power behind him to become Minister, can take any statutory powers that he requires for the purpose of giving him the right to exercise the priority he might desire.  I would not be favourably disposed towards the suggestion of Senator Sir John Keane that we should put a statutory obligation on the Minister carefully to weigh the claims of all other claimants on the Hospitals Trust funds before taking any steps towards the provision of this new hospital.  I would assure the House, if it were necessary, that the claims of all the hospitals which are anxious to extend or to provide new institutions will be fairly considered. There does not appear to be any great anxiety on the part of any of the voluntary hospitals to push on with the preliminary steps towards the provision of further accommodation or the provision of new hospitals pending the termination of the present international crisis.  In fact, it is difficult to get the governing bodies of some of those institutions even to proceed with the preliminary plans.  At any rate, I think it would be an innovation that I should have to resist if the Minister's discretion were to be <Col N="1305" /> curtailed in the manner suggested by Senator Sir John Keane.</P>

      <P>On the question raised, the Parliamentary Secretary explained that, if the Minister did not have the discretion, he could always get it; that if he was sufficiently strong in the Dáil to be appointed Minister he must have a subservient majority, and, therefore, could get the powers to do what he wished to do in any case. That, to my mind, is a complete denial of democracy and a complete denial of parliamentary government.</P>

      <P>I do not for a moment suggest anything about the present Minister.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that, under our Parliamentary system, a future Minister could do that.  I am suggesting that that idea is an entirely false one in regard to our Parliamentary system.  It presupposes that, because a majority in the Dáil elect a Minister that majority has no individual rights at all; that they will always blindly support him, and that there is no such thing as any kind of freedom inside any Party.  If that be true, it means that Parliament, at its best, is a rather poor debating society.  I do not myself believe that we have reached that stage, and I hope we will never reach it.  Even though very often we have the Whips put on in a way that I think is unnecessary, I think&mdash;or I hope, at any rate&mdash;that there is a considerable amount of individual opinion, even though it is expressed only at Party meetings.  The idea suggested by the Parliamentary <Col N="1306" /> Secretary which, of course, applied only to a future Minister, seems to me to be utterly unparliamentary.</P>

      <P>My criticism of Section 29 is not that it leaves too much discretion to the Minister but that it leaves no discretion at all; it is mandatory on him to dispose of the money in a certain way.  This, as far as I know, is an entirely new feature in regard to any of the legislation governing the Hospitals Trust funds. I may be wrong about that, but I cannot remember any other case in which the Hospitals Trust funds were ordered to be disbursed for the benefit of any particular hospital.  The Parliamentary Secretary has defended the present discretionary powers of the Minister.  Of course, they are secured to him completely by Statute. I do not always agree with the Parliamentary Secretary, but I think he was quite within his rights in claiming that, speaking generally&mdash;he did not say &ldquo;speaking generally&rdquo;; I put that in&mdash;the Minister has not shown any favouritism in his distribution of funds between the various hospitals. The distribution has been very fairly carried out.  I think it is an objectionable principle that a statute should be brought in to limit the power of the Minister in the exercise of that discretion, to override whatever discretion he may have or whatever advice he may have got from the Hospitals Commission and that certain institutions shall be entitled to receive funds in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that the Parliamentary Secretary is very logical.  He says that no restrictions have been placed upon the Minister in the past and asks why should any be placed on him now.  When the Hospitals Act was passed, the rebuilding of the State hospital was never in contemplation.  If it were felt that the State hospital, in the sole discretion of the Minister, had a right to get funds in priority to any other hospital, I think that the matter would have to be raised on the original Hospitals Act and I should be very surprised if something were <Col N="1307" /> not done to prevent that happening. On the Report Stage, I propose to bring in an amendment to establish the point I am now urging.  It would appear that, as the section now stands, once this hospital is started, no other hospital can participate in the capital funds of the sweepstakes until this hospital is completed.  Other institutions which may have equal claim may have to wait for years and years.  My view is that none of the rebuilding schemes should be started until the capital is in sight.  We should be satisfied to go on with the existing institutions until they can all rebuild or until the capital is available and it can be distributed on a fair and equitable basis.  I shall consider some form of words for the Report Stage which will meet the anxieties I see and which I hope the House shares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was moved some weeks ago by Senator Douglas and spoken to by the Minister for Finance and, owing to a combination of circumstances, there has been a considerable interval between the opening of the debate and its continuance and, I hope, conclusion, to-night.</P>
      <P>I am seconding this motion on its merits and I should like, at the outset, to make it clear that it is in no way intended to be an attack upon civil servants, upon the Civil Service, or upon any particular group of civil servants; nor is it, indeed, in my judgment, referable particularly to this emergency, nor do I intend to discuss the very large question as to whether the Civil Service should not, in fact, be reduced or whether there should not be less interference with, or management of, the lives and the business of citizens.  That is too large a topic for this motion.  I am simply accepting the position that the Civil Service is a big machine which, in the words of the Minister for Finance, is likely to grow larger and that it ought, therefore, to be investigated periodically with a view to seeing that the very best service is taken from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be the last person to attack the present Civil Service, because I have had, in more than one capacity, ample experience of the loyalty and industry and devotion to duty of civil <Col N="1309" /> servants.  I saw, in 1922 and subsequent years, these qualities displayed by them, their anxiety to give of their best, and the very remarkable versatility that a number of civil servants were able to display, turning from old tasks to tasks of an entirely new nature.</P>
    <P>The emergency, it appears to me, only quickens a process which has been going on for a considerable number of years, a process by which Parliament and Government interfere&mdash;I use the word without attaching to it any particular weight of meaning&mdash;more and more with the lives of ordinary citizens.  We are aware that the Civil Service from which our Civil Service descends is the British Civil Service; that that Civil Service was developed to deal with a <i>laissez faire</i> organism, to deal with the affairs of a Government and a Parliament whose settled policy was a policy of non-interference with the ordinary lives of the people. It dealt with two or three main subjects. One of these was war, including an army, of course, and the war that it was framed and developed to meet was something quite different from what we are witnessing at the moment, which is called total war. The main subjects were war, courts and foreign affairs.  But, within the last 100 years, and more particularly the last 30 years, the functions of Parliament and Government have been steadily widening and, at an accelerated pace, covering a much larger area.</P>
    <P>There have been certain adaptations but, if one cares to examine the difference between the tasks that confronted the Civil Service before the Lloyd George Budgets early in this century, from 1909 to 1911, one can easily see that since that time the Unemployment Insurance Act, the National Health Insurance Acts and a great variety of other Acts were passed, and, even in the domain of social services, to take but one comparatively small area out of a vast expanse, the Civil Service has been given a much wider variety of functions. There have been since then some adaptations, but hardly any of <Col N="1310" /> principle, and I feel that they are not sufficient to enable the Civil Service to deal with its present task and with the tasks with which, there is practical unanimity, it will be faced in the future.  The only really important change that has been brought in is the principle of competitive examination, the principle of competition for posts. That is the major change.</P>
    <P>Now, the State provides capital money or annual grants for a great many purposes, which would have shocked statesmen or parliamentarians a generation or two ago.  Here, for example, we have grants for capital money provided for such things as the Electricity Supply Board, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Industrial Credit Corporation, the sugar beet industry, insurance and so on, and we have also recently formed a shipping company and a Central Bank. Whether we like it or not, these are activities of Government, and seeing that Government money, voted by Parliament, goes into these activities, it is necessary for the State to keep some touch with them and some form of control. It is because of that, that you have new and varied functions for the Civil Service, and what we ought to consider is whether persons, recruited under the old system, can possibly carry out different functions, which would have been unthinkable some years ago.  The Department of Supplies, for instance, has been cited as an example, and it is likely that, after this war, the Department of Supplies will survive in some form or another, but I should like to take another example, which is more familiar to me but which is hardly ever mentioned.</P>
    <P>I should like Senators to consider the great variety of matters which now come within the purview of the Department of Education. That Department deals with primary and secondary education, as well as technical education.  It deals now with a much bigger field than it ever dealt with before.  It deals, as I have said, with technical education, and also with such matters as domestic economy.  The National Gallery, the School of Art, the National Library, and the Museum all come under its <Col N="1311" /> control, and it also deals with industrial schools.  Now, in connection with all these matters, there is what is called in the Civil Service a file, which eventually reaches the head of the Department of Education, and he has to give an opinion on all these extraordinarily different things.  I knew for a long time that that was the position, but I did not realise it fully until I, myself, was a Minister for Education. Take the Museum alone as an example, and consider the extraordinary variety of knowledge that is required there.  One has to have knowledge of archæology, of old glass, of old lace&mdash;of 101 things which one does not usually associate at all with education. When you come to consider that, you really wonder at the small number of highly-paid people that there are in the Department of Education at all. For example, we spend nearly £4,000,000 &mdash; £3,800,000 &mdash; on primary education.  Now, I want to dissociate myself completely from the kind of propaganda, which was common at one time, about the highly-paid civil servants.  As far as I know, there is only one highly-paid civil servant, on the £1,000 a year scale in the office, dealing with that £4,000,000 a year expenditure, and I should say that in that case, instead of its being a matter of over-staffing, it seems to be a matter of under-staffing.</P>
    <P>One could give the very same example from other Departments. Long ago, in the days of Sinn Féin and, indeed, in the days when Fianna Fáil was getting into office, there used to be denunciation of boards and bureaucrats but, unfortunately, we have more and more boards and more and more bureaucrats, using that word in an inoffensive manner to indicate civil servants, and we are moving into a stage when we are likely to have government by experts.  I am sufficiently old-fashioned to be lacking in enthusiasm for that.  I have known quite a number of experts, and I know they can be charming people, but I would rather not be governed by them, if I could avoid it.  We have county and city managers and more and more civil servants.  We are, in <Col N="1312" /> fact, creating&mdash;and we are not alone, because almost every country is creating it in one way or another&mdash;a new ascendancy.  We used to fulminate in former times against the old ascendancy, and I have learned that along with having demerits they had certain merits, but we ought at least to take steps to train and pick with great care the new ascendancy we are creating ourselves and to refresh them for the performance of their duties by releasing them from time to time.</P>
    <P>On that question of experts, one of the difficulties in the Civil Service has always been, and is yet, that no satisfactory solution has been found for the relations between the experts and the administrators.  The Civil Service is ruled by clerks&mdash;again, I use the word simply to mean &ldquo;administrator&rdquo;&mdash; and, taking education again as an example, a man might be an admirable head of a Department to guide education itself&mdash;the inspectors, the programmes in the schools&mdash;but put him down at a desk, smother him in files and he becomes, perhaps, not at all so competent a person.  In fact, you smother the real qualities the man has, but the Civil Service is so geared up that the head of every Department must be the accounting officer; he must be, in other words, a clerk and not an expert, and he must be a clerk who has to deal with all kinds of things.  He constitutes a bottle-neck and he has time for no thinking at all. He is smothered in work, smothered in day-to-day things, smothered in files, and has no opportunity of standing and looking at the work of his Department.</P>
    <P>There is another point which might be considered.  The Civil Service in the old days was a very small body, controlled entirely by the Treasury, now the Department of Finance.  I do not know whether Senators who have not had any administrative experience realise how far that particular control goes.  It is not only control of the amount of money that may be spent on a big thing, but it goes down to the smallest details of staff and the smallest figures of expenditure. It worked very well, perhaps, <Col N="1313" /> in a small machine, but it is now, I think, quite ineffective in a machine which has grown out of all proportion and has become completely unwieldy. The Minister for Finance, who can be very pleasant when he likes&mdash;and I am not sure that he was not humbugging when he said this&mdash;said in the course of his reply that the Civil Service was slow, but that the Ministry of Finance was there to hasten things.  I took occasion to say to him that I thought the Ministry of Finance was a brake rather than an accelerator and anybody with the slightest experience of it knows that that is so. In the nature of things, the Ministry of Finance is a bottle-neck and it is beyond human capacity and beyond human knowledge that there should be a chief establishment officer in the Department of Finance who understands all the Departments.  It simply could not be.</P>
    <P>Again I could give simple examples without going into the affairs of the Department of Supplies or the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Department of Education decides, for its own purpose, that examinations will be conducted by certain types of persons.  Having done that, the Department of Finance fixes all the points about remuneration.  They fix this kind of thing&mdash;it does not affect me, I hasten to add&mdash;that a university examiner will get £5 for setting the first paper, less for setting the second paper, and, if he is to set four papers, he will get £10.  That is to say that somebody in the Department regards the setting of examination papers as being the same as punching eyelet holes and that the fourth is easier to punch than the first.  It may, in fact, be much harder, but that is one simple example.</P>
    <P>In other words, when policy has been decided on by one Department, the Department of Finance steps in to arrange all the details, so that the results will, possibly, be quite different from those contemplated by that Department.</P>
    <P>Anybody who was ever in the office of an establishment officer in the Department of Finance, and looked at <Col N="1314" /> all the files surrounding the unfortunate individual, will realise that he could not, possibly, get all the work done.  How is it done?  It is done in the old, traditional way.  Traditions have a habit of not being evaded. When a Department wants six clerical officers, it asks for 12 and is offered three.  That is the first reaction.  I want to assure the House that the Civil Service is staffed exactly on the same principles as those on which a farmer sells his cow at a fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, at any rate, native and traditional, but it is much more cumbersome and causes much greater delay than is the case when a man sells his cow at a fair.  The man brings his cow into the fair to-day; he sells it to-day; he gets his money to-day and he goes home; but the head of a Department writes on 1st January that he wants 12 clerical officers, knowing that he has no chance in the world of getting them.  He is first told that he does not want any and, then, after some argument, he is told he can have three.  After further delay, he gets four, and, if he is resolute, he gets six.  I should like to put it to the House that I do not believe that anybody knows exactly how many clerical officers he ought to get, although the Minister said there was a perfect scheme for doing that.  I should like to differ from the Minister&mdash;I do not think there is any scheme for doing it.</P>
      <P>Exactly the same thing occurs sometimes on questions of promotion and increases of pay.  A sum of £100 is asked for in respect of a particular officer.  The Department of Finance says that the man should not get anything and they yield by saying that he can get £25.  Eventually, he gets £50, not because he deserved £50&mdash;he may not deserve anything, in fact&mdash;but because the head of his Department was strong enough in this titanic struggle with the Department of Finance to get £50 out of them.  There is no rational method that I ever encountered in my experience of discovering what a particular individual ought to get.  It is done on a process of bargaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> I do not want to be understood as decrying what the Department of Finance do.  They have a very difficult job and they have this answer to what I am saying&mdash;and it is a good answer so far as it goes&mdash;that every Department's goose is a swan.  Anyone who wants promotion for a man in his Department describes him as marvellous. The Department of Finance takes the reverse view and regards all the swans as geese.  Neither view is correct.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for the Department of Finance to be all-knowing and all-pervading. They could not possibly be.  They could not possibly be experts on what is going to happen in the Museum, or on whether a book for the Parliamentary Library is or is not a suitable book for a Parliamentary Library.  I have seen that discussed at some length with the Department of Finance.  They cannot be experts on everything and the present system makes every single thing flow into the Department of Finance and come out of it extremely slowly, with very bad results.  It is not possible to maintain exactly that kind of control over an ever-growing Civil Service&mdash;a Civil Service which is growing not only in numbers, but in functions&mdash;and they cannot possibly work satisfactorily. They accomplish a great many small economies.  I was told recently that if you agree to do a broadcast for twenty minutes for a certain figure and if, in fact, you stop after eighteen minutes, the two minutes will be taken off your fee and one-tenth of it deducted, and that that happened in the case of people playing a concerto which was to last for thirty minutes and which lasted only twenty-seven minutes.  One-tenth of the fee was promptly docked.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That kind of thing is done constantly. Talking of pre-war conditions, if an Army officer wanted to get an <Col N="1316" /> allowance for a private car, he made application to his own branch, then to the Quarter Master General, then to the Chief of Staff, then to the Minister, and next to the finance section of the Department of Defence, after which the Department of Finance had to &ldquo;O.K.&rdquo; all, and through all these channels there filtered back to the individual making the application, a query devised by a young man in the Department of Finance who deals with that kind of thing.  If he does not find a precedent, then he has to know all about it.  That was all very fine in a particular scheme of organisation but I suggest that it is not working satisfactorily now.  Anything that was never done before is outside their scope.</P>
    <P>As to recruitment to the Civil Service, it was a marvellous business for us in this country when the British proceeded to have open competitive examinations for a considerable number of their civil servants.  In this country, at the present time, the Civil Service is able to get the very best products of our secondary schools.  It is very remarkable that, in the British days, it was possible to get into the Civil Service from the primary schools. That is no longer possible.  I am not speaking now with regard to particular Governments.  That has not been possible for many a long year.  I tried to arrange for it and I was a complete failure.  I could not do it.</P>
    <P>We get in excellent material from secondary schools at examinations for clerical officers and junior executive officers.  It is an open question, and worthy of consideration, whether a merely written examination, producing a particular result with people numbered 1, 2 and 3, is the very best way of getting the best candidates.  It is still more open to question whether, when they get in, the best possible use is made of them.</P>
    <P>I have met in the first year at the University students, boys or girls who did extremely well in the Leaving Certificate, went for the Junior Executive and got a high place.  Such a person leaves the University some time about Easter and goes into <Col N="1317" /> the Civil Service.  According to the Civil Service regulations, nobody can attend University lectures in the morning.  That regulation was made when I was Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and I pride myself that it was evaded in the case of members of the staff here with satisfactory results for the State and even for the Department of Finance.  It often struck me in such cases that it would be better to give these people a place in the Civil Service, to let them go on and finish their University course, and then either go into the Civil Service as executive officers with University degrees or compete for the administrative class, which is equal to the First Division.</P>
    <P>Another thing that one feels is that the Civil Service, particularly since the scope was narrowed in this country, should give the same opportunities as are given in other countries for refresher courses, and for training outside the State.  That has been resorted to in the case of certain specialised posts, such as posts in the Museum. It seems to me that, in a small country like this, it is open to argument and inquiry whether it would not be better to appoint certain people after the age of 21 or 22 years.  I remember that, in 1922, a difficulty was experienced in getting into the Civil Service satisfactory private secretaries, and the President of University College, Dublin, was asked to nominate three people of good academic standing, the kind of person who would go into the British First Division.  The three people nominated were engaged in particular professions, one being a barrister and another an assistant in Classics in University College.  They were taken in and have been highly successful.</P>
    <P>One is now our Consul-General in New York; one is in a very high place in the Department of Finance, the other is in a high position in the Department of Justice and is now the Civil Service officer in charge of censorship. I hope that will not be held against him.  Some scheme might be devised, more difficult and more complicated to work perhaps, but which would give better results than merely having competition, getting the result, <Col N="1318" /> and putting these persons into the Civil Service where, with few outside contacts, they spend the remainder of their lives.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service used to be a very leisurely institution.  It is by no means that since 1922.  I remember as a student meeting people who had the advantage of being clerks in the Courts of Justice.  I met one person at 2 o'clock one day and he said he was terribly busy and did not get off until 1.30, because two of the men in the office were ill.  He did three men's work, apparently, before 1.30.  There are no such men in the service now, and the stories that go about of men having high pay in such positions are in almost every instance false.  It seems to me that the difficulty in the Civil Service now is the reverse.  There is in the Civil Service quite a number of bottle-necks, but the higher official is overworked.  He has to sit at a desk surrounded by files, he has to deal with telephones, with interviews, with a superior or a Minister, and can enjoy no leisure.  Above all, he has no opportunity of doing any thinking about his job.  That is a matter of experience.  I feel that&mdash;it may not be a popular thing to suggest&mdash;the question might be investigated as to whether it would be possible to have some people at the top of the Civil Service who would be well paid and who would not be smothered by day-to-day work.  In the Department of Education, I am certain there is not a single individual who can go in and sit down at an empty desk and think of anything at all about the educational system.  Everybody is immersed in an immediate job and that immediate job takes up all his time. Some such people, for example, might devise a scheme whereby, in the case of industry and agriculture, production and distribution, that are mentioned here, instead of control by the Civil Service there might be more cooperation.</P>
    <P>With regard to Civil Service methods, I am, of course, well aware, as the Minister for Finance said, that the Civil Service is not a business, and the notion that if business men got control of the Civil Service they would make it hum and change it, is undoubtedly erroneous.  They would <Col N="1319" /> not do any such thing.  I understand that the British experience in the last war was that the business men who were brought in to run the Civil Service ran it at enormous expense. The Civil Service is not a business.  As the Minister for Finance very properly indicated, the fact that the Civil Service has to work for a Minister who is responsible to Parliament and who can be asked questions or challenged makes things slow and cautious.  But I am not so sure that one thing that slows up everything, namely, Parliamentary Questions in the Dáil, might not be very much altered.  There is a certain type of Parliamentary Question that might easily be relegated to a committee or might be dealt with in quite a different way from the present public method.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that every human being enjoys power; that the Civil Service has great power, and that the possession of power creates a desire for more power.  There is an attitude all over the world amongst civil servants, and I suppose here as well, that there is hardly any job they could not do better than the people who are doing it.  That is an illusion, of course.  The Minister's line in his speech was that everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds.  He took the line that the Civil Service is slow, that it is bound to be slow.</P>

      <P>I wish it were sure; I am not so sure that it is.  For example, a friend of mine once told me that he was applying to hire a garage that the Board of Works had to let.  I met him shortly afterwards and he said to me: &ldquo;Those fellows in the Board of Works think they are letting Saorstát Eireann whole and entire to me instead of an ordinary common or garden garage.&rdquo;  The way in which the Board of Works wanted to let him the garage, the number of forms to be filled, and the number of guarantees that a well-known Dublin business man was to give for a 20/- per week garage annoyed him so much that he said they could keep their garage <Col N="1320" /> and, in three months afterwards, he got it for 5/- per week less and gave no guarantees at all.  That is the kind of thing that is happening every day in connection with supplies and matters of that kind that I do not want to go into.  The Minister's line was that the Civil Service was slow, that it was increasing in numbers, increasing in cost, increasing in functions, and that that process was bound to go on, and the Minister felt that there could be no remedy for that as long as Parliament lasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If our system cannot adapt itself to changing conditions, this Parliamentary system is bound to go.  One of the reasons that it has gone, or is going, in certain places, is that it failed to adapt itself to changing conditions. The Minister is against an inquiry at present.  Surely the present, when people's minds are open to all kinds of change, when we have a kind of melting period, would be the best time to have this kind of inquiry.  For these reasons I suggest that an inquiry should be held, that it should be held now before the war ends, that it should be held by people who have experience of this Civil Service and of another Civil Service, and, if possible, by business men who have been in contact with public life&mdash;not by business men who have been in contact with the Civil Service&mdash;and who, as business men, are capable of contrasting methods.  I am tempted to add, although it is not in the motion, that another great bottle-neck, the Department of Local Government, might also be investigated.  I do not know whether it is realised that we have created county managers and city managers; that they are now in the position, practically speaking, of being civil servants, and that every single thing they do, such as the appointment of a temporary nurse or the appointment of a temporary draftsman, has to go to the Department of Local Government for sanction.  The Department of Local Government stands to the local bodies exactly as the Department of Finance to the other Departments of the State, with, of course, the exception and the difference that the local bodies have not got the same access to the Department of Local Government <Col N="1321" /> as the ordinary civil servant has to the Department of Finance.  But these two bottle-necks are immense clogs upon any kind of progress.  A certain amount of economy may be effected by them, but it is doubtful whether you would not get more economy by getting a better machine and throwing more responsibility upon the people below.  For these reasons I support the motion and I think, in spite of the difficulties of the present situation, that it is when people's minds are open to change that an inquiry ought to take place.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service, undoubtedly, is the victim of a lot of inaccurate and unfair criticism.  There may be some ground for some of the charges brought against it, but, on the whole, I think it gives good service. This country did not invent red tape.  It was invented in another country and the delays and the annoying methods of the Civil Service in holding up business are just as common across the Channel as here. There has been a little book published under the title, &ldquo;Passed to you, please,&rdquo; which, I believe, is a skit on the English Civil Service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it describes the annoying delays in English administration for which civil servants are responsible.  There is another charge brought against the Civil Service in this country and I believe the English Civil Service, that it has undue power and that Ministers are practically pawns in the hands of the higher officials in the service.  There is an anecdote told in connection with the English Civil Service when a change of Government was pending some years ago.  Somebody said to one of the high Treasury officials: &ldquo;You fellows had better look out.  There is a certain Government coming into power and you will have to mind your P's and Q's.&rdquo;  The official replied: &ldquo;It does not matter what Government gets in, whether Conservative, <Col N="1322" /> Liberal or Labour, we are the Government.&rdquo; That mentality is also said to actuate the Civil Service here.  Personally I do not believe it does.  But when a man wants anything done by any Government Department and there is any undue delay about it, it is always said: &ldquo;These Civil Service fellows are holding it up and will not allow it to be done.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There may be a case for a general overhaul, but somehow these commissions of inquiry do not appear to get anywhere.  You appoint commissions of inquiry to go into all sorts of matters, but somehow the result does not lead to anything.  There should be some other method of discovering a means of rectifying these matters rather than a commission of inquiry, which may take months and months to go into a matter, amass a pile of evidence, and then the thing is set aside and left there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I have often criticised them, I believe the higher officials of the Civil Service are overworked. Many of them have told me that they have often to bring work home with them from the office and often work until midnight in order to complete work they have on hands, that their working day does not end at 5 o'clock in the evening but very often only begins then.  The heads of Departments have to be experts.  They have to know more about government than a Minister knows.  They have to know all the details of government and have to be thoroughly conversant with everything connected with their Departments. Very often, a Minister coming into power has to learn from them.  It is not to be expected that a Minister of any Government on taking charge of a Department could be as conversant with the work of that Department as men who have been working in it for years.  That does not happen in any country.  You may get an extraordinary expert on finance, like Sir Josiah Stamp, in England, or men of that type.  If they were put in charge of finance, they might make a terrible mess of it. They might be first-class men in the outside world but, when it came to dealing with the work of a Government <Col N="1323" /> Department, they might be completely at sea.  There was an agitation in England a few years ago for a businessmen's Government.  The people who fostered it claimed that no man should run the Department of Justice but a lawyer, that no man should be First Lord of the Admiralty but a sailor, and so on.  Very often, the sailor and the lawyer might not be competent to run these particular Departments.  It requires a certain type of mind, certain mental alertness, to be able to manage such Departments and very often men in these professions would not be proper men for the job.  On the question as to whether or not the problem could be solved by establishing a commission, somehow I have no faith at all in commissions.  We have had so many commissions to inquire into all sorts of subjects whose findings are gathering dust in Government offices that I am afraid a commission is not the best way to solve the difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very difficult as well as a very important problem.  I was glad to see the line that Senator Goulding took on it and to know from the tone of his speech that it is possible to have it debated in a reasonable way.  As a member of one commission which is at present sitting and whose findings are likely to have a rather important bearing on this whole question, I do not know that I am prepared to agree with what he says as to the uselessness of commissions. The usefulness, or otherwise, of commissions depends entirely on the quality of the work they do and the reports they prepare.  It is rather sweeping to condemn all commissions out of hand and to say that the method of considering such a subject as this through a commission is a hopeless method.  The question is: what is a good method of considering it?  What is the alternative to setting up some sort of commission of inquiry through which the whole matter can be gone into thoroughly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt at all that, both inside and outside the Oireachtas, there is a very considerable amount of <Col N="1324" /> uneasiness about the growth and methods of the Civil Service.  I entirely agree with Senator Hayes that it would be altogether wrong to condemn the Civil Service as we have it or its members.  It is not their fault that the system is what it is.  It was not made by them and they are only operating what has been handed down to them.  If we have defects in our Civil Service system, if there are bottle-necks of the type to which Senator Hayes referred and if the public at large is uneasy about, for instance, the growth of the Civil Service, the real fault lies, not with the Civil Service at all but with Parliament and with the Government.  It is the job of Parliament to watch over these things, to frame some line of action with regard to them and to take care that no part of its executive machinery gets out of gear, or, if it does get out of gear, remains out of gear for an appreciable period.</P>
    <P>There can be no more important work for Parliament to do, it seems to me, than that, and one way of dealing with this question would be to appoint a Parliamentary committee, a committee of experienced Members of Parliament, drawn from all Parties and including among them, not merely people who had experience of government, but people who had experience of business and various aspects of public life.  That is one way in which the matter could be discussed and dealt with and I would be fairly confident that, if we had a good Parliamentary committee like that, we would be likely to get good results from it.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, there has been a good deal of comment and discussion in England lately on this subject.  We have all seen in the Press recently that a complete overhaul of the English Foreign Office is contemplated.  The work which has led to that suggestion for overhaul has been done in the middle of the most terrible war in which England has ever been engaged. If it is possible for the British, with the responsibilities and the difficulties they have on their shoulders at the present moment, to consider questions like that, why should it be beyond our capacity to do the same thing?  It is <Col N="1325" /> not only the Foreign Office that has been examined and in whose working improvements have been suggested; some time during the past year, a Committee of the House of Commons&mdash;I think it was&mdash;made very important suggestions with regard to the Civil Service as a whole.  One suggestion, for instance, is that there should be a staff college established for the better training of actual, serving members of the Civil Service and another suggestion is that the titular permanent head of the Civil Service should not be an official of the Treasury.  These were, of course, simply suggestions but, within the last week, I think, the First Lord of the Treasury has promised to set up a committee to investigate the recruitment, organisation and conditions of work in the Civil Service in England.</P>
    <P>If England can do a thing like that, especially in present circumstances, why should not we be able to do it? There are several reasons why we should always be carrying out some inquiry of this kind, why we should always have this subject uppermost in our minds as members of the Legislature. One is, as Senator Hayes pointed out, that the system which we have inherited is a foreign system.  It was originally created in this country by a foreign Power.  We took it over and kept it on as a going concern and, ever since we took it over, we have been more or less&mdash;if the word is not offensive&mdash;tinkering with it.  We have been making small changes here and there, adding bits and taking away bits, altering a certain number of trifles, but we have not made any fundamental change in the whole structure of the Civil Service.  It is highly questionable whether a country like ours, a small, comparatively poor country, can either afford to have a Civil Service of that kind at all, from the financial point of view, or can indefinitely continue with a political system which produces that kind of Civil Service.</P>
    <P>That leads me to another aspect of the matter which, to me&mdash;perhaps I am over-imaginative &mdash; is extremely serious; that is, the indefinite growth in the numbers of the Civil Service.  It seems to be accepted as a sort of inevitable <Col N="1326" /> thing that the Civil Service shall go on increasing steadily from year to year, and that no such thing can be contemplated as a time or a means by which a stop can be put to the growth of it.  It is a simple enough calculation that if that process goes on inevitably for a certain number of years more, the majority of the people of Ireland will be members of the Civil Service.  It could happen in a not very long time, with the enormous increase in the rate of growth that has taken place lately.  Sooner or later, if the whole thing is not to become entirely top heavy, it will produce some kind of revolution as a means of getting rid of it.  We will have to devise a scheme by which the system can be overhauled, especially if the tendency to perpetual growth is to be checked.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons, of course, for the growth of the Civil Service has been the emergency, but there is a much more fundamental reason than that.  It is, as Senator Hayes has pointed out, the continual development of State activity in all possible directions. There is hardly a week that we have not, in the Seanad, some fresh example of a sphere of activity into which the State, for one reason or another, very often for quite plausible and temporarily good reasons, sees fit to intrude.  Everywhere the State goes, the Civil Service has to go. There have to be increases in the Civil Service to meet this and that new problem, and all the time, as has been very forcibly pointed out, it is highly questionable whether, at the very centre of the whole thing, the machinery is adequate or is capable of functioning properly as it stands.</P>
    <P>One of the principal defects, to my mind&mdash;I have often said this before&mdash; in the whole system is the way in which the working of the Civil Service, as a whole, is dominated by the Department of Finance or, if you like, by the twin Departments&mdash;Finance and Local Government.  It is quite true, as Senator Hayes has said, that the Department of Local Government exercises the same functions in its sphere that the Department of Finance does in a whole host of other spheres.  The assumption that <Col N="1327" /> underlies the whole system is that the Department of Finance, for some reason, is gifted with an amount of insight and knowledge into all kinds of administrative problems that is not possessed by the people who are actually closely concerned with those problems: that, for instance, the Department of Finance possesses officials who know more about the details of education than, say, the officers of the Department of Education.  When I speak about education in that respect, I know what I am talking about, because I have often discussed this question of the work of the Department of Education with officials of the Department of Finance.  I have found that they consider that they have greater authority, in many ways, on subjects related to the work of education than the officials who are in the Department of Education have.  The result of that idea is that everything the Department of Education tries to do is held up.  As a further result of that, it seems to me&mdash;I think it is thoroughly true of the Department of Education &mdash;that you have a kind of atrophy developing in these other Departments.</P>
    <P>After a long experience, when a very able and highly placed official finds that his real function in the scheme is to be a cog in the wheel of the Department of Finance, he loses interest in his own work, and gradually gets assimilated into the finance machine.  He ceases to be as productive on his own subject as he ought to be, and originally was. It is true to say that, at the present time, the Civil Service is gathering up into itself the best brains in Ireland.  There is no doubt that the very best young men and women we have are getting into the Civil Service year after year.  They are being taken in and treated almost as biological specimens.  They are being sterilised, and the life is being knocked out of them.  They are being rendered incapable of producing any good work on their own responsibility.  I know some young civil servants who feel the effect of that atrophy and sterilisation in their work.  Very often they are put <Col N="1328" /> on work for which they have no taste. They are not allowed, so far as it can possibly be prevented, to have any outside interests whatever&mdash;very few, in any case.  The very idea that they might continue the education in which they made such progress is entirely frowned upon.  They are regarded as cogs in the machine once they get in and the life is gradually squeezed out of them.  There is no denying that, as the system stands, it may be very difficult to deal with it or find a remedy for it, but some remedy will have to be found before the whole thing breaks down.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes deprecated going into fundamental questions like the question of the relation between the Civil Service and Parliament, or the tendency that exists at present for the State to spread into more and more activities.  I think that, when this thing is inquired into, if it is inquired into, fundamentally, these wider questions will have to be taken account of. I think the reason for all this development is that the State is usurping, more and more, functions that ought to be performed by other organs in society.  As we are at present, we practically have the State&mdash;this is not confined to us; it is the universal experience&mdash;on the one hand and the individual on the other.  Society, as such, has very few organs that can stand up against the State, or that can exercise any real effect on the State.  You have the individual, as a citizen, with his vote, and you have the State.  There is very little in the way of an intermediary. The individual citizen, once he has fulfilled his function of voting and electing a Parliament, has very little say in what concerns, in the most intimate way, his own life.  I am thinking, in particular, of a Department like the Department of Education. I suggested here long ago that an advisory Council of Education would be of the greatest possible assistance and value.  As things stand, the Department of Education is so overgrown and has so very scattered and disparate functions that it is quite impossible for one individual to oversee them all and be an expert on them all.  Unless some body is set up which can represent the needs <Col N="1329" /> and desires of the public to the Department, things will go from bad to worse, the Department will become less and less representative of what the country wants and feels and, ultimately, if that state of affairs spreads to other Departments, the whole machine will break down altogether.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes said a good deal about education and it is not necessary for me to go into detail about it, but there are many aspects of education with which I happen to be fairly familiar and which will illustrate what I am saying.  The Senator spoke about the Museum.  Anyone who knows anything about the National Museum is aware that, in many ways, it is worse off than it was when the British were here.  There has been a certain amount of progress, it is true, but there has also been a great deal of retrogression.  In many ways, especially as regards its organisation and capacity to do valuable work for the community, the National Museum is hardly as good now as it was 25 or 30 years ago.  That is by no means the fault of the men who are closely associated with the work of the Museum. They have very high attainments and ability, but their capacity for doing good work is entirely frustrated and made entirely useless to the country by the system that exists, and particularly by the fact that such capacity is choked through the operations of the Department of Finance.  I am not pleading for a policy of extravagance in regard to institutions like the Museum.  There is no need of extravagance, but there is need to see, when money is being spent, that the people who will have the say in spending it know something about what it is being spent on.</P>
    <P>A great defect in the whole Civil Service system at the moment is that the final say does not lie with the experts. Although there are plenty of experts in various branches of the Civil Service, their work is frustrated in all sorts of ways, and one can see that most easily in an institution like the Museum.  The same thing applies, to a certain extent, to a new body like the Institute of Advanced Studies. I doubt whether that Institute can <Col N="1330" /> give the value it might have given to the country, for the very reason that its working is too much subject to the control of the Minister for Finance. An illustration of how it works came to light only a few weeks ago.  The professors in the Institute of Advanced Studies are men of great capacity and high standing, but it has been ordained in recent weeks that they are not to be allowed to act as extern examiners to the National University or to have any contact at all with it.</P>
    <P>The work of an extern examiner is very light, it would not take up any of their official time and it would be of considerable benefit, both to the men themselves and to the university, but, because of the pedantic character of the machinery in which they are caught up, they are not allowed to do any of that work&mdash;they are forbidden completely, are cut off and sealed up in a glass case.</P>
    <P>You will find that sort of thing all through the Department of Education and the Civil Service generally. That is regrettable, especially when it has to do with the cultural aspect of life in this country, questions like the cinema, the administration and control of the broadcasting service, and the whole attitude of the State towards the Fine Arts in general.  It is true&mdash; and no one can deny it&mdash;that we are very far behind the standard that has been reached in other countries, where they have a more efficient organisation to deal with these things.  No one will say it is in any way unfair to criticise our broadcasting system or the whole situation with regard to the cinema, because we are so badly equipped with the instruments for dealing with these questions.  The plea of economy is sometimes used to justify our position with regard to these things.  It is a great misfortune, after all the high hopes we had 25 or 30 years ago, about the way we would be able to do great things and get a great place for ourselves in the civilised world, once we had control of our own affairs, to find that, when we have control, we are reduced to a very low position, even amongst the smaller and poorer countries, <Col N="1331" /> and that our productions are of such a shoddy character.  The cause of all this is the organisation of the Civil Service, the way in which the Department of Finance has choked and checked every attempt to make progress in these respects.  To hope that you can do any good by private enterprise in these things is an entire chimera.  There is no use in thinking it can be done.  The State, or some organ of society given a status and power for the purpose, must deal with these things, as they certainly will not be dealt with and advanced by private individuals.</P>
    <P>Once the report of the Vocational Organisation Commission comes out, we shall be in possession of a survey of this whole question, which will throw a good deal of light on what we ought to do with regard to the organisation of the Department of Finance and especially on how we can equip ourselves with new organisations and new machinery, by which society itself, in various aspects of its activity, can do work that the State is either totally incapable of doing or is prevented from doing at the moment by the system of organisation with which it is endowed in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>The object of this motion, which ultimately is to discover what steps would be desirable to increase the usefulness of the Civil Service, is one with which we must all have sympathy, but, in my opinion, to ask for a commission of this kind would be singularly inopportune when the world as we know it is&mdash;in the expression in the old Irish Annals&mdash;&ldquo;a quaking sod under our feet&rdquo;.  We cannot avoid the tremors, and we do not know what kind of land we will stand on when it is all over.  In spite of the argument made by Senator Hayes, that this is a good time to take the steps suggested in the motion, I think it is very inopportune.  Senator Tierney spoke of the changes and new points of view that will be brought out in the report of the Vocational Organisation Commission.  We all expect that it will be very enlightening and that it will <Col N="1332" /> have a great influence on the structure of society.  Therefore, a commission that would sit, with the world as it is at present, with our country facing an emergency and with the imminence of the publication of that report, to set up a plan for a Civil Service that could work in a different kind of ordered society than we have at present, would be just a waste of time and labour.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I believe it is a good thing that a discussion like this should take place occasionally.  Every machine needs overhauling, and it is quite probable that the Civil Service is one of those machines which need adjustment, but we ought to remember that there are other ways than commissions&mdash;which are a very cumbersome method&mdash;to make those adjustments. The Seanad itself, perhaps, would have as much knowledge as the people who would be likely to be on the commission.  As Senator Tierney suggested, we could have a Parliamentary Committee to go into the question. If the commission suggested in the motion were set up, its members would be very largely drawn from the Seanad and the Dáil.  Senator Tierney made the point that England, which is a country engaged in the war, finds an opportunity to go into this question at the present time, but I would remind the Senator that England is a big country with 40,000,000 inhabitants.  A great many people in this country who would be valuable for such a commission, and who alone would have the experience and ability which would make the work of the commission worth while, are engaged in all kinds of very urgent work at the present moment.  Therefore, our case is not on a parallel with England at all.  I believe that the motion is inopportune, and for that reason if it is put to a vote I will vote against it.</P>

      <P>I feel that the Senator who put down this motion has done a good service in ventilating this question, but it is so immense that I do not see how any debate here can adequately cover the subject.  I feel that there has been considerable confusion of thought amongst some of the speakers as to what we are really aiming <Col N="1333" /> at.  From the speech of Senator Tierney, it appeared as if he wished this inquiry to range over the whole field of the machinery of government. That is rather an alarming prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, governments have got more complicated as they laid their hands on more activities which were previously done by private enterprise, and I do feel that, accordingly, you want a rather different mentality or outlook in higher civil servants.  With regard to the lower grades, I do not think that things need to be changed very much, but I do feel that, in the administrators, you want to get rather a different outlook.  How are you going to do that?  First of all, I feel it is essential that the men who have to handle the higher side of government should have a university education.  I do not know the divisions in this country, but I know the Oxford divisions. A man who took, say, a degree in what they call the modern greats or in economics or in history will not necessarily be a better civil servant than the man who took a degree in the classics. I am old-fashioned enough to believe that, in handling the affairs of life, the man who has had a good, sound education in what they call in Oxford the modern greats has very many advantages. I am anxious to see the higher civil servant a man of balance and judgment, a man of broad outlook, a man who has a general knowledge of the world and of the problems with which he is dealing.  The difficulty will be to try to harmonise and blend the academic, scholastic and graduate knowledge that he acquires at the university with the practical problems with which he has to deal.  I feel that, after he has been in the Civil Service some time, he should have an opportunity of getting into contact with business affairs.  There is a body called the Institute of Business Management. I do think that a civil servant would benefit very much by taking a course or having an insight into the problems with which a body like the Institute of Business Management has to deal.  It is now being recognised that, although managers are to a large extent gifted, there are certain rules and principles of management and organisation, and <Col N="1334" /> if they are violated&mdash;I hope on another occasion to show how certain essential principles are being grossly violated in this country&mdash;you never can get efficiency.</P>
    <P>I feel, therefore, that, over and above a trained mind, an honours university degree, the civil servant should have a practical knowledge of business management on the one hand; then I feel that he should have knowledge of the world.  I feel that civil servants live a life too far apart from the ordinary people.  They get into an office, with files, and do not know how the ordinary people respond to what they are doing.  For that reason I should like to give the civil servant a sabbatical year, to get him right out of the Civil Service and let him travel.  Let him choose what he is going to study in his sabbatical year, and get him right away from the files and the narrow office routine. That, I feel, is a positive approach to a very big problem, because I do not feel that a lot of those problems that are covered by the machinery of government are so much the problems of the civil servant as the problems of the Minister and the people.  The people have asked for all these things to be done, and the civil servant is only putting into operation, making practical what the people, through their Ministers, through the democratic machine, have asked for.  I think the civil servant has to be an especially well trained, educated and wise person, because he has the most difficult job of all; he has to educate his Minister.  Nobody will deny that persons find their way into politics with very little knowledge of business, very little training.  They have been able to persuade the people that they will give them salvation and deliverance, and when they come into office with those ideas they find that there are numbers of practical difficulties in carrying their wishes into effect. The civil servant has to do his best to operate those theories.  He has to be a man of tact.  Naturally, he has to show his Minister that a lot of what he fondly hoped when he was on the hustings making an appeal to the people, cannot be done in practice <Col N="1335" /> without complete chaos and dislocation. I want to emphasise that we should try to improve the training, education and outlook of the higher civil servants.  We should have men of broad outlook, who are able to co-ordinate technicians, and take the long view of every problem If we could do that, we would be taking a great step forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I like this motion.  Take this word &ldquo;usefulness&rdquo; in the motion.  How does one judge whether a thing is useful or not?  If you get a pencil sharpener and try to sweep the carpet with it, it is completely useless.  Before you can say whether or not a thing is useful, you want to know what it is you require to do.  The motion asks that the Government be requested to appoint a commission to inquire into and make recommendations as to what steps are desirable to increase the usefulness of the Civil Service to the community as a whole.  There have been complaints about the growth of the Civil Service.  Do we want it bigger or what do we want it to do?  What I object to is that the Government is doing far too much.  First of all, take what you think will be useful and then you have got to think what you want the Civil Service to do.  The discussion here this evening has completely, or very largely, overlooked the fact that there is a Government and that there is a Parliament.  Senator Tierney spoke about the National Museum and he said that it was rather starved financially.  I should like to point out that the Minister decides to put forward a certain estimate of cost for each service and the Dáil decides whether or not it will vote it.  There is no need to bother about the Civil Service in that connection.  If the weakness of the National Museum is due to lack of funds then it is a matter for Government and for Parliament and not for the Civil Service.  If Parliament votes a certain amount for a given Department or for a given subhead under a Department Vote, strictly speaking, legally no more than that may be spent.  The Civil Service is acting under a Minister and that <Col N="1336" /> Minister is a member of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>You can, of course, ridicule anything if you are so inclined and the Civil Service is often subjected to ridicule. I have listened here to <i>ex parte</i> statements to make it look ridiculous.  The Civil Service is growing because the Government is taking more and more into its own hands and has been arrogating to itself business that is, strictly speaking, not the Government's business at all.  I admit that in times of war, practically every Government is a totalitarian Government.  Senator Tierney referred to what was proposed in England with regard to the Foreign Office and the proposed staff college for civil servants.  He asked if England could do that, now when she is at war, why should we not be able to do it, as if it were a desirable thing.  As a matter of fact, it is done because England is at war.  When a country is at war it has to placate and flatter the least responsible sections of the community in order to secure their cooperation in the war.  You do not have to do that for people with a sense of responsibility.  They are prepared to take their burdens and to make sacrifices for the common good.</P>
      <P>As I read the papers, the proposals about the Foreign Office arise from the fact that there is a certain envy operating in regard to it.  There has been a certain tradition created by the humorous papers that officials of the Foreign Office are members of selected families and that because they belong to a certain class they are necessarily inept and stupid.  Certain people in England are playing up to that by talking about a new system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal for a staff college is based on the same feeling to my mind. During a war, as I say, every Government is a totalitarian Government.  A large section in politics want to have totalitarianism then although normally they would be the first to cry out against it.  It does seem that when the war is on opportunity is taken to utilise circumstances which are peculiar to a war period to make permanent certain institutions created by the war. All the proposed talk about a staff college to train technical civil servants <Col N="1337" /> aims at assisting the movement towards enabling the State to take over every human activity.  It does seem to me, therefore, that instead of our wondering that that should be proposed in England during the war, it would be a matter of wonderment if it were not proposed.</P>
    <P>The commission which it is proposed to set up as a result of this motion is also to inquire into what steps are desirable to increase the usefulness of the Civil Service to the community as a whole, but, first of all, you have got to make up your minds as to what is useful.  I think you may say that what some people would regard as most useful might appear to others as most harmful.  I think the most harmful feature of the Civil Service is that it has to interfere in so many spheres in which it should not interfere.  The next part of the motion suggests that in the opinion of the Seanad the terms of reference to the commission should include an inquiry into the methods of recruitment and promotion in the Civil Service.  I would exclude that.  As to methods of recruitment, I do not quite know why that is included in the motion.  Any person at the head of a Department must decide as to whether A or B should be promoted.  There are only two ways in which promotion can be carried out.</P>
    <P>You can have a mechanical system whereby you say a man will be elevated according to seniority or priority or according to his success in examinations.  Otherwise, the man who is responsible for the work must choose or must exercise his personal judgment as to who is most suitable for promotion. You have to decide whether promotion is to be carried according to either of these methods or whether it is to be carried out by the man responsible for getting the work done.  If you say &ldquo;You must promote A or B&rdquo;, and if you still reserve the right to criticise the man responsible in the Department, it seems to me unjust.</P>
    <P>The motion further suggests that the proposed commission should inquire into the relations of the Service with outside organisations, especially with those which deal with production or distribution.  I admit that during a <Col N="1338" /> time of emergency it is natural that the State, because the whole existence of society which it has organised is in jeopardy, should overflow and outpass the natural limitations and boundaries of its activity.  In this country that has happened already and not during a period of a world war.  We had a carefully selected emergency thrust upon us in 1933 by the acts of our own Government and an enormous amount of legislation and State activity were sought to be justified on the grounds of the crisis created and precipitated by our own Government.  We entered into a sphere of enormous tariffs.  Now the moment you have a policy of enormous tariffs, a new situation and a new danger confront the Civil Service.  Traditionally, the activity of the Civil Service is almost confined to the various branches of the Service.</P>
    <P>It functions only within its own Department although some Departments collect taxes from people outside.  But the moment a system is created, such as we had here before the present emergency, you certainly have a new situation.  You have the possibility of making a man's fortune by giving an enormous tariff on some particular item that he is manufacturing or proposes to manufacture.  You have the power to issue licences, and the getting of a licence or the refusal of it may make all the difference between fortune and ruin for certain people. There was a new situation there which might have called for an inquiry, but at the present moment I do not think that you need any such inquiry.  You have a Minister in charge of a Department. If you are dissatisfied with anything that is being done or with the whole policy of that Department, it is the Minister who is responsible.</P>
    <P>We are told these terrible stories about the Department of Finance, but it is not the Department of Finance that is responsible; it is the Executive Council.  This discussion has rather irritated me, though I admit it is a purely personal irritation.  In 1922, when this State came into existence, a number of people put forward the most scandalous propositions for consideration by the Government.  Time and again I was annoyed by the assumption <Col N="1339" /> that all sorts of wonderful national things could be done if only our national Ministers had their way, but that behind them, surrounding them or controlling them, was an organised gang of civil servants, bitterly anti-Irish and trying to fight England's battle over again.  There was that very nice charitable attempt to take from us our responsibility.  I felt it was our duty at that time to tell the people that if there was anything wrong in the matter of government, it was the members of the Government who were responsible and not anything that would justify these cowardly attacks on civil servants that took place at that time.</P>
    <P>The Ministers are responsible and, over the Ministers, the Dáil and the Seanad are responsible.  If you want more money spent upon the National Museum, Parliament can vote it.  If more money should be spent upon the National Museum, there is one person guilty, and that is the Minister, in that he has not brought forward any proposal in his Estimates.  I should like to have an inquiry into the Civil Service to decide what its work is to be.  At present there appears to be nothing that is not civil servants' work.  Even before the present war, if there were certain things you wanted, you had to ask the Irish factory purporting to make those goods if they would supply them.  To my own knowledge, if you wrote for a certain type of thing you got an arrogant letter from the factory saying you could not have what would suit your requirements; you must have an inferior or a different type of commodity, made by them.  You then had the right to appeal for permission to import what you wanted on the ground that it was not obtainable here.  Your request for a licence to import on the ground that what you wanted was not obtainable here was sent to the very interested party, who had already informed you that you must accept something you did not want, because that was what they could produce. You had this peculiar system whereby a business man was incorporated into the Civil Service.  He could refuse you the licence, because it was his advice <Col N="1340" /> that was acted upon as to whether or not you could import what you required. By refusing you a licence, he would force you to buy from his factory what did not suit your purpose, but what suited him to give you.</P>
    <P>I have been irritated by this discussion because it has so misrepresented things.  The Department of Finance exercises control, but, if the Executive Council does not like that control, it can be withdrawn.  Senator Hayes referred to certain things which should have been done, but which the Department of Finance stepped in to stop. When a Minister wants to do something, he can ask the civil servants for advice, and they should advise him, but, not in a way to flatter him, and to assure him that what he wants to do is the right thing; they can advise him frankly as to what is the best thing to do.  If his judgment disagrees with theirs, he may find that what he wants to do will require the sanction of the Executive Council.  He can go to his colleagues on the Executive Council and, if they refuse sanction, then they and not the civil servants are to blame. He may find in the existing state of the law that he would not be justified in spending money for a given purpose. In that way he can go to Parliament and ask for a Vote and, if he fails to get it, then it is the Minister who is to blame and not the civil servants.</P>
    <P>We see that the work of the Civil Service is changing radically from what it was traditionally and the tendency towards some new system of recruitment, promotion and organisation in order that civil servants will do on an increasing scale the new type of work that they are doing at the moment.  I would be inclined to resist this, because I recognise that, in England and all over the world, the tendency is more and more for the State to take over every activity.  That is particularly so in this country and it is so in response to an unremitting clamour from outside.  The farmer who complains about warble fly inspectors annoying him will, in the next breath, be asking for a State subsidy for something in which he is interested.</P>
    <P>If you are to have the State subsidising, then the State must have control <Col N="1341" /> in relation to the things that are subsidised.  Everyone is denouncing State interference and everyone is wanting more and more from the State.  The State has to take the children to school, to teach them there and to feed them, to clothe them and to build houses for them to live in.  All responsibility is being taken off the family.  One speaker told us how everybody longed for power and how everybody, when that power was obtained, wanted more and more power.  I do not accept that.  The truth is that this aggression of the State, so universal at the moment, comes from a sense of impotence in people.  They want security and they want someone else to provide it, and the only thing they can think of is this abstraction, the State.  I want a smaller Civil Service, because I want less done.  I believe it will be much more useful the more you tend to make it smaller.  That is the problem, and that problem is not in the Civil Service but in the Ministers and in the Parliament of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>With a lot of what Senator Fitzgerald has said, I am in thorough agreement.  From time to time, we hear appeals for help and support from the Government and then, when the estimated expenditure is presented for consideration, there are complaints about the cost.  One would imagine, to hear some of the speakers this evening, that, if we had this commission of inquiry, we might, possibly, secure a Civil Service of supermen.  Can anyone imagine a Civil Service of supermen controlled by a Parliament such as we have?  Things are bad enough as it is, but, if we got better men, I am afraid we would have to get a much better type in the Parliament of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Tierney spoke, generally, on education and referred to the horrible way the Department of Finance is treating the Museum, the Institute of Advanced Studies, and so on.  He never mentioned the fact that there are 300 national schools condemned as unsuitable. I do not know whether the Department of Finance or the Civil Service is responsible in that connection. I put the responsibility entirely on the members of our Parliament, <Col N="1342" /> because they do not take sufficient interest to bring pressure on the Minister to ensure that the great mass of the school children will have suitable schools in which to be educated.  It is a terrible blot on our system that we have these unsuitable schools&mdash;a much greater blot than the fact that the mummies in the Museum are not being looked after.  Much has been said about the Museum and the terrible loss it is to society.  Think of the thousands of unfortunate children attending unsuitable national schools.  Which is the greater evil?  I suggest the little humans who are attending the unsuitable schools are more important to the nation, and they should get more attention.</P>
    <P>I think that Senator Mrs. Concannon was very proper in her remarks, to the effect that the motion is entirely untimely. This is certainly not the time to discuss a motion of this nature about the Civil Service.  Anyone who can visualise something along the lines of the Beveridge Report coming into operation in this country in the future will realise that that would mean a great extension of the Civil Service, and is there any other organisation in the country that is better fitted to deal with such a matter than the Civil Service? I doubt if there is.  Then, much as Senator Sir John Keane has said about businessmen and their ability to train our civil servants along business lines, I think we ought to ask ourselves what would be our predicament if we were running our country on business lines by businessmen.  It must be remembered that, mainly, a business is run for profit, and for the profit of a certain individual or individuals.  Do we want to have that happen in the case of our Civil Service?  I certainly do not want it, and I do not think it would be for the good of the country, generally.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House, but these are some of the ideas that occurred to me, and which were brought to my mind during the course of the debate.  I think we would be much more profitably employed in debating a motion to consider the possibility of setting up a committee or commission to deal with the economic and <Col N="1343" /> social situation as it presents itself now, with a view to advising the Government both with regard to the present emergency and the post-war position.  Then we might be able to fit into the scheme of that committee or commission the possibility of altering the Civil Service, because it might fit better into a new situation which would be more compatible with the conditions that will prevail after the war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much time left and I do not think it will be necessary for me to take up more than about ten minutes in replying. I think that, perhaps, the most remarkable thing about this debate is that it has produced agreement between Senators Fitzgerald and Foran. I might have known that if they did agree, I was certain to disagree with them, and I certainly do, so far as this matter is concerned.  The most notable &mdash;I shall not say the most remarkable&mdash;thing about the debate is that nobody, except Senator Michael Hayes, took the slightest notice of what I had said, and the last speaker showed that either he was not here when I was speaking or, at any rate, had not read what I said, because, if he had, he would have given his reasons as to why he disagreed with the point of view I put forward.  However, I should just like to say that, because Senator Foran considers that after the war there will have to be drastic changes, and because he holds that we ought to have&mdash;and in this I completely agree with him&mdash;something which would be a kind of Irish Beveridge Report, to deal with Irish problems and the considerable changes that will have to be faced, he thinks that that is a reason why we should go on with the old type of Civil Service and should not take time to deal with this problem now.  I hold exactly the opposite. It is because I agree with him about the changes which are inevitable, whether you like it or not, that I think some effort should be made to tackle the problem now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the peoples of the world are going to demand changes.  These <Col N="1344" /> changes probably, will not be as radical or drastic as some people think, but if the world is to progress and if the rights and privileges of people are to be recognised, it is inevitable that changes will occur.  Although I hate war and realise its evil, I also realise that war creates upheavals, and that out of these upheavals come changes, some of which are not good, but some of which are good.  There are good results as well as bad results from these upheavals.</P>
    <P>Now, the only person in the debate who dealt with the main points that were made by me, to any extent, was the Minister for Finance, and I should like to make one or two brief references to the attitude taken by him.  He, first of all, suggested that I was inclined to blame the Civil Service for what really was the action of the Government.  I want to make it clear that I was not blaming the Civil Service about anything. I was setting out certain things that were not perfectly satisfactory, and I said that I felt that since we were going to have to face very considerable changes in the future, this would be a good time to set up a small body&mdash;I do not care whether you call it a commission, a committee, or anything else, and I shall not follow Senator Fitzgerald in his remarks about the exact wording of the motion &mdash;to prepare for such changes.  Whether you like it or not, the Government&mdash; whether it be a one-Party Government, a national Government, or whatever you like to call it&mdash;cannot carry out the wishes of the people it represents except, to a very great extent, through the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I believe that we have in the Civil Service a surprisingly large amount of ability, working, in many respects, under antiquated rules and machinery.  I think that there is the danger with regard to the Civil Service, as in most businesses, and particularly the larger businesses, that you cannot see the wood for the trees inside.  Where you cannot get the reform from inside, even with the best will in the world, in such cases, the bringing in of fresh minds will lead very often to changes and improvements which could not be achieved&mdash;at <Col N="1345" /> any rate, in the same length of time&mdash; from inside.  The Minister for Finance said that the Civil Service is slow, must be slow, and will always be slow.  That may be correct, or it may not.  I cannot accept a statement of that kind, at any rate until I have done my best to see if the position can be remedied. We have at present&mdash;whether it is a matter of necessity or not may be arguable&mdash;a very considerable amount of Government control and inter-governmental negotiation on vital matters, such as trade, agriculture, supplies, and so on, which are not necessarily matters of individual profit, but rather of the carrying on of the business of the country and obtaining its necessary supplies.  I suggest that, at any rate, for some years after the war, the main supplies of the world will be in the control of a number of governments and that individual governments, will be under a considerable amount of international control.  In such circumstances, I do not think it is safe to allow this method of passing things on from the bottom to the top&mdash; taking perhaps two or three weeks before a decision can be made&mdash;to go on.  In the matter of supplies during a war, slowness often means loss.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that it is always the case, but where slowness means nothing being done, I would far rather see a responsible individual given the opportunity, as he would have in an ordinary business, of making the best decision that he could and getting something done, even if he made mistakes, and I think that anyone who listened to me or who read my speech would find that I would be in favour of some scheme of modifying the present system of Parliamentary Question and Answer&mdash;not that I would be in favour of its abolition&mdash; whereby a particular individual would be protected from blame in connection with any decisions he might make.  I think that the whole matter demands consideration and a certain amount of overhaul.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am not concerned about the exact wording of the resolution. I should like to see a small committee, commission, inquiry or whatever you like to call it, set up, <Col N="1346" /> which, unlike the last Brennan Commission, would hear evidence from outside as well as from inside as to the problems facing the Civil Service and which would show whether it is not possible to institute definite improvements. I think it is just as important to check over and to examine your Civil Service at least every ten years as it is to provide, as is provided in the Constitution, that the constituencies, and the number of voters in the constituencies, shall be overhauled. The voters' list is important and the representation is important, if you have democracy.  Why?  Simply in order that your Parliament will be as representative as possible.  But the representative character of your Parliament will fail unless you have a Government responsible to it, and that will fail unless you have the best Civil Service you can get, one which is responsible to the Ministers and which is carrying out what Ministers want in the best way.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that in most Departments of our Civil Service there are systems in vogue which have been in vogue for a very considerable time. I do not say they are bad&mdash;all I say is that they require investigation to see if they cannot be improved.  The idea that you cannot do it during a war, or at this particular time, is, I think, a mistake.  I do not attach much importance to what may or may not be done in England, but it is interesting that this whole question has been raised there and a committee of inquiry much on the lines I suggest was promised I think, last week, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The line of the criticism which has been made there, while in many respects rather different from the line I take, has a good deal in common with it.  That is not necessarily a guide to us, but I think Senator Concannon is completely wrong if she thinks that, during the war in England, there are a lot of suitable and important people whose time is not fully taken up and that here suitable and proper people are fully engaged.</P>

      <P>I take the opposite view.  I would say that the suitable people in England are fully occupied, while here you have quite a number of able and suitable people who are by no means fully occupied.  However, that is a matter in respect of which there can be a difference of opinion.</P>
      <P>One other matter&mdash;the question of financial control&mdash;was referred to today. I do not see how you can avoid financial control of Departments, but I have never been in favour of what is called in England &ldquo;Treasury control&rdquo;, which we took over from England. I was on the first Constitution Committee which gave this matter a considerable amount of attention.  We had two professors who addressed us at considerable length&mdash;one from the National University and one from Trinity College.  The professor from the National University believed that the British Treasury system was the best ever devised, with the greatest possible advantages, and was very strongly in favour of it, while the professor from Trinity College said it worked in England simply because there was a tradition, that it was inherently bad and that the French system of the Court of Accounts would be far better for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very much inclined to the view taken by the gentleman from Trinity College and I do not think that in a small State like this the system of Treasury control which we have at the moment works as it ought to work. That does not mean that we should not have financial control, but I do not think you want control by another Department of every detail, and it is this control of small details, as distinct from control of the total expenditure, which works badly.  If Parliament votes a certain sum of money for a Department, or for the mummies in the Museum, if you like, the amount must be restricted to the amount voted by Parliament, but the official in <Col N="1348" /> charge, to my mind, ought to have full power to make economies in one direction and to spend the saving in another direction.  At present, if he wants to spend half-a-crown outside the amount sanctioned, he has to get Treasury sanction.  If he continues to spend what has been voted, even though he knows there could be economies, it will not cause him any trouble.</P>
    <P>I was also chairman of the Post Office Commission and, in spite of what has been said about commissions, I think they can still do good, although our recommendations have not yet been fully accepted, but they may some day.  I, again, very definitely formed the opinion that detailed control by another Department of almost every item of expenditure is a bad system, but control of the larger items by the Department of Finance, which is looking for economies and, at the same time, seeing to it that the Parliamentary Vote is not exceeded, is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>There is a kind of irksomeness in the feeling that every single detail is being watched, and if anyone would care to read the book mentioned by Senator Goulding, <i>Passed to You, Please</i>, he will find extremely humorous, but, I have no doubt, perfectly true, illustrations of what may happen.  I am convinced that a useful purpose would be served by a committee of inquiry, sitting in private, though its evidence and report would be published, through which members of the public would get an opportunity of stating, knowing that they would be considered, the problems they feel exist and which have to be dealt with by the State at present and of ascertaining how best the Civil Service could help.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
