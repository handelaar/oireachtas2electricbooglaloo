    <Title>Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1942&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to amend Section 46 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931. The necessity for this Bill arises owing to a court decision on a point which was not covered in the Act.  It was a case where a lease was signed subsequently to a house having been erected on a building site.  The house was built in expectation of the lease being given but, owing to the fact that the lease was only signed after the house was erected, the court held that the point was not covered and consequently it was necessary to bring in this Bill. There is another case where a local authority in County Cork, a board of guardians, took a plot of land outside an urban area.  It was a pure building lease and the house was erected on the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An urban area is described as anything down to a village for the purposes of the 1931 Act.  This place was actually outside the village of Carrigtwohill and because of that was not covered by the Act.  That position is being provided for under this Bill. <Col N="1699" /> Where the lease is for a period of not less than 20 years, the benefit of the Act of 1931 is extended to non-urban areas.  Another point is being covered. It has happened that a person who got a building lease partly developed a plot of ground and for one reason or another was unable to continue the work.  A man may have built six houses where he was to build 12.  He developed half the site for the six houses.  The undeveloped portion of the plot would not be ancillary to any house on it, and as the Act stands at present, by reason of the fact that all the plot was not ancillary to the buildings on it, it is very doubtful if the lessee in such a case would have the benefit of the 1931 Act.</P>
    <P>There was one particular case brought to my notice, where a man got such a plot of land and had expended on it something up to £12,000 in building houses.  The whole site was not developed and he was going to lose the full benefits of the reversionary lease, as it is called, because he had not developed the whole site.  That is being provided for. We are coining a new expression in this Bill to deal with cases of that kind.  We are dividing such a lease as that into two parts, calling the part that has been developed the &ldquo;built-on&rdquo; lease and the other portion the &ldquo;vacant&rdquo; lease.  What would happen when the lease would expire would be that the lessee would be entitled to a reversionary lease in respect of the built-on portion; but the unbuilt-on portion&mdash;the &ldquo;vacant&rdquo; portion&mdash;even if there were a house on it, which may have been built before the lease was given, would be a matter for arrangement.  Take a case such as the case I am speaking of, where there may have been a very large plot of ground and a mansion built on it and that part of the plot was built on by the lessee and that the house may be on an undeveloped portion of the plot.  In this Bill now the lease for that portion is called the &ldquo;vacant&rdquo; lease.  As far as that part is concerned, it is a matter for arrangement between the landlord and the lessee when the lease expires, and they <Col N="1700" /> can make a new lease on terms mutually agreeable to them.  As far as the &ldquo;built-on&rdquo; portion is concerned, we are protecting the person who had the lease and who built the houses.</P>
    <P>There is another section to which I wish to draw attention.  When the Bill was going through the Dáil, it was pointed out that there were people who might be affected in another way.  In view of the court decision that the lessee had no rights in the case of a house built before the lease was granted, some people, believing that they had no further rights whatever, made other arrangements with the landlord, which were to their disadvantage. We are providing that, if the lease had fallen in since the 1931 Act was passed, and if no third party had acquired any rights in the meantime&mdash; that is, if the arrangement still was one between the landlord who granted the lease and the lessee&mdash;we would void any agreement that might have been made and give the lessee the benefit of the 1931 Act.</P>
    <P>Everyone will see that the sections are very cumbersome.  They are set out in detail and it is believed that the points I have raised are covered. I do not think that I need deal with these points more fully at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To begin with, I would assume that there was land which was to be built on by a contractor who, instead of owning the land freehold, merely leased it from the freeholder.  In doing that, he contracted to cover it with houses and to pay a certain annual rent.  I understand the proposal here is that the lease will be divided into two parts. In regard to the area that is covered and on which he has built, say, six houses, his rights and responsibility to pay ground rent would remain. With regard to the other half, what is the position?  Does he retain that, paying the rent that he originally agreed to pay, or is that cancelled and does the land go back to its original owner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When the lease falls in, he has no claim and it is a question of a new arrangement.  He is entitled to <Col N="1701" /> a new lease of the built-on portion but, as far as the other portion is concerned, it is a matter for arrangement. He cannot claim for the part that he had not developed and he has no rights there, but in respect of the other part he gets the full benefits of the 1931 Act, that is, the right to a reversionary lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a man who takes a rood of ground and builds a house on it, strictly speaking, the house belongs to the lessee.  There used to be cases where the landlord, who had already got an exorbitant rent for the land, claimed the house as well, and that seems to be inequitable. The risk behind this is that, if you have 100 acres and houses are going to be built on that land, those houses provide great security, because they are more valuable than the land and, therefore, the rent will be paid. In the case of someone taking ground for 12 houses and contracting to pay rent, the owner has the guarantee of the houses as security for the payment. Suppose someone takes 100 acres and builds two houses.  There the value of the land is much greater than the value of the property built on it.  What is the arrangement going to be there, if the lessee, who has built the houses during the period of that lease, fails to pay rent on the whole 100 acres?  Normally, the owner of the land has the security of the built-on part.  I judge from what the Minister said that the lease of the whole 100 acres remains&mdash; during the 99 years, or whatever it may be&mdash;but in that case the landlord has not the same asset available to him to guarantee the payment of the rent.  I give the case of 100 acres and two artisans' dwellings built on it.  What is the position if the man fails to pay?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has built those <Col N="1702" /> two houses and has sublet on proprietary leases to someone else, the sublessee has his rights as against the ground landlord and the lessee would lose his interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say that the lessee has spent £3,000 on building the houses.  He has no money at all.  He has to pay rent on some hundreds of acres and is unable to do it.  These two houses are certain assets of his,. as far as a man on a weekly or yearly tenancy is concerned.  I want to see how the law will work there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In such a case, if he does not keep his contract the landlord could bring him to court and he could be ejected.  I do not know about the houses: I think he would lose his houses altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we ought to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the lessee actually owned the houses himself, he would lose them; but if he had sublet to someone else, the person to whom he had sublet, if prepared to carry out the terms of his sublease, would be able to deal directly with the head landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not seem to be quite satisfactory.  I gave the case of 100 acres and two houses.  Now, the proportion may go much nearer than that.  There could be a position in which the yearly or weekly tenants may come out of the deal quite well, but the man who spent a substantial amount of money on building the houses may not come out well, and he may be in the position that he cannot even get the rent from his tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this Bill is genuine.  As far as I can see&mdash;and it is difficult to see far in a complicated measure of this kind&mdash;it is a satisfactory method of dealing with the difficulty.  I am not clear as to what the Minister calls the second amendment to the original Act, as I have not the details.  As far as I am concerned, I am in complete sympathy <Col N="1703" /> with the objects of the Bill.  In a complicated measure of this kind, particularly one that is full of legal phraseology, we are to a large extent dependent on the Minister and his advisers.  There are few, if any, lawyers in the House and I do not think there is an actual practising barrister. No one, except he is really in practice and knows what recent decisions have been, is really able to give what I might call a fully competent opinion as to how this will work.  But, even if we had two or three such barristers and the best Minister in the world&mdash;I am not running down this one, of whom I have a high opinion&mdash; I still recognise that in a measure of this kind we never know what we do pass until cases come before the courts.  That is peculiarly the case with regard to the landlord and tenant position more than anything else.  At the same time, I have done as much as any layman could do to understand what is intended in this Bill and I am in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that I misunderstood the Bill, but I am not at all clear that the point raised by Senator Fitzgerald has anything to do with this Bill at all. It seems to me that it is a criticism of the 1931 Act, if it be a criticism at all.  At the same time, as he mentioned it, I should like to point out that, in practice, the theoretic cases which he raised rarely if ever arise. If a man has, we will say, 100 acres, and has built two houses and pays an annual rental, which usually in a lease of that kind is relatively small, very much less than the actual value of the two houses, he will borrow on the value of the houses which he has before he will allow his rights to disappear.  I think if it got to the stage that the rights of his tenants were likely to be affected, the property would be sold up and somebody else would become the owner.  In fact, you do not ever get a case where a man, for the sake of £10, £20 or £30 ground rent, actually is able to seize houses.  But what you might get prior to the 1931 Act was a case where the lease had run out, and where, because of the value of the asset, you had a much larger and possibly <Col N="1704" /> unfair lease demanded.  That, I think, was the principal object of the 1931 Act, and it is to make that more watertight and more satisfactory that this Bill is introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult for a layman to follow the complications of these Acts, but one point has occurred to me.  Take the case mentioned by the Minister, where a man builds only half the number of houses he intends to build on a plot of land.  He has obtained a building lease, and he has failed to carry out his building programme&mdash;half the land is left unbuilt upon.  Is the lessor entitled to take possession of that land when the lessee fails to carry out the building programme? As a result of the war situation, many builders have failed to finish their programmes and have left land unbuilt upon.  Will the owner in these cases be entitled to take possession of the land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that in connection with a building lease a person does not necessarily contract or covenant to build a certain number of houses.  If a person gets a plot of land he can build on it unless there is a covenant that he must not build.  If he does undertake to build a certain number of houses and does not build them, then he has broken his covenant and he can be proceeded against and ejected.  The only people who are protected then are those to whom he may have given a sublease, not weekly or monthly tenants, but people who have given a valuable consideration. They are protected, but they will have to deal with the head landlord; that is where a covenant has been entered into.  I understand that in a lot of these building leases there is nothing laid down as to the number of houses to be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In a lot there is. Take the Pembroke estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In these cases they are entitled to recover and eject the person, <Col N="1705" /> but the sublessee is protected. That is the position.  As to the point that Senator Goulding raised, where a man had contracted to build a certain number of houses and was not able to do it, he can be held to his contract. We are not dealing with that at all. We are providing for the case where a person has partly developed the site in respect of which he had obtained a lease in which there was no prohibition against building.  A single house may be standing on one acre and, quite clearly, the whole acre may be ancillary to the house.  Whereas, if he made a road through the acre and parcelled it into three parts on one side of the road, building a house on each part, one-third would be ancillary to each house and the other half on the other side of the road might be a market garden, which would not be regarded as ancillary.  If one house had been built and the land had been laid out as a sort of pleasure ground, the whole acre would be ancillary.  If there is a covenant to build, that is enforceable as against the lessee.  The sublessee, who has paid money to the lessee, has his rights guaranteed by the 1931 Act.  He must, however, deal with the man who has got possession as a result of the breach of covenant by the first lessee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>If a lessee continues to pay rent for a whole plot, but is unable to complete the building contract as a result of the war situation, surely he should be safeguarded, if it is impossible to carry out the full terms of the lease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the point raised by Senator Goulding, if the Minister could provide for that in this Bill he would be doing justice to a certain section of the community.  For instance, a builder in the city may purchase an acre of ground from some <Col N="1706" /> person and may intend to build ten or 12 houses on that land.  Owing to the emergency he may only build seven or eight houses.  He may not be able to get the material and therefore may not be able to finish the proposed building scheme.  In my opinion, it would be only common justice that that man should get time until the emergency is over to conclude his programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I have anything more to say.  It is certainly a complicated matter, but I tried to make it as clear as I could. We are dealing with cases which have arisen.  What Senator Hayes has said is probably the fact, that if a person makes a contract of that kind he will surely provide for such contingencies or else it will be a queer sort of agreement. I have not heard of any such case where the land was taken over by the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts would recognise the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure they would. This Bill was very simple originally. There was only one single sheet dealing with two cases, one of which was decided in the courts and the other one which a local authority had asked us to deal with. They had actually taken a plot of land for the specific purpose of building a dispensary and then they found that, because it was outside an urban area, they could not get what they were looking for.  Then other cases came up which I considered were worthy of consideration.  There was the one I spoke about where the land was partly built upon.  A man bought <Col N="1707" /> this plot somewhere outside Carlow. There was a mansion on it.  I do not know how many acres, but there was rather a considerable amount of land involved.  There was no covenant against building.  He decided to develop, and had gone a certain distance when he died.  I understand he had spent something like £12,000 in building. It was quite clear that, although the land may have been held to be ancillary to the one large house, it could not be considered as being ancillary to the number of houses that had been built, but each plot attached to a house was ancillary to it.  Consequently we have arranged that that particular part would get the benefit of the 1931 Act, and in regard to the other part it would be open to whatever arrangement might be made between landlord and lessee when the lease expired.  Other cases may arise from time to time, and they will have to be dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to amend an Act of the <Col N="1708" /> Irish Parliament dealing with pawnbrokers. The Act of 1788 provided for the appointment of four auctioneers for the sale of unredeemed pawnbrokers' pledges in the City of Dublin.  The Act provided that each of the auctioneers should be assigned to one of the four divisions into which the city was divided at that time, and prohibited any auctioneer from having his auction room outside the division to which he was assigned.  It was discovered recently, however, that for at least 70 years one of the auctioneers has had his auction rooms outside his division. A case was taken in the courts, but it was dropped.  I thought it was only fair when approached by these people, seeing that we were taking nothing from anyone else, to confirm them in what they had been doing for so many years. That is simply what this Bill does. There was a suggestion in the other House that we were taking something from other auctioneers.  That is not so.  We are simply allowing something to continue that had been the practice for 70 years&mdash;allowing them to sell outside their own division.  I am told, as a matter of fact, it would be difficult to trace the actual divisions into which the city was divided at that time. During the course of the debate in the other House&mdash;which did not take very long&mdash;I was asked would I agree to the appointment of a select committee to consider the whole question.  I said I would be prepared to do that.  It will be necessary some time or other to overhaul the whole thing, but it will take some time before it can be got under way, and this is merely an interim Bill to provide that what has been going on for years may be continued.</P>

      <P>I understand that it is considered that the time is now ripe for overhauling the old Act of 1788, and I think there is a danger here of some of the corporation officials, possibly, losing by this transaction. There were four pawnbrokers' sales-shops in the city.  Two of them were under the control of the Dublin Corporation officials.  The City Marshal has something to do with one of these pawnbrokers' auction rooms.  The danger now is that the pawnbrokers <Col N="1709" /> may turn their whole business over to the favoured auction rooms and leave the other auction rooms vacant.  The Minister has stated that an opinion was expressed in the other House that there was a necessity for a revision of the old Act.  If so, could not this matter be dealt with in connection with the revision of the old Act, if a revision is thought desirable?  I do not believe any Senator or the Minister would desire to injure any citizen, but the argument is put forward that that may happen, that some of the old pawnbroking auction rooms may be left derelict while the favoured ones get all the business.  That is the point I wish to make.</P>

      <P>I think there is a good deal in what Senator Healy has said. The City Marshal's position is a sinecure and I believe his remuneration comes from this source.  He controls at least one of the auction rooms and has a good deal to say in the disposal of unredeemed pledges.  It is a fairly important matter to take away that privilege and to confer it on some other person.  I think we ought to hear more from the Minister about this.  It has been suggested that there is a good deal of favouritism and privilege behind this move.  Some people are concerned as to why it is felt desirable to change a practice which has gone on for so many years, while it is admitted that the whole system of pawnbroking and the disposal of unredeemed pledges should be inquired into.  I do not propose to go into it, but I do know that there are some very grave abuses behind the unredeemed pledges.  I understand this is a comparatively new premises in Capel Street.</P>

      <P>Surely the position is that a number of people who follow a particular trade, the trade of pawnbroking, in this city, found themselves hampered by an Act of 1788, and it is not that there is a change being made in the practice, but that the Minister, in his anxiety to be entirely lawful, is legalising something which took place over a period of 80 years, in contravention of an Act of the old Irish Parliament, passed in the year 1788. So that, instead of doing something new, the Minister is following a tradition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>He is making it legal now to do something which was permitted but which was really in all probability against the law.  In other words, certain people have acquired by prescription a right which the Minister is now conferring upon them by passing a positive Act in their favour. There is one other thing that strikes me about this, that is, the question of privilege.  Surely people should have a right to choose their own auctioneer to sell their own goods.  I do not profess to be an authority on pawnbroking but I did make some inquiries into this matter and into the system generally and I do not know that there is any ground for saying that the pawnbrokers as a body are people who commit grave abuses or that there are grave abuses in their system.  Their system is, I understand, very minutely laid down.  What they can do and what they cannot do is very carefully stated and they operate under very considerable restrictions.  There may be necessity to inquire into this particular old Act and considerable improvements may be possible in the whole scheme but I do not think that we should discuss the matter on the basis that pawnbroking as a business is something which is riddled with abuses and that it needs the same kind of inquiry, for example, as was necessary in regard to certain forms of moneylending, which undoubtedly were subject to abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> It seems to me that this Bill does a right and proper thing&mdash;a thing which we should do.  I should regret if, as Senator Healy says, some individual is injured as a result.  The Minister might, perhaps, assure us that there is no authority at all for saying that we are introducing something new in this Bill.  What we are doing is clinging to something which is at least 80 years old.  If there has to be an inquiry, that inquiry is not necessitated by the existence of grave abuses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the principle of making legal something which has been the practice for a considerable time, and which the responsible Minister can see no reason for changing, is a good one.  Where we discover certain old Acts which have fallen into disuse, I think that the proper course is to set the law right by the simple process of introducing a Bill.  It is a bad thing to continue a practice once it has been discovered to be illegal.  I think that the Minister has taken the right course in introducing this Bill.  I should have been glad if somebody had explained exactly what Senator Foran and, perhaps, Senator Healy were driving at.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how the continuance of a practice which has been going on for 80 years can affect a sinecure which somebody has enjoyed unless that person is over 80 years of age.  If the pawnbrokers have been using only one auction room, in the erroneous belief that they were forced by some Act to use only that auction room, and they consider that this Bill changes the law to a greater extent than is intended or that some kind of hare is being started, then it might be wise for the Minister to look into the matter, so that he will not find himself in another difficulty.  When we had a similar Bill before the House recently Senator after Senator rose to explain the experience they had on both sides of the bar.  In this case, we seem to be rather handicapped.</P>

The Bill deals almost entirely with pawnbrokers but, in parenthesis, in the Title, we have the words &ldquo;Divisional Auctioneers.&rdquo;  Apparently, this Bill has been introduced at the request of some private individual or private interests.  Since the Minister can find time to accede to the request of such private individuals or private interests, I think he should find time to deal with matters of public interest.

If private interests can succeed in getting matters of importance to them brought before the Oireachtas, I want to urge that, in the public interest, certain reforms are necessary in connection with a matter referred to in the Bill&mdash;the question of auctioneering.  I think I am within my right in drawing attention to the fact that there are other phases of the auctioneering business which require attention.  I do not know whether the present administration will continue to carry on or not, but, in the public interest, certain matters ought to be attended to in connection with the auctioneering business.  There are certain abuses in connection with auctioneering&mdash;matters in which the public is very much interested, and in respect of which the public is, to a <Col N="1713" /> large extent, swindled.  I think I am entitled to refer to that aspect of auctioneering, and to say that, if the Minister can find time to introduce a Liquor Bill, which was not demanded, and various other Bills, his Department ought to go into the question of the abuses that take place in connection with auctioneering.  The position at present is that a man can come from God knows where, set up as an auctioneer in the city and swindle the public.</P>

      <P>Regarding the question of public interest, if the public interest had not been concerned, I would not have moved in this matter.  I have been given to understand that a very poor section of the public, particularly in Dublin, is very much affected by the operation of this pawnbroking business. It was because of that that I listened to the representations which were made to me.  I confess that I had a different idea of the pawnbroking business until I heard the pawnbrokers' side of the case.  I am inclined to think now that they are really a benefit to those people.  I was unaware of the extent to which they serve them. I was so much impressed by their case that I told them that, when the strike finished, I would consider doing as they requested me.  We are, in this Bill, giving the pawnbrokers the right &mdash;a right which they have exercised up to the present&mdash;to choose between any of four auctioneers, two of whom are corporation officials.  We are taking nothing whatever from the corporation officials.  If the pawnbrokers wish to go to the corporation officials, there is nothing in this Bill to prevent them.</P>

      <P>If a person has goods to sell, he should not be compelled to go to one person to sell them for him. He should have some choice.  If there were any point in Senator Foran's case, it would be in the direction of compelling the pawnbrokers to go to a particular auctioneer.  I think that would be altogether wrong.  If this were something new, if somebody were being brought in who had not exercised this right for years, it would be quite a different matter.  I am not sure whether the practice which has obtained was illegal or not, but I am told that if an attempt were made to trace the city boundaries of the time, great difficulty would be found.  The case has not been proved.  The matter was brought to the court, but it was dropped, and it is, so to speak, hanging over these people who want to have the position cleared up.</P>
      <P>One of the members of the other House said that he did not see why any auctioneer should not be allowed to sell these pledges.  Why four people should have this privilege is a matter which can be inquired into.  If certain privileges were being taken from them, they would be losing something, but when we are merely continuing what has existed for years, I see no injustice whatever in it.  Whatever privileges these corporation officials were entitled to, they are still entitled to.  They are entitled to sell all the pledges of the pawnbrokers in the city if they wish to send them to them, but if they do not wish to send them to them, I do not see why we should force them to do so.  With regard to Senator Conlon's point, if the Senator wishes, he could put down a motion, but it has nothing to do with this Bill.  I must say, however, that he did it very well. There is nothing contentious in the Bill and I suggest that the House might give all stages now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to extend for a further period of two and a half years the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940. The Act of 1940 granted a remission of rates only in respect of such buildings as were completed prior to 30th September, 1942.  The Bill proposes to extend that measure so that the remission obtainable will be obtainable in respect of buildings completed prior to 31st March, 1945.  It is important in that connection to understand that the remission granted under the 1940 Act was intended to apply only to residences which had not secured a remission or a grant under any other Act, that is to say, under the Housing Acts, or the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  On reconsideration of the terms of the principal measure, it appeared that there was some possibility that one measure would overlap the other.  Accordingly, Section 2 (1) (b) of this measure provides for a redefinition of the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; in such a form as will preclude the overlapping which it was thought might be held by the courts to exist.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear, however, that this re-definition has not retrospective effect, in so far as there may be in existence some building&mdash;we in the Department do not, in fact, know of any&mdash; which has secured a remission under the Act of 1940, and which was, at the same time, entitled to a grant, remission, or some other concession to induce building under some other Act. This precautionary reservation is introduced into Section 2 so as to ensure that where some concession has been granted mistakenly under the Act of 1940, that concession will still continue to subsist and will not be rendered null and void.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all welcome this Bill.  There is very little to be said on a Bill of the kind, but there is just one point I should like to clear up.  I take it that the Bill does not deprive any person of any of the concessions granted under the previous Housing Acts, 1932 to 1940, but there are buildings in rural areas which are entitled to a remission of rates for seven years, and entitled also to a grant under the Housing Acts, while those building houses in urban areas are entitled to a remission of rates for five years, but not to a grant.</P>
      <P>The Government are often accused of being generous to the people of the towns at the expense of the people in the rural areas, but in this case the position is reversed, and the rural population are getting a concession, in the way of a grant and an extension of the period of remission, which is not granted to the people in the towns. As the present Housing Act expires on 31st March, that is, to-day, I should like to avail of the opportunity to urge the Minister, when introducing the annual extension of that Act, to include grants for those who may erect houses in urban areas in which they propose to reside.  Cases may occur of people undertaking to erect such houses, and I think they should be given every encouragement.  I urge the Minister to make grants available in such cases.</P>

      <P>I presume there will be no objection to this Bill.  Unquestionably, housing operations in the city have been to a great extent held up owing to shortage of supplies.  These houses, if completed and built, would in the ordinary course be entitled to a remission of rates, so that there could scarcely be any objection to passing this Bill, which will do justice to people who have made ready to go on with the building of houses, but who could not complete them because of the emergency.</P>

This Bill, in fact, only deals with the residences which have not been built under the Housing Acts or under b<Col N="1717" /> the Gaeltacht (Housing) Acts.  It applies to residences which, for one reason or another, say, because their floor area exceeded that which was prescribed in the Housing Acts, would not get a grant in any event, so that the only inducement for the building of such residences was the inducement of getting a remission of two-thirds of the rates for a period of five years.  So far as the houses built under the Housing Acts are concerned, of course, they do get a remission of rates, whether built by private people or by public utility societies, and in their case there is no change either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad requests the Government to set up a commission to inquire into and make recommendations upon the matter of hospital finance generally; and, more particularly, upon the relations between the voluntary hospitals and the State, with a view to the establishment of the organisation best suited to the efficient operation of the whole hospital system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time past I have felt that a motion of this kind was overdue, and I felt it especially <Col N="1718" /> when we were discussing the St. Laurence's Hospital Bill.  A number of questions arose there which really raised a wider issue than that which the Bill itself covered, and although, through your indulgence, Sir, we were allowed to discuss certain things that may not have come within the scope of that Bill, I felt that I could not deal with a number of matters, within the scope of that Bill, in a properly comprehensive way.  Accordingly, I have drawn up this motion in general terms &mdash;terms which appear to me to admit of the widest possible discussion of hospital finance and policy.  I need hardly say that if the Government were to accept the principles involved, it would be necessary to consider, in much closer detail, of course, the terms of reference that would go before any commission that may be appointed.</P>
    <P>Now, my reason for feeling that an inquiry, on the lines of the motion, is necessary, suggests that I should refer very briefly to the background of this whole hospital question.  Up to the time that the Sweepstakes were established, a certain practice had grown up as a result of experience.  We had the old traditional system of voluntary hospitals, arising out of the necessities of the poor, and which were intended, mainly, by their charitable founders, to give treatment to the poorer classes of the people.  As a result of that system, over a large number of years, you had hospitals founded which were supported, in the main, by voluntary subscriptions.  Certain hospitals, such as the group with which we dealt in the recent Bill, were financed, mainly, by State funds.  Then, as time went on, the needs of the sick poor were not adequately covered by the voluntary system, and, going back to the early days of the poor law system, you had the dispensaries and other services provided by local authorities. As I say, the whole hospital service developed, more or less, on those lines, until the Sweepstakes came along; and the Sweepstakes came along largely because the source of voluntary contributions proved to be inadequate for the services required.  Certain hospitals were getting into financial difficulties owing to increased expenses <Col N="1719" /> and declining subscriptions, and it was felt that some other form of assistance should come to their aid, and, as you all know, the Sweepstakes came into existence.</P>
    <P>Now, in the early days, the Sweepstakes were a comparatively modest affair, but they grew to such an extent that it became necessary to regulate the new position that they brought about.  I quite agree that it would have been quite impossible to allow the, if I might call it so, unseemly scramble that took place among certain hospitals in the beginning of the Sweepstakes to get funds and spend them as they thought fit, whereas other hospitals were excluded.  The result was that the whole thing became almost a national problem, and I quite agree that the State or some other authority had to step in and regulate and control the distribution of these considerable sums of money that had, somewhat unexpectedly, and rather surprisingly, come in.  A committee was set up, therefore, to deal with that matter, but I say that the present system is only an improvisation brought about by some exceptional needs resulting from the advent of these Sweepstakes funds.</P>
    <P>The present system is in the nature only of an improvisation; it never has had in view the wider needs of hospital treatment and medical services for all classes of the community.  That is a much bigger problem, which I feel, in preparation for post-war conditions, now falls due for comprehensive examination. Those of us who feel that inquiry is necessary have to ask ourselves: is the present system of control&mdash;brought about, as I have said, largely by the Sweeps&mdash;satisfactory?  If it is a regulated and co-ordinated system, capable of meeting the needs of the future and the new conditions we will have to face, well and good; I would then be the last person to ask that it should be changed.  But, personally, I have grave doubts&mdash;many people with whom I have discussed the matter also have doubts&mdash;that the present system is best suited to the very important work that lies ahead, to the new conditions that we are likely to have to face, and to the general <Col N="1720" /> desire to provide better services for the sick among all grades of our community, not merely the very poor, who cannot afford to pay, but those of small means who can afford to pay a little, and those of larger means who can afford to pay a good deal more.</P>
    <P>The system at present&mdash;I am speaking mainly in regard to general hospitals&mdash;is in this form: you have in existence the old hospitals under the voluntary system, a number of them teaching hospitals under their own peculiar regulations, some attached to universities, and, which is only right and proper, all with their own special characteristics arising out of their origin.  Then you have, as a result of the control that became necessary when the Sweeps money came on the scene, a body called the Hospitals Commission.  That body is not an executive body.  It is an advisory body; I think I am right in saying it is merely there to advise the Minister as to the needs of existing hospitals, mainly with regard to the distribution of the Sweepstake funds.  I should be the last person to suggest in any way that that body has not done very admirable work.  One has only to look at their reports to see the vast amount of information they have collected, in many cases the very valuable suggestions they have made, and the enormous industry shown by the large volume of statistics they have compiled, but we realise that that body has no responsibility to anyone except to the Minister in an advisory capacity. As I said, it is not an executive body, but it is one that imposes an element of worry, and, I would suggest, a certain element of delay in reaching final decisions which are the responsibility of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like at this stage to make certain references to the publications of that commission.  We have a series of reports dating from 1933-34.  In the course of a rather detailed inquiry I was met by certain not very important but puzzling features.  I am a little bit puzzled because, in respect of the forwarding and acknowledging of the reports, I am met by the Irish language. Elsewhere in the reports I am dealing with my own tongue, but in <Col N="1721" /> regard to the forwarding and acknowledging of them I am a little bit puzzled as to the exact particulars.  I notice that the 1933-34 report was forwarded without date, and it was acknowledged in Eanair, 1936&mdash;I do not know what that month is&mdash;by the Minister's Department.  The next report I come to is for the year 1935-36. It was forwarded in Deire Foghmhair, 1937.  Again, I do not know what that month is.  You will note that it was forwarded in the year following the report, and it was acknowledged in the same year.  Both those letters were dated.  Then we come to the year 1937.  The report was forwarded in Meitheamh, 1938.  Now, here is a curious thing; it was forwarded in 1938, and was acknowledged in a Ministerial letter without a date.  It is rather strange to find an undated letter issuing from a Government Department. Then we come to the report for the year 1938.  It was forwarded&mdash; here I am almost sure I have correctly translated the name of the month&mdash;in July, 1939; it is given here as &ldquo;Iul, 1939.&rdquo;  Again, it is acknowledged without a date, so for two years in succession we have an undated acknowledgment. It is a small matter, but it is puzzling.</P>
    <P>After that, we have no more reports; the last report is for the year 1938.  I would ask the Minister to tell us why, after having had consecutive reports covering a period of five years, each forwarded within the year following the period with which it dealt, we then have a complete blank for a period of four years, four years during which important work must have been done by the hospitals?  It is a great handicap to anybody who wants to discuss hospital policy to be without those valuable reports for four years.  On the St. Laurence's Hospital Bill, I asked the Minister why this was so, and he rather expressed surprise that it had been so.  In any case, he said he would inquire into it.  Presumably, that was the first time he knew that there had been this long delay in publishing these reports.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make invidious <Col N="1722" /> comparisons, but it does seem strange that some Government Departments are much quicker than others.  For instance, we already have the report of the Land Commission with reference to last year's activities.  We also have the report of the Electricity Supply Board, a very complicated organisation covering a vast field of commercial activity.  We get that report with extraordinary regularity and punctuality.  In the case of this commission, there has been no report for some years.  I cannot help feeling doubtful that the commission is entirely responsible for this delay. This commission, for five years, presented its reports punctually, and then suddenly in 1938 it dried up and has remained dried up ever since.  I think we are entitled to a full explanation of the delay.</P>
    <P>When you examine these commission reports, you find an extraordinary volume of statistics.  I welcome statistics, but I always like to be satisfied as to the purpose they serve.  Statistics collected merely for the sake of collecting them, and which do not appear to be capable of much use, are, to my mind, an unnecessary waste of time and money.  I doubt the value of some of the statistics contained in the large volume covered by some of these reports.  For instance, you have, in relation to the general hospitals, a segregation of expenditure under a number of headings, such as provisions, surgery, domestic, miscellaneous, and so on.  You have then in relation to the total number of occupied beds, covering two or three pages, and in relation also to the total number of beds available.  I am not an expert in hospital management or control, but I fail to see how anybody, however expert and however closely concerned in hospital control, would require such a large volume of statistics set out separately both for occupied and for available beds.  We might like to know the total number of occupied and available beds, and we might like information as to the degree of occupancy&mdash;that is all separately set out&mdash;but why there should be so many statistics under other headings, puzzles me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" /> I also question whether, when certain information is not given, very much value can be got from these statistics. For instance, looking at surgery and dispensary, I notice in the case of two hospitals, the Adelaide and the Drumcondra, that no figures are available.  I can understand that the Adelaide, not being associated with the Sweepstakes, does not consider itself under an obligation to present any figures, but the fact that there are no figures does make a serious gap in any investigation.  I come now to an extraordinary discrepancy.  In one hospital I see that the cost per occupied bed is £16; the lowest is £14, and the highest is £41.  I feel that cannot be so in reality, and that there must be some rational underlying explanation of a discrepancy of almost £30 in regard to an occupied bed.  There is no explanation given for that, however, and, in the absence of any explanation&mdash;looking merely at the bald figures&mdash;I doubt if such a large volume of statistics is really worth all the trouble taken in its compilation.</P>
    <P>I pass on to the appendices, the statistics of illness, and I am interested to find there a new feature in our Government publications.  I find three languages&mdash;rather a hopeful sort of international outlook.  I notice the omission of Irish as a heading&mdash;I do not know that that matters very much. We have English, French and German headings for these various categories of illness.  Perhaps they may be valuable for foreigners studying hospital statistics; it might be interesting for foreigners to notice the incidence of disease in Kerry County or in Cork City, but I question whether the whole thing is of any practical value.  I am rather driven to this conclusion, and I say so with all due regard to the valuable work that the Hospitals Commission has done, that I am afraid it is a body that is growing into merely a statistics-collecting body and, to a certain extent, these statistics are drawn up merely to justify existence, without regard to need.  I do not feel that the work this body is doing is worth the money that must be spent upon it&mdash;I do not mean all the work, but I do <Col N="1724" /> mean the minute statistical work&mdash;and I cannot escape the feeling that that body is, to a certain extent, collecting this large volume of figures merely to justify its existence.</P>
    <P>One thing I should like to refer to in relation to statistics is the total absence of any costings.  I find&mdash;and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me&mdash;that the only statistics that are of any use for the purpose of control are statistics got out on a unit-costing basis.  There is nothing of that kind being done.  I know there has been difficulty about it, but I feel that over the period of eight or nine years some attempt might have been made to give some figures which would carry confidence as showing the true costings.</P>
    <P>On the question of finance, speaking in round figures, up to the year of this last report, 1938, the hospitals had received a total of approximately £13,000,000 from the Sweepstakes.  At the present date, approximately £8,000,000 remains as a fund under the control of a vesting body, the Hospitals Trust.  The titles in these cases are rather misleading, but I am referring now to the body having control of the investments.</P>

      <P>£8,000,000 remains and the hospitals have had the balance between them.  Over £1,000,000 has gone to the rate-aided hospitals&mdash;the county hospitals&mdash;and, roughly, the remainder has gone to the general hospitals. That capital sum of £8,000,000 is, as far as can be seen, required to finance the present growing deficits of the general hospitals.  Perhaps £1,000,000 of it may be free, but the remainder of that £8,000,000 is earmarked to meet those growing deficits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> I would ask the House to bear in mind that, in its first report, the Hospitals Commission recommended, among other things, an increase of 600 beds in the bed accommodation of the Dublin general hospitals.  There were other recommendations in the report regarding rebuilding, amalgamations, and some other things that I need not go into at present.  There was, however, this substantial recommendation, based, I am sure, on inquiry, that the general hospitals in Dublin required 600 additional beds. That was in the year 1933.  If the census figures are any guide.  I imagine that the need for additional beds has grown in the meantime.  In spite of the fact that the sum of £13,000,000 has come into the hospitals' system from the Sweepstakes, how many beds, do Senators think, have been provided in the Dublin general hospitals?  The large number of 25 beds over a period of nine years.  That is the number, although the sum available was £13,000,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary may be able to explain it, but, on the face of it, it will take some explaining. I know, of course, that the hospitals have benefited in other directions, that nurses' homes have been substantially improved, and that certain necessary equipment has been provided; but, even so, I feel that the need of additional accommodation to the extent of 600 beds should, over this period of nine years, have been met to a greater extent out of that large sum of money.  The nominal addition of 25 beds is, surely, not adequate, looking at the thing by and large.</P>
    <P>Other big recommendations made by the commission have, I suggest, been equally sterile.  As far as an outsider can see, no progress has been made as regards amalgamations.  No doubt, discussions on the matter have taken place between the Government and the hospitals concerned, but we are still awaiting the necessary legislation to make amalgamation possible.  Finance is now very largely dried up, so one must feel that the possibility of amalgamation taking place is becoming more remote.  Finance, or no finance, we feel that it has taken an unduly long time&mdash;whoever the parties concerned <Col N="1726" /> may be&mdash;to produce the necessary preliminaries for any effective scheme of amalgamation.  The reason why I ask the House to say that this matter needs inquiry is because the evidence seems to show&mdash;I have given, I think, satisfactory indications in that direction&mdash;that the present organisation is not the one which is best suited to the needs of an efficient and progressive hospital system.  The delays that take place in getting decisions are notorious.  Hospitals get letters from the Hospitals Commission, letters which, no doubt, are courteous in their terms, calling attention to their growing expenditure and asking for economies.  Everybody knows that expenditure is growing.  How can it be otherwise in the present emergency, and with the increased cost of living? They also get letters in almost similar terms from the Minister's Department, many of which are produced in duplicate. They are almost in the nature of circulars with perhaps a little paragraph at the end dealing with the needs of a particular hospital.  The complaint is that on some small matter on which a business man would expect a reasonably prompt reply&mdash;it may be just a demand for sanction for some comparatively small expenditure&mdash;the delays that occur are unending.</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary will hardly attempt to deny that there are very long delays.  There was one&mdash; I do not say that it may not have been exceptional&mdash;brought forward in the Dáil.  It related to the site for the new Cork Street hospital.  No doubt, there had to be some inquiry in that case.  I do not know who is to blame, but these delays seem to be endless.  I think anyone familiar with the day-to-day work of hospitals will agree that, when a thing must be done sooner or later, the delays that take place in getting sanction are excessive.  From all that I draw the conclusion that the present organisation is not the one best suited to modern needs.</P>
    <P>The underlying reason for this motion is the belief that, on the whole, there is a much wider outlook needed on the future of hospital policy and finance.  At present, with regard to finance, the position is really baffling. <Col N="1727" /> The Hospitals Commission was set up, and large schemes were forecast, based on a continuance of the Sweepstakes income.  The funds have been greatly reduced, but the schemes are still there in people's minds.  What is going to happen, and what view have the Government about what is going to be done, if the Sweepstakes are not revived, or if they are just revived on a more modest scale? I feel that, in the main, some of the reforms suggested, such as building and amalgamation, are not merely not luxuries necessitated by the large amount of the Sweepstakes income, but are needed.  Whether the Sweepstakes are revived or not, they are necessary, in the public interest.  That is a matter that, I think, should be examined: where the money which is to finance them is to come from if the Sweepstakes are not revived.  Personally, I feel it is the duty of the State to find the money.  That is only my own personal view.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter, however, that should be done without inquiry.  I feel that the need is so great, and the demands for better hospital services so pressing, that the money should be found by the State, the State, in turn, taking a lien on future sweepstakes. If that income is not there, then, in the last resort, the cost should be borne by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Then, for a large number of other things, a long-term examination is required in the light of better things promised in the new world.  A multitude of things is required.  There is the question of the medical treatment of persons of moderate means.  There is a distinct need at present for some better service, or rather for one at a more moderate cost to people in the £500-£600 group who become ill.  They are prepared to pay something more than for the treatment accorded on the same lines to the very poor.  They certainly cannot pay for expensive nursing homes.  The problem of reasonably priced treatment for such people requires examination.  Then there is the question of the interaction of hospital services with, possibly, compulsory insurance in future, if we get <Col N="1728" /> anything on the lines of the compulsory insurance outlined in the Beveridge Plan.  I think the interaction of hospital policy, in relation to compulsory insurance, is a matter that should be thoroughly considered, even at present, when there are considerations of a less wide character in question.  There is also the question of specialisation in certain diseases by certain hospitals.  I hope that Senator Rowlette will follow me and, for that reason, I want to be very careful to explain that I am not, as a layman, in any way suggesting matters outside my province for the medical services.  I know those who feel that hospitals, in the light of modern science, should specialise in some diseases.  I think Senators will agree that it is very desirable that tuberculosis cases should not be dealt with in the present general hospitals, and mixed up with other diseases which are not in their nature infectious.</P>
    <P>There is also the important question of the out-patient services.  The present condition of out-patient services in Dublin could be described as little short of chaotic.  The free dispensary service is notoriously unable with the large flood of out-patients, not having the equipments, the space or the staffs. These out-patients, according to the way they feel, get the best treatment in any hospital they deem fit to attend. But I do not know that there is any attempt to regulate the inflow of out-patients or the diseases from which they suffer.  Certainly control of the whole out-patient service is overdue for examination.  In connection with that I should like to mention that out-patient costs, according to figures given in the Hospitals Commission Report, are the costs per occupied bed. The total is got by including the costs of out-patients' beds, figures which vitiate any conclusion.  An attempt should be made before now to segregate costs of out-patients in statistics that are to be of any value.</P>
    <P>There is another very large question which I suggest is not satisfactorily dealt with now, that of how to blend the existing voluntary system with a growing measure of State control. We must now realise that a time <Col N="1729" /> has been reached when the voluntary system cannot remain with all its former features.  We have to accept the fact that voluntary subscriptions have practically dried up, and that it is desirable in many ways to consider an inevitable measure of State control. I do not think the Minister, responsible as he is for a Department, liable as he is to political influence, and affected as he must be by popular feeling in the manner of his decision, is the best person to administer long-term hospital schemes.  When we started the Electricity Supply Board it was deliberately organised to be free largely from political control.  I cannot help feeling that a commission examining this matter would try to seek some solution along the lines of that service, amongst bodies representing the medical services, the voluntary hospitals, and perhaps a preponderating measure of State control, so that there should be one executive body entrusted with the administration of funds and to control hospital policy. That is my own personal view of the future.  It can only be decided after full inquiry by a commission which would hear evidence and have all the necessary authority.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the future of the convalescence services. Everybody will agree that the convalescence side of the treatment of disease is largely undeveloped and needs great expansion.  That is a matter that would have to come within the purview of any inquiry. There is also the question of business management.  Experience in other countries has shown, and gradually in a small way it is beginning to be felt here, that an increasing degree of business methods will be needed in future to control hospital management.  I am only attempting to picture the large field that would have to be covered by any commission that could take a satisfactory long term outlook.  Incidentally, I might mention the question of pensions for nurses.  The nursing service is one that needs inquiry and treatment.  There is the basis of my case, that the present organisation has grown up in the nature of an improvisation due to the advent of the Sweeps. If the Sweeps had never come I suggest <Col N="1730" /> we would have had the present organisation.  The question should be approached now on a much wider and more comprehensive basis.  I believe that the present organisation is not satisfactory, and is not fitted to meet the needs of the future, as well as to plan a long term view for the hospitals, and for that reason I ask the House to support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been interested in the motion that Senator Keane has brought before us and in the manner in which he has brought it.  His motion demands an inquiry into the present system but it leads up to an argument in favour of greatly increased State control.  There are many of the remarks and criticisms that he has made with which I am in entire agreement and there are some with which I am not quite in agreement.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senator altogether in his reference to the need for managing the hospitals on more strict business principles than those on which they are managed at present&mdash;that is, in regard to their financial administration. Many people who manage hospitals are business men who give their time voluntarily and generously&mdash;and many of them give their money also&mdash; to keep the hospitals going.  But they sometimes look on business management as if it were a matter of collecting money from patients.  In many cases, such patients cannot contribute for the treatment they receive and it has been a fundamental principle of the voluntary hospitals up to the present&mdash;a principle which I should be sorry to see disappear&mdash;that they depend on charity and that they do their work largely out of charity.  I quite agree with Senator Keane that modern development renders it necessary to deal with a class of patient in voluntary hospitals which was not thought of at the time those hospitals were established&mdash;nor thought of for some decades, or even centuries, after their foundation.  That class of people is called the contributing patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are stressing this importance <Col N="1731" /> of business methods, I think we ought to bear in mind that business methods must be applied to business matters and should not be applied to something which should still remain a matter of charity&mdash;the performing of the fundamental function of the hospitals. A great improvement has been made in the administration of our hospitals in the last half a dozen years by the appointment of almoners whose duty it is to adjust the payment to the means of the patients and not to press for payments which it would be hard for patients to meet.  Those almoners also make themselves acquainted with the home and financial conditions of their patients, and try to assess, in agreement with such patients, the financial basis of the contribution. With a little more experience of that, the business arrangements covering payments by patients to hospitals should be still further improved.</P>
    <P>Senator Keane has given certain portions of the history of what the State has done during the last ten or fifteen years in regard to voluntary hospitals. I wish to point out that, up to 1937, the State did still contribute some small sums to some of the voluntary hospitals, in respect of grants which had been established originally by the Irish Parliament prior to 1801 and which had remained in existence since then.  They were all small payments, except in the case of one hospital with which we dealt at considerable length a few weeks ago.  When the sweepstakes were established, the State decided to abolish all those grants, and they were abolished, I think, in 1937. Since that date, the hospitals have got no assistance from the State in any capacity&mdash;financial or otherwise.  Their funds have been &ldquo;docked&rdquo; by the State in different directions and yet they have had to carry on.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred on several occasions to the sweepstakes system. The sweepstakes were invented by the supporters of a few of the voluntary hospitals some fifteen or sixteen years ago&mdash;I am not sure of the date, but it does not matter&mdash;in order to pay the debts which were overwhelming some of those hospitals and to renovate, add <Col N="1732" /> to or re-build some of the other hospitals which were in a bad way.  As we all know, the sweepstakes proved to be an extraordinary success for some years.  There were great advantages, but there were also great drawbacks, in that they attracted the attention of undesirable people &mdash; notably the Oireachtas, which saw very large sums of money coming into the country and going to a purpose which they deemed proper and useful but which did not contribute directly to the upkeep of the State or of the hospitals which previously had depended for their upkeep on the rates.  As a consequence, very large sums of money were diverted from the sweepstakes receipts for the purpose of relieving taxes on the one hand and of relieving rates on the other hand.</P>
    <P>I have not any document before me at the moment, but I cannot help thinking that Senator Keane may have made an error in quoting the sums of money given to the voluntary hospitals. Perhaps he would favour me with a quotation from a recent report, in order to give a comparison of what has been given to the rate-supported hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quote £13,000,000 as being, roughly, the receipts&mdash;of which sum approximately £3,000,000 was granted to participating hospitals; £1,159,000 to the rate-aided hospitals; and £9,000,000 remains with the Hospitals Trustees.  Some of that £9,000,000 has been distributed but some £8,000,000 still remains with the Trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures which Senator Keane has read out do not tally with those in my memory, and I am glad he has brought the correct ones to my mind.  People who bought sweepstakes tickets with the intention, in the first instance, of contributing to the relief of the sick poor&mdash;which is the work of the voluntary hospitals in this country&mdash;now find that something more than a quarter of the funds&mdash;about one-third, I think&mdash;has been devoted to the relief of the rates.  A large sum has also been devoted to the revenue of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the difficulties in which <Col N="1733" /> Senator Keane sees the voluntary hospitals at the moment, and his summing up of them, I am, in the main, in agreement with him.  That trouble is due to those who have been rifling the funds for which the sweepstakes were originally established, and to which, as the previous Minister for Local Government and Public Health frankly admitted in the Dáil, they should primarily have gone.  The primary purpose of that collection was the aid of the voluntary hospitals.  Had that money gone to the voluntary hospitals, the difficulties that Senator Keane sees to-day would not have arisen.  Those difficulties arise, in my view, from the tampering by the Government, through the Oireachtas&mdash; quite legally, of course&mdash;with a situation which did not, in all equity, concern them at all.</P>
    <P>For those funds the State has given no service to the voluntary hospitals, but certainly has given the services of the Hospitals Commission.  I would like to join with Senator Keane in his remarks regarding the very valuable work done by that body.  In its early years it made a very useful survey of the condition of the country as regards its hospital services, and very carefully planned to deal with the hospital service systematically on an efficient and adequate basis.  That that plan is not being carried out is not the fault of the Hospitals Commission.  Senator Keane gave us instances of the fact that it takes a year or two to get even an acknowledgment from the Custom House for a certain document sent across from Upper Mount Street. Those of us who had to do with the plans put forward by the hospitals and with the recommendations made by the Hospitals Commission do not know with accuracy, but do know in general, the length of the delay, and that the delays are so wearisome and tedious that the recommendations made and the plans put forward are almost forgotten before a reply can be obtained from the Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring the House back to consider what is the distinction between voluntary hospitals and others.  I take it that a voluntary hospital is an hospital which, primarily, is dependent on voluntary <Col N="1734" /> funds.  That does not rule out, of course, contributions, as were made in the past, from other sources, such as the small grants formerly given by the Irish Government towards voluntary hospitals.  But, in their foundation and maintenance they are almost dependent on voluntary funds.  The second point is that they are administered by voluntary workers, a matter of considerable importance, because people are not going to take on the arduous duty of governors unless they are interested in the work, and have a human and real live interest in carrying it to success.  For those who value hospital work, it is a duty to express, whenever the occasion arises, the gratitude of the public to the men &mdash;very often business men with plenty of work of their own to look after, and sometimes men and women who are retired from other professions&mdash;who give their leisure time to the administration of voluntary hospitals, which requires very great ability, great consideration and a great expenditure of time.  Thirdly&mdash;and this one is also of importance&mdash;voluntary hospitals are staffed by voluntary professional workers.  Incidentally, I may point out that in any development, such as Senator Keane seems to look forward to, that last item may make a considerable difference in the financial position if the hospitals have to pay salaries to staffs of a considerable size who at present, and whose predecessors throughout the centuries, have given gratuitous service.  These characteristics of the voluntary hospitals have to be kept in mind when discussing their future.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane expressed the opinion that the present organisation is not satisfactory.  I am sure that if that organisation had been given a free hand for the last 15 years the position of the voluntary hospitals would be satisfactory to-day.  It has been held up.  I am sure that the natural development of that organisation, with the resources which were unexpectedly opened at that time, could have been brought to a very successful issue by now if it had not been for the rifling of the funds in the two directions I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane, near the <Col N="1735" /> end of his speech, drew attention to certain faults in the present hospital service.  I agree that he is right in some of these criticisms.  Most of these criticisms have already been submitted to the boards of governors by the medical staffs in order to improve the service.  He spoke particularly of the lack of system, I think, in the out-patient service.  I quite agree that where the out-patient service has been better developed, as has happened in other countries, the out-patient service, instead of being as it is here, at any rate in the scope of its treatment and the class of people who attend, almost synonymous with the poor law dispensary service, becomes a series of specialised departments, and casual droppers-in do not come into the hospitals in such places simply to meet friends and have a chat for an hour or so in a moderately comfortable room and to get attention for ordinary illness.  They are sent for consultation. They have already seen other medical men&mdash;their club doctors, private doctors, or poor law doctors&mdash;and they are sent for consultation in special cases; cases where special apparatus may be needed or special skill required for diagnosis.  Here in the out-patient departments of the hospitals you will find the same class of people that you will find in any poor law dispensary, and cases in which such special lines of diagnosis and treatment may not be necessary.  I believe that hospitals would be far more useful if they did limit their out-patient <i>clientele</i> in that way; that they could do a good deal with conditions which could not be adequately dealt with elsewhere, and would save a great deal of time and energy spent on work which could be competently done by any medical man without any special skill.  I think Senator Sir John Keane is not, perhaps, quite familiar with the degree of specialisation which takes place in many of the departments of the hospitals, judging from some of the things he said.  The out-patient departments are not all such general reception rooms as I have mentioned, but very definitely serving a particular specialised purpose.</P>

      <Col N="1736" /> Again the Senator said that it was not good to have tuberculosis patients in general hospitals mixed up with the others.  I entirely agree with him. I think it is quite right that general hospitals should have a special ward or wards for dealing with tuberculosis cases.  There is no other provision in the country for dealing with them and they have to come to these hospitals. One of the main difficulties at present is that other cases of sickness have been crowded out of the wards of general hospitals owing to the necessity for dealing with tuberculosis cases, because there is no room for them anywhere else in the country.  We have had talk of the establishment of sanatoriums, but nothing happens.  In the meantime the methods of treatment of tuberculosis cases have developed very differently in recent years and they may require more special and surgical treatment than was customary even ten years ago, and much more than was customary 20 or 30 years ago.  The only place at present for dealing with them is within the general and voluntary hospitals.  I agree that they should not be mixed up with the other patients and that there should be isolation wards.  In the present conditions, owing to the shortage of beds to which Senator Sir John Keane referred, it is quite impossible to segregate them as they should be segregated.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane, at the end of his speech, pleaded for a large measure of State control.  He expressed the opinion that it was admitted that a larger measure of State control was required.  My view would be that the control which the State has begun to exercise, because it obtained the right of administration of the sweepstake funds, should be steadily diminished and disappear altogether. I quite agree with Senator Sir John Keane that the voluntary hospitals would have to do a great deal of reorganisation. The difficulty at present is that they are not masters in their own house or of their own funds and have not found such a degree of State control as has been exercised helpful to the development of the hospital services or to the efficiency of the hospitals. I see no reason to suppose that <Col N="1737" /> a larger measure of State control would give any more efficiency.</P>
    <P>As to the other point which Senator Sir John Keane referred to, most of us have been thinking of how the general medical service could be developed in future to reach a larger class of the community than it does now, but I am not going to discuss, it at present. He suggested that such activities and discussions as have been taking place in a neighbouring country arising out of the Beveridge Report have set us here thinking&mdash;that is quite true&mdash;and that certain developments which take place in future which may or may not be similar to developments which take place in Great Britain.  But, at the moment, I would try to emphasise that the problems here are very different from those in England or Scotland, and that while we have problems to be dealt with we would be making a grave mistake if we jumped to the conclusion that the sort of solution which is put forward in a neighbouring country is the sort of solution which will suit problems in this country.  That was a mistake made 30 years ago in the matter of national health insurance, where a system devised with special reference to an industrial population like that of Great Britain was applied in this country, truncated, it is true, of its most important element.  A system was applied in this country that was almost identical with the system applied in England.  We have not altogether recovered from that, though in recent years, it is right to say, the system has undergone a great improvement.  But we should in any radical changes which may be made in the health system of this country be careful to get a system which will suit the conditions of the country and not be merely adopted because it has been found or is believed to be suitable to the conditions in another country.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with the recommendation that Senator Sir John Keane asked the Seanad to make, that a commission should be held, seeing the rather tendentious nature of the commission which he would like to see established.  For my part, I think that steps in the direction that he suggested <Col N="1738" /> in regard to increasing the power of the State and diminishing voluntary control and voluntary work would be detrimental to the health of the country instead of improving it.  I could not support Senator Sir John Keane in his recommendation in that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane has done a very useful service in putting down this motion, because the discussion so far has been of considerable value.  At the same time I feel&mdash;if he will forgive me for saying so&mdash;he has made a very poor case.  With regard to Senator Rowlette's remarks, I desire to say that I am not an advocate of complete State control.  On the contrary, my view is that what the individual&mdash;and that is true of the individual hospital as well as the individual man&mdash;can do reasonably well, the State should not do at all.  At the same time, I do not think the proposer of this motion suggested in anything that he said that all was well and all was perfect with the voluntary hospitals before the advent of the sweepstakes.  I do not think that anyone in this House could argue that the hospital position is other than improved as a result of the sweepstakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Rowlette, I think, has suggested in his speech that all was not well, that all was not healthy, with the voluntary hospitals.  That would seem to indicate that some measure of State control is inevitable.  For my part, I hope the extent of State control will be as slight as possible.  Nevertheless, if things are not as satisfactory as they ought to be with the voluntary hospitals, I do not think the idea of State control should be eliminated. Senator Rowlette&mdash;I want to be quite fair to him&mdash;suggested that there should be a diminution of such State control, and I am not against him in that, but there can be a diminution of State control only if the work of the voluntary hospitals is carried on satisfactorily.  I am not alleging that the work of the hospitals, whether voluntary or State controlled, is 100 per cent. efficient or 100 per cent. perfect.  Even in the present system, I feel it is not right, for example, that the inefficient hospital should be quite content to continue in <Col N="1739" /> its inefficiency and to apply to the Hospitals Commission for whatever deficit it may incur in the course of a year's working.  I feel the less encouragement given to that sort of thing by the Hospitals Commission the better.</P>
    <P>The hospitals should be conducted as efficiently as possible.  I do claim that the hospitals as a whole, are to-day far more efficiently conducted and far more effective as a result of the sweepstakes.  I think it is undeniable that in our hospitals, in Dublin and throughout the provinces, we have facilities, such as up-to-date x-ray apparatus, that we would not have were it not for the sweepstakes. I am afraid a number of the critics forget that there have been these immense improvements in hospital equipment throughout the country. To my own knowledge, in quite remote parts of the country, operations can be performed which in my younger days could have been undertaken only in Cork or Dublin.  That improvement has been brought about as a result of the work of the Hospitals Commission.</P>
    <P>We would all like to feel that it would be possible to continue to maintain our hospitals by charity and by charity alone, but the extent of the charity given to our voluntary hospitals was not adequate to provide them with the up-to-date equipment which is now available in those hospitals which have been assisted by the Hospitals Commission.  If we had allowed these hospitals to continue as they were, without enabling them to move with the times, without giving the patients the facilities to which they were entitled, merely because, in principle, we were against sweepstakes, we would merely have revealed the lack of a Christian outlook on the part of the Legislature.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that in the past the needs of the poor were given very great consideration by the hospitals, but that does not mean that they were given adequate consideration. In my view, they were given far from adequate consideration. <Col N="1740" /> I feel they ought to be given even greater consideration in the future.  Under the system which has been in vogue during the past ten or twelve years, very considerable improvements have taken place in that direction, and throughout the country to-day the poor, or even the near poor, the people with £200 and £300 a year, are getting hospital facilities that were unheard of in this country 25 years ago.  Surely, that is all to the good.  It must be admitted that in the past the needs of the poor were not adequately catered for.  I am not claiming that they are adequately catered for now, but certainly the position is far better than it was some years ago.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane agrees that the State had to step in to regulate the large sums made available by the sweepstakes.  The only thing that remains for us to consider is whether the present system of control is or is not satisfactory.  I do not think it is unsatisfactory.  I think it was necessary to set up something like this Hospitals Commission.  I think it has performed a tremendous amount of useful work and I feel that were it not for the Commission a large number of the improvements which have taken place would not have been possible. While I say that, I have no sympathy whatever with the inefficient hospital, which relies on the Commission to meet its deficits.  Where these deficits are unavoidable I think it is all to the good that the hospital should have some body such as the Hospitals Commission to make them good, but so far as they are avoidable, I would rely on the Hospitals Commission, in view of their record of good work, to secure that that state of affairs must not continue. Senator Sir John Keane suggested that the present organisation was merely an improvisation and, therefore, not satisfactory.  In moving his motion, I do not think that he gave us any examples of unsatisfactory results on the part of the Hospitals Commission.  From what I could gather from Senator Rowlette's speech, he would agree with my view in that respect.  One of Senator Sir John Keane's criticisms had reference to the dispensary service. <Col N="1741" /> In the course of my life, I have gone to places in all the thirty-two counties. I think that we have inherited a service which we have much improved. We can be quite proud of the service given by our dispensaries.  The dispensaries are extraordinarily good and, on the whole, the service given to patients, if not ideal, is extremely creditable.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have a larger measure of State control now than formerly, and that the sweepstake has made these large funds available is no reason why charitably disposed persons should not help the hospitals.  I have heard it frequently urged against the sweepstakes innovation that they killed the voluntary system in regard to the hospitals.  It is a poor type of charity which is withdrawn for such a reason.  If something remains to be done for the poorer patients in these hospitals, charitably-disposed persons should not be deterred from exercising their charity to such extent as they can afford by the fact that a certain amount of assistance is forthcoming from another source.  Senator Sir John Keane suggested that the Minister was not the best authority to exercise widespread control over the hospitals.  I presume that he was not referring to a particular Minister but to the Minister for the time being.  If there is to be State control, it must be exercised by some Minister.  In this case, the Minister who exercises control is the Minister for Local Government.  If there is to be State control, it must be exercised by somebody who has got parliamentary sanction, as the Minister for Local Government and every other Minister have.  The Senator said something about Ministers being swayed by political influences, but he did not give us any evidence that the work of the Hospitals Commission, or the attitude of the Minister with regard to the hospitals was politically influenced.</P>
    <P>I was hoping that the Senator would elaborate his views on the Beveridge plan, though, goodness knows, this House, in view of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, should be tired discussing &ldquo;beverages&rdquo; of any kind.  The Senator did not, in fact, develop his views on that question.  He merely told us that <Col N="1742" /> something in the nature of the Beveridge plan would have to be considered some time in the future.  The Beveridge plan has not come yet. Although I would concede some measure of State control for hospitals since they are in receipt of State moneys, when it comes to a question of insurance, I am not in favour of State-controlled control, or anything in the nature of the Beveridge plan.  In insurance, I think that the individual will fare better without State control. Virtually the only criticism in Senator Sir John Keane's speech was his suggestion that there were endless delays in obtaining Ministerial sanction.  That may be the fault of the system.  No matter what Minister is in office, it is inevitable, when the expenditure of public moneys is involved, that these delays will occur.</P>
    <P>I am with the Senator in hoping that these delays will be eliminated so far as is possible, but I would agree with Senator Rowlette that Senator Sir John Keane has not made a case for this motion.  Everything may not be perfect at the moment, but the improvement in the position of our hospitals to-day as compared with that of 20 years ago is almost miraculous. Unless there is general agreement that some inquiry should be held, I do not think that any case has been made by Senator Sir John Keane for his motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in thorough agreement with Senator Sir John Keane's motion.  I think that it is timely and opportune and that the need is very urgent.  The voluntary hospital system has given very good service in its time but, under modern conditions, it is almost entirely out-of-date.  In a changing world&mdash;and this country is changing like every other country&mdash; other countries have seen the necessity for reorganising their hospital system. Many of them had more up-to-date systems than we had.  Our voluntary hospital system requires attention for many reasons.  This country is fortunate in having the Sweepstake funds. In that connection, the sum of £13,000,000 has been mentioned.  This amount has been accumulated and <Col N="1743" /> made available for the development of an up-to-date hospital system, which I do not believe we have got.  From the latest returns published, we find that, in 1938, there was a deficit in the case of 51 hospitals of £158,000.  Senators will note that that was for the year 1938.  Not much imagination is required to realise the difference in the charges from 1938 to 1943.  We can assume that the charges on the hospitals have gone up very substantially.  There, in itself, Senators have a justification for an inquiry into the financial position of the voluntary hospitals.  If that reason stood alone, it would justify an inquiry. It shows that the system, if allowed to continue as at present, will be heading for bankruptcy.  Whatever inspired wealthy people in the past to make bequests and legacies to the hospitals, these have now disappeared.  More and more, the hospitals are being thrown on the resources of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  That is the source from which their deficits have to be met, and we may assume that they amount to considerably more than £200,000 per annum to-day.  I do not think it requires any more from me to impress on the Seanad the need for an inquiry. That alone would justify action in regard to inquiry and investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For over 30 years, this country has had a system called the national health insurance system&mdash;a misnomer, of course, because they never did anything to deal with health propositions. They gave out weekly allowances and so on, but they never touched at all on the question of public health.  By amalgamation, a certain amount of funds have been accumulated, and it is proposed to spend something in the neighbourhood of £200,000 per annum on health services from the national health insurance.  A sum of between £50,000 and £60,000 is to be made available for hospitals and £75,000 per annum for dental benefits.  There are to be considerable sums for convalescent homes treatment and specialist and surgical institutions, while money is also to be provided for the treatment of rheumatic, neurotic and other patients, the total being about £200,000 per annum, and, so far as national <Col N="1744" /> health insurance is concerned, they have no say whatever in respect of the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell unduly on this point because the matter is in dispute at present.  Some people, in their wisdom or unwisdom, before the matter has been settled, rushed into print in the Press, but I do not want to do anything which would further jeopardise the very desirable end of an agreement between the voluntary hospitals and the National Health Insurance Society.  I think that, there, is to be found another reason for asking the Government to set up this inquiry. The voluntary system is all right in its way.  It served a purpose in the past, but it is not moving with the times and is not in keeping with modern conditions. Some steps ought to be taken to bring it more into conformity with modern conditions.</P>
    <P>I have seen it stated that any development on these lines would put the doctors in the position of underpaid civil servants.  I am sure nobody wants to bring that about, but I do not think that as a whole civil servants are underpaid, and I do not think they are any less competent than any other section of the community.  I think that a considerable measure of State control is necessary, and for the reason that every voluntary hospital is a self-contained unit.  There is no co-operation between them; they are a law unto themselves.  Each hospital has its own equipment.  Senator Brennan spoke about that modern equipment and about equipping the hospitals down the country with it, but if Senator Brennan sees a virtue in equipping these hospitals with modern equipment at enormous cost, when they lie idle for eight-tenths of the year, whereas in a thickly populated centre these machines and their operators could be exploited and used every day, I certainly do not.  I think it is unwise expenditure.  The patients could very easily be brought to these machines, or the machines could be made more mobile and brought around to the patients.  Instead of going to enormous in providing up-to-date machines which are very rarely used, and which <Col N="1745" /> are badly wanted in thickly populated centres, it would be much more economical to have them in places where they would be of the best possible service. That is not the case now and that is another reason why we should have an inquiry&mdash;to see that the big expenditure from these funds is used to the best possible advantage for the sick people.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our voluntary hospital system is that it is usual in a number of these hospitals to close down some of the wards&mdash;not beds, but wards &mdash;during the summer period, ostensibly for cleaning and painting, but really because the staffs have to get holidays, and rightly so.  In the meantime, illness and the need for beds do not grow less, but the beds are not available because there is no one to attend to them. That is a serious matter and one which I, and other like me, have stressed on various occasions.  If you take into account the bed costs, overhead costs and so on, and the enormous expenditure involved in these institutions, to have a large portion of them lying idle, so to speak, when there is a big demand for them, is a very important matter for all concerned.  Senator Brennan referred lightly and rather sneeringly to the Beveridge plan.  We must have some plan, whether it is a Beveridge plan or any other, to deal with the situation here, and I submit that while the funds are there and before they are diminished any further, we ought to have a commission to inquire into the whole position of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>I have not gone to the full limits of this matter, but I will say that if we had a properly equipped and organised dispensary system, we could do away with some of our hospitals by dealing with the people before they became chronic cases.  In that connection, there is very little segregation of the chronic and the acute cases in the Dublin hospitals.  In many of the hospitals, chronic cases occupy beds for as long as two or three years.  I do not know that that is economic; I do not know that it is good for the hospital system; but I know that it is keeping acute cases out of the various hospitals. <Col N="1746" /> There are many other phases of this matter that would be more proper to put before a commission of inquiry, or such a commission as is suggested in this amendment, and I sincerely hope that the Government will listen to this timely appeal of Senator Sir John Keane to set up such an inquiry, because the need is there and the matter is comparatively urgent.  That need, certainly, will not be lessened by putting the matter on the long finger, and I think that, as the war goes on, and at the close of the war, the need for hospitalisation in this country will become even greater than it is to-day.  At any rate, I see no other source from which these annual deficits can be met except the Hospitals Trust Funds, and they are exhaustible. Accordingly, now is the time to take steps to remedy that situation.  I may say, in conclusion, that I am not at all in favour of the State taking over these funds and using them for hospitals which are the entire responsibility of the State.  However, these are matters which would be very proper for a commission of inquiry, and I sincerely hope that the Minister will see his way to approve of this motion and have a commission set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw this motion, I expected that there would be some definite charges of incompetence or otherwise against the voluntary hospitals. I have listened to Senator Sir John Keane and, as I have some know ledge of different hospitals in the city, and their management, I think it is my duty to answer to some extent some of the points that were made.  I think that one of the first points made by Senator Sir John Keane was that some of the hospitals had money to spend whilst others were not so fortunate.  I presume that the reason why some of them were not so fortunate was that they would not partake of the proceeds of the Sweepstake funds, and therefore it was their own fault if they did not get support from these funds.  It seemed to me that the greater part of the criticism to-day was directed towards the Hospitals Commission, instead of towards the administration of the hospitals themselves.  In that criticism, Senator Sir John Keane <Col N="1747" /> referred lovingly to the national language of this country.  It is wonderful the interest that some people take in the national language at times.  Possibly, the Senator did not like to see the national language coming in, in connection with the distribution of the Sweepstake funds.  He also referred to the fact that the Sweepstake funds may be dried up.  Well, let us hope that this emergency will not continue for all time, and that, when it is over, the Sweepstake funds will return to their former prosperity.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to the building of Cork Street Fever Hospital. It is true that the question of building a new fever hospital has been under consideration for some time.  The site for the hospital has been purchased, and no loss has been experienced. Out of evil, however, sometimes cometh good, and would not the Board of Cork Street Fever Hospital be placed in a very awkward position at the present time if a contract had been given and the whole thing held up, or if some clause in the agreement with the contractors were used to get more money out of the Board in connection with the building of that hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the out-patient departments in city hospitals, and I understood him to say that they were in a state of chaos.  I do not know if that is the case.  I have not heard any evidence of that, and I know something about the hospitals in the city.  I think that if there was anything wrong about the out-patient departments of the hospitals, we would very soon hear about it.  The Senator also spoke about the necessity for having businessmen on the boards of management of our hospitals.  I can tell the Senator that there are both businessmen and business women on the hospital boards of this city.  One of the hospitals to which the Senator referred was, I think, the Richmond Hospital.  The management there originally was appointed, chiefly, by the Lord Lieutenant.  Of course, that matter now comes under the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, but I can assure Senator Sir <Col N="1748" /> John Keane that if he will come to some of the boards of management of the hospitals in this city, he will find very many efficient businessmen on these boards&mdash;some of the most successful men in business and commercial life that there are in the city.</P>
    <P>I certainly was surprised at the attitude adopted by Senator Foran in the points that he raised.  We know the headway that has been made in connection with the different hospitals, in the way of buildings, and providing suitable instruments for these hospitals, which were badly needed. Senator Foran has recently become a member of the board of one of these hospitals, and he must know the headway that has been made in connection with that hospital, the amount of money spent in building, and so on, and that applies to a good many other hospitals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator also referred to the fact that certain instruments, or machines, as he called them, were lying idle in some of the county hospitals.  Well, I think it was very wise of those county hospitals throughout the country to try to provide the necessary machinery, equipment, or utensils, to deal with emergency cases. For instance if, down the country, you had a case of a person suffering from a perforated duodenal ulcer, would it not be necessary to have some machine, or some instrument, to deal with that immediately?  I do not think any case has been made against the management of the hospitals.  It seems to me that Senator Sir John Keane has directed his argument against the Hospitals Commission, and accordingly I do not see why I should vote for this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that I was not here when Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Dr. Rowlette were speaking on a subject which must be of particular interest to women.  I speak as one without any expert knowledge of the subject, but I think it would be common sense to oppose the resolution as it stands now, <Col N="1749" /> on the ground that it is inopportune. The reason I take this stand is that the hospitalisation of the country cannot be dealt with alone; it is part of a much greater thing, the whole medical and health services of the country, and if a commission is set up it must take cognisance of that fact.  For that reason, I would plead that, if this motion goes to a vote, the House will not pass it.  At the same time, it is a very good thing to direct attention to any form of health services, and especially the hospitals.  I should like to take this opportunity of impressing on the Minister that the nurses play a very important part in our health services, and I hope that, if anything is being done, their position will not be overlooked.  If we do not improve the position of our nurses, there is a danger that girls who would make excellent nurses will be attracted to hospitals in England.  I know that the Minister is interested in this matter; with Senator Miss Pearse, when we were both in the Dáil, I had the honour of leading a deputation of nurses to him, and again when the Minister for Finance was Minister for Local Government he also received the three women Senators in connection with this matter.  I know, therefore, that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are interested in the position of the nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people seem to be rather frightened at the idea of State control. It seems to me that the State is what we make it, and, if it is right for a small group of people to be charitable and to help the poor and the suffering, then it is also right that the entire body&mdash;call it the State if you like&mdash; should be charitable, and if the State can do the work better there is a very good case for State control.  I cannot help thinking that, although we owe a great debt of gratitude to those who organised the sweepstakes, and rejoice at their success, it is not altogether to the credit of a Christian country like this, which recognises its duty to the poor, that we should be dependent on that particular form of finance.  It would be much better to face up to the fact that we, the whole Irish people&mdash;that is what I mean by the State&mdash;owe a duty to our sick and <Col N="1750" /> suffering brethren, and anything we can do to improve the hospitals will help them.  I heartily agree with the idea that there should be an inquiry, but the hospitals should not be dealt with by themselves; the inquiry should be into the whole health services of the country.  For that reason, I am not in favour of the motion as it stands now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Seanad do not insist on its disagreement to the amendments made by the Dáil to amendments Nos. 1 and 2 made by the Seanad to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1942, <Col N="1751" /> and now agrees to the amendments made by the Dáil to the said amendments.</P>
    <P>The position briefly is this, that the Seanad made a number of amendments to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, dealing particularly with the hours of opening and closing on Sundays and week-days in the county boroughs and outside the county boroughs.  At my suggestion the Minister embodied all the hours in one section of the Bill.  My own view is that we should accept the position as the Dáil has now left it, and I state that, although, as a personal matter, I believe, in the question at issue, my opinion is contrary to the opinion of the Dáil.  The question at issue is the hours of opening on week-days in the county boroughs&mdash;Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford&mdash;during summer time.  The Dáil passed an amendment, to one of our amendments, which meant that public houses in these boroughs would be open until 10.30 p.m. and, therefore, in conjunction with another part of the amendment that the closing hour for normal trade all over the country every week-day in summer time would be 10.30 p.m.  I believe that there is no demand for that, and I think there is no good case for it.</P>
    <P>I am rather in favour of the 10 o'clock hour for closing, particularly on Saturday; but despite that view, it appears to me that we must recognise certain facts.  This House has limited power.  It has power to make amendments, and these amendments go to the Dáil.  The Dáil, as in this case, agreed to the majority of the amendments embodied in the new section&mdash;practically to all the amendments made by this House, and then made the particular modification I have mentioned.  I think, while we are entitled to express by our votes our particular view, when the matter has gone this far, we should not disagree with the Dáil on a point of this kind.  That is to say, we should not endeavour to hold up the Bill and have the penal provisions of the Constitution put into operation in the other House on a point which is not of considerable importance.  Taken in relation to the general provisions of <Col N="1752" /> the Intoxicating Liqaor Bill, I think the point of disagreement is not one of major importance.</P>
    <P>We had an interesting discussion to-day, I think I may say, at the conference, and no compromise on this matter appeared possible; that is to say, no compromise which would be recommended by the Dáil members to the Dáil and which would result in agreement.  Therefore, the conference eventually agreed to recommend that the Seanad should not insist upon its disagreement.  I am, therefore, moving now that we agree with the Dáil&mdash;that is what the motion really amounts to.</P>
    <P>Having explained to the House the position on the immediate question at issue, may I now offer comment on the situation envisaged by the Minister for Justice in the other House, a situation which might have arisen eventually in the case of this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the 24th March the Minister in discussing the proposal for a conference is reported&mdash;column 1385 of the Dáil debates&mdash;as saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The alternative is,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is the alternative to our agreement with the Dáil,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that I will put down a motion that the Bill be deemed to have passed both Houses; that will mean, I understand, the unamended Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears, therefore, that the Minister considers, and I presume is advised, that the position under the present Constitution is that when the two Houses disagree the Minister can move in the Dáil a motion which, after a certain period, gives the Bill the force of law in the form in which it first left the Dáil.  Now, Sir, if that is a correct statement of the position, it is an extraordinary state of affairs.  It is contrary to the position which most people thought obtained under the Constitution, and it is contrary to the procedure which obtained under the previous Constitution.  Surely, what should happen is that when the Dáil and Seanad had come to agreement on certain amendments to the Bill, these amendments should be inserted in the Bill, but that if there was some point of disagreement, the Dáil could insist upon its point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> That was the procedure explicit in the constitutional position previously, that the Bill should become law in the form in which it originally left the Dáil, but with the addition of the modifications certified in a certain manner to which both Houses had agreed.  That provision was explicitly stated in Article 38A.  There is no such provision in the present Constitution&mdash;its omission is significant I suggest&mdash;and it would appear, therefore, that the Minister, if I may say so, was correct in the opinion he expressed, and which I have quoted.  If that is a correct exposition of the position the situation is one that needs looking into with a view to authoritative interpretation.  The Minister's statement discloses what I suggest is a rather important flaw in the Constitution.  It is not the first one that has been discovered in it, and I am sure it will not be the last.  In regard to the position of this House it is a matter of importance that when we have made amendments to a Bill we can be confronted with this situation: that if we insist on our opinions on a particular point the Bill will become law with none of our amendments not even those on which agreement had been reached between the two Houses.  I do not know if that position was contemplated by the framers of the Constitution.  It certainly is not a position which this House would desire to have.  Having drawn attention to the matter, and stated my views I now move that we do not insist on our disagreement to the Dáil amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon, when speaking, referred to the position of hospital nurses.  That has prompted me to contribute a little to this debate.  From reading the motion I thought that we would be confined almost entirely in our remarks to a consideration of the financial relations between the hospitals and the Government.  So far, few speakers have confined themselves within these limits.  The motion asks that the Government set up a commission to inquire into and make recommendations upon the matter of hospital finance generally. That is just finance, but, further it says &ldquo;and, more particularly, upon the relations between the voluntary hospitals and the State&rdquo;.  I presume, again, that Senator Sir John Keane means financial relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad, because it means that the few remarks I have to make will come within the Rules of Order.  The Senator's interpretation of the motion will tend to widen the scope of the debate considerably.  We will, I take it, be in order in discussing matters that are not exactly financial. I would like to have the system of hospitalisation at present in force throughout <Col N="1755" /> the country discussed under several headings.  A debate on such lines would enable the public generally to understand how far we have gone and are likely to go, and what amount of groundwork has been cleared for this scheme of hospitalisation.  Running in my mind are improved facilities for the treatment of cases of tuberculosis: their early diagnosis, the treatment of the disease where it is definitely established, the after-care which patients will require after a period of treatment in a tuberculosis hospital.  There is also the treatment of rheumatism.  It seems to be our national disease, more so even than tuberculosis.  We have not any set schemes for the treatment of this malady, which is the cause of very great unemployment and involves the payment of sick benefit to members of the National Health Insurance Society.  Then there is the treatment of chronic cases in hospitals, which really should be institutions for the treatment of acute cases.  Beds should only be provided for the treatment of cases while the condition of the patients is acute, or during the period immediately following an operation.</P>
      <P>To my mind, many cases are kept far too long in the ordinary hospitals instead of being taken to some institution for after-care.  To use an A.R.P. expression, there should be &ldquo;casualty clearing hospitals,&rdquo; in which the acute cases would be treated, and when in a condition of convalescence they could be transferred to an after-care institution. These are matters that run through my mind in dealing with hospitalisation and the treatment of patients, and I would like further enlightenment on them through a discussion in this House.  They are entirely outside the financial phrasing of this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the imposition of State control on the hospitals generally, I feel that without State control it is not likely that nurses and other hospital staff will have their wrongs righted.  It is very difficult for each institution, on its own behalf, to provide for staffs individually, whereas under State supervision, State control or State inducement, the hospitals <Col N="1756" /> generally could be induced to improve the conditions of the nursing staff and other personnel of the institutions.  A little more State interference would help to make the hospitals take greater care of the money they receive from patients.  I have an idea that patients in hospitals do not pay always all that they should pay for their maintenance, and greater supervision by an overriding authority would help the hospitals to get greater contributions from patients.  Left to the individual institutions, there is a general idea of not trying to get adequate payment from patients while they are in the hospital. I believe it is not the poorer patients who are always to blame in avoiding payments like that.  These are matters which I thought originally would be more or less out of order, but as the proposer of the motion has mentioned that they could be interpreted as being in order under the second phrase of the amendment, I would like to put them before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say that, in the case of tuberculosis, we are entirely behind the times in this country.  There is one case in which I was interested recently.  It was that of a young boy who went to Peamount. He was 18 years of age and a member of a pretty large family.  The Peamount authorities say that he is incurable.  He is sent back home again, to die in the midst of the other members of the family.  I would say that, at the least, it is very hard on a young boy who does not realise that he is going to die, that he is sent home from the hospital, particularly if his people are willing to pay.  It is an awful state of affairs that he has to go to his own home and mix with other members of the family sleeping in one room.  It is unfortunate that that should happen in a country where, in the last ten or 20 years, there has been such discussion on hospitalisation and such funds raised for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the conditions under which nurses have to serve, I do not understand why nurses, who make such a sacrifice and do such excellent work, should have to work longer hours than people in other employment.  Despite the fact that there has been a lot of <Col N="1757" /> discussion on hospitals within the last 20 years and that the Irish people have been told that our hospitals are in a position to receive any class of patient, if someone suddenly became sick in County Dublin to-night, the only hospital which must have its doors open is the Dublin Union Hospital.  In that hospital there is only a certain staff and I feel that they are overworked even in normal times.  While I do not know if it applies to the city, it is a fact that if someone becomes sick in Finglas to-night that is the only hospital which must remain open. There are many people who would die rather than go to the Dublin Union Hospital.  In saying that, I am not criticising the hospital in any way, as I know that, in the circumstances, the staff in St. Kevin's do their very best but they cannot do impossibilities. After all, if they have a staff to deal with 200 patients, they cannot look after 400, nor can they provide accommodation for that number.</P>
    <P>Again, if some poor person down the country has to be sent to a Dublin hospital, it is hard&mdash;and these people resent it&mdash;that their names should appear in the local papers, stating that the board of health is paying hospital fees for so-and-so.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary not to let that occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Senator give me a specific case where that ever occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give several. Take the case of someone coming to a Dublin hospital from Mayo.  I do not know if this has occurred since the county management system came into operation.  One case in Mayo went before the board of health and the name was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  I have some respect for the statement I made.  I am not saying that it occurred since the county management scheme came in.  If some poor person is sent up by the authorities, it should <Col N="1758" /> not appear in the papers.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that I have not any knowledge of its appearing since the county management system was introduced, but it did appear heretofore, and I am sure some county members will bear that out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>From listening to the discussion this evening I think that, while we may agree with the suggestion made by Senator Keane that some commission be appointed to inquire into the present system of hospital finance, we would also agree that the present is hardly an opportune time to give consideration to such a big question. If such a commission were appointed at present, no matter how desirable it may be, there is the danger that the position would be viewed from the actual conditions of the moment.  About 12 months ago, I suggested here that our whole dispensary system was more or less out of date, but I also said on that occasion that we could not do very much about it under present circumstances.  I would suggest to Senator Keane that this motion be postponed for the moment and that, later on, some motion be introduced which would go even further.  It should take in our whole hospital and medical system and, possibly, even our whole social services, as one is interlocked with the other. Otherwise there would be very little use in having a commission appointed to investigate hospital finance.  We <Col N="1759" /> must consider, not exactly the money spent or the efficiency of the hospitals, but the services that the hospitals give to the nation.  This would not be the best way to deal with the matter without taking the other services dependent upon it into consideration.  Therefore I think, in order to give the services that are necessary, more than hospitalisation must be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of confusion of thought concerning this motion.  In fact, we had a variety of views expressed here on the question of hospitalisation, one set suggesting State interference to a greater extent, and another set suggesting that the State should interfere to a lesser extent, and that some new body or commission should be set up to inquire into the whole position &ldquo;with a view to the establishment of the organisation best suited to the efficient operation of the whole hospital system.&rdquo;  The motion seems to presuppose that the present system is not best suited to the efficient operation of the whole hospital system.  When Senator Sir John Keane put down this motion &ldquo;to inquire into and make recommendations upon the matter of hospital finance generally and, more particularly, upon the relations between the voluntary hospitals and the State with a view to establishment of the organisation best suited to the efficient operation of the whole hospital system&rdquo; one would assume that he had in view our entire hospital system.  There has not been any discussion here to-day about our hospital system unless in relation to voluntary hospitals, particularly in Dublin.  Our hospital system is something much more comprehensive and far-reaching than the service provided by voluntary hospitals in Dublin.  I do not know if the Senator intended that the general question of our whole hospital system should be brought under review in connection with this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of finance, it is suggested here that a new commission should be set up &ldquo;to make recommendations upon the matter of hospital <Col N="1760" /> finance generally.&rdquo;  There has not been any indication that I can trace as to what this new system is expected to discover in reference to hospital finances.  Are we to abolish the Hospitals Commission set up by statute ten years ago, to whose excellent services tribute has been paid in this House and by many outside it, and to establish some other commission?</P>
    <P>What is this other commission going to do that the Hospitals Commission is not capable of doing?  I have not got much enlightenment on that point in the course of this discussion.  Under the Act of 1933 applications for grants by hospitals have to be referred by the Minister for Local Government to the Hospitals Commission.  It is the duty of the Hospitals Commission to investigate these applications and to report.  I have not heard it said to-day that they were not the most suitable and competent body to carry out that function.  If that is not the case a motion of censure on the Hospitals Commission should be put down, and let us deal with that problem, if it exists.  Senator Sir John Keane states that the present system is an improvisation. The present system is a scheme that was deliberately worked out and passed into law ten years ago, with a view to having a complete survey of hospital facilities and hospital requirements throughout the State, and evolving a suitable plan to meet our requirements.  That plan must include, and does, in fact, include, local authorities' hospitals as well as voluntary hospitals.  In fact our 59 voluntary hospitals include institutions for the deaf and dumb as well as for the mentally defective.  As against that we have 59 district hospitals, 44 fever hospitals, 28 county hospitals, 29 sanatoria and tuberculosis institutions, not to mention mental hospitals and county homes.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal with our general hospital problem we must envisage and co-relate the hospital activities of local authorities and see how they fit into the voluntary system if the voluntary system is to be retained.  Outside the City of Dublin, to a lesser extent the City of Cork, and to a smaller extent the City of Limerick, the poor are being <Col N="1761" /> provided for by local authorities in their hospitals.  In the Dublin area more specifically, voluntary hospitals are being availed of to supply the place in the hospital system that is supplied by local authorities' hospitals throughout the provinces.  Everybody agrees that for all practical purposes voluntary contributions have disappeared as a source of revenue for voluntary hospitals, and that these hospitals are at present being maintained almost entirely, on the one hand out of sweepstake funds and, on the other hand, out of the rates by way of contributions from local authorities for the maintenance and treatment of patients.</P>
    <P>Clearly, if the voluntary hospitals are to be availed of to supply in certain areas hospital treatment for the poor, in substitution for local authorities' hospitals, the local authorities and the State must interest themselves to such an extent as to ensure that there will be easy admission to these institutions, and that people for whom there is an obligation to provide hospital treatment will have the best treatment that can be provided.  That may not be possible, and probably is not possible, in existing circumstances, because of the bed shortage, but it has never been suggested, and, I think, it is scarcely intended to suggest that that difficulty is one to be solved by the Hospitals Commission, or that we will get forward any more rapidly towards a solution of it by setting up a new commission in substitution for the Hospitals Commission.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane suggested that the Hospitals Commission has no responsibility to anybody only the Minister.  I do not know what was passing in the Senator's mind. To whom should the Hospitals Commission be responsible unless to the Minister?  The Minister has statutory functions in relation to the distribution and the disposal of sweepstake funds.  He acts on the recommendations of the Hospitals Commission. He appoints the members of the Commission, and I fail to see any flaw in a system under which the Hospitals Commission are responsible to the Minister, and to the Minister alone. <Col N="1762" /> The Senator did not develop the point. He merely mentioned the fact by way of complaint that the Hospitals Commission had no responsibility to anyone only the Minister.</P>
    <P>He complains about delay, not very specifically, just a general complaint about delay.  He did give one specific case of delay which I will deal with later on, but I presume he was referring in general to delay in the disbursement of the annual deficits of the voluntary hospitals.  Now there has been delay&mdash;delay is inevitable.  The Minister is responsible for authorising the release of these grants for the payment of deficits, and when we find the deficits rising year by year, until £7,000,000 at 3 per cent. has now to be held invested in order to pay the annual deficits, inquiries must be made from the voluntary hospitals as to the causes of the rising deficits and suggestions must be made as to how it may be possible to reduce these deficits.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane complained a good deal about delay in the publication of the Hospitals Commission's Reports.  The Hospitals Commission were under no obligation to publish a report at all.  It is entirely within their discretion whether they should publish an annual report, or a report for five years, or whether they should report at all.  They are bound to report to the Minister on the various matters he submits to the Hospitals Commission for advice and recommendation; but they are under no obligation to issue a report to the public.  It is well, perhaps, that the House should know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the line of thought suggesting a closer relationship <Col N="1763" /> between the State and the voluntary hospitals is rather a sounder line than the line of thought suggesting that the voluntary hospitals should be completely divorced from Departments of State.  Our hospitals, voluntary and local authority, are, in the main, the curative arm of our public health system.  The curative arm is a very important arm but, taking the long view, the preventive arm is more important.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health has full responsibility for the operation of the preventive arm, for the creation of those environmental surroundings that help to combat disease &mdash; improved water schemes, improved sewerage schemes, improved housing schemes, and so on&mdash;all intimately related to the combating of disease.  Similarly, he is responsible for school meals, the distribution of free milk, the medical inspection of school children, the medical and dental treatment of school children, the immunisation of children against certain infectious diseases, and so on. Hence, it seems to me, at any rate, that in order to evolve a proper public health system, the closer you can link up the preventive arm with the curative arm the more effective will your system ultimately be.</P>
    <P>The Senator complains that there are too many statistics in the reports of the Hospitals Commission.  Then he becomes rather childish.  He cites as the item that brought him to the conclusion that there were too many statistics in the report that it sets out the number of beds available and the number of occupied beds.  In the light of the fact that there is a good deal of complaint as to the difficulty of getting patients into hospital at present, that there is a good deal of complaint against institutions as to whether in fact, when they refuse to admit a patient, they have a vacant bed, I think it is a good thing to have on record statistics as to the number of beds available and the percentage occupied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just explain?  I did not intend to complain <Col N="1764" /> about the relative statistics of the number of beds available and the number occupied, but I thought it unnecessary to give the financial expenditure under the head of provisions and all these other things in relation to both categories.  I do not see that that served any purpose.</P>

      <P>I would be surprised if there were any volume of opinion in support of that view in this House or outside it.  Notwithstanding the fact that somebody said &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to that expression of feeling by Senator Sir John Keane, many people in this House have paid a glowing tribute to the Hospitals Commission.  Many people outside the House seem to think a good deal of the Hospitals Commission, too.  I have here a publication entitled, <i>Future Hospital Policy in Dublin,</i> by William Doolin, M.B., F.R.C.S.  In this publication is set out a discussion that took place at a meeting at the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland in the Royal College of Physicians on the 1st May, 1936.  The subject for discussion at the meeting was &ldquo;Future Hospital Policy in Dublin.&rdquo;  The discussion was opened by Professor Henry Moore, and Professor Henry Moore has not been particularly generous in his criticism either of the Hospitals Commission or the Department of Local Government in many of his public contributions on the subject of hospitalisation.  He says here:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Both the medical profession and the public must be grateful to the members of the Hospitals Commission, and to their secretary, for their careful and painstaking study of the general hospital situation and for their well-balanced and excellent report recently published; its general tenor and trend have shown that its authors were fully aware of their responsibilities and its publication has removed a load of anxiety from the minds of the great majority <Col N="1765" /> of the members of the medical profession.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They should have improved with maturity.  They ought to be better balanced now than they were then.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission deserve our hearty congratulations and we may express the belief that their future efforts will be as praiseworthy as their first one.  The Commission recognises the importance of such matters as hospital co-operation, medical social service, and clinical medical research, all of which are sadly deficient in our country at the present time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On page 7 of the same report Professor R.J. Rowlette said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I associate myself with the appreciation of the work of the Commission expressed by Professor Moore.  The members show both capacity and industry and have done their best to gain a full knowledge of the problems which faced them.  In their recommendations they have shown both a broad view and a long view.  I think that everyone who was brought into contact with them must have been impressed by their patience and courtesy in listening to the views put before them from whatever quarter or interest they came.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And on page 11, Mr. William Doolin said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it may be honestly admitted, this Academy, in its deep concern for the welfare of the Dublin school of medicine, regarded the possible results of the deliberations of the Hospitals Commission with a perhaps natural fear.  Medical men, if not by nature, at least by force of training, tend to regard the new, the untried remedy, with a certain amount of conservatism, with a scientific scepticism that is essentially protective of the interests of those committed to their care.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The First General Report of the Hospitals Commission recently submitted to the Minister, however, should go far to allay such fears.  It is a most statesmanlike document, one that deserves alike the praise <Col N="1766" /> and the thanks of this Academy for the broad conspectus therein provided of the Saorstát hospital problem viewed as a whole: the more one studies that Report the more clearly does one come to realise that the members of the Commission are studying the hospital problems of this country on the broadest lines, for the ultimate benefit, not of particular or vested interests but of the people of this country at large.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could go on.  I fail to see that a new commission is necessary in order to enlighten us on the hospitals position in this country in the light of the very high opinion that is held by most eminent medical men of the Hospitals Commission as at present constituted.</P>
    <P>The Senator also complains of the absence of a costings system in the voluntary hospitals.  If a system of costings is absent from the voluntary hospitals, it is not the fault of the Hospitals Commission.  For years&mdash;and I think Senator Keane is aware of the fact&mdash;they have been endeavouring to get the voluntary hospitals to adopt a costings system.  So far, they have met with little success.  I do not know how the new commission that the Senator has in mind will get better results.  If the Minister interferes, if he brings additional pressure to bear on the voluntary hospitals to do anything under the sun, to improve their system of accountancy, to establish a costings system, or to do anything else, he will be told that he is interfering with the management of these institutions and that they resent it.  If we set up a commission to replace the Hospitals Commission it is safe to assume they would be met with the same line of criticism.  We discussed this question of costings here the last time we were discussing hospital matters, and I informed the House on that occasion that a uniform system of accounting, at any rate, had been adopted, a uniform system of annual returns, that at least in one institution a system of costings was being tried out and, if it were found to be satisfactory, that it would be applied to other institutions if their consent or co-operation could be secured.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> The Senator's figures on the matter of the total finances in the Hospitals Trust Fund are not altogether accurate, but I do not suppose, unless for the purpose of record, that it makes very much difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not affect the substance of my case at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I suppose I need not bother having put on record the actual position.  In rough figures, at any rate, there is £8,000,000 in the Hospitals Trust Fund and, in rough figures, £8,000,000 has been expended in one way or another.  The interest that has accrued on the money invested has brought in about £1,000,000.  The total amount of money, including interest, available from all the Sweepstakes since the Hospitals Sweeps were first introduced amounts to approximately £16,000,000.  Of that, as the House is already aware, approximately £7,000,000 has to be held invested to meet the annual deficits of the voluntary hospitals.</P>
      <P>That is a very large sum, and I think that we may reasonably assume that, in the near future at any rate, the financial position of the voluntary hospitals will not be much improved by voluntary contributions.  I think it is unlikely that there will be any large-scale influx of money by way of voluntary contributions towards the maintenance of the voluntary hospitals. Consequently, we have to ask ourselves, if we were in a position to build to-morrow, if this emergency were over and building materials were again available&mdash;in the meantime I hope we will get well advanced with our plans &mdash;how could we give effect to the recommendation of the Hospitals Commission regarding the provision of the four large hospitals contemplated in the City of Dublin?  It seems to me that that problem can only be solved by getting the local authorities to take considerably greater financial responsibility for the people who are being maintained in these hospitals at the expense of the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may seem a strange suggestion when you look at it from the narrow point of view of the people residing <Col N="1768" /> in Dublin, but when you look at it from the point of view of people from the provinces, when you realise that they have to make provision for the hospital treatment of their own poor and that they have to strike a rate for the purpose&mdash;and, if it is an increasing problem they have to strike a correspondingly increased rate&mdash;one must have some difficulty in appreciating the case that is made here for the voluntary hospitals in Dublin, that the deficits that they incur for supplying to the ratepayers of Dublin City and County free hospital treatment, should not be borne, in part at any rate, by the rates of the area concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Rowlette has talked about the rifling of the Hospitals Trust Fund by the Oireachtas.  He was good enough to admit that it was by an Act of the Oireachtas that this deliberate system of robbery was carried out. The Oireachtas decreed, by Act, that the hospitals of the local authorities should benefit from the Hospitals Trust Fund.  That seems to me to have been a very sound decision. There are no voluntary hospitals in Galway.  Senator Rowlette suggests that, if the people of Galway get grants out of the Hospitals Trust Fund, they are &ldquo;rifling&rdquo; it, of They are legally &ldquo;rifling&rdquo; it, of course.  Similarly in the case of the people of Monaghan, Cavan or Donegal or any other county in which a hospital has been built.  But are they not as well entitled to get assistance in providing hospital accommodation and treatment for their poor as are the people of Dublin?  I cannot see that there is any difference.  Those who buy sweepstake tickets are not entirely inspired by an overwhelming desire to contribute to a charitable object.  Neither are they entirely, or particularly, concerned with the poor of Dublin.  If charity enters into their consideration at all, I should say that they would have in mind the poor of Ireland.</P>
    <P>But I think that the vast majority of those who buy sweepstake tickets buy them on the offchance that they might win a prize.  Consequently, we <Col N="1769" /> may dismiss the viewpoint that the people who buy those tickets are overwhelmed with the desire to assist a charitable work.  The argument is, therefore, irresistible that the poor in every other part of the State have an equal claim on those moneys with the poor of the City of Dublin.  I do not think that the local authorities should be charged with rifling the fund, even with statutory authority, if, as a result of the provision of that new source of revenue, they have been able to make reasonable and proper hospital arrangements for their own poor.  That is as it should be and they are as well entitled to relief as the people of any other area.</P>
    <P>That brings us to a further development of that line of thought.  When a local authority down the country desires to send a case to a city hospital for special treatment, it is called upon to pay a minimum of two guineas a week.  The voluntary hospitals are not at all satisfied that two guineas a week is an adequate sum.  I do not pretend for a moment that two guineas is sufficient completely to cover the cost of maintenance and treatment. But I do say that if everybody receiving treatment in the voluntary hospitals contributed two guineas per week, or had two guineas contributed in respect of them, it would make a very material difference in the finances of these hospitals.  My Department has brought that matter rather forcibly to the notice of the voluntary hospitals. We have not got a very encouraging response.  We have been harping on this matter for a considerable time but we have not made much headway.  To my mind, it is along that line of development we can hope to release sufficient capital sums when this crisis is over fully to implement the report of the Hospitals Commission. We hope fully to implement it and I believe it will be possible to do so.  We also hope that, when normal conditions are restored, the Hospitals Sweepstakes will again become, if not the source of revenue they were in the past, at least a substantial source of revenue.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane must have got lost and confused in the maze of figures included by the Hospitals Commission <Col N="1770" /> in their report.  He says that 25 additional beds have been provided since the Hospitals Commission came into being.  I am perfectly certain that he did not intend to mislead the House. He must have misread the report.  As a matter of fact, 1,486 additional beds have been provided in the voluntary hospitals.</P>

      <P>We had another little difficulty regarding these four major hospitals in Dublin&mdash;a difficulty with which Senator Rowlette is quite familiar.  I do not suggest that he deliberately suppressed his knowledge of this little complication.  Probably, he overlooked it.  The fact is that the Meath Hospital was included in the scheme of amalgamation of certain hospitals in which Senator Rowlette and Senator Keane are particularly interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that it was recommended that the Meath Hospital should be included in the scheme of co-ordination of a certain group of hospitals.  That was a recommendation of the Hospitals Commission.  It seemed to be a desirable development, but the Meath Hospital was not inclined to come in.  If we do not adopt recommendations of the Hospitals Commission, we are subjected to a good deal of criticism, and, if it were possible, we would be held up to a certain amount of ridicule.  Consequently, we tried to have the recommendation of the Hospitals Commission given effect to.  We negotiated with these people&mdash;we spent a very long time negotiating with them&mdash;in the hope that perhaps we would get them to come into the scheme as recommended by the Hospitals Commission, but, as Senator Rowlette has told the House, they refused.  When they refused, we had to change our hand again.  We had then to consider: Is it worth while going on with the other three when the Meath Hospital is excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, we decided that we would go on with the other three.  It required legislation, fairly comprehensive legislation, and when it comes to legislation for voluntary hospitals, I can assure the House that many ticklish points will be raised.  Sometimes people are agreeable; sometimes they are disagreeable; and sometimes it is very hard to get them to see reason, but you need not hope to have legislation affecting the interests of any group of voluntary hospitals produced overnight. Consequently, a considerable amount of time was spent&mdash;not wasted &mdash;in drafting the legislation to deal with the amalgamating group of voluntary hospitals.  That legislation has now been agreed upon.  There is not any particular hurry about it, I think, because if we had that Bill passed through the Oireachtas, I do not think we could build that hospital, <Col N="1773" /> nor do I think that the promoters claim that it could be built.</P>
    <P>There is not much use conjecturing, but it seems to me, at any rate, to be doubtful that we will be in a position to build any hospitals in this country within a number of years until building materials are again available, but in the meantime we can do a certain amount of preparatory work and legislation can be introduced at any time.  The only drawback at the moment is that the Oireachtas will be fairly fully engaged with financial business for the next few months, after which we shall have some other diversion.</P>
    <P>The Senator talks about notorious delays in the Department.  He does not go on to give us any definite particulars as to the notoriety of the delays, but he complains that expenditure is growing and then asks how it could be otherwise&mdash;referring to the emergency conditions&mdash;it is natural to expect that there should be a growing expenditure.  To a certain point, I agree with him, but, at the same time, in justification of the notorious delays in disbursing these moneys out of the Hospitals Trust Fund, for which the Minister has responsibility as the head of a State Department, it is well to remember that, in 1933, the deficits were roughly £50,000 and that, in 1938, they were roughly £115,000.  There was no emergency in 1938 and yet the deficits increased from £50,000 to £115,000.  I think these figures in themselves constitute an adequate and complete reason for any delays, any negotiations and any questioning that may have taken place between the Department or the Hospitals Commission and these voluntary institutions.</P>
    <P>In all this story of the delays and suggested, though not actually alleged, incompetency, there is just one instance mentioned.  It was mentioned by Senator Sir John Keane, that is the case of the Cork Street Fever Hospital. If I have to weary the House with the story of the Cork Street Fever Hospital, do not blame me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us hear about the Cork Street Fever Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Healy wants to hear about the Cork Street Fever Hospital and wherefore the delay.  I avail of the opportunity to put on record the facts regarding the Cork Street Fever Hospital.  When the proposal to erect a new fever hospital was decided on, a provisional committee was established in the year 1935 as an advisory committee for the purpose of carrying out preliminary investigations in connection with the selection of a site. The first difficulty arose in relation to the area of the site to be acquired. The Hospitals Commission had recommended a site of about 30 acres.  The provisional committee decided that the site should have to have a minimum of 100 acres, and although the Minister intimated that the maximum area to be sought should not exceed 50 acres, the provisional committee adhered to their view.  There was good reason for delay there.  The Hospitals Commission were right; the Minister was right; or these people were right; but at any rate there was a difference as between 50 acres and 100 acres for the site.  Notwithstanding the advice of the Hospitals Commission and the advice of the Minister, they proceeded to take their 100 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No progress could be made until the Dublin Fever Hospital Act, 1936, came into operation, and the Dublin Fever Hospital Board was constituted as from 1st January, 1937.  Meanwhile, the Dublin Corporation had, at the instance of the Department, instituted a new procedure for ascertaining the most suitable site for the proposed sanatorium, and were in 1936 conducting a survey of the entire district in <Col N="1775" /> and about the City of Dublin with a view to selecting the best site for the institution.  It was considered desirable to await the completion of this survey.  That was a sound commonsense attitude and I do not think there can be any criticism on that score.  The provisional committee referred to had selected a site at Blackditch, which was subsequently adopted by the Fever Hospital Board. The corporation had rejected that site when considering the question of a site for a sanatorium.</P>
    <P>There was room for thought there. The provisional committee selected a site which the corporation had already rejected and the Minister was expected to approve of this selection of a site which was not considered suitable for a sanatorium, without any delay.  The Minister, being a responsible man at the head of a Department of State, does not act in that irresponsible way. Alternatives were suggested by the Department but the Fever Hospital Board gave their preference to the site at Blackditch, and, in November, 1937, the Minister authorised the board to negotiate for the purchase of that site.  The price of the refusal was that we could not get on with the fever hospital proposition at all; but although we believed they were wrong, although they selected a site which the corporation had already rejected, in order to get on with the job, we had to approve of the site.</P>
    <P>When consideration of planning was taken up, it was evident that the board wished to plan on a very elaborate basis.  When planning a hospital, it is necessary to have regard to its future operation, and to endeavour to secure that the upkeep and running costs will be kept as low as possible, while at the same time providing for efficient treatment of patients. Economics in initial cost often produce economics in running expenses.</P>
    <P>At the end of November, 1938, the first outline schedule of accommodation was submitted by the board for a hospital with accommodation for 400 beds, the number recommended by the Hospitals Commission.  While the schedule was being considered in the Department, the board submitted a <Col N="1776" /> new proposal for a hospital of 500 beds.  This fundamental change created a difficulty, and it was not until the middle of 1939 that the board agreed to go back to 400 beds.</P>
    <P>Following approval of the preliminary schedule of accommodation, the board submitted a detailed schedule of accommodation and a plan of the hospital showing the lay-out of the buildings.  It was only after repeated and lengthy discussions that the Minister succeeded in convincing the board that it was possible to achieve considerable economies in construction cost without in any way affecting the efficiency of the hospital, and that those economies would in fact produce further economies in upkeep and running costs.  In addition to the economies secured in the essential components of the proposed hospital, the Minister had considerable difficulty in convincing the board that in the present circumstances the provision of a swimming pool for nurses, a covered ball alley at a cost of £1,500, and 23 cottages for male employes at a cost of £650 each, would be an extravagance that could not be justified.  The Minister had already recognised the need for recreational facilities and had agreed to such provision on a generous scale, including tennis courts, a ball alley&mdash;uncovered&mdash;a recreation hall, a billiard-room for the medical staff, and common rooms for nurses and domestics.</P>
    <P>Another matter in connection with which unnecessary delay took place was the appointment of a consulting engineer.  The Minister, realising the importance of the institution for the treatment of infectious diseases, and also that questions of temperature and ventilation should receive special consideration in the planning of the hospital, was anxious that the best possible advice should be obtained for the designing of the engineering services. It was essential, not only that competent consulting engineers should be appointed, but that the most competent available should be employed. It was felt that the Hospital Board would find it difficult to select from among the applicants the most suitable candidate for each branch of the engineering <Col N="1777" /> work, unless they were guided in the selection by expert advice. The Minister, accordingly, decided that in the selection of the consulting engineers the board should be advised by the professors of engineering from the National University of Ireland and Dublin University.  The board, instead of asking those advisers to select the most suitable of the applicants, asked them to submit a panel of suitable persons for the posts, and proceeded to make a selection from that panel.  The Minister, therefore, had to request the board to obtain from the selectors the name of the most suitable applicant for each branch of the work.  Considerable delay would have been avoided in this matter if the board had been prepared to act in full accordance with the Minister's recommendation, which was eventually adopted by them.  That is how the delays occurred.</P>
    <P>When the final schedule of accommodation and draft sketch plans were submitted to the Department on the 15th August, 1940, it was found that the schedule of accommodation did not contain amendments which the board itself had agreed to after long discussions with the Department on the previous draft, and that the plans submitted did not even agree with the schedule of accommodation accompanying them. This position involved the detailed reexamination of the proposals and the preparation in the Department of a lengthy statement containing corrections and recommendations for the amendment of the plans.  These amendments were practically all accepted by representatives of the board at a conference in November, 1940.  Since then, the preparation of plans has proceeded, and the board have practically reached the position when they can start the site development works.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost at the beginning of 1941 was £519,126 12s. 0d., and the actual and prospective commitments from the Hospitals Trust Fund for other hospital works did not permit of a grant based on that figure.  Apart from the position of the Hospitals Trust Fund, the Minister had to remember that the future maintenance of the hospital would involve a large <Col N="1778" /> charge on the general body of the rate-payers in Dublin City and County.  The utmost care, therefore, had to be taken to ensure that the cost would be kept at a reasonable level in view of the other burdens falling upon the rate-payers.</P>
    <P>The principal economies achieved as a result of the examinations of the proposals of the board by the Department are:</P>
    <P>(1)  A more compact plan on the site, thus making considerable saving in the construction of roads, ducts and engineering services, with a consequent saving in running cost.</P>
    <P>(2)  A reduction in the number of separate cubicle blocks.</P>
    <P>(3)  A reduction of the ancillary accommodation to be attached to each ward block.  For instance, each ward block of 26 beds was provided originally with five bathrooms.  The number of bathrooms was reduced to three, representing a total saving of 20 bathrooms for the ward blocks.</P>
    <P>(4)  The floor space per patient originally proposed to be provided in the cubicle blocks was 144 square feet.  This has been reduced to 110 square feet, and as there is accommodation for 140 patients in the cubicle blocks, the floor space saved amounts to approximately 4,700 square feet, exclusive of the saving in corridors, etc.  Some saving was also made in the floor space allocated to each of the 260 patients to be accommodated in the ward blocks.</P>
    <P>(5)  It was originally proposed that each maid should have a separate room.  It was eventually agreed, following representation from the Minister, that the maids should be accommodated in cubicle dormitories; thus reducing considerably the cost of their accommodation.</P>
    <P>(6)  Savings have been recommended in many other sections, such as the admission block, the chapel, the nurses' quarters, garages and other buildings.</P>
    <P>I think that that is a very good example of what causes delay in the planning of new institutions, and I think that anybody with an open mind <Col N="1779" /> will agree that if my Department spent time on the examination of these proposals, it was time well spent and the results of the examination of these plans would accrue to the ultimate advantage of the people who maintain that institution.  The alterations that have been made in the plans have not lessened in any way the efficiency of the proposed institution as a first-class modern fever hospital.  The reluctance of the board to co-operate with the Department, and the incompetent manner in which they handled certain of these matters, must, I think, be held responsible for any delay that occurred.  So much for what the Senator described as the notorious delay that has been associated with this matter, and for the allegation that the Department of Local Government and Public Health and the Hospitals Commission were responsible.</P>
    <P>The Senator also spoke of the out-patients in the Dublin hospitals, and said that that was a matter that was over-due for examination.  Again, that is one of the matters that has been very strongly pressed on the management of the voluntary hospitals.  The group of the Irish Medical Association who are particularly concerned with hospitals and dispensaries went into this matter and spoke in the most emphatic language of the abuses that were associated with the out-patient departments of the voluntary hospitals. Notwithstanding that, and notwithstanding the repeated pressure from the Department of Local Government and Public Health on the same matter, we have not yet been able to induce the voluntary hospitals to make any radical change in that regard.  The position is, as any impartial person who is interested in this question must admit, that the out-patient departments of the Dublin voluntary hospitals are being cluttered up with a type of patient who could very well be treated by the dispensary doctor.  It seems to me that the out-patient departments are not serving the function that they could very well serve.  In my judgment, the local doctor, the family doctor, or private practitioner, when he comes across a case that seems <Col N="1780" /> to be rather obscure, or where he is doubtful as to the diagnosis the best course would be to give a note to his patient to go to the out-patient department of a voluntary hospital where all the skill of the staff of that hospital would be available to aid him in the diagnosis of the illness and the treatment of his patient.</P>
    <P>If such a system were established, with the staffs of the out-patients' department reporting back to the doctor who sent the case there in the first instance, there is no reason why a big proportion of those people could not continue to be treated either by the private doctor at home or by the dispensary doctor.</P>
    <P>People may say there is not sufficient accommodation in our public assistance dispensaries.  That is not an excuse at all.  At any time when a reasonable case was made to my Department regarding the provision of additional dispensary facilities, those additional dispensary facilities were provided.  If the voluntary hospitals will put their own house in order, and leave us to look after the poor in our public assistance dispensaries, we will do our job all right.  Apart altogether from the poor who go there, there is no doubt that there is abuse of the out-patients' department by people who could afford to pay.  People come up from the country, stay a couple of nights with a relative and slip around to the out-patients' department, and people in the City of Dublin who have a good share of the world's goods very often go to the out-patients' department and get treatment at the expense of the Hospitals Trust Fund, when in fact they should pay for that treatment. As well as that, the out-patients' departments are cluttered up with people who are not looking for treatment at all but are merely looking for national health insurance certificates.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of service we get from our out-patients' departments, owing to lack of organisation.  Under the present scheme of things, I think a very big advance in our public health services could be achieved if the voluntary hospitals would agree completely to modify their outlook in relation <Col N="1781" /> to the functions which their out-patients' department ought to serve in our hospitals system.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane said at some stage&mdash;I do not know what he meant&mdash;that the Minister is not the best person to decide the matter of disbursements out of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  I wonder who would the Senator suggest should decide those matters?  If a Minister of State is not the best person to decide on a matter regarding which he has statutory obligations, and if some outside body ought to be set up, between him and the people affected, to decide those issues for him, then I wonder what on earth we have Ministers of State for at all.  If the Minister delegated to the Civil Service or to a commission or anybody else a function that ought properly to be discharged by him, we would hear a very loud cry about bureaucracy.  If we delegate to somebody else, we are wrong; if we do it ourselves, we are wrong too.  It appears to me that we are going to be wrong in any case.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane made a further reference that I should. be reluctant to think he seriously meant.  He stated that, in regard to those matters, the Minister would be subject to political pressure.  That is an extraordinary statement for a man holding the responsible position in the public life of this country that Senator Sir John Keane holds.  Does he seriously think &mdash;if he does not think it he should not suggest it&mdash;that in the disbursement of those funds any Minister would be influenced by political pressure?  If he thinks so, will he cite a single case that he knows of where a Minister has been swayed by political pressure in determining the grants to be given out of the Hospitals Trust Fund?  If he is not prepared to cite such a case, he should not make such an allegation here.  I do not think he believes it himself.  I would be very much surprised if he did.  Perhaps I am reading more into his words than he intended them to convey, but to me they had a very nasty meaning.</P>
    <P>Coming to Senator Foran's contribution to the debate, it will not take very long to dispose of the only point that struck me about it.  He made one very <Col N="1782" /> foolish statement&mdash;a statement altogether inconsistent with any facts that have ever come before me.  He said we have equipment lying idle in hospitals down the country, and that the hospitals are, for all practical purposes, derelict.  I do not know whether people make statements like that without any consideration or without having any facts before them, but my experience is that our local authority hospitals down the country are overcrowded.  Invariably, the complaint that I get everywhere I go, and in all the communications relating to this problem that come to my Department, is: &ldquo;We have not sufficient bed accommodation.&rdquo; I do not know where on earth those institutions can be where the equipment is lying idle and the beds are lying idle.  I never heard of them, and I do not believe they exist.  I do not suggest that Senator Foran was deliberately misleading the House, but I do suggest that somebody has been misleading him.</P>
    <P>In the time at my disposal I cannot deal in detail with the progress we have made in giving effect to the recommendations of the Hospitals Commission. I have dealt in some detail with the position regarding the four Dublin hospitals.  Legislation has been passed regarding one of them.  Legislation is ready for introduction in the case of another; if the financial business of the coming session permits, it will be introduced during that session, but, if not, it will be introduced afterwards.  The other two hospitals are busy planning.  Many exchanges of views have already occurred, particularly in the case of the Mater Hospital, between their technical advisers and the Minister's technical advisers.  They have made considerable headway.  In the case of one other voluntary hospital, they are now ready to proceed with the planning. So far as the local hospitals are concerned, we have provided 13 new county hospitals; 23 new district hospitals&mdash;I can give the geographical location of those hospitals to anybody who is sufficiently interested&mdash;10 fever hospitals; extensions to tuberculosis institutions in Wexford, Kerry, Cork, Leix and Limerick County Borough; a new sanatorium has been provided <Col N="1783" /> in Rathdrum, County Wicklow, and a new tuberculosis hospital in Cavan is almost complete.  Extensive works have been carried out at such mental hospitals as Ballinasloe&mdash;including Castlerea&mdash;Mullingar, Limerick, Sligo, Ennis, Grangegorman, Portlaoighise, Castlebar, Monaghan, Ardee and Killarney, and smaller works at other mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>It may be said, perhaps, that the local authority hospitals have advanced more rapidly than the voluntary hospitals.  That is true.  That is due to the fact that we had considerably less difficulty in our negotiations with the local authorities regarding site location, bed capacity, etc., than we had with the voluntary hospitals.  On the other hand, I think perhaps it might be a blessing in disguise that this hospital in which Senator Barniville is so much interested was not built before Fianna Fáil came into office, and that the programme of hospital development in Dublin City has not been completed even up to the present, because, when we realise that it now takes £7,000,000 invested at 3 per cent. to pay the deficit of the voluntary hospitals, we must ask ourselves the embarrassing question, what would become of these voluntary hospitals if that £7,000,000 had been expended in building new hospitals?</P>

      <P>I shall deal first with the subject on which the Parliamentary Secretary seemed, I thought, to get unduly heated, and that was my reference to political pressure.  I feel that every Minister is subject to Party pressure.  Surely, that cannot be disputed? His Party have claims upon him, and there is no question of personal corruption.  The Parliamentary Secretary talked as if I were accusing the Minister of giving money away to his political friends.  I did not do so. There are all kinds of questions in relation to hospital policy.  There are, for instance, questions of municipal hospitals versus voluntary hospitals. There are all kinds of political wirepulling in matters of that kind.  That is as far as my suggestion went.  If the Minister was not always the best judge, <Col N="1784" /> and if he should not be given the absolute deciding voice in matters of that kind, it would be better to try to devise some sort of organisation which would combine other representatives with the Minister, or with officers of the Department, in those decisions. There is no ground for the Parliamentary Secretary getting as heated as he did when I made that remark. We are living in a world of reality, and to suggest that there is no such thing as Party or political pressure influencing decisions, is to ask one to believe that one is in a fairy land.</P>
      <P>As to the neglect of legislation in connection with these amalgamated hospitals, I know that legislation takes time.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that things cannot be done overnight. I know that, but there is a difference between overnight and six years.  I feel there, again, that I may be wrong and I am not making any charge, but it would seem that the State hospital got far more expedition in the matter of legislation than did the voluntary hospitals.  I do agree that if they push the matter forward now, not very much harm will be done, because building cannot be undertaken at the present time.  But it is important to get the legal authority established and to get on with the plans.  We know the time they take, and the sooner they are prepared, the better.  I cannot believe it is going to be a controversial matter when it comes to Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary talked about out-patients and suggested that the remedy for the present confusion lay in the hands of the voluntary hospitals&mdash;if they would only refuse to take those people and throw them back on the dispensary system, the dispensary system would be adequate to deal with them.  I am not intimately in touch with the dispensary system, but I am told that the dispensary officers are asked, in some cases, to deal with 180 people an hour, with totally inadequate equipment.  Of course, it cannot be done and the dispensary officer sends them on to the hospitals and the hospitals have this nondescript accumulation of cases with which they try to deal.  I do not think it <Col N="1785" /> would be satisfactory if they attempted to be unduly harsh in their segregation, if they were to say to a patient: &ldquo;You are not seriously ill and you can go back to the dispensary system.&rdquo; That would be totally against the spirit in which the voluntary hospitals try to do their work.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary laid great stress on the tribute paid by persons connected with the medical association to the work of the commission. Dr. Moore was one of those who paid a tribute.  I hope I paid a tribute to the work of the commission.  Let me point out that this tribute was paid in 1936, when the commission had published its first report, and that was put before this medical body.  I think that first report was admirable and very necessary.</P>
    <P>I will come now to what I feel is the defect in the present position.  The commission has survived its utility. It was required to make that survey that took place in 1936, but, having made its report, I feel it might have relapsed into a much smaller and totally different class of body.  What I feel&mdash;and it is only a matter of opinion&mdash;is that the commission has survived its utility and, like many other bodies, it is striving to justify its existence by issuing a mass of statistics, many of which are not worth the money.  I do not think I said the commission was not worth the money. The record will show what I did say. I said that that vast mass of statistics, most of which could not be used in practice, was not worth the money. That is different from saying the commission was not worth the money.  I do feel that the commission has survived its usefulness and a totally different organisation is called for.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary meant to be deliberately confusing when he talked about commissions. He rather suggested I asked for the setting up of another commission to replace the existing one.  I did not.  I asked for a body to inquire into hospital finance generally and report on the system best suited to the efficient operation of our future hospital system.  It might recommend the abolition of the existing commission <Col N="1786" /> and possibly the establishment of some joint body along the lines of the Electricity Supply Board, but I never asked for a permanent commission. Perhaps I did not make myself clear, but I will mention briefly that my objection to the present organisation is that you have a hospital with its advisers and architect and board; then you have the commission, and then you have the Minister with his officials and his own architect.  Altogether it is an unsound organisation. There need not be any heat about it. I consider it is a bad organisation, and I would like an inquiry in order to see whether we cannot get hold of a better one and leave politics and all that sort of stuff out of it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary suggested I should not have made a point of comparison between the available and the occupied beds.  I think it is quite right that the commission should give us the figures of the total available beds and occupied beds, but I do not think it was necessary to give all those statistics of financial apportionment that have been given with reference to the available beds and the occupied beds.  That is a patent example of the unnecessary work the commission is doing, and I feel it is an example of work that is being carried out simply because there is not other more useful work to do.</P>
    <P>With regard to reports, the Parliamentary Secretary got very hot with me because of certain remarks I made about political pressure.  I think I am entitled to get a little bit hot with him when I point out that for four years the commission has not published any report, although previously it did so. Surely that requires some explanation. When I am told that the commission need not publish a report, am I expected to leave it at that, and to take it from the Parliamentary Secretary that no more reports are going to be published?  If that is the policy, then I think he should be frank about it and say whether the Minister or the Government have received any reports from the commission and, if so, why they have not been published.  What is the reason for the sudden decision to <Col N="1787" /> hold them up?  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary has not been frank with the House on this matter and that I am entitled to get hot with him about it.  It may be a minor matter but I think he has not been frank with us.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up any more of the time of the House.  I have dealt with what I consider to be the outstanding points.  What I have in mind is the setting up of a commission to make a fresh examination of this whole problem.  The motion is really only an indication of my approach to it, and if agreed to would have to be examined by the responsible Department.  The terms of reference and so on for the commission would then have to be drawn up.  I should like very much to see the relations between the rate-aided hospitals and the voluntary hospitals brought within the purview of such an examination.  It is very important that we should have some close co-ordination between the treatment of cases in the county hospitals and the more specialised treatment that possibly may be given in the Dublin general hospitals.  Senator Mrs. Concannon rather suggested that my motion covered too narrow a field.  My answer is, make it as wide as you like, and let there be an examination of the whole problem.  We certainly should not accept it that the present organisation is satisfactory and that all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.</P>
    <P>On the question of delays, because I mentioned Cork Street Fever Hospital half the time occupied by the Parliamentary. Secretary in replying was taken up in dealing with that hospital. He referred to the delays that take place as regards meeting deficits.  Why should there be these delays?  Why could not 90 per cent. of them be paid on account, thereby saving the charges that borrowing involves, and let the investigation into claims go on?  Why is it considered necessary to penalise bodies because it is assumed that their administration is extravagant?  Are some of the deficits met more quickly than others?  I should like an assurance on that point.  Generally, I think <Col N="1788" /> the delays are pretty much the same in all cases, but I may be wrong in that.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary took me up rather sharply on the reference I made to the provision of additional beds.  I think that what I said on that was absolutely correct.  I said that the recommendation made by the Hospitals Commission was that 600 additional beds were needed in the case of the Dublin general hospitals. The record, I think, will show that I did make that statement.  The figures before me indicate that 23 additional beds&mdash;not even 25, the figure I mentioned when speaking at the opening&mdash; had been provided up to 1938.  I know that additional beds are being provided in the new county hospitals in greater numbers&mdash;in more spectacular places up and down the country.  The Department may find it easier to deal with the local authorities than with the existing voluntary hospitals.  Is that the explanation for that, and is that a true picture of the position?  I agree that the Minister has greater power and more authority in the sphere of local government than he has in the case of these Dublin hospitals.  Even if that be the case, I do not think it satisfactorily explains the spectacular results in one case, and the almost negligible results in the other.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the way it has listened to me on this matter.  I feel that the motion has served a useful purpose.  I was sorry there was any suggestion of political feeling about the motion.  I certainly had none.  My only reason for putting it down was because of my interest in the poor of all classes.  I strongly feel that the present system is not the one best fitted to serve their needs, and that is why I moved the motion.</P>
