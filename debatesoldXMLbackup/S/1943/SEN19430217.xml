    <P>Government amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In pages 2 and 3, Section 4, to delete paragraphs (A) and (B) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>by the deletion of sub-sections (1), (2), and (3) thereof and the insertion therein of the following two sub-sections in lieu of the said sub-sections so deleted, and the said Act and in particular sub-sections (4) and (5) of the said Section 2 shall be construed and have effect accordingly, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Save as is otherwise provided by this Act, it shall not be lawful for any person in any county borough to sell or expose for sale any intoxicating liquor or to open or keep open any premises for the sale of intoxicating liquor or to permit any intoxicating liquor to be consumed on licensed premises:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has been tabled as a result of the agreement reached in the Seanad.  I was asked by the Seanad to consolidate all the sections dealing with the hours of opening and closing. They are all set out in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the hours set out in the amendment for opening in Dublin on Sundays, we had a good deal of discussion on that matter on former Stages of the Bill.  The playing of hurling and football in Dublin entered largely into the discussion. The proposal in the amendment is that public houses in Dublin be permitted to open at 1.30 p.m.  I would appeal to the Minister to go back to the 1 o'clock opening. I am reliably informed by people interested in the games that the opening of public houses at 1 o'clock on Sundays would not seriously interfere with the G.A.A.  The 1 o'clock opening would also ensure that the assistants would get the benefit of the Shop <Col N="1448" /> Hours Act in the sense that they would get an extra half-day in consequence of having worked four hours.  They will get no recompense for working three and a half hours.  That is a very important consideration for the assistants generally, and I would appeal to the Minister to take it into consideration. From the employers' point of view, the 1 o'clock opening has this important feature: that the licensed clubs in the city are permitted to open at 1 o'clock on Sundays.  It is contended, and I believe there are substantial grounds for the contention, that these licensed clubs represent serious opposition to the ordinary licensed trader.  The Minister and the House can see that licensed traders have a serious grievance if their clientele is taken away from them before they are allowed to open their premises.  I put it to the Minister that these are important considerations that ought to be considered by him.  In view of what I have said, I think he ought to reconsider his attitude on this matter.  The 1 o'clock opening is an important matter both from the point of the employers and of the assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Minister is concerned, I would like to point out that I provided for 1 o'clock opening in the original Bill, and it was really in deference to the wishes of the G.A.A., accompanied by the assistants' representatives, that I went on to 2 o'clock.  Some of the assistants came to me with representatives of County Dublin Board G.A.A.  We had much discussion and I thought we had arrived at agreement.  I should like to see uniformity as far as possible.  But, there was opposition to that and I think that, after a very long discussion, we came to the agreement which is set out in the section.  I should like to see uniformity in regard to week-days and Sundays.  I thought we were compromising between the G.A.A position and the clubs by providing for an extra half-hour.  When I brought in the Bill, I aimed at 1 o'clock because of the points which had been made about the opening of clubs on Sundays at that hour.  I was then approached with representations <Col N="1449" /> that 1 o'clock opening would ruin the hurling game in Dublin, and that there should not be any opening before 2 o'clock.  As far as I am concerned, I am in the hands of the Seanad with this amendment.  It merely carries out what they have decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment as put down now by the Minister is the amendment agreed upon on the Committee Stage when the Bill was re-committed. As a matter of fact, I put up all the arguments which have been advanced by Senator Foran in favour of 1 o'clock instead of 1.30.  It was fully discussed, and although I opposed it as strongly as I could, the general trend of opinion seemed to be that they would not agree with 1 o'clock. They agreed to fix the opening hour at 1.30.  I did my best to get 1 o'clock carried but I saw the feeling of the Seanad and I did not press my arguments any further.  The hour of 1.30 having been agreed, the Minister has brought in this amendment to clear up the whole position and to carry out exactly the wishes of the Seanad on the last day.  As a matter of fact, I was expecting more support from Senator Foran.</P>
      <P>Senator Campbell was opposed to 1 o'clock on the last occasion, and, in any case, the general feeling was that 1.30 would be a much better hour.  I did not expect that there would be any discussion here to-day because the Minister has merely brought in an amendment to clarify the position. That being so, I think we ought to agree without entering into further discussion.  The hours of 1.30 to 3 and 5 to 7 appear to me to meet everyone's wishes and I think we ought to be able to get along without further discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it was interesting to you, Sir, and to other members of the association, to hear the references to the Gaelic Athletic Association. I feel sorry, at all events, that the employers and assistants could not meet each other on this question so that there would be unanimity instead of seeking to get the question settled in the Seanad.  It is perfectly clear now that the assistants are asking to work <Col N="1450" /> half an hour longer.  I am speaking now subject to correction from Senator Foran or anybody else, but that is how I understand the situation.  The reason they are asking to be allowed to work an extra half hour is, I understand, that they may be entitled to an extra half day off in the week.  I wonder if I am stating the position correctly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to do with that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>If such is the case, even at this late hour I would be very anxious that employers and employees should discuss this matter.  The employers of to-day were the employees of yesterday, and the employees of to-day will be the employers of tomorrow. This question affects the trade as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made it perfectly clear and I thought, generally, that we accepted the proposition, that we were not discussing the Intoxicating Liquor Bill as we might discuss, say, a Trade Union Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not discuss this Bill on such a basis.  It is unfortunate that another measure seems to cut across this one.  I feel that we should deal with that measure if it is necessary to deal with it when this one is out of the way, but that we should reverse our decision&mdash;many of us believe there should be a three hours' opening&mdash;in order to avoid another issue which ought to be dealt with separately, seems to me an absurdity.  I hope the House will not change on that alone.  If the House changes because it thinks that additional facilities and longer hours are required on Sunday, that would be a legitimate reason.  I would much prefer that we should go back to three hours, but I am not proposing to do so now.  It was debated at great length and we reached this measure of agreement which the Minister has carried out absolutely accurately and in the way in which it was agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another factor, the workers.  The employers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Report Stage, Senator, only one speech may be made.  If, however, it is a point of order, or of personal explanation, I will hear you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the position as represented by Senator Foran is the exact one.  On the Committee Stage, during the tea adjournment, certain consultations took place and the general agreement was that the hours should be from 1.30 to 3 and from 4.30 to 7.  That amendment was brought in and the Government supporters solidly voted against the Minister's amendment with the exception of Senator Byrne, who supported it in conjunction with five people on this side of the House.  We do not disguise the fact that we are anxious to see that the workers will get the compensation to which they are entitled. There is no use in blinking the fact that certain interests became pretty busy between the Committee Stage and last week, as a result of which there has been a complete reversal of opinions expressed on the Committee Stage.  The whole change of front came about because certain people have more regard for the interests of employers than those of the employees. I am not including in that the temperance advocates and pioneers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Such as yourself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are quite entitled to try to shorten the hours and, as a matter of fact, I approve of their attitude.  But the employers themselves were agreeable to four hours provided they were permitted to open at 1 o'clock.  They made the case that if they got half an hour's extra trading between 1 and 1.30&mdash; trade which ordinarily went to the clubs&mdash;they would be in a position to meet the extra cost of the time-off granted to the assistants.  If that is the position in future, employers and workers are agreeable on that point and I do not see why the House should not accede to it.  I think that is the main reason why they are advocating a change so as to make the hours 1 to 3 and 5 to 7.  There is no use in Senator Conlon pretending, <Col N="1452" /> or trying to give the impression that he was not acting on behalf of the employing class when he moved his amendment.  Of course, we do not make any secret of the fact that we are anxious that justice should be done to the workers in this industry, and that they should have ample compensation for the time they are compelled to work on Sundays. I think it was Senator Lynch who pointed out last week that if those people had to work for three hours and 50 minutes they would be entitled to no compensation, but an extra ten minutes would entitle them to compensation.  In reality, some of those people have to work much longer.  I am reliably informed that, in one house close to Nelson's Pillar, 300 pints have to be filled and ready on the counter when the doors open at 2 o'clock on Sundays.  The assistants get no compensation for the extra time they have to work outside of the regular opening hours. The only time that counts, as far as they are concerned, are the hours set forth in the Bill.  Senator O'Donovan made the point that those people are working after hours, but my information is that they are working before hours as well.  For that reason the Seanad should agree to the suggestion made by Senator Foran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether Senators are really serious in discussing this matter again.  I do not even know whether we are in order in doing so.  We seemed to have reached unanimous agreement on the last day, and now we are discussing the possibility of going back on that decision.  I cannot see any consistency in supporting an amendment to have an opening from 2 o'clock to 6 o'clock, a continuous four hours, as Senator Campbell has done, and at the same time criticising the Bill as giving increased facilities for drinking. The Senator cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither can anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inconsistent to support longer opening hours on Sundays <Col N="1453" /> and yet to criticise this Bill for creating greater drinking facilities.  I maintain that on the last day we were practically unanimous in regard to those hours.  I speak for the general public, as I interpret their wishes, and, as I said on the last occasion, I speak also for those amongst the grocers' assistants who are members of the <Col N="1454" /> G.A.A.  I supported an earlier amendment that the opening be from 2 o'clock to 3 o'clock only, and that was not agreed upon.  Now, after full agreement the last day, we are wasting our time discussing this proposal to-day. I hope we will not waste any further time on this discussion.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared carried.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 3, Section 5, to delete paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) and substitute three paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  by the deletion from subsection (1) thereof of all words after the words &ldquo;save and except&rdquo;, and the insertion in that subsection of the following words in lieu of the said words so deleted, that is to say, &ldquo;if such premises are situate in a county borough, between the hours of 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock in the morning on week days, or, if such premises are not situate in a county borough, between the hours of 9 o'clock and half-past 10 o'clock in the morning on week days during a period of summer time and between the hours of 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock in the morning on week days during any period which is not a period of summer time,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(b)  by the insertion in subsection (2) thereof, after the words &ldquo;off-licence is attached&rdquo;, of the words and brackets &ldquo;(other than premises to which a wine retailer's off-licence within the meaning of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, and no other off-licence is attached&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(c)  by the deletion from subsection (2) thereof of all words after the words &ldquo;save and except&rdquo; and the insertion in that subsection of the following words in lieu of the said words so deleted, that is to say, &ldquo;if such premises are situate in a county borough, between the hours of 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock in the morning on week days and between the hours of half-past 2 o'clock and half-past 3 o'clock in the afternoon on week days or, if such premises are not situate in a county borough, <Col N="1455" /> between the hours of 9 o'clock and half-past 10 o'clock in the morning on week days during a period of summer time and between the hours of 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock in the morning on week days during any period which is not a period of summer time&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This is a consequential amendment.  Section 3 of the 1927 Act provides that all licensed premises which do a mixed trade may open for non-licensed business between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. on weekdays and that premises with an off-licence may open for such business during the afternoon closing hour.

      <P>When we discussed this Bill, on the last day and an amendment by Senator Conlon had been put, I was twitted with not saying &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; in a loud voice as a sort of Greek chorus to his rather tragic &ldquo;Tá&rdquo;.  I am not so much interested in what one of our newspapers called Seanad cheese-paring.  I have always tried, as far as I could, to see that the law would correspond as closely as it possibly could to what one could get people to obey.  I remember some years ago, when there was a Traffic Bill before the House in Committee, certain Senators with an elaborate solemnity reduced the pace at which buses would be allowed to travel from 35 miles an hour to 30.  With great enthusiasm, on the Report Stage, I got the speed limit back to 35.  I thought it was better that the limit should be kept as close as possible to what you might expect people reasonably to obey.  The majority of Senators, and certainly the general public, knew that what subsequently would <Col N="1456" /> happen was that buses would travel at 50 and 60 miles an hour, quite regardless of the law.  I often wonder whether the expression &ldquo;more honoured in the breach than in the observance&rdquo; was not devised by some clever person to try to describe the relations that existed between a large number of people in Ireland and the intoxicating liquor laws.  I cannot go into cut and dried percentages as Senator O'Donovan did, because I imagine there are about 1,000,000 people involved, and it is very difficult to get accurate information, but there are undoubtedly large numbers of people in Ireland who unhesitatingly set out to break the liquor laws and succeed in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are large numbers of people who, while not particularly anxious to break the licensing laws, if they find themselves in company where it is easy to do it, will do so unhesitatingly. There are large numbers of people who, for private reasons, do not wish to break the liquor laws for fear that it would damage them in some way or other, but who hold them in contempt and derision; and there is also a large number of people who do not care either way, and who take no particular interest.  To none of these people is it an anti-social act to break the liquor laws.  We know perfectly well that the liquor laws are ridiculed all the time in pictures and cartoons, and laughed at in articles in papers and magazines, and that they are the subject of jokes and sketches and plays. For the last eight weeks there has been a one-act play performing in one of our principal theatres of which the high-light is this idea.  It depicts a respectable publican and two of his cronies having a quiet time drinking in the pub after hours.  There is nothing in that, of course, to arouse the interest of the audience.  It is quite ordinary and commonplace.  But after a bit the peaceful scene is disturbed by a knock and by the entrance of a Civic Guard.  Instantly, of course, the interest of the audience is aroused, and this Civic Guard enters to interfere with respectable, quiet citizens going about their ordinary, lawful occasions. The audience immediately takes sides, <Col N="1457" /> and I have not the slightest doubt in saying that down to the last teetotaller they are 100 per cent. in favour of the publican.  This publican&mdash;I always regard the publicans as a comparatively simple sort of people who take their wives and families out in the pony and trap on Sundays&mdash;displayed great guile, acquired, no doubt, through years of association with the public.  He places a large glass of foaming porter adjacent to the elbow of the Civic Guard, and proceeds to tell a story about some friends of his who had a terrible journey across a desert, describing, with horrific detail, blazing sand and the stifling heat, the exhaustion of the men and the lack of vegetation.  The audience, while they listen to the story, fix every eye on the Civic Guard to see the first indication of the arm of the law being undermined.</P>
    <P>Sure enough, he very quickly gives a sigh, and we see him pass his finger between his neck and his collar and shortly afterwards pass his tongue over his lips.  The whole audience, with a sigh of relief, realises that there is nothing left but to give him the <i>coup de grace.</i>  The thing is over when the Guard seizes the glass of porter, drains it down, and asks if there is any objection to giving them a few bars of &ldquo;Galway Bay.&rdquo;  However, that is the end of the play, and the audience are perfectly certain, as you would expect them to be, that the Civic Guard has been ruined in his loyalty to his duty and to the State, and that a perfectly respectable publican has won out, and that their attitude towards these unsuitable licensing laws has been entirely vindicated.</P>
    <P>The liquor laws that we have here are, as everybody knows, a hang-over from the British days.  They are only to be found, as far as I can discover, in the old world, in dependencies, colonies, dominions, and places of that kind, wherever the flag flies, or, metaphorically speaking, wherever the map is coloured red.  They are the most British of British laws.  I am not one of those who would worry about that particularly, if they were good laws. I have never felt that my patriotism suffers very much because people play <Col N="1458" /> foreign games, or that my love of country would deteriorate in any way if telegram forms or pillar boxes had retained their pristine colour.  But for those who do feel very strongly on the subject, it must seem at some stage that if the things that have been said here, and the things that have been implied, are true&mdash;and I do not admit that they are&mdash;all that stands between them and the inevitable debauchery of the Irish people are these particular licensing laws.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that we have never looked at the question of licensing laws from the viewpoint of their effect on the Civic Guards.  We know, of course, that very large numbers of Guards have to be employed to defend these laws against the people and that considerable sums are spent every week in carrying out these duties.  It is a great credit to the Guards that it is taken for granted that they will always do their duty, but it must be a tremendous strain on them.  I do not suggest that the attitude of the Civic Guards to the licensing laws should be the basis for the laws that we should enact, but I do feel that it would be rather a sounder basis than the fact that some individual person had been personally incommoded during his Saturday night peregrinations on a tram-car.</P>
    <P>There is another point of view from which I disapprove of the licensing laws, and that is because there are different kinds of trading, and no distinction is made between the trades at all, though there is no point of contact between them.  There is what is known as stand-up drinking and also what is described as sit-down drinking. By stand-up drinking I mean the trade which is done in bars, theatres and hotels, and the other kind is the drinking that is done in connection with a cooked meal in a recognised restaurant. There is a tremendous distinction between those two trades, but there are exactly the same laws for both.  For one thing, stand-up drinking concerns spirits and beers almost exclusively, and wine is invariably taken in sit-down drinking.  There has always been an element of romance about drinking <Col N="1459" /> wine.  We cannot, of course, always have the conditions laid down by Omar Khayyám, but &ldquo;a jug of wine and thou&rdquo; in Jammets or the Dolphin is not so bad when all is said and done.</P>
    <P>There is another big distinction which is rather vital from my point of view, and that is that the sitting-down drinking is usually indulged in by people of rather better means than those who engage in the standing-up drinking.  Consequently, if you tried to legislate for this trade, which is totally different from the other trade, you would be told that it was not democratic to make a distinction between the well-to-do and the not-so-well-to-do.  That whole principle has gone completely overboard because we have already legislated in favour of the better-paid Dublin employee as against the less well-paid country person in the matter of Sunday opening. I do not feel that the question of democracy is concerned where it is a distinct trade.  There is also the question of the tourist traffic.  If our tourist traffic is to be confined entirely to charabanc trips for the denizens of Blackpool then there is nothing further to be done, but if we look to a rather better tourist trade we should try to provide tourists with such facilities as they are accustomed to at home and in every other country.  The Minister was a little wrong in his comment on the tourist.  He said in effect, that what was good enough for the Irish was good enough for the tourist.</P>

      <P>I do not at all think they have.  Certainly I can remember immediately before the war French touring cars going about County Wicklow.  They stayed late in the mountains to get the most they could out of the summer's day, and they came back to the city just as they would to any other city in the world, looking for some place where they could have food, wine, and perhaps music.  There is absolutely nothing of that kind in Dublin because the <Col N="1460" /> restaurants that have licences cannot open after 10 o'clock.  I have dealt with the principal points.  I feel sure the Minister will not agree with me, that there are very large numbers of people, who, one way or another, treat the law with contempt.  If what I say is true the Minister ought to be the last person to know anything about it, but I think he will agree with me that we are not a drunken people.  He will agree with me still further that if we were a drunken people the amount of time that is provided for people to get drunk is ample for that purpose. The Minister may not drink but at least he knows that if I or anybody else desired to get drunk or was inclined to get drunk the time provided by the 10 o'clock closing is ample in which to do so.  It cannot be said that time is what I would call the essence of the contract.  Our principal fault is perversity, very largely due to our history.  Too much puritanism and too much grandmotherly legislation for a people as perverse as we are is, I believe, a very great risk.</P>
      <P>I have tried the patience of the House, but I wish to make a few suggestions as to what ought to be the lines on which we should proceed if there is going to be future legislation. First of all, I think the quality of many of our drinks is unnecessarily potent.  I believe that we could reduce the potency of these drinks.  In other countries they have tried to create a balance either by rationing drink or reducing the potency.  I do not think rationing would work here, but we could reduce the potency of the drinks, and in regard to punishment, especially in motor accidents, in which drink is a factor, the expression &ldquo;under the influence of drink&rdquo; should not be used but instead we should use &ldquo;drink taken&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe if the punishments were more severe, there would be less people doing things they should not do when under the influence of drink.  I think also that there should be a sort of premises test, especially in matters of hygiene.  In many public houses conditions of that kind are too revolting to talk about.  The premises should be made as suitable as possible.  The more splendid the surroundings in all <Col N="1461" /> probability the more splendidly people would behave.  If there were a test of that kind in regard to premises it might have the effect of putting out of business many small houses that are little better than shebeens.  I believe that, provided certain steps were taken, there should be ample supplies, ample time in which to drink and ample accommodation.</P>

      <P>A play has been referred to and that play is over to-night, so that there is very little time if Senators want to see it.  I do not intend to develop that.  I want to say this: that this is a very good Bill in many ways, and the principal way in which it is good, and the principal feature in it is this effort to do away with the awful <i>bona fide</i> or alleged <i>bona fide</i> traffic around the City of Dublin.  I believe that it will go a long way to stop that grave abuse.  I do not know whether the statements made by Senator Robinson apply to the modern public house.  The modern public house is a place of light and gaiety and all the rest, something approaching the German beer garden, except that in the cities it is under cover.  I think the Minister made a mistake when he did not go in for more uniformity in Sunday opening.  Dual Sunday opening is another good feature in the Bill which will be welcomed by the people generally.  It will help family life very much on Sunday afternoons. It is unfortunate that the Minister did not make it four hours instead of the three and a half hours. I hope that when the Bill comes into operation the charges alleged by Senator Robinson will not be as evident as they are now.  I hope that when it is law it will be insisted upon and that people will be made to obey the law.  I welcome the Bill for the very good features that are in it but, of course, we cannot have matters all our own way.</P>

      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to express my personal appreciation of the very fair and extremely satisfactory way the Minister has acted through these <Col N="1462" /> debates.  He has tried to help the Seanad, and he has, I think, made it possible for us to try to make improvements in the Bill which, I very much hope, he will be able to carry through the other House.</P>
      <P>The speech of Senator Robinson was, to my mind, a very good example of the great advantages that would accrue if we had no Whips in this House on all measures.  Though I do not by any means agree with him entirely, I have a good deal of sympathy with his point of view.  I was particularly glad to hear from his side of the House a protest against grandmotherly legislation.  I hope that we shall hear the Senator again on that subject.  He will have quite a lot of opportunities of speaking on it, judging by the extension of Government powers which we are getting from almost every Minister.  I am sure that if the Senator speaks again on the subject he will be listened to with eagerness.  I agree with him in this, that I would like to see the problem of intemperance or temperance, whatever way one cares to look at it, dealt with from the national point of view by some sincere and capable body of persons, a body forgetting, for the time being, what we have inherited from England in the way of licensing legislation, and seeing whether it is not possible to get the question viewed in a way that would not cause any risk, at the same time not necessarily tying ourselves up to the licensing laws which are a heritage of the past.  If you had to start by immediately abolishing the licensing laws I would have to join issue with the Senator on that.  I think it would be far too dangerous to do that, and I do not think the Senator really meant it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that on the whole this is a good Bill.  I am sure that every member of the House, representing every interest, hopes that the Minister will be able to deal with the so-called <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  I think we are unanimous as far as that is concerned. Personally, I would like if the Bill were a bit more strict than it is.  We all realise that the Minister has tackled this problem in a fair way.  He has not <Col N="1463" /> allowed his own prejudices&mdash;I do not know whether he is a teetotaller or not &mdash;unduly to influence him in dealing with the Bill.  Possibly Senator Robinson does not know that there are some people who sit down to meals and drink water.  I simply mention that because he did not include water amongst the drinks to which he referred.</P>

      <P>I desire to support Senator Robinson on one point, but I am not so satisfied in regard to another of his points.  His first point was that the better a public house is&mdash;in its appointments&mdash;the better will be the conduct in it.  In England, the public houses are, for the most part, tied to certain breweries both from the point of view of trade and in regard to the renewal of their licences.  These breweries are always putting money aside for replacements and improvements.  In this country a licence is issued to a respectable man, quite regardless of the condition of his premises.  I feel it is time that legislation was introduced to try to bring about an improvement in the condition of the licensed houses in which our citizens take their refreshments.  In England and in France, the premises in which refreshments are taken are conducted in a most orderly way.  I hope the Minister will consider in what way pressure could be brought to bear to bring about an improvement in the licensed premises in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Robinson in the point he made in regard to the dilution of the various kinds of drinks served in this country. For example, John Jameson's whiskey, as sold in England, is reduced in strength by 30 per cent. compared to what we get here.  That spoils the quality of it altogether.  Another thing that leads to a lot of dissatisfaction in England is that you have various kinds of measures.  That leads to all sorts of dishonesty so far as the customer is concerned.  I think that a change in either direction would be wrong from the point of view of our people.</P>

      <P>The Minister has had a troublesome time in getting this Bill through the two Houses to its <Col N="1464" /> present stage, but I think that he must have felt repaid for his trouble by the welcome that, in general, it got from this House.  It seems to me that in particular he must have felt repaid by the speech that we have just heard from Senator Robinson.  It was quite a stimulating speech, just as potent as any of the liquors that we have been hearing so much about.  When listening to the Senator I could not help thinking of a certain Abbey described by Rabelais in which there was but one rule: everyone could do as he pleased.  In regard to the liquor laws. Senator Robinson pleaded that everybody should be allowed to do as he pleased.  But, unfortunately, human nature being what it is, both inside and outside Abbeys, that is not quite possible, and human nature cannot be allowed to do as it pleases.  Hence Bills such as the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to restrictions on the sale of intoxicating liquors, and especially the very potent ones that are general in this country, I know, of course, that the people of no nation can be made sober by legislation, but people can be helped to sobriety by legislation. The laws can be so framed that temptations may be lessened and restrictions put on abuses such as those that have developed around the so-called <i>bona fide</i> trade.  As well as the promotion of such legislation we must also undertake the process of educating our people to respect the law.  I do not take very seriously the stage farce to which the Senator referred about the Civic Guard and the bottle of stout.  If the publican's discourse had such an effect on the Civic Guard, then it would seem to me that it would have a similar effect on the audience and would have the effect of emptying the theatre.  I do not think, as I said, that we should take these quips and jokes very seriously.  When I was young we had many stories published in <i>The Shamrock</i> and similar journals about the gauger and of the ruses taken to circumvent his activities.  I suppose a modernisation of these stories centres round the Civic Guards visiting public houses during unlawful hours.  That does not mean that we are encouraging people to break the laws or are in our hearts on the side <Col N="1465" /> of the law-breakers.  The laws are of our own making, and are made to be observed.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson thinks that this legislation is a mere copying of English legislation.  I do not think so at all, though, personally, I would have no objection to copying English legislation, or good legislation from any other country, if we were likely to get good tips from it.  What we should aim at is making laws for the good of our people.  By a process of education we should strive to make our people realise that these laws are made for their good, and that they should have respect for them.  Though I do not think the Minister is quite satisfied with the Bill as it stands, still I believe everybody must admit that it is going a long way to solve some very serious problems.  We all hope that it will have the effect of contributing to the happiness of our people's homes. No woman can be indifferent to that aspect of the question, and in the name of my sisters, I desire to thank the Minister for having introduced it.</P>

      <P>I do not desire to delay the House except to pay a tribute to the Minister's forbearance while this Bill was under consideration. While we have some grievance left in respect of the hours, I do not think we have any grievance against the Minister for the manner in which he dealt with this problem.  The Bill itself has been worth while, if only for the fact that it cuts out all drinking between midnight and 6 o'clock in the morning.  I believe the Bill is worth while for that reform alone.  Much of a certain type of crime was due to drinking between those hours.  If that has been wiped out now the Bill will have been justified.  So far as hours are concerned, Senator O'Donovan accused me of being inconsistent. I was inconsistent in the interests of the industry as a whole.  I understand that certain decisions have been taken in regard to this Bill, but I hope they will not be brought into effect.  If I have been inconsistent it was in the interests of peace and harmony in this industry. We have no complaint about the licensed grocers and vintners as <Col N="1466" /> a whole.  They manage their business well having regard to the circumstances in which they have to conduct it, and I am sorry, for that reason, that the hours were not acceded to merely for the reason that it would have placated the assistants, and given them those four hours on Sundays. We have been inconsistent merely for that reason, and I only wish to compliment the Minister on his patience and forbearance and to congratulate him on bringing this very admirable piece of legislation into effect.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words, although I know little about public houses.  I am not going to say that I have never been in one, but I do not think I have been in a public house half a dozen times in my life, and even after this Bill I would not care to be subjected to an examination on what the licensing hours are.  I would like to say that I do not see why our public houses should not be more of the nature of real clubs instead of being places where people get drink only.  If you go into a small village and want a cup of tea or some light refreshment you have great difficulty in procuring it, but you can get all kinds of drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is wrong, and that we should try to encourage such places to keep general refreshments as well as strong drink.  The public house should be a place into which families should be able to go, something more in the nature of a café or a club in the real sense of the word than a mere drinking place.  One would imagine that well-managed places would keep that ideal in view.  That seems to be as far as progress is feasible at present.  It is at least the direction in which we could work.  I do not know to what extent it can be helped by legislation, but public opinion should demand not only mixed houses, but places where the main inducement of the management is not the sale of drink.  I think that idea is implicit in the trust houses in England&mdash;the manager's profits do not depend on the amount of drink he sells.  I imagine here the test would not apply.  The guiding influence of <Col N="1467" /> the person who runs a public house seems to be to avoid trouble.  He has simply to uncork a bottle and pour out the drink, whereas to provide coffee and tea and other things means trouble.  I would like to join in the tributes paid to the Minister for the accommodating manner in which he has met the House, and I would like to see the same kindly spirit brought into a great deal of other legislation that comes before us.</P>

      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has received suggestions and done his best to produce a measure that is best in the interests of everybody.  I was glad to hear Senator Robinson's speech.  I would like to hear the Senator speaking more frequently.  His remarks were very humorous and, at the same time, serious, but I do not know whether he intended to cast any reflection on the Civic Guards in the story which he told about the glass of foaming porter and the publican.  Incidents of that sort may occur, but they would be isolated ones and not at all applicable generally.  The Civic Guards are a very fine body of men, and I am sure he did not mean to suggest anything else.  They are human but, generally speaking, they endeavour and have succeeded in carrying out the law in an excellent manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the Committee and Report Stages, I moved certain amendments.  Senator Campbell made a very nice reference which I greatly appreciate.  Some of us might have had our little passages, but that is all over and we are all pleased with the results.  I was forced into a certain position.  The statement has been made that I was obviously representing the licensed trade.  If that were so, I would have no apology whatever to make, but the fact is that I was drawn into a position by virtue of the fact that there are two sides to every story, and there is no doubt that the advocates of the assistants were very well represented here.  I held that it was not a question of the hours the assistants would work or what would suit the publicans either, but that we <Col N="1468" /> wanted to do the best we could in the general interest.  Seeing that that was the position and nobody was saying anything for the other side of the case, I took it up as well as I could.  By far the greater number of publicans are people who engage one, two or three assistants and the number of hours at which houses have to be kept open as compared with the number of hours worked by each assistant differs a great deal.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that there was a case to be made for those publicans and that the granting of an extra half-hour to a man with only one or two assistants would leave him with no leisure at all.  I was doing my best, in accordance with my views, to do justice, and to give fair play to all sections.  I hope the Bill will be the means of doing a lot of good.  It will close down public houses between midnight and 6 in the morning.  There were places around Dublin where houses opened at midnight on Sunday night after closing at 8 the same evening.  It is a good thing to have that stopped.  I hope that the Bill will become law in practically the same form as it leaves this House.  Very little change that would be of any benefit can be made in the Dáil, and I hope the Minister will convey the views of this House there.</P>

      <P>I rise to join with Senator Robinson in hoping that some day the whole question of our licensing legislation will be brought under review, and that we will proceed on entirely different lines from what I might describe as the patch-work quilt of licensing laws we have inherited over a period of years from a country where conditions are not by any means necessarily the same as they are here.  I would like to join in the tribute to the Minister for the way he handled this Bill in the House, and for the accommodating manner in which he received all suggestions.  As regards the Bill itself, I can only say this about it, that the Minister has succeeded in making certain improvements. He has made improvements in regard to the <i>bona fide</i> trade by providing for a complete shut-down at midnight.  He has made improvements <Col N="1469" /> which will abolish <i>bona fide</i> abuses in the neighbourhood of Dublin.  He has also given much more reasonable facilities in the county borough areas on Sundays.</P>
      <P>But the fact of the matter is that, despite those improvements, the 1927 Act, in my opinion, was a bad Act, and the best that can be said for this Bill is that it is an improvement on that Act.  Even if the Minister had accepted my suggestion that the <i>bona fide</i> traffic should be abolished under all circumstances, and had adopted a system of general opening throughout the country on Sundays, I would still maintain that the Bill was only a slight improvement on the 1927 Act.  I do not think we will ever have a really satisfactory licensing code, and one which will have the respect of the public in this country, until we adopt some suggestion such as Senator Robinson has made, and scrap all our patchwork licensing legislation and start afresh on new and more reasonable lines.</P>

      <P>I said at one stage during the debate that I wished I had had the luck to bring the Bill in here in the first instance, because, having gone to the other House, I felt that I was a bird alone.  At one stage I actually cried out to ask if there was anyone in the House to help me at all. I got the very prompt response that I was trying to do something which was not the business of Parliament&mdash;that I was trying to make people saints by legislation.  Here, in this House, I found far more extreme views than I have.  I would not agree with those either, but I must say that, taking the debate generally here, I found much more support of my views than I found in the other House.  If I had got that support in the other House, I would have stuck to my proposal to do away with the <i>bona fide</i> business altogether except on Sundays, because I believe it is a complete farce.  It simply meant and means that, I would say, in 90 per cent. of the cases people are drinking outside the county boroughs later than they are really entitled to drink.  They went out for no other purpose, but the trouble was to prove that.  We could not prove it.  To the extent to which it <Col N="1470" /> is possible to do that now, the Bill is a great improvement.  Personally, I should prefer to have every place open until 12 o'clock, rather than that they should close in one place and remain open in another, because I know that what is called the <i>bona fide</i> trade is not a genuine one.  That is why I must admit that I was disappointed&mdash; although I did want the 10 o'clock closing in the cities&mdash;when the half hour was knocked off in the cities. People have to stop drinking now at 10 o'clock in the cities, but if they go out to a place like Coolock or Templeogue they can drink until 12 o'clock.  The fact that there is a two hours' gap makes it more likely that that will happen.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I would say that the Bill is an improvement on the 1927 Act, and I am pleased that that is so. When I left the other House I felt that I really had got public opinion on the matter; I do not know anywhere else I could get it, because the members there are representatives of all classes, elected by the people.  On the matter of the <i>bona fide</i> business, I felt that I was probably a little bit too extreme, and that there was no use in trying to abolish it when public opinion was against its abolishment.  I believe that I would have fared better if I had started here in this House, but, having agreed in the Dáil to let the <i>bona fide</i> trade continue until 12 o'clock, I did not feel justified in turning it down when I arrived in this House, although that was my own personal wish.  Similarly, when I go back to the Dáil I will try to get them to accept what was passed here.  I do not like the difference between 10 o'clock and 10.30; it rather spoils the Bill, but it cannot be helped.  It was well debated here, and there was a division on that point.  As far as I can, I will press the acceptance of the amendments put in by the Seanad, and I hope they will be agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to thank Senators for the way they received me.  It is not usual to get bouquets thrown at one like that, but this debate particularly ought to be, and I think on the whole was, on a non-party basis; the matter was approached on its merits.  My object <Col N="1471" /> simply was to deal with a grievance.  I was not going to have a general revision of the licensing code, because I realised that a point of view like that expressed by Senator Robinson would have to be adverted to, and if there was anything of that kind being done something more than a Bill introduced by a Minister would be needed; there would have to be a general inquiry, and all the rest of it. All I was hoping to do was to deal with a clear abuse, and that was drinking at night time.  It may continue, but I hope it will not.  I hope that the Civic Guards and the justices will deal severely with any cases of drinking after hours.  Up to the present, there was the excuse that you could not tell whether the person was entitled to be there or not.  Now, there is no excuse.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that, from 12 midnight until 6 o'clock, no person has the right to be drinking on licensed premises. I think the play to which Senator Robinson referred would be much better without that sort of thing, and I do not think it is quite true.  There may be an odd case where the Civic Guards will do that, but on the whole they do their duty as well as possible. You have exceptions all right; there will be a chance of dealing with those exceptions.  I am saying this because I want the Civic Guards and the justices throughout the country to realise that we are in earnest about this matter; we want to put down this nasty sort of drinking that goes on.  In conclusion, I want to thank the Senators for the reception they have given me.</P>

    <P>I put down this amendment to try to get the Minister to be more frank with us about his intentions with regard to this hospital.  I really find it hard adequately to deal with the subject within the ambit of this Bill, because the matters I have in mind raise the whole question of hospital policy, in which the Government plays a really large part and has a dominating power.  In this Bill and in the powers that the hospital is given under this Bill, you see the dangers of possibly unfair discrimination under the present practice.  The Hospitals Commission in their first report outlined a comprehensive policy for all the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>At the moment, I am concerned only with the hospitals in the City of Dublin, but the report to which I have referred outlined a comprehensive policy.  A feature of that policy was amalgamation of certain hospitals, rebuilding in other cases, and&mdash;the Minister will agree that this is very important&mdash;the provision of a substantial number of additional beds.  I think it will be admitted by everybody that the need for additional beds is far greater now, some eight years afterwards. Under this measure, there is the danger that one hospital can, and I am afraid will, get an unfair priority with regard to its finances.  It would be all right if there were plenty of money for everybody, and if all those schemes could proceed concurrently, but I think it is now admitted that that is not likely in the near future&mdash; nor for many years to come.</P>
    <P>As I stated on the Committee Stage, the bulk of the capital now in the hands of the hospitals trustees-I think that is the right word; the terms are rather confusing&mdash;is required for deficits.  It may not be all exhausted, but it is approaching the stage when the income from the £8,000,000 will be needed for deficits.  The deficits are increasing and, in view of the rising cost of everything, they are likely to increase.  I feel very strongly that there is a danger that the Minister may <Col N="1473" /> say: &ldquo;Well, there is only enough money for one hospital and, therefore, I am going to give it to this hospital.&rdquo; I think that would be unfair.  The Minister, I think, is inclined to say: &ldquo;You cannot have a lot of hospitals operating concurrently if there is no money to support them and it would be much better in the interests of the sick poor that any effort feasible should be concentrated in one hospital.  This being a sort of pet of my own, I am rather inclined to give it to that hospital.&rdquo;  I think on the face of it that is unfair. You must have regard to a number of needs.  I do not know that the need in the case of the Richmond Hospital for reconstruction and modernisation is any greater than in the case of the other hospitals.  I know that under this fortuitous system of finance that we have provided there is a dilemma, but I think the Minister ought to give the undertaking asked for in this amendment.  Before he gives priority to the Richmond Hospital, he ought to consider the claims of other hospitals which have formulated schemes, and he should not let himself get into a position in which he is inclined to favour one hospital because it is what might be called a State hospital.  I think he might quite logically say: &ldquo;This is a State hospital; in the past it has been financed largely out of State funds.  I should be inclined to ask the State to finance it and let this hospital be subject to State finance and let the other hospitals have their share of the sweepstakes money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put this amendment down so that the Minister might give us, at least for what it is worth, an undertaking that he is not going automatically to let this hospital get control of any limited amount of money that is available and that he is going to make some effort to try to give a fair apportionment on the different claims.  It is an essentially complicated problem because it might be argued that if you are going to be faced in the next ten years with stringent finance or if you are going to rely entirely on the sweepstakes and sweepstakes do not come up to expectations and fall far behind what they did in pre-war years, you might say: &ldquo;It is better to have no rebuilding at all; it is better to give the existing <Col N="1474" /> hospitals according to their needs what they want, to bring themselves up to date on their present sites.&rdquo;  I cannot help feeling that circumstances may arise when that would be the most sensible proceeding.  I do not want to enlarge on the general question of hospitals.  I have a motion on the Order Paper on which I hope to deal with the matter comprehensively, but I hope I have said enough to indicate what I have in mind on this point and that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to say something to relieve my anxiety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to add to what Senator Sir John Keane has stated.  I think he has done an important service by drawing attention to the abnormality of the present proceeding. The Minister has full power to make what grants he thinks fit from the Hospitals Trust Funds and, therefore, he has whatever power this section proposes to give him.  I think it is the first time in the history of disbursements by the Minister from the Hospitals Trust Funds that he seeks power to bind himself by Act of Parliament in advance to make a certain grant.  He has power under the existing Act, but here we have, as Senator Sir John Keane has pointed out, a section which will tie his hands.  On his own motion, he will tie himself in advance by statute to limit his discretion as to what grants he is to give, as empowered by another statute.  I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary in this House or, as far as I know, in the other House gave any reason for this alteration in the usual procedure. There is the other point that I think is objectionable, that not merely are the hands of the present Minister tied but the hands of any future Minister are also tied.  The hands of future Ministers are tied in advance by statute, and they can only escape from these shackles by coming to Parliament again and having the section repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet another point to which I should like to call attention is that there have been commitments to many other institutions with regard to rebuilding or the establishment of new hospitals. Probably Senators are aware that the main part of the scheme of the <Col N="1475" /> Hospitals Commission for the City of Dublin was the establishment of four large hospitals in or near the city. One of them, the Richmond, on its present site was to form a nucleus which was to be later enlarged.  Another was the Mater Misericordiæ Hospital, also on the north side of the city, which was to be enlarged to hold a considerable number of patients.  Another was St. Vincent's Hospital, on some site on the south side of the city&mdash;whether it was a site which they themselves had chosen at some time or some other site, I do not know.  The fourth hospital was to be amalgamation of the three small existing hospitals&mdash;Mercer's Hospital, Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital and the Royal City of Dublin Hospital.  These were to be amalgamated into one institution. None of them has a suitable site at present, but a site for such a hospital was under discussion both with the Hospitals Commission and the Dublin Town Planning Committee. No decision as to this site has been come to but the scheme of the Hospitals Commission had received the approval of the Minister, and Bills had actually been drafted to make it possible in case existing statutes bound these hospitals.  The Bills were drafted some years ago and, no doubt, are in safe receptacles in the Custom House. That was the scheme for four main hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now to be put in a position under which he is to be prevented from distributing funds which may be at his disposal, according as he thinks proper.  He is to be tied by this Bill to show preference for this one hospital.  I think that is a grave injustice to the other schemes which have received the approval of the Hospitals Commission.  Presumably the Department has had to employ officers drafting Bills conformable to the wishes of these several hospitals. As the Minister has already the power which the section asks, of distributing funds as he thinks fit, and as the section tends to tie his hands in regard to the exercise of his discretion, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not see any objection to accepting Senator Sir John Keane's amendment.</P>

      <P>The amendment sets out, as the House is aware, that before approving of the scheme the Minister shall have regard to any scheme that may be formulated by other hospitals.  The entire case made in favour of this amendment by Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Rowlette is based on the premise that the Minister may do something in relation to this hospital, because it is a State hospital, that is not altogether proper, and that he will show a leaning towards this hospital which would react rather unfairly against the interests of other hospitals.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane mentioned the possibility of unfair discrimination. I think it is rather unfair even to suggest the possibility of unfair discrimination in the light of the fact that the Minister has had the statutory power for the past 11 years, and no charge of unfair discrimination in relation to this hospital has ever been made against the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, apart altogether from the premise upon which the case for it is based, would, in my opinion, achieve no useful purpose at all.  Before the Minister makes a grant to any hospital he has to have regard to a number of things, including matters not embodied in any scheme before him such as the amount of money available in the Hospitals Trust Fund, and the speed at which that fund is being encroached upon either by hospital deficits or by capital charges.  Some scheme that comes before him must, if it is to be implemented at all, get a priority.  There must be some plan under which priorities will be arranged having regard to all the factors entering into the problem.  The financial factors are bound to have a big determining influence <Col N="1477" /> in deciding what particular scheme should be permitted to operate if there are not sufficient funds in the Hospitals Trust Fund to permit all schemes to become operative at the same time.  Regard also will have to be had to the geographical distribution of existing institutions, and to how far the public needs are being met by existing institutions. It may be that some of the existing hospitals are in reasonably good condition of structural repair, that they may be well equipped as compared with others.  Other hospitals may be in a completely dilapidated condition, and such a factor would have to be taken into consideration in deciding whether one or the other would be permitted to proceed.</P>
    <P>The most important factor, however, would be the needs of the community. If you have two or three modern hospitals, so equipped as reasonably to meet the requirements of the community, in one end of the city, and if you have a shortage of bed accommodation in another part of the city to the extent that the poor cannot find admission to the hospitals in that area, you may have to decide deliberately that a hospital in such an area must get the preference, and that while it is desirable, at the earliest possible time, to put the full scheme of hospitalisation, recommended by the Hospitals Commission and accepted by the Minister, into operation, the most urgent parts of that scheme must be given priority, and the Minister must, in all reason, be given the right to determine what the urgent needs are in any particular area.</P>
    <P>Apart from anything I have said regarding it, the amendment would be, I think, unworkable if incorporated in the Bill.  Hospitals might formulate schemes that the Minister would not know anything about at all.  Every scheme formulated is not submitted to the Minister, but every application for a grant has to be submitted to the Hospitals Commission.  If this amendment were passed, the Minister might have to disregard the views of the Hospitals Commission suggesting or recommending that priority should be <Col N="1478" /> given to a particular institution. The authorities of hospitals very often submit unsound schemes &mdash; schemes which, in the present circumstances, should scarcely be considered at all.  If the amendment were to be accepted the Minister would have a statutory obligation, regardless of the merits of the scheme, to have regard to it.  It seems to me that the amendment is unnecessary, that it would be unworkable, and I think that Senator Sir John Keane ought not press it.  If it is carried through this House I would have to oppose it in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that if he did accept the amendment it would not get us much further, but I put it down largely to give an opportunity of expressing my uneasiness about the whole future of hospital policy.  Here you have a vague, grandiose, and, no doubt, idealistic scheme put forward by the Hospitals Commission on most precarious finances.  I am afraid that this is likely to happen, that the Minister will say: &ldquo;Let us go on with one part, anyhow.&rdquo;  Not unfairly, but in his discretion he might say to the Richmond that it was the best one to go on with and he might commit himself perhaps to £500,000 of capital expenditure. Unless the finances of the commission are adequate, the Minister may have to cut down rigorously on all the others in order to finance the Richmond. He will be committed, on the Richmond scheme, to the provision of a sound, good, modern hospital with an increased number of beds, and that will be a commitment from which he cannot escape.  Well, I am afraid that unless he is exceedingly wise and cautious the effect will be that the claims of the other hospitals even for apparatus and, say, better nursing quarters on their present sites will be all held back until this Richmond Hospital is built.  I feel that will be uneven and unfair.  When I say unfair, the Minister will appreciate that I do not say deliberately unfair.  He would not act unfairly, but it would operate unfairly.  I am afraid that that danger is present, but as the Minister says <Col N="1479" /> that even if the amendment were accepted it would not mean anything I will ask the House to let me withdraw it.</P>

Senator Mrs. Concannon on the Third Stage suggested leaving out the possessive case in this.  That would interpret more correctly the idea of the Oireachtas in naming this Bill, and in addition it would make for euphony.  If the name of the Hospital were St. Laurence's Hospital, no one would be aware that the hospital was named after Ireland's great native saint, Lorcán O Tuathail, because there was another Laurence who was a saint.  We venerate Lorcán O Tuathail because he was a great saint and also because he was a great Irishman.  I think to make it in consonance with the idea of the framers of this measure it ought to be &ldquo;Ospidéal Lorcáin Naomhtha O Tuathail&rdquo; and in English &ldquo;Saint Laurence O'Toole Hospital&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The point at issue on the last occasion was as to whether the hospital will be called St. Laurence Hospital or St. Laurence's Hospital, and the Bill St. Laurence's Hospital Bill.  It was a question of whether the name should be used in the sense of an adjective or whether the possessive form should be used.  The other question is now introduced for the first time as to whether the surname should be attached.  That was a matter discussed at length in the Dáil.  In fact, it was originally intended that the title of the Bill should include the surname, but for various reasons it was decided in the Dáil that it would be better to omit the surname, the principal reason being that the hospital would be called by an objectionable abbreviation of the surname.  It is not necessary that I should develop that.  On the question whether it ought to be St. Laurence or St. Laurence's we could probably have an interesting academic discussion, but I rather think that there is something more to be conveyed than the adjectival <Col N="1481" /> use of the name would convey. The use of the possessive suggests to me, at any rate, that this hospital would be under the patronage, protection and guardianship of St. Laurence and will, in fact, be St. Laurence's Hospital.  I do not think that to describe the hospital as St. Laurence Hospital conveys just that same idea.  To me it does not.  St. Vincent's Hospital was called St. Vincent's. We have St. Patrick's Guild, St. Mary's Hospital, and in almost every instance the possessive is used. Having considered that aspect fairly fully since the matter was raised by Senator Mrs. Concannon, this amendment was put down in the belief that it was more desirable that it should take this particular form.  I would not be favourably disposed towards introducing the surname.  In the first place, it would be a very unwieldy title; and in the second place, because of that unwieldiness the surname would certainly be abbreviated to an objectionable abbreviation.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask does this, in fact, convey the idea of protection of St. Laurence O'Toole. When you say St. John you do not mean St. John Vianney, St. John of God, or St. John of the Cross but St. John the Evangelist.  There are two saints of this name, St. Lawrence of the Early Eastern Church and St. Laurence O'Toole.  The name St. Laurence means not apparently the saint the Minister talks of, but, as far as I can see, it is putting the hospital under the protection of an early saint in the Eastern Church.  That is quite all right but if you want to put it under the protection of St. Laurence who was a saint here about one thousand years ago, then the name is St. Laurence O'Toole.</P>

St. Lawrence of the Eastern Church had nothing to do with Dublin, but St. Laurence O'Toole was not only a great <Col N="1482" /> saint and an eminent churchman but a great Irishman.  His is a name that has come down for years and was accepted by ancient Dublin whether it was Danish or Norman.  We had St. Laurence's churches, football and hurling clubs and other things.  Nobody is going to misuse the name.  I do not know whether or not I am in order in discussing this.  I certainly think, if we are going to put it under the patronage of anybody, it should be under the patronage of St. Laurence O'Toole.</P>

      <P>On that question, Sir, you were good enough when in the Chair last week, to suggest that a question which I then asked the Parliamentary Secretary might be more properly raised on this stage.  I asked him particularly if he would divulge to the Seanad, what appears to have been kept a grave secret up to the present, the reason why this Bill, which has been hurried so much through this House within the last week or two, was held in reserve for something like two and a half years during its progress through the Dáil.  Presumably, there was a good reason for that procedure. If there was, I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be wise to let the Seanad know what guided him, or the <Col N="1483" /> Minister, in that long delay in the passage of the Bill.  If he is not willing to answer that question, then Senators can only form conjectures which may or may not be true, or which may or may not be complimentary to the discretion of the Minister.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will accept the suggestion that that question may properly be put now, and that he will give an answer to it which will satisfy the Seanad that the Government has acted with due discretion and with due respect to the Oireachtas in this long delay of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I addressed another question to him also which has not been answered, and am, therefore, driven to a particular conclusion in that case.  I asked him whether the view of the Minister, as expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary, that the site for the hospital should be changed to some outside site was on the advice of the Hospitals Commission or not.  That question has not been answered and no information has been given to the House on the matter.  We know, because the information is contained in a public document, that the Hospitals Commission recommended that the new Richmond Hospital should be built as part of the scheme for four large hospitals for the City of Dublin.  As well as I remember, the Hospitals Commission recommended that the present site was convenient and adequate for the purpose. The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that it is not adequate, contrary to the knowledge of many people who probably know the site as well as he or his advisers, and contrary to the opinion expressed some years ago by the Hospitals Commission.  I think we are entitled to ask whether the Hospitals Commission has withdrawn in any way the recommendation it made some years ago in one of its earlier reports, namely, that the new hospital should be built on the present site, which it considered to be both convenient and adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to tell us that the Hospitals Commission has proposed a change of site, or has approved of such a change, well there is no more to be <Col N="1484" /> said on that point by way of criticism. If he cannot tell us that, then we are bound to come to the conclusion that the Hospitals Commission has not changed its attitude or expressed approval of the Department's decision. We know that at one time the advice of the Hospitals Commission was that the site should not be changed.  We also know that at one time that was the opinion of the staff and of the governors of the hospital.  If the Minister has not received any proposal to alter the recommendations and opinions then expressed, we are driven to the conclusion that the Minister and his advisers are, in this matter, acting contrary to the wishes of the people most concerned, and contrary to the recommendations of their official advisers&mdash; the Hospitals Commission.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give us some information on these points to-day.  I pressed him for this information on two or three previous occasions, but was simply put off.  I think that the members of the Seanad are entitled to the information, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will not leave himself and the Minister in the difficulty that they have pushed a Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas by keeping back certain relevant and necessary points in regard to the advisability of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a profound uneasiness about this measure, and must ask the indulgence of the House to say a few words on the Final Stage of it.  The Minister is bound by statute to have recourse to the Hospital Trust Funds if he wants to rebuild this hospital. If he saw fit to ask for State finances for the purpose, he could not do that without getting amending legislation passed.  If I am wrong about that I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me.  Suppose the Minister were to say: &ldquo;Well, now, there is only a certain amount of money; I do not think it is fair to take all the money that is available for the hospital as it is a State hospital, and I think that, perhaps, I should ask the Minister for Finance to provide this and let the other hospitals share in the available sweepstake monery&rdquo;&mdash;<Col N="1485" /> he could not do that.  He is under a statutory obligation to finance this scheme in the manner set out.</P>
      <P>That is what makes me uneasy.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary this: can he give an undertaking that he will do for the other hospitals at least what he has done for this hospital, namely, hasten through the necessary statutory powers for them? He has done that in the case of this hospital, but there are other hospitals which require similar statutory powers. The delays that have occurred in providing them seem to me to be utterly unreasonable.  I cannot say where the blame for that lies, but I think it is only fair to ask the Parliamentary Secretary that he should hasten through the Bills that the other hospitals require so that they may have an equal start, when the time comes, with St. Laurence's Hospital.</P>

      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary was introducing this Bill, he gave us a very interesting historical account of the hospital which it is designed to enlarge and replace. I think he could have gone a little further back, because the building has a longer history and one more appealing than that which he described to us. Because I should like to have some record of its past preserved in the new building, I have intervened at this stage.  The Richmond Hospital is in what used to be called Chapel Ward. It was an old Dominican convent. Before that, it was built for the Benedictines in the reign of James II, and after the Battle of the Boyne they had to leave.  The Dominicans of Galway, who had been in existence during the penal years, sent a little colony to Dublin, and they occupied that old convent and stayed there for more than a century.  We have lost so much of our history that these little scraps of it, especially ones that are of such great interest, should not be forgotten, and I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would see that St. Dominic and St. Benedict have their little share in the dedication of some of the wards, so as to preserve this historical continuity. I do not want to take from St. Laurence O'Toole the honour that <Col N="1486" /> is due to him in the Archdiocese dedicated to him, but the point that occurred to me is whether St. Laurence can really be St. Laurence O'Toole. I think that the saints are officially known by their titles in the calendar&mdash; Senator Fitzgerald would know more than I do about that.  If it is so, we are miscalling St. Laurence O'Toole by giving him the title of St. Laurence. Because we are so young as a nation, it is important that we should be particular about the correct usage, and that is why I am calling the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to it.</P>

As he knows, the old Dublin Union site lies at the north of those hospitals and the entrance is now used as the Morning Star Hostel.  In my opinion, a new hospital should have a bright and cheery outlook if possible, and be in the best surroundings.  The surroundings there are neither bright nor cheery, and possibly on reconsideration of the whole situation, the Hospitals Commission may be entitled to change their mind the same as many of us do.</P>

      <P>Senator Rowlette raises the question of why consideration of this Bill was adjourned, it having been brought before the Dáil some two or three years ago and having been in a condition of suspended animation since.  The Bill was not proceeded with in the Dáil at the request of the Opposition.  It was introduced shortly after the outbreak of the war, and was looked upon as being contentious and it was considered that in these early stages contentious legislation should not be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>In the interval developments took place that seemed to establish fairly definitely the necessity for proceeding with this legislation. As I stated on the earlier stages in this House, neither the board of governors of the hospital, nor the Minister, had power to acquire a site.  Let the time be what it may when we will be able to resume hospital reconstruction in this country, anybody who has given any thought to this subject at all will agree that the planning of a hospital of 500 or 600 beds is a very tedious project.  You cannot begin to plan, until you have acquired the site.  Consequently, assuming that it would take three years&mdash;and that is the minimum to prepare the plans of this or any other hospital in the city&mdash;if we were to be ready to commence operations at the end of that three years, it would now be necessary to acquire a site, and if this crisis was over in three years, and materials and funds were available, we could then proceed to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other considerations <Col N="1488" /> bearing on the question.  In the intervening period some of these old buildings that are included in the property &mdash;the House of Industry Institutions&mdash; are in a very bad state of repair, some of them in a condition approximating to being a danger to the public.  In fact, proceedings have been instituted by a local authority here in the city against the board of governors because of the condition of some of these buildings. The actual position under the Act of 1856 is that the board of governors has power of management and power of management only.  They had no power to demolish buildings or to carry out structural alterations or repairs.  In so far as the property was vested in the Commissioners of Public Works, the Commissioners could carry out alterations and repairs, but without a full realisation of the statutory limitation on the powers of the board of governors, the board of governors acquired property.  It is more than doubtful at the present time if they are the rightful owners of the property purchased, inasmuch as the Act of 1856 definitely defined their powers and these powers did not include the power of acquiring property.  Consequently, the board were in the dilemma that they were being prosecuted because of the insanitary and dangerous condition of certain buildings they had acquired at a time when they had no right to acquire property, and no statutory power to deal with derelict buildings. That seemed to be rather a good reason why the necessary statutory powers should be provided by means of an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There were other considerations which were of lesser importance. Under the Act of 1856, all increases in salaries and such matters had to have the sanction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and the Minister for Finance.  Again, without a full realisation of the limitation of their statutory powers, the salaries of various officials were increased without sanction.  The matter came to light when some of those officials were due to retire, and it was found that, within the law, they could be retired only on the salary as last sanctioned by the Ministers. <Col N="1489" /> That did not affect a very big number of the officers or employees of the committee of management, but it was a matter that fell to be dealt with rather urgently if an injustice to some of those people was to be avoided. Those were the main considerations before the Ministry in determining that this Bill had to be proceeded with as a matter of considerable urgency.</P>
    <P>Senator Rowlette also raised the question as to whether the decision to build this hospital on a site other than the site of the existing institutions was on the advice or had the approval of the Hospitals Commission.  For his information and for the information of the House I want to say that on 13th June, 1940, the Hospitals Commission, stated in a communication to the Minister that the suggestion to transfer the hospital's activities from the present congested location to a more open site on the outskirts of the city was to be commended as a progressive step which will provide an improved distribution of general hospital facilities on the north side of the Liffey.  I think that disposes of that.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon and others have referred to the name of the hospital. The general trend of the discussion&mdash;although the orderliness of it, as the Cathaoirleach has pointed out, has been a matter of some question&mdash; has been to the effect that, by calling the hospital &ldquo;St. Laurence's Hospital&rdquo; we do not necessarily mean St. Laurence O'Toole.  There are, in fact, three St. Laurences set out in the <i>Ordo:</i> 10th August, St. Laurence, with the letter (M) after his name, meaning &ldquo;martyr&rdquo;.  This was St. Laurence who was roasted on the gridiron. There is no other identification; there is no surname.  Then there is: 6th September, St. Laurence Justinian, with (C) meaning &ldquo;confessor&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;Justinian&rdquo; is to indicate that he was a descendant of the noble family of Justinia.  Then there is: 14th November, St. Laurence, Ep., C., Confessor, Bishop.  He is our Irish saint.  His official title is simply &ldquo;St. Laurence&rdquo;.  There is no reference whatever to his surname.</P>

      <P>As I am likely to be some little time on my feet, I wonder if I would be in order in addressing the House from a sitting position?  I will explain what I mean, in this way: there is a number of enterprising gentlemen outside who have recently shown a desire to capture a seat, possibly my seat, and I fear that, if I remain too long on my feet, one of those enterprising gentlemen will, in the meantime, have captured my seat.  Perhaps Senator Dr. Rowlette would like to make a similar request.  I listened with mixed feelings to the debate which the Minister wound up the other evening.  I should like to say that I think the Minister gave a favourable turn to a debate which at one stage seemed to develop into the usual acrimonious back-chat that leads nowhere.  I am not without hope&mdash;I am sorry the Minister is not here to hear me say it&mdash;that I may be as successful in turning the Minister into a statesman as he has been in turning me into a politician.  At all events, that indicates the spirit in which I&mdash;I think I may say &ldquo;we&rdquo;&mdash; approach this whole matter.  We want to do what we can to give the Ministry our moral support in pressing on our British neighbours to adopt towards us, with regard to artificial manures, a policy which we think is right and just so far as our interests are concerned, and which, further, we are convinced is in the interests of our British neighbours as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This shortage of artificial manures is not a new phenomenon in our agricultural circumstances.  In fact, the history of that shortage goes back at least ten years.  In giving some account of how that shortage has come <Col N="1492" /> to be as serious as it is now, I want to emphasise the fact that, if we had had more artificial manures available for our agriculture during the years 1932-1939, it would not have mattered quite so much if we had been somewhat short of manures during the war period because certain artificial manures, especially phosphates, have persistent effects in maintaining the fertility of the land and we could have gone on living on the accumulated results of the original fertilising of the land, if only the land had got that original fertilising.</P>
    <P>The situation is as acute as it is now because we are short of artificial manures now due to war conditions, and because we were short of them for other reasons during the years 1932-39.  These were the years of the so-called economic war.  I hesitate to refer to that war because it sometimes causes people to go off at the deep end, but I think the wound that was then inflicted on our agriculture has left a sore which still festers.  I should like, if I could, to apply the cleansing lotion of objective analysis to that sore in order that we might see what are the causes of our present difficulty and what the moral responsibility was of the various agencies concerned.  As to the economic war itself, I am not going to say that any one Government was wholly responsible. I am not going to say that the responsibility should be divided on a fifty-fifty basis between the two Governments concerned, but I am going to say that the responsibility is shared in some proportion between these two Governments, whether it be in the proportion of 99 per cent. and 1 per cent. or some proportion between these two ratios and fifty-fifty.  I am not going to say which is which; you can take your choice with regard to that.  The point there is that the economic war situation was in some proportion the joint responsibility of both Governments and consequently both Governments have a certain moral responsibility, even now, to do what they can to restore the ears which the locusts have eaten, if I might use a Biblical expression.</P>
    <P>In this connection I think it is a <Col N="1493" /> source of legitimate regret that we did not four years ago go forward to the constitution of a national Government representing all sections of the community, because I think in our negotiations with Britain, the fact that the Minister represents only a Party, a Party which in the past has not perhaps been so outspokenly friendly to Britain as certain other sections of the community, may possibly discount what he has to say and prevent him from being able to produce the results for the whole nation that we should like to see produced.  When the Minister makes representations to his opposite number in the British Government, which he undoubtedly has been making both personally and through his officials at odd times during the past three years, when he attempts to get a higher price for our beef cattle, or attempts to get us more artificial manures, he is in that capacity really-and truly representing every Party and every section of this community, including the ex-Unionist farmers who are in some cases more closely associated with me than with him.  I want to make it quite clear that we want the Minister to feel that he does represent every section in the community in negotiations with our British neighbours.</P>
    <P>The facts of the case are that for any kind of sustained and extended tillage we must have manure.  There are two principal sources of manure, one farmyard manure and the other artificial manure.  Farmyard manure is quite an admirable thing and in certain circumstances could certainly supply most, if not all, of the manurial requirements of an intensive tillage economy, but an adequate supply of farmyard manure has been lacking, too, during the last ten years because one of the immediate results of the economic war which broke out in 1932 was that stall feeding of large animals, the fattening of large animals, went out of fashion and has not yet come back.  It went out of fashion for the simple reason that with the price of beef cattle at 18/- per cwt., live weight, at one time in the Dublin market, and with the price of oats, the production of which it was the <Col N="1494" /> national policy to maintain during that period, it simply did not pay to use threepence worth of oats in order to produce twopence worth of beef.  One result of that disappearance of stall feeding from the tillage areas was that even in years subsequent to the economic war they had to carry on a tillage economy as best they could with no profitable foundation in live stock which would provide them with farmyard manure.  They had to give up stall feeding in the winter time and they had to relate what profits they could make out of their tillage crops to a policy of less and less farmyard manure and more and more artificial manure.  That is true especially of regions such as Wexford or Louth, in which it was profitable to grow increasing areas of barley, wheat and beet.  I think artificial manures played in these areas a relatively greater part in that economy and farmyard manure played a relatively small part, because stall feeding had simply disappeared.</P>
    <P>One might ask the question why has stall feeding not come back now that the price is very much higher than it used to be?  In that connection, I would say that while stall feeding even now is desirable, from the point of view of the quality of the farmyard manure which it would produce, it is no longer possible in present circumstances to feed and fatten animals on such things as oats which formerly formed the principal part of their ration, and it is physically impossible to get such things as linseed cake.  In fact it would be quite uneconomic in present circumstances to stall feed animals in the country.  Even now, however, it would be possible to stall feed cattle in the winter time on a ration of straw and silage.  I am told that good silage and straw as a foundation will make it possible to make animals reasonably fat.</P>
    <P>It is certainly one of the cheapest ways in which fat cattle can be produced under present or indeed, under any, conditions.  Here we are up against another factor which makes it unprofitable to stall-feed cattle even with the cheapest materials under present conditions, unprofitable certainly to finish cattle up to the point <Col N="1495" /> that they are ready for the butcher's block at the time they reach the British port.  I refer in this connection to the differential price policy which was introduced in Britain in 1933 and has been maintained in one form or another ever since.  Under that policy, the British pay for an animal reared, fattened and finished in their own country a price some 14/- per cwt. live weight higher than the price which they will pay for an animal of similar quality reared, fattened and finished in our country and exported for slaughter.</P>
    <P>Further, they pay for what is called forward stock, an animal that has reached the stage where in a couple of months it will be fit for slaughter&mdash; a price some 9/- per cwt. more than the price they are prepared to pay us for an animal already finished and fit for slaughter by the time it reaches the English port.  Putting it in figures, if the price of a fat animal of a given grade, reared and finished in Northern Ireland, is 64/- per cwt., liveweight, the price of a good fat animal finished in Eire and ready for slaughter would be 50/- per cwt., liveweight, and the price of forward stock finished for slaughter in two months time would be 59/- per cwt. liveweight.  So that a farmer who finishes his beast up to the point when it is ready for slaughter is in considerable danger of losing 9/- per cwt. in the value of the animal, and he will lose more in the price per cwt. than he will gain in the price for the increase in weight.</P>
    <P>That makes it a dangerous speculation for our farmers and cattle men to carry out the process of fattening up to the point at which they are ready for slaughter by the time they reach a port in Britain.  This has the incidental result that our agriculture has lost the value of manure which those cattle would have produced in the final stages of their fattening, and I am informed on the highest authority that the manure produced by bullocks or fattening dry stock is much more valuable than that produced by younger cattle or even by milch cows.</P>
    <P>Hanly's <i>Mixed Farming</i> is a work of recognised authority on Irish, or <Col N="1496" /> indeed any agriculture, and he says on page 53, and I would like to put it on the records of the House:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The quantity of manure produced by a farm animal depends largely on the quantity and kind of the food consumed;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Growing animals, or cows producing milk, will give poorer manure from similar food than, say, fattening cattle; because, while nitrogen, phosphates and lime are largely retained by the former to produce muscle, bone and milk, only fat, containing neither ash nor nitrogen, is mainly retained by the latter.  Of the percentage of nitrogen in the food consumed by a milking cow, approximately 25 per cent. is retained in the body and in the milk, 18 per cent. is voided as solid excrement, and 57 per cent. is voided as urine. The corresponding figures for a fattening bullock are about 4 per cent. retained in the body, 23 per cent. voided as solid excrement, and 73 per cent. voided as urine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the fattening bullock only retains about 4 per cent. of the valuable nitrogenous element in its ration.  The rest is voided and becomes manure.  The cow, on the other hand, retains 25 per cent.  Therefore, the manurial value of the excrement of fattening cattle is more valuable than that of any other kind of live stock. This is the kind of farmyard manure that circumstances have deprived us of possession of during the years both of the economic war period and up to the present, because of the continuation of that economic war under a different form through this differential price policy.</P>
    <P>In that aspect of the matter the fact that during the economic war years we diminished greatly the imports of feeding for live stock had an indirect effect in diminishing the quality of farmyard manure available in those years.  The import of maize in various forms which was as much as 11,000,000 or 12,000,000 cwts. in 1931 came down to about 4,000,000 cwts. in the depth of the economic war, and has never recovered <Col N="1497" /> since.  The imports of the more concentrated foods, such as oil cake and meal, also diminished very seriously. The average annual import of oil and seed cake and meal between 1926 and 1931 was 963,000 cwts., and in the subsequent six year period from 1932 to 1937, the average annual import was 653,000 cwts.&mdash;a substantial diminution.</P>
    <P>That diminished use of the more concentrated forms of food had an important effect in impoverishing the quality of the farmyard manure available during those years.  I would like to read another selection from Hanly's <i>Mixed Farming.</i>  On page 80, he says: &ldquo;Experiments carried out at Rothamsted showed that manure produced from bullocks fed on roots, hay, and from four to eight lbs. of cake, gave an increase of crop the year it was applied, approximately double that from a similar quantity of manure produced by bullocks fed on roots and hay alone,&rdquo; so that farmyard manure was scarce in those years, and the quality of it was impoverished by reason of the fact that we were feeding our animals less nourishingly than we used to.  For that fact, I contend that both Governments are responsible in some degree and, therefore, should be responsible for remedying that serious situation in the interests of both countries.</P>
    <P>With regard to the importation of artificial manures, the figures there are equally significant.  During those years there was a substantial decrease in the imports of artificial manures especially of those kinds of manures which are prolonged in their effects although they do not give immediate results.  I refer to phosphatic manures and things like basic slag, the value of which can only be realised over five or six-year periods.  In some of those economic war years there was no import whatever of basic slag, and when, towards the end of the time, there was some increase in the aggregate import of artificial manures, the increase was mostly in respect of nitrogenous manures for giving quick results and entirely appropriate to a policy of snatching a quick profit from a catch-crop like wheat or beet, but having no <Col N="1498" /> permanent effect in maintaining the fertility of the land.  Here are the aggregate figures for phosphatic potassic and nitrogenous manures.  The average imports for the six years 1926-31 were: phosphatic, 220,000 tons; potassic, 11,500 tons; nitrogenous, 20,000 tons.  I should have said that the average annual supply of artificial manures was represented by these figures, taking into account the fact that rock phosphate, imported and made into manure here, becomes about twice its weight of artificial home-produced manure.  Consequently, the figures I gave are the figures showing the total supply available for Irish agriculture without reference to whether it was manufactured at home or imported in the finished form.</P>
    <P>Again I give the figures, phosphatics 220,000 tons, potassium 11,500 tons and nitrates 20,000 tons.  In the next six years 1932-37 the average for phosphates was 154,000, for potassium 6,500 tons, or about half the previous normal supply and nitrates 15,000 tons, about threequarters of the previous normal supply.  I do not attach any importance to the fact that the import of nitrates kept nearer to normal because these manures only last for a year and have no bearing on the subsequent fertility of the land.  My point is that the land is more impoverished now by reason of the inadequate dressing of the more permanent manures which it got in the years immediately before the war, and consequently a greater measure of artificial manure is now necessary.  We are to some extent to blame because we made it our business to restrict imports of artificial manures during the economic war years, and down to quite recently in doing so we deliberately injured the interest of 600,00 agricultural producers in order to forward the interest of 1,000 workers who derived their livelihood from the manufacture of artificial manures.  I wish to argue that it is a British interest as well as an Irish interest that we should have more fertilisers and have them now. The Minister in his remarks said he thought that the total amount of artifical manures available would be somewhere <Col N="1499" /> between 45,000 and 50,000 tons. Well, that is a mighty poor total in comparison even with what was available during the economic war period. When the total of phosphates was 154,000 tons, potassium 6,500, and nitrates 15,000 tons, there is not in this year more than half the previous normal supplies.  We are a very long way now from the desirable total of artificial manures.</P>
    <P>It is a British interest that we should have more fertilisers and have them here and now.  If we do not get them I am not suggesting that the only alternative is to send an ultimatum to Britain and say we will not sell her cattle.  That would be sheer lunacy. All we have to do is to point out that if we do not get them we will have to put a larger area of land under tillage in order to get the total wheat, oats and other things we require.</P>
    <P>If we put a larger area under tillage we are going to have a smaller area under grass, and if that happens we are going to have less grass for our dry stock.  Even if we have the same number of dry stock on the land as before, they are going to be less well nourished and the net result will be that lighter and leaner live stock will find their way to the British market, and into the British larder.  If they gave us artificial manures it would enable us to obtain our tillage requirements on a smaller area of land.  A similar practical difficulty occurs with reference to providing silage for hay. I find with my limited experience that I have to cut off a larger proportion of my available grass land in order to make up the area for silage for winter feeding.  On the other hand if one could only get hold of some sulphate of ammonia in the early spring, when dressing the land to get the silage, we could do with a much smaller area, and would have more land for maintenance of cattle in summer pasture. There again we would be able to produce a greater weight of cattle for the British market by reason of having a larger supply of grass.  It is in their interests that we should not have to waste too much of the grass land in <Col N="1500" /> order to provide tillage and in order to secure that all they have to do is to give us adequate supplies of artificial manures to enable us to get sufficient crops on a smaller area of tillage land.</P>
    <P>Now I might make the case that a bargaining power in dealing with our British neighbours is somewhat weak. I am quite aware that under the present circumstances our products do not bulk so largely in the British market as they would if we had pursued a different policy, and if they also had pursued a different policy during the last ten years.  I know that they have ceased to depend on us for butter and bacon, and that they get remarkably increased supplies of these products from places such as New Zealand and Canada.  I know that there are various technical means in the processing of dead meat which enable tremendous quantities to be conveyed in remarkably small amounts of shipping space, and that when subsequently they appear on the table they have almost the same quality as fresh meat.  Some people say that this development of dehydration of meat and other products will remain, even after the war, and bring even the most distant markets into closest competition with us as a source of supply for the British market.  That is probably true but, nevertheless, I maintain that we still have a certain bargaining power in our dealings with Britain though it is weaker than it should be.</P>
    <P>We have a case which is a strong case, both on moral and economic grounds.  The next time the Minister is talking to his opposite number at the other side about the price of cattle or the like, I wish he would ask that Minister point blank how does he square the price for our beef as compared with the price in Northern Ireland, with the principles of the Atlantic Charter, of which we have heard so much, and to say if the whole position will bear examination in the light of the principles of that Charter, by which I think the British people are quite sincerely trying to establish good relations with the rest of the world, but which they somehow overlook <Col N="1501" /> when it comes to a question of their relations with us.  I should point out that we could safely put a larger area under potatoes if we had more artificial manures.  If we had more potatoes we would be able to have more pigs and poultry, and easily get back to the position in which we would have bacon to spare for export, and could expand in proportion egg production, which would be available for export. In that way they have an interest in expanding our production of potatoes for export.</P>

      <P>If I could continue for five minutes I would then finish.  Then, again, I think we have a possible bargaining point with reference to the production of beet.  The normal requirements of this community in beet sugar are about 100,000 tons a year.  Last year the beet crop was rather less productive for us, and we are all painfully conscious of the fact that we are now on about half rations of sugar, probably having only about 60,000 tons of sugar to go around.  I am not without hope that the recent promise of a stone of sugar for every ton of beet produced will have a considerable effect in adding to the acreage under beet, especially on the part of small growers.  I confess that I have fallen for the temptation myself, because up to now it was contrary to my principles to have anything to do with beet, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so, I think we can go to the British Government and say that we are in a position, with the help of artificial manures, to grow enough beet to produce 100,000 tons of sugar, our normal requirements, and that, under the circumstances, we would like to share that total with our Northern Ireland neighbours in the proportion of, say, 70,000 tons for ourselves and 30,000 tons for them, which would mean leaving ourselves perhaps slightly short.  Notwithstanding that, we could still give a share to our Northern Ireland <Col N="1502" /> neighbours who are our fellow-countrymen. We might be willing to make some sacrifice in their interests. As individuals we have in the past frequently shared our relatively larger sugar ration with them in a way that was winked at by the authorities on both sides.  I do not see any reason why some such agreement should not be openly arrived at between the two Governments, so that if the British Government would give us more artificial manures we would undertake to produce not only enough sugar for ourselves but Northern Ireland as well. We could divide the total amount available under some agreed proposal.</P>
    <P>Similarly with regard to flax.  We have there also a bargaining point.  I think the British Government are interested in our flax production.  We might endeavour to grow a greater quantity of flax if they would be reasonable on the question of artificial manures.  Finally, I would like to say that the Minister could command the moral support of the section of the House which I may claim to speak for, and, I would hope, of the whole House in this matter, and so be a truly national Minister in his contacts with the British Government.  With the moral support of all sides of the House he could put the case, which is strong both morally and economically, with great force.  I feel certain that if he were in that position some good results would come from it, both from the British point of view as well as from ours.  Consequently, I hope the Minister will accept the motion, and that the House will give it its unanimous acceptance.</P>

      <P>I would be inclined to support Senator Baxter's motion, whether it is approached from the national or the economic point of view. Economically at least, it is very doubtful if we are not losing ground to our neighbours in Northern Ireland.  From the international point of view, and from the long-term view, that is clear enough for all to see.  That is why I attach considerable importance to this motion.  The policy of doing the best <Col N="1503" /> we can from year to year, and hoping for something to turn up, is dangerous, and whether peace is just around the corner or many years away, it should be the aim of all of us to contribute to a constructive programme.  Whether we accept the theory that peace is around the corner or that the emergency may be long drawn out, vital forces confront every citizen at practically every meal and may well increase as the days pass.  These are increased by our international surroundings. Neutrality must be paid for.  Its price is a big consideration, and I think that Senator Baxter's motion accepts the fact that the agricultural community must make a sacrifice by paying for it in the most serious way.  In this emergency, maximum production must be our unswerving aim and no side issues should be permitted or condoned.  Our present efforts of tapping and drawing upon our resources, tending to call for still more effort, more labour and more cost at a time when there is evidence that the sand in the glass is running out are to be deplored.</P>
      <P>I saw that the Taoiseach at Limerick recently was well enough advised to admit that it was necessary for the country to look to such counties as Meath and Limerick as reserves from which our immediate needs might be satisfied.  It is well for us to have these counties, but that statement shows that we are in the danger zone. What of to-morrow?  I read, too, his statement that more barley was necessary and that it was our greatest bargaining asset.  Barley, beer and spirits are ready to be placed at the disposal of this nation or of our neighbours if the means to the end be granted immediately. A real live effort should once again be made by the Taoiseach and our Minister, and I think we should do all we can to give them our best support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, it is not only necessary at the present time, but even more necessary for the decades that are to come.  We have a great deal of raw material but we want certain stimulants, and those who want our products are daily taking active and vigorous <Col N="1504" /> steps to see that either openly or surreptitiously what they have to spare does not find its way to us.  I hope that in a prepared programme, methods will be found of providing us with stimulants for our land which will give us a sufficiency of products badly wanted by everybody.  From a carefully drawn bargain, other avenues may open which will provide us with the stimulant and the manures which we got up to ten years ago, when stall-feeding for beef production&mdash;a subject so efficiently handled by Senator Johnston in his remarks&mdash;gave a highly successful manure, and the resulting barely crop gave the offal which in turn produced the milk, butter, bacon and beef that left well-nourished families in our homesteads.</P>
    <P>I was present at a lecture at University College last March where Mr. MacEntee, the former Minister for Finance, expressed a gloomy outlook for the future of Ireland if we continue to look towards the cattle trade. Since then, the present Minister for Finance and, if I mistake not, the Taoiseach, and the Minister for Agricure, gave it as their opinion that we would be well advised to continue the live-stock trade and to regard it as our greatest national asset.  Last September it was my good fortune to be present at a meeting addressed by Mr. Hudson, British Minister of Agriculture, when publicly and insistently he told British farmers and producers to buy and to buy early from the thousands of magnificent store cattle which Ireland had then in her fields and pastures.  It will be admitted that the better the manures and the more extensively they are used, the better and more mature will be the stock available here.  With goodwill on both sides, it should be possible to find a means by which both countries might pool their assets for each other's good.</P>
    <P>To my mind, it is a task the successful accomplishment of which opens a vista in a land where successful husbandry will breed a contented and happy people.  It will help to replace a soil, now giving evidence of exhaustion, by a fertile soil giving a living to those who own it. <Col N="1505" /> I may be told that we have not much to give, and less to receive, but there is evidence that we have a great deal to give, and that in return a great deal may be expected if a commonsense basis for discussion can be found. Every little counts, and God has favoured both our islands with marked fertility and resources, which it is criminal not to utilise.  It must cause all of us&mdash;it certainly causes me&mdash;pangs of uneasiness when we see our immature store cattle, leaving the country and workers leaving it to be fed elsewhere, while our stall-feeding sheds are idle and our breweries dilapidated.  If our produce stands in the beef market of Newry or Belfast it is tariffed to the tune of £8 or £10 per head.  These handicaps affect us all, and I doubt the wisdom of exporting store cattle if it is humanly possible to produce the finished article at home, because from the finished article the best manures will come, and the results will be better for everybody. In the country I come from, the flight from the land is largely due to the fact that the stall-feeding industry has ceased to exist.</P>
    <P>Only last week or the week before we saw that the proprietors of the cinemas in England and in this country reached some agreement for pooling resources for their common good.  I think the Taoiseach and our Ministers here could fail in no better cause than the one I have mentioned.  If there was any necessity to broaden the responsibility, I suggest that they would find all Parties just as helpful in regard to those matters as they did on the Defence Council, which has proved such a magnificent success. Experience exhibits the benefit of that mixed gathering of forces.  Desired qualities are enhanced, undesired weaknesses are reduced, courage is unified, and there is a determination to see that the deterioration of our Irish land is not aggravated by neglect of opportunity on the part of our statesmen.  To my mind, the times are too critical for any wishful thinking. The suggestions in this motion come down to solid earth, on which experience has shown us that a solid footing may be found for our agriculture <Col N="1506" /> during and after the emergency.  I was left cold and comfortless by the speech of the Minister the other evening.</P>
    <P>Only last week I saw an article in <i>Irish Industry</i> which stated, in alluding to a remark of my own, that the sole cause of the deterioration in the agricultural position and the flight from the land, was the fact that the output of our Irish farms has not increased in the past 20 years.  I have no doubt that that is true, but the only remedy they give us is to promote cow-testing.  If cow-testing were to solve our difficulties it would be an excellent thing, but in order to increase our output it is absolutely essential that we get the best fertilisers.  It is absolutely essential, too, that we revert to stall-feeding.  In the debate on this motion at the last meeting of the Seanad, Senator O Buachalla told us that in a certain area, which he visits from time to time, the farmers who he said were undoubtedly amongst the very best tillage farmers in Ireland, had adopted a scheme of carrying the straw from the fields and throwing it around the gates.  They were able, he said, to accumulate a considerable amount of manure in that way, but I am afraid that manure will not have the desired effect.  In fact, if they keep on throwing the straw round the gates long enough, they may block the gates, and they certainly will not have much sub-soil afterwards.  I think a national policy on the lines of Senator Baxter's motion has much to recommend it, and it will have my wholehearted support.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very interested in the speeches made by Senator McGee and Senator Johnston.  Senator McGee gave us the <Col N="1507" /> good advice to come down to hard earth, and we heard much talk about the quantity of artificial manures that were available.  As far as I understand the average Englishman, he is not a very &ldquo;givish&rdquo; person where his own needs are concerned.  He will see that his own requirements are satisfied before he passes on anything to his neighbour.  Senator McGee put this question more forcibly than Senator Johnston.  A price has to be paid for any concession we get from England. Senator McGee's price might be a price of blood; Senator Johnston's price would be a price of Irish national self-respect.  So far as I understood Senator Johnston, he does not appear to have a very high opinion of the character or mentality of the members of the English Government, because he suggested that if we were to send over to England Ministers, not those responsible for the economic war, but Ministers responsible for other interests, they would receive more respect from the English Ministers.  Does Senator Johnston suggest that English Ministers are swayed by prejudice and that they would not make a fair deal with Ministers of this Government who have been in office for 11 years?</P>
    <P>The Senator has not been as unfair as many other speakers who have dealt with the economic war.  Senator Johnston agreed that all the faults were not on one side, that the English Government have their faults as well as the Government on this side, but I maintain that the Government which conceded 90 per cent. of the moneys in dispute, along with giving us back the ports they held here, acknowledged by that fact that they were in the wrong. But whether they were in the right or in the wrong, the policy of the English ruling class&mdash;the ordinary Englishman may be all right&mdash;has always been a selfish policy.  Senator Johnston referred to the differentiation in the price given for fat cattle reared in England and in the Six Counties and the price given for fat cattle coming from this portion of the country, but he did not explain what was the cause of it.  The Senator must be a very <Col N="1508" /> innocent man if he believes in the so-called paper Atlantic Charter.  It is refreshing to find in those critical times a man who believes in what is turned out as war propaganda.  I think the English people and the English Government would have more respect for us if we stood on our rights.  There is no reason why we should go hat in hand to them at all.  As the Minister for Agriculture explained here recently, they were not prepared to give us an economic price for our butter, and now they are getting none of our butter. They are not giving us an economic price for our cattle.  They are not giving us a price that will enable people to stall-feed cattle on the present high price of feeding stuffs.  It may be that the English people cannot be fed with imports from New Zealand and South America as Senator Johnston stated, but in any case this policy of going hat in hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Senator Johnston were able to show that there is a surplus of artificial manures such as sulphate of ammonia and superphosphates in England, there might be some reason for going there with bargaining powers, but we have not that assurance. We have not had it from the proposer of the motion and I am one of those who do not believe in the so-called generosity of the English people.  It is natural for them to look to their own interests first.  They have pets in the Six Counties whom they will subsidise afterwards and they will give us nothing here except what they cannot help.</P>

      <P>We all agree with Senator Baxter's motion and the views expressed in advocating it, because we all agree that agriculture and the land are the backbone of the country, that it is a fundamental industry, and that it is our first duty in public life to do everything that is possible, and to use <Col N="1509" /> every means in our power, our resources and our wealth, to make the people on the land self-sufficient, to hearten them, and to raise considerably the general standard of living. That has always been the general policy of the Government as a whole, and there is no use in people getting up here and using pious platitudes and phrases which are meaningless.  We find ourselves in a country at peace but cut off from sources of supply of practically any kind, and our community dependent on the produce of its own soil.  As I see it, in this debate the members of the Opposition Party in the most flippant manner are playing Party politics to have a rap at An Taoiseach and his Ministers in one form or another, and all that only goes to mislead the people into the belief that if a Minister were to cross to London all the worries and troubles of the community would be at once relieved by some sort of barter system.</P>
      <P>Anyone who desires to be perfectly honest about the situation knows very well that it is beyond human power to-day to bring here, or to give to the people, normal pre-war facilities for the development of agriculture.  Every body knows perfectly well that it is our duty to get everything possible done to meet the food requirements of the people.  The nation and its survival are far more important than this petty little squabbling and tinkering that is going on.  Who cares who governs this country if we can survive the awful catastrophe that has befallen Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are living in a very foolish atmosphere, looking at Ireland from within, and ignoring the difficulties and the despair that exist all over Europe. We are looking at Ireland and the world from a commercial point of view, as if ordinary trade and commerce were the urge in life to-day.  Behind Senator Baxter's motion is the idea of a trade or barter agreement.  Does Senator Baxter realise that England is not interested in trade and commerce at all? We are looking at England from a trading and commericial point of view, but England does not give a damn about trade or commerce.  That apparently has not struck Senator Baxter or his supporters.  Within the last two <Col N="1510" /> days we heard a British Minister announcing that because of the concentration of industrial life in England he was able to save 10,000,000 square feet of industrial space.  Does Senator Baxter understand what that means&mdash; that they closed down on trade and commerce, and on industries, even with a large export trade?  They are not interested in trade any more, they are interested only in the war effort, and, from their point of view, they are quite right.  But, looking at the world from a commercial viewpoint only, we expect England to meet us on a commercial basis.  The suggestion is too stupid for words.  We could not expect them to do it if there was any appreciation of the difficulties that exist in England. I think we are wasting time talking about barter and trade.  England has nothing to barter with us at the present time.</P>
    <P>That is the way I see the position. I think that is a perfectly frank and honest point of view, and also a practical one.  I saw it stated some time ago that England would not buy our bacon when we had bacon to sell, that it was much cheaper to bring it from Canada and the very ends of the earth instead of getting it here.  If we look at the world, or even at England, from that point of view, we can only say: &ldquo;Very well, you have given up all trade and commerce; you are interested only in the war effort. What surplus have you that you can give us?&rdquo; Do you mean to tell me that Senator Baxter and his colleagues have all the brains and all the ability to find a solution, and to get something from them which the present Government cannot get?  It would be unnatural to think that.</P>
    <P>Until this war is over we have got to make up our minds that it is the duty of all not to expect anything from anybody else, but to make full use of all the resources we have inside the State in order to ensure that, whatever we may be short of, we will not be short of the staple foods of the people, and that everybody in the State will get sufficient.  Speaking as a farmer, I do not see why there should be any difficulty about staple foods being in sufficient supply at present prices, <Col N="1511" /> which are guaranteed by the Government. They are reasonable; they can be profitable, and they are profitable. Farmers are having a fair time at present&mdash;not as good as in the last war, but a fair time.  They have a ready market for everything they have to sell.  As long as we can ensure the survival of the State we as individuals have to submit to little jolts at present. But what are these little jolts?  If we can tide over things we will be in a better way at the end of the war.  Then there will be a better opportunity to aim at a higher standard of life than we ever had before.  Why these little bickerings at the Minister?  Who cares who is Minister at the present time? It is time to stop such talk.  The situation is too serious.  If we are all prepared to bury our pride in the interests of the country, then this little island will be well worth living in when the war is over.</P>

      <P>I do not pretend to have understood all that Senator McEllin said.  I think I agreed with some of the things he said but other arguments about Britain and so on are beyond me.  He has said that England is not interested in trade, that she has nothing to export and that she is only interested in the war effort.  Well, the British Government is certainly very interested in the war effort and wants people working and producing for war purposes.  The British Government knows that they have to have food for that purpose.  It has taken enormous steps to increase agricultural production in England.  The British publicists are always warning the people of the difficulty of convoying the imports they need across the Atlantic and other seas.  The fact is that the English people do not want to send anything out; they have not enough and have nothing to export.  They need more than they have and they need consequently to look to other countries. You may say it is not trade and commerce, but they do need a great deal that is produced outside the country, and as sensible people and as honest men they realise that they must pay for it, whether by lease-and-lend methods, by barter or in cash.  I think <Col N="1512" /> it is not impossible&mdash;although I am not going to pretend to pontificate on this &mdash;that, therefore, they might feel it was good business on the British side to save shipping space by getting as much food as possible from this country, because with all they have done, they are not producing all they need.  All this talk about their not being interested in trade means nothing. I knew a man who said he took no interest in money; he said that all he asked for was to have his needs supplied. I was impressed until I found his needs were not only more than I have ever had but more than those of anybody else I have known.</P>
      <P>The proposal, I understand, in this motion is that there should be a recognition that one of the most conscious needs is food supply.  The proposal is that we should send over certain things we produce and ask in payment that which will enable us to produce more. Implied in the motion is the argument that greater production here is for our own good and our greater production in the agricultural sphere, in so far as it exceeds what we ourselves require, will be of benefit to England.  Therefore, if we send them goods they need, and if they send us means of producing more, they have got additional benefit, in that the payment they give is going by repercussion to give them a greater payment.  Senator McEllin talks about squabbling and attacking the Government.  I do not know whether it was this morning or whether it was at 1 o'clock or on last night's wireless, but I noticed that a number of questions had been put to the Foreign Minister in England.  I must say they were questions of which, had I been in his position, I would have taken a very poor view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was about a section of the army at Stalingrad coming over to England and a section of the people who had participated in the battle of Britain going over to Russia.  That was proposed and though, as I say, if I had been in the Minister's position I would have given it a very short answer, the Minister replied that he thought this a very good idea, and if it suited the Russian Government, he would be very happy, and the whole <Col N="1513" /> British people would be very happy to receive this section of the defenders of Stalingrad.  He quite accepted the suggestion that representatives that defended Britain should go over there. He did not say that that was attacking the Government.  The attitude we find on the other side of this House makes communication almost impossible. Senator Baxter made a most reasonable speech.  A Senator on the other side&mdash;I know his knowledge of English is very little, although I am prepared to admit that his information is quite unlimited&mdash;made most scandalous suggestions about Senator Johnston.  I do not think you will ever get anywhere, here or in any Irish legislature, if it is always assumed when people make a reasonable proposition that there must be something devious, malicious and vindictive behind it, and you begin answering the malice that your mind has conceived as being behind the words instead of answering what they have said.  This is not an attack on the Government.  The Minister has said that the British have no artificial manures.  I do not think that word &ldquo;no&rdquo; must be taken too absolutely. The British certainly want artificial manures.  No doubt they would be happy to have more.  It comes to considering whether what they need would possibly be better secured by passing a certain proportion of the available artificial manure to the Irish producer. I would have imagined the Government here making a specific proposition that, in the allocation of so much manure, it would be devoted to production of a particular item that was useful to us and useful to the British, and that they would guarantee that a certain proportion of the result of Irish production would be exported to them.  It is easily possible that it would pay the British Government to send more artificial manures even if by doing so they had to reduce the percentage given to their own people.  I am simply saying that it is possible.</P>

      <P>Running right through the Minister's remarks here there was a sense of despair.  He said that there was no hope of getting anything from England.  What happens in war times, even more so than in peace times, is that a proposition which seemed unfeasible can, in changed circumstances, appear in an entirely new light.  I do not pretend to know more than others, but I do know that when Algiers and North Africa were entered by the Allies it was immediately clear that in so far as they had been previously exporting to France the new situation meant that any exports they had must be diverted to the Allied countries, principally to England and America, since the other ends they supplied were cut off from them.  I heard on the wireless that one of the big products that used to be exported from North Africa was artificial manures.  I also heard, possibly from unenlightened people, on the wireless that it would be important for England to import, and to take and pay for in kind, as much as possible of the products of North Africa. Senator Johnston knows a good deal more about these matters than I do. It seems, therefore, that it may happen that England will be receiving from North Africa what that country produces, and will aim at taking the maximum in the interests of North Africa.  In that case it seems possible that whereas, some months ago, there was no possibility of diverting artificial manures from England to Ireland, in the early future there may be a sufficient supply of these manures to justify the British Government in calculating that it would better serve the British war effort, in the matter of food supplies for their people, to send artificial manures over here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why Senator McEllin and Senator O Máille should get up and talk of this motion as being a Party affair.  I agree that the Minister is certainly in a better position to judge as to the feasibility of this than Senator Baxter.  But it is a tradition of Parliaments that the Opposition Parties can get up and make suggestions in regard to a great many matters that the Government knows urgently require to be done.  Sometimes <Col N="1515" /> a suggestion has the implication and the possible effect that it indicates and leads to a certain priority being given to one item rather than to another.</P>
    <P>All that Senator Baxter's motion has done is to call attention to a fact which the Minister and most people are aware of, namely, that the country is in need of more artificial manures.  He has suggested that another approach should be made to the British Government by the Minister on this matter. That is exactly the thing that was done in England this morning by the Opposition Parties, but the Minister there did not get up and say that by meeting the wishes of the Opposition the Government there were selling their self-respect.  There was nothing of that kind said.  There was none of the silly talk of the kind that we have had from Senators on the opposite benches or any suggestion that what was said had anything to do with Party manoeuvring.  In regard to innocent remarks that I have made myself from time to time other people have read into them the most blackguardly and scandalous implications.  Such implications had never entered my mind until they came from the other side.

      <P>There is no necessity to get hot on either side about this motion.  It is a purely business matter. The British people are realists and are quite as ready to make a bargain as we are.  Senator Fitzgerald made a rather good point with regard to North Africa.  A vast quantity of the phosphates reaching this country come from North Africa.  That being so, I think we would have the right to claim that some at least of those phosphates should be directed to our shores.  We have to remember that the British, over the last couple of years, have been engaged in carrying out a vastly increased agricultural policy. Like ourselves they have been calling on their farmers to produce more and more.  Unless they have a surplus of artificial manures, it would hardly be <Col N="1516" /> fair, in view of that, to expect them to divert to this country what they may want themselves.</P>

      <P>There is the other end of it to be considered.  At the moment we are not exporting butter because we want it ourselves.  If the British happened to be short of butter, would we leave ourselves short in order to give it to them?  Frankly, I do not think we would.  We also are realists.  The people at the other side are not giving us for our cattle the same price that they are giving to their own farmers and the farmers of Northern Ireland for cattle.  Our cattle, it must be remembered, are very useful to them.  In any bargaining that may take place that should be pointed out to them, and in all fair play we should demand that our farmers would get the same treatment as their own farmers and those in Northern Ireland are getting.</P>

      <P>What I dislike about the motion is that there is implicit in it the suggestion that the Minister for Agriculture and his Department are not doing all that they could do to make a better bargain, and that they should be able to get better terms for the produce that we are sending out.  On the last evening that the motion was debated in the House, the Minister made it quite clear that they had done all they could in that respect, and could not persuade those on the British side to give us more stuff in return for what we are sending them. If Senator Baxter could tell the House how that difficulty can be overcome, he would be doing a very useful and valuable work.</P>

All the speeches should be directed to the strengthening of the Minister's hand, making the arguments so cogent that the British will yield to them.  I liked, therefore, the <Col N="1517" /> speeches of Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Goulding.  Senator Fitzgerald made a very important point that the situation has changed, especially since the developments in North Africa, that home of manures, and that at present Britain might be in a position to give us what we want without detriment to her own farmers. At all events, that is worth investigating, and everybody in this House should help with constructive criticism. That is why this motion was put down and with no other intention.</P>

      <P>Many of us are familiar with the story that Moliére used to try his plays on the old nurse. I am in the position of the old nurse in relation to Senator Baxter.  I am just an ordinary intelligent woman, and I believe that there is a good case to be made for his motion.  I deprecate the implication that our Ministers have not done what they could already in this matter.  It seems obvious to anybody that an arrangement would be of advantage to both parties.  It is a case of business relations between ourselves and Britain, and that is why we want to be good neighbours and to exchange commodities with each other.  I remember a man I knew once who said he never failed to do a good turn if it cost himself nothing.  That is why we want to impress on England that if they do us a good turn, there will be no injury to themselves, but positive benefit.  The progress of the U-boat campaign might make it more imperative for them to seek from us goods which they are now getting from far away.  For this reason, I am glad the motion was presented to the House and debated in the most realistic and commonsense manner.</P>

      <P>We use three kinds of manures&mdash;phosphatics, potassics and nitrogenous manures.  The big bulk of phosphatics came from North Africa in the past.  Basic slag, which is a by-product of the manufacture of steel, came from England in small quantities. Potashes came from Germany.  I do not know how much potashes are reaching England from Germany now.</P>

      <P>Sulphate of ammonia is a by-product of the manufacture of gas, and that has largely been produced in England, but I take it that with nine-tenths of their arable land cultivated, they require all the nitrogenous manures they can get or have. The possibility of getting phosphates from North Africa is very remote. Recently we lost a shipload of phosphatic manures on the high seas, and I have heard some expert pointing out recently that if all the farmyard manure now going to waste could be preserved and saved it would far outweigh that shipload of phosphatic manure which was lost with the lives of 33 men.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Buckley who was quoted here as having referred to the spreading of straw around gates and farmyards.  I believe the quotation was given in a sneering kind of way. That is not right, and is hardly in keeping with the attitude that we ought to adopt towards this question of manures.  Senator Buckley's remarks were very much to the point, as the increased quantities of straw we have could be very well utilised to absorb the nitrogen which undoubtedly has gone to waste in many farmyards in the past.</P>
      <P>We had big areas of tillage long before the introduction of artificial manures and I am wondering how the people managed then.  A hundred years ago there were extensive areas of tillage&mdash;even up to 50 years ago&mdash; and we had not any artificial manures.  Reference has been made to the shortage of linseed cakes and such feeding stuffs.  I submit that we have a product known as meat meal which is being manufactured in fairly large quantities in three or four centres and which is not in sufficient demand.  This is very strange, because in meat meal we have a good substitute for these cakes.  It is a protein feed the same as the imported cakes.  Senator Johnston told us of the advantages of silage and wheaten straw.</P>

Like some other <Col N="1521" /> Senators, I certainly got the impression when I read this particular motion that the implication was&mdash;whether Senator Baxter meant it or not&mdash;that the Minister for Agriculture was not doing his best to get all the manures which we need so badly.  Even before I heard the Minister's speech I had learned from a source which I know to be very reliable that we had no great hope of getting any artificial manures from England for the simple reason that England has not enough for herself. That is what the Minister told us.</P>

      <P>What I mean is that, if the British Government said to us: &ldquo;We cannot produce more artificial manures because we lack butter, but if you send us more butter, it will enable us to produce a surplus of artificial manures, which we will send you,&rdquo; that might put a different complexion on the amount of butter we would be prepared to send them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that the British factories are not making anything like the amount of artificial manures which they produced in normal times.  Those factories are so constructed that they can be switched over to make munitions of war.  We also know the difficulty of importing manures from North Africa or anywhere else.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister would have done his best to get them if they could be got, and that the reason he failed to get them is that the British were not prepared to give them.  I thoroughly agree with what Senator Counihan said, and with what Senator O'Callaghan said to-night, with regard to concentrating <Col N="1522" /> on producing whatever artificials we can produce here, and also paying greater attention to our supplies of farmyard manure.  As Senator O'Callaghan has pointed out, for many years before we heard of artificial manures here we were producing ten times the amount of tillage we had in recent years, and certainly three times what we have even yet.  I should be as glad as anyone else if we could get a sufficiency of artificial manures, but if we are to produce all our own food we must make a very much bigger effort than we have been making to save all the farmyard manure we can, and devise every conceivable plan for increasing the production of it.  At one stage I thought, like Senator Johnston, that you could not feed cattle on wheaten straw, but I have found from experience that cattle will eat wheaten straw even when there is good oaten straw beside it.  I was very glad to discover that, because I grew wheat long before there was any demand for wheat growing, and I was under the impression that the straw was no use to me and that I would have to sell it to some person who owned racehorses.</P>

      <P>I learned it by experience. Of course, there is no great point in that, because we would always have to feed straw to cattle, whether it be wheaten or oaten straw, and the more cattle we have the more farmyard manure we will get.  Senator Baxter referred to the question of flax. I grew flax myself during the last war, and was very interested when I found that we are growing it here again and that there is an opportunity of disposing of it profitably.  I made inquiries and was in touch with people in the flax industry and in the ropemaking industry, and the impression I got was that we are making a good bargain in getting binder twine in return for our flax.  We could not possibly get on at the moment if we did not get binder twine.  Consequently, we are very lucky to have flax to give in exchange for it.  I am quite certain that, if there were any means of getting artificial manures, they would be got.</P>

      <P>On the whole, I have no complaint to make about the general tone of the discussion.  I welcome especially the contributions of Senators Goulding and Mrs. Concannon. I should like to disabuse the Seanad of the impression that I put down this motion merely in order to find fault with the Minister.  I had no such intention.  Our problems demand a different type of approach altogether. The contributions of Senator O Buachalla and O Máille were, of course, no help whatever, but I am refreshed by the approaches made by Senator Goulding and Senator Mrs. Concannon.  To be quite frank with the House, I put the motion down in this form because it is a fact that whatever efforts the Minister has made up to the present have not borne fruit to the extent which is necessary. Looking at it from the national point of view, I think it is not the right attitude for members of this House&mdash; I do not mind what side they are on, whether it is Senator Sir John Keane or anybody else&mdash;to make the British case.  Why should anyone here say that there is no use in asking the British to give us artificial manures when they have not enough for themselves? We are so decent and we have so much consideration for them that we would not dream of asking them for anything so long as they want it themselves? That is not my attitude at all. I have been challenged on many occasions for displaying a sympathy with the British that was foreign to people on the other side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said the last day I think it is a help to the Minister that people like Senator Johnston and myself and other members of the House should stand up deliberately and say that we think the British ought to give us a square deal.  It should be a <Col N="1524" /> help to the Minister in dealing with the British to know that there are people here&mdash;not of his Party at all, but people whom the British might regard as more moderate&mdash;who are not at all satisfied with the results of our bargaining with Britain.  That is why we have approached this matter in this particular way.  I repeat that we ought not to make the British case by saying that they cannot be expected to give us what they want for themselves. The Minister did not make that case, and it would have been helpful if some Senators had read his speech more carefully.  On the particular point as to what the situation is in Britain with regard to artificial manures, the Minister was questioned by Senator The McGillycuddy, who said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is one question which the Minister definitely did not deal with. I asked him whether he could tell us if, having regard to the British programme of agriculture, they have artificial manures which they could give us?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I did answer it in this way, that I said that the British Government tell us they have none to spare.  We may have our own opinions on that.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the Minister has.  Senator McEllin has left the House, but he could tell what some farmers in the west are paying for sulphate of ammonia.  When the Minister was addressing himself to the question, he referred to the fact that he was there in 1941, but I would like to mention that there is a great change in the Britain of 1943, and that it is going to change with increasing rapidity inside the next 12 months.  I agree absolutely with Senator Mrs. Concannon and Senator Johnston in that respect, and we ought to try to make hay while the sun shines. Whatever An Taoiseach or the Minister may say, we farmers know that a serious situation with regard to our soil fertility is developing, and to the extent that we are losing fertility we are getting poorer every day.  I do not want to see at the end of the war and for years afterwards&mdash;like the people who are building up the Tennessee <Col N="1525" /> valley in America and putting a huge amount of capital into it to restore the desolation&mdash;our farmers having to put colossal capital back into the land to restore its fertility, apart altogether from the destruction of the construction of the soil.  That is the process which is going on side by side with the loss of fertility.  When you take away the fertility you alter the construction of the soil, and that is one of the things which practical farmers know and dread.  That is why we must fight for a situation here to ensure as far as we can that we are going to get the material to keep our land in good heart.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan adverted to the point I made about binder twine, but if I gave the impression on the last occasion that I was excluding the importation of equipment for our threshing mills and repairs to our binders, or binder twine, nothing was farther from my mind.  We want all those things because they are all part of our whole tillage plan.  In exchange for what we are sending out we want all that is necessary for the equipment of our agriculture.  It may, however, interest Senator O'Callaghan to know that we grew last year 18,000 acres of flax.  When I questioned the Minister on the relative values of imported binder twine and exported flax, he left the House under the impression that he thought one equalised the other.  I have gone to the trouble of trying to get out figures.  We grew 18,000 acres of flax last year, and I am sure some Senators will be startled to know that one neighbour of mine from an acre of this crop got £80 plus 80 half-crowns. Let us put the value down at £60 per acre and you get over £1,000,000 for the whole crop, grown mainly in the three northern counties, with a little bit in West Cork.  Senator Johnston will corroborate the price, which was about 22/6 per stone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Senator could give us the weight in stones. You might grow flax as you might grow wheat on virgin soil, and get a very big crop, but then go to the next place next year and you might not get half the crop.  I think £60 an acre is very big.</P>

You can get the potash for beet also; and I am afraid that altogether too high a proportion of the fertilisers available are going to be allocated to beet, leaving a much smaller proportion available for greens and roots.  I am much more concerned about the production of potatoes, especially at the present time.</P>

      <P>I agree that the labour is very considerable.  I have not gone into the question of the number of men that would be required.  Perhaps 16 men would pull an acre of flax, and I put their wages down at about 6/- a day.  What I am trying to point out, however, is that we may put down the value of our flax last year, taking one acre with another, as close on £1,000,000.  I have been trying to ascertain the value of our binder twine as against that, but I cannot get figures as to the binder twine imports last year.  The methods by which these returns are given in round figures prevent a segregation of different imports, so I do not know what the value of the imports was last year.  I have gone, however, to the statistics, and the highest figure I could get for the years 1936, 1937 and 1938 was for 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> The binder twine imports for 1936 were valued at £18,000.  Let us assume that they were doubled, quadrupled or even ten times the quantity last year.  That would still represent only £180,000, and we are sending out £1,000,000 worth of flax. If we were able to import fertilisers at the 1936 figure they would approximately represent £500,000.  Our flax exports alone last year would have done much more than pay for all these artificial fertilisers, for the 200,000 tons which Senator Johnston gave us to-day while imports of binder twine would also make a very big contribution towards the payments for fuel which we are using in tractors and other machinery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am refuting that.  The Minister at first gave us the impression that that was the position, but later on he did not stand over that.  It is important that we should know these things.  As far as the Minister's approach to this is concerned, I am not finding fault with it.  I would not expect the Minister to come to the House and say that there were other things which could be done.  I would not expect him to tell us that there was negligence or that there was a situation in which it was obvious that there had been failure.  I am not approaching it from that angle at all. I do not want to pass judgment in a way which is unfavourable to the Minister, but I want the House to say that the line I am taking indicates a proper approach to this question.  I think no one attempted to deny that we want artificials.  I do not like the attitude of Senators in this House who use the argument that Britain also wants these artificials.  Let Britain make that argument if she wishes, but if that argument were put up, I would make the point that in the case of nitrogenous manures and sulphate of ammonia, which she makes in immense quantities, she has been able to give her farmers 4 cwt. to the acre.  If she gave her farmers 3 cwt. to the acre, the yield would probably be just as <Col N="1528" /> good, and if we could get that other cwt. per acre, it would make a tremendous difference in our yields.</P>

      <P>I know what conditions are across the Border.  I have been across there and have seen it.  Senator O Buachalla puts me the question: What would I do if the Minister were turned down, would I show fight? Well, I would say that I would not run away from a fight if anybody wanted fight, but I would choose my ground, and I do not see why we should have to fight at all.  The Minister told us he was across in 1941.  I say there are a great many people dead since that <Col N="1529" /> time, and I believe that the time is ripe for a fresh approach.  Senator O Buachalla told us that there were continuous negotiations.  He told us a number of things of which I have no personal knowledge.  I could not get any information on this by any other method than by putting down this motion.</P>

      <P>So am I.  Senator O Buachalla said there was a sort of plan by which certain commodities were purchased in order of preference?  I know nothing about that.  How could I be expected to know it?  The Senator puts me the absurd question: &ldquo;If the Minister asks for so and so and does not get it, what is he going to do.&rdquo; Anybody who knows anything about negotiations knows that the party which is seeking something will not go up to the other party and say: &ldquo;I am asking for so-and-so, and if you do not give it to me, I shall strike you between the two eyes.&rdquo;  It is quite absurd to put a question like that to me.  I think that there is no necessity to anticipate a refusal because we are having discussions with them frequently about certain commodities.</P>

      <P>About artificials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Senator O Buachalla tell me when last a communication passed between us and the British on this matter?  I do not know. I have not seen it.  There is no such thing as continuous negotiation about artificials or anything else.  In discussions of this kind discussions are carried on between Department and Department, and you know the way these communications go on.  You know very well, even if you were in love, there comes an end to these continuous communications, and it could only be said by someone who does not understand the question that we are writing every day about artificials and they are telling us that they are not going to give them.  It is all too grotesque.  I refuse to be drawn along that line.  I do not think that we have to face up to the situation of what we have to do if they refuse to give us <Col N="1530" /> more, because they are giving us some. My view is, as it was the view of Senator Johnston, that the farmers can make better use of the land and that they would have more for the British if Britain were more expansive.  The Minister talks of 1941, but that is two years ago.  Perhaps we are all in a different mood now.  If we got into discussions of that kind it might be the foundation for the wiser course of action on many other problems.  It does not mean that it must be a policy of compromise or that compromise must be all on this side.  In any dealings we are going to have there must be a <i>quid pro quo.</i>  My feeling is that Britain is getting more from us than we are getting in return.  In circumstances like these I do not think fault ought to be found with me for asking this House to put it to the Government that the soil conditions, the profitability of agriculture and the whole future of our people are bound up with our ability to sustain soil fertility. That is the object of my motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that I am justified in asking that of the House in view of the fact that every farmer knows that unless we can get more artificials into our land for the next year or two in return for what is being taken out of it, it is not the farmers who are going to suffer most.  No matter how strenuous the efforts farmers make to get the crops it will not pay to get them, and it is not the farmers who are going to go short.  The farmer and his family are not going to be anything like as short as people in the towns.  We could not get a price from Britain for our bacon and butter, and what was the consequence?  Our own people are also short of bacon and butter.  The agricultural industry is very complex and the machine highly geared up, and you have to plan in terms of years, and if you are negligent the consequences are inevitable.  I put it to the House that my approach to this question is reasonable and fair.  I had no desire to score off anybody and certainly no desire to score off the Minister.  The Minister was quite clear, and we got a great deal of valuable information which we would not have got if this motion had not been put down.  I beg <Col N="1531" /> the House to appreciate the fact that there are things on which we should be able to agree.  It is in no way humiliating to the Minister for one of the House of the Oireachtas to say unanimously that the situation is such here that we ought to have an effort made by the Minister, and that such effort in the new circumstances would bring more fruits than we have been given up to the present.  That does not say that the Minister has not done his best.  As Senator Johnston has put it, I believe that those on the other side might have done more.  It is quite conceivable that they may be in the mood to-day to do more.  I would certainly put it up to them.  I do not want to continue this discussion nor to go into any of the points, some of them quite cantankerous, but I ask the House to accept the motion.</P>
