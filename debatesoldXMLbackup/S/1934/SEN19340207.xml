      <P>On behalf of Senator Foran, I formally move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 24 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>24.&mdash;Where under this Act compensation is payable in respect of injury by accident to a workman, whether such injury does or does not result in his death, the court may where it is satisfied that medical or surgical treatment has been rendered to such workman direct the payment to the medical practitioner or practitioners by whom such treatment was rendered of such sum as the court, having regard to the circumstances of the case, may consider reasonable and may direct the manner in which such sum shall be paid and any sum so ordered to be paid shall be in addition to the compensation payable to the workman under this Act.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 24 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>24.&mdash;When compensation is payable under this Act in respect of any injury to a workman, whether such injury does or does not result in his death, and the court is satisfied that medical or surgical treatment has been received by the workman, whether in hospital or elsewhere, the court may, out of the compensation payable under this Act, direct the payment to the medical practitioner or practitioners from whom such treatment has been received of such sum as the court, having regard to the position in life of the workman <Col N="306" /> and to all the other circumstances of the case, may consider reasonable for such treatment and may direct the manner in which such sum shall be paid: provided that this section shall not apply to an agricultural labourer entitled to free medical treatment in his own dispensary district by the dispensary medical officer of that district.</P>

    <P>New section.  Before Section 73 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>73.&mdash;Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  compensation is payable under this Act in respect of an injury to a workman, and</P>
    <P>(b)  such workman has received, whether in hospital or elsewhere, medical or surgical treatment in respect of such injury, and</P>

    <P>(d)  such compensation is fixed by an order of the court or under a weekly payment agreement, commutation agreement or an agreement by way of compromise registered by order of the court under Part VI of this Act,</P>
    <P>the court may, if it so thinks fit, upon the application of such medical practitioner made immediately upon the making of such order, direct the employer to pay, in addition to the compensation, to such medical practitioner in respect of such fees such sum, not exceeding five pounds, as the court may fix, and if such direction is given the payment by the employer to such medical practitioner of the sum so fixed shall be deemed to be a payment, by such workman to such medical practitioner in respect of such fees.</P>

      <P>I suggest that amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4 might be perhaps more conveniently discussed together since they all deal with the same matter.  Senator <Col N="307" /> Foran's amendment, proposes the securing of the doctor's fees at the expense of the employer.  There was another suggestion that the doctor's fees should be secured at the expense of the worker, and I brought in an amendment which was an alternative to both of these, namely, that his fees should be secured to a limited extent.  The one principle is involved in the amendments.</P>

      <P>As Senators are aware, I have not been at any time enthusiastic for the insertion in this Bill of any section with respect to the payment of fees due to doctors for attendance on a workman injured in the course of his employment. I have felt that any statutory provision governing the payment of these fees would be bound to result in a general increase in the cost of medical attention to such workman and that, therefore, the cost of workmen's compensation and the cost of insuring against employers' liability in respect of it would be increased. As, however, there appears to be a substantial body of opinion in the House in favour of the insertion in the Bill of some section securing the payment of fees to doctors attending such workmen, I felt that it was desirable that a proposal, embodied in the form of an amendment to the Bill, should be submitted which would be to some extent half-way between that suggested by Senator Foran on the one hand and that suggested by Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger on the other hand.  Both Senator Foran's amendment and the suggestion of Sir E. Coey Bigger are designed to secure to the doctor his fees without limit and that whatever the doctor claimed he was entitled to for his attendance on the workman was to be secured to him.  The only difference between the two amendments was in regard to the source of payment.  Senator Foran suggested that the whole of the fees <Col N="308" /> claimed by the doctor and assessed by the court should be paid at the expense of the employer, whereas Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger's suggestion was that it should come out of the compensation awarded.  Either suggestion, in my opinion, would be very undesirable. On the one hand, the payment of the fees at the expense of the employer, without any limitation on the employer's liability, would, in my opinion, almost inevitably lead to substantial charges under that head. I mentioned last week that in one particular State the cost of workmen's compensation was increased by such a provision by over fifty per cent.  and it would almost inevitably have the same result here.  If we are to increase the cost of workmen's compensation to employers I would much prefer that we would do it for the purpose of increasing the cash payments to the workmen.  On the other hand, if we are to make the doctor's fees chargeable against the amount of compensation awarded to the workman there would be very little left for the workman in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been taking on this Bill with relation to the maximum payments provided.  There are many cases, however, in which these maximum payments are never made.  Senators may not be aware that the average payment in respect of workmen's compensation for six industrial groups, excluding agriculture, in 1930 was £22 10s. 0d.  The average payment in respect of agricultural workers injured was only £13 11s. 0d.  In the six industrial groups payments average from £30 5s. 0d. in the case of constructional workers down to £18 16s. 0d. in the case of railway and tramway workers.  If we contemplate a reduction of even £5 on the average payment in these cases the reduction in the compensation will be a very considerable part of the whole.  On that account I felt that we should not, under any circumstances, enact a section which would secure the doctor his fees without limit, whether paid by the employer or out of the employee's compensation.  Therefore, I suggested an amendment in the form <Col N="309" /> which now appears on the Order Paper providing for the payment by the employer, at the discretion of the court, and on application to the court, in addition to the compensation, such fees, not exceeding £5, as the court may fix.  If such direction is given, payment by the employer to the doctor of the sum so fixed shall be deemed to be a payment by the workman to the doctor in respect of such fees.  It is understood that, in the event of the doctor's reasonable fees being in excess of that amount, the doctor is still at liberty to recover from the worker the balance of the fees due after the amount to be paid by the employer has been fixed by the court.  These fees will be payable only in cases where compensation is fixed by order of the court or under an agreement registered by order of the court.  I do not think it is possible to make provision for other cases.</P>
    <P>Following the discussion here last Wednesday, I have received representations from various parties interested in this matter and, particularly, from persons associated with insurance companies, who have represented that even this very limited provision is bound to affect the cost of compensation considerably.  Having regard to the average payments made in the rases to which I have referred, an all-round increase of £5 per case would mean, of course, a very considerable burden on employers and would necessitate a very substantial rise in compensation insurance premiums.  I do not think it will mean, necessarily, an all-round increase of £5 per case. The doctor, in many cases, will try to argue that fees for his services do amount to the £5 mentioned in the section, but the court in many cases will hold that a smaller fee would compensate the doctor for his services. However, even if the average cost of workmen's compensation is increased, in consequence of the enactment of this section, by a much smaller amount than £5 per case, there will be, nevertheless, an increase which is bound to have its reflection in the cost of insurance against this liability.  If the Seanad is strongly of opinion that some section safeguarding <Col N="310" /> the doctor should be inserted in the Bill, it is not a matter that should be made one of serious contention, but I would strongly urge them to reconsider their attitude on the matter.  I should prefer that the Bill would be left in the form in which it was introduced, but if the Seanad wants to insert such a section I would urge the adoption of the Government amendment which fixes a definite limitation on the amount rather than the acceptance of either of the other amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust anything I say in reference to the amendments will not be taken as disrespectful to or causing any reflection whatever on the medical profession.  We have many eminent doctors amongst us, some of them enjoying world-wide fame.  The Irish doctors, men and women, are renowned the world over, and no profession is more venerated by our people, particularly by the poor.  Our doctors are renowned not only in this country but in other countries, and particularly in the industrial centres in England, for being painstaking, for their charity, for their affability and, above all, for not being greedy, a complaint which may be made of other professions and businesses.  That being the case, it has occurred to me that the bartering that has gone on in reference to the payment of doctors' fees has been a little indecent.  I cannot see why the same law should not apply to doctors as to other creditors.  It is a great mistake to bring in special legislation dealing with doctors.  It is a very bad precedent to establish in Acts of Parliament and to single out any profession for exceptional treatment.  On that score I am opposed to the amendments. At the last meeting of the Seanad I had the temerity to suggest that other creditors should be considered as well as doctors.  I took my cue there more or less from a statement previously made by the Minister. The Minister has now let me <Col N="311" /> down, so that I might quote the old saying: &ldquo;Do not put your trust in princes too much,&rdquo; and I might apply it even to Ministers.</P>
      <P>During my association with the Seanad I have seen Ministers sitting still, and not budging an inch when they had a big majority behind them. I take more than a passing interest in the present Minister, because his father and myself have been lifelong friends.  Although I do not agree with him in this matter, I am glad to say that he is human and that he has given way a little.  I can fully understand his position when faced by men of the sincerity of Senator Sir Edward Bigger.  However, I think it would be a mistake for this House to pass the amendments.  It is a bad principle to show preferential treatment towards any creditors in any Bill.  If this is passed another Bill will come along, perhaps, in a month's time from the lawyers saying: &ldquo;Oh, we should be paid for our advice.&rdquo;  The bankers may then come along saying: &ldquo;Oh, surely we should be paid first, as we supply the money.&rdquo;  Then shopkeepers, tea merchants, dairy proprietors, provision merchants or others, if they can get sufficient friends in this House, may come along.  The same thing is going to happen, so that I do not know where it might end.  I am not saying that those submitting the amendments are wrong, but I believe I am right in my contention.</P>

      <P>As this matter was thoroughly debated before there is nothing left for the members of this House to do but to make up their minds on what proposal they will accept.  I think Senator Wilson will agree with me in accepting the Minister's suggestion, that it would be the wisest course to have the three amendments withdrawn and the clause left in the Bill as introduced. We have a very good case in my amendment for excluding agricultural labourers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir E. Coey Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  It appears to me that Senator Counihan's amendment is not in <Col N="312" /> order, because it deals with the Medical Charities Act, which is not in any way touched on in this Bill.  The Medical Charities Act was not framed for the purpose of meeting accident cases, and it does not require dispensary medical officers to attend in accident cases.  These medical officers must first of all be provided with tickets.  The tickets are in two forms, either to attend a person at the dispensary or in his own home.  The doctor need not attend at all until he is furnished with a ticket, which can be given only to a poor person.  The proposal here is not to relieve the poor person but the employer.  The employer is the person who is going to pay.  Therefore, to bring in a provision that he is to be relieved from doing so, because there is a dispensary medical officer available, is, to my mind, quite wrong.</P>

      <P>As regards the point of order, whether the agricultural labourers are or are not entitled to free medical treatment, I find it very hard to rule.  My personal knowledge is that numbers of people who meet with accidents are treated in hospitals. They are, as a matter of fact, treated there, and if that were against the law, as is suggested, I do not think they could be treated.</P>

      <P>My contention is that we are already paying dispensary doctors for work which it is proposed to pay them for under this Bill. Whether their fees are sufficient or not <Col N="313" /> is another question.  The dispensary doctors get remuneration for attending to people who are not able to pay for medical treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of the agricultural labourers are entitled to red tickets, and they get them.  That is the only class my amendment deals with.  It would be rather hard on farmers, for the sake of compensating dispensary doctors, whom they are already paying through the rates, that they should be asked to pay up to 35 per cent. in the way of insurance.  That is what it would amount to.  The average amount of insurance paid in accidents for agricultural labourers is £14.  I am informed that that was the figure in 1931.  The premiums on farmers will now be increased by 35 per cent.  It is with the farmers I am particularly concerned.  They will have to pay the whole amount of the increased premiums, and not the insurance companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they will have to recoup themselves in the form of increased premiums.  The contention of juries is: &ldquo;Oh, the insurance companies will pay.&rdquo;  Juries are in that way inclined to go to the full limit when awarding damages, and in a small way I think that may influence more than juries when considering the compensation to be given to doctors.  I am satisfied if the Minister will agree to leave the clause as it originally appeared in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be clear as to the meaning of some words in one amendment. &ldquo;The court may, upon the application of such medical practitioner made immediately on the making of such order direct the employer to pay in addition to the compensation to such medical practitioner... a sum not exceeding five pounds.&rdquo;  Does that cover all medical practitioner's fees and hospital charges?  I know of a case near home recently where a servant girl slipped and fell when carrying a sack of meal.  She went home after a month, <Col N="314" /> and her mother kept her at home because her leg was painful.  An action was taken and the judge awarded £30 to the girl.  There were six medical men and three lawyers engaged. Finally the girl got £5 for herself which she did not desire.  The lawyers and the members of the medical profession divided the remainder.  I think the premium to be paid might be considerable. We should know that £5 will cover the whole of the medical expenses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain sum due by the injured worker for medical and hospital treatment.  That sum may, in the opinion of the doctors or the hospital authorities concerned, exceed £5.  This amendment, as drafted, provides that the court may order that up to £5 whatever sum is due by the workman for medical fees and hospital treatment shall be paid by the employer.  The balance, if there is a balance, is still a charge against the workman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in our admiration, as so beautifully worded by Senator O'Neill, for the medical profession, we are inclined including the Minister too readily to agree to the general principle of an amendment without considering exactly what its full effects would be.  I have read these three amendments very carefully and have given the matter considerable thought during the week, and I have come to the conclusion that the Minister's earlier speeches were much better than the speech he made last week.  The one he made to-day was rather better than the one last week, but in the earlier speeches he showed that he knew more about it than we did, and if we had accepted his point of view then, we would have been wiser than we were last week.  That is a further compliment, if he likes to take it as such, following on the compliments <Col N="315" /> Senator O'Neill has showered upon him.  I think, however, that we are going gaily into an amendment which although prepared by the Minister or by his Department has not been fully considered.  We are not quite clear as to what it will mean.  The Minister has stated and I, on my information, know, that it is not at all infrequent that there are two doctors in a case of an accident, one called in at the beginning, and the other&mdash;the medical attendant&mdash;afterwards, and I am told that there are a number of cases in which there are three and even four doctors.  The Minister stated&mdash;and I presume he is right, though I rather think the opposite, but we will assume that he is right because it makes my case stronger&mdash;that you might even have £20 awarded if the court agreed. It has already been shown that the £5, even assuming that there is only one doctor, represents somewhere about 25 per cent. of the average claim.  I have made careful inquiries and I am informed that the considered opinion of the principal insurance companies dealing with this business is that the Bill as it stands, that is, without this amendment, will mean an increase of approximately 15 per cent. on the insurance premiums paid at present. That will apply to farmers, to manufacturers, to traders and pretty well all round.  There might be some slight variation, but I am told that that will be the figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will allow me to go on and develop my argument, I will meet, or try to meet, the point raised by Senator Dowdall.  My information, which is given to me by representatives <Col N="316" /> of leading insurance companies, is that without this amendment the increased premium will be approximately 15 per cent.  That is due to increased benefits provided under the Bill.  I am informed on the same information, which I regard as reliable, that the estimate made by representatives of the insurance companies, a number of whom have, I believe, met together, is that this amendment will involve a further 25 per cent.  Whether that is a reasonable view or not, I am quite satisfied as to my authority, and that is their view.  I am therefore, very reluctantly of the opinion that it is a reasonable view and one which we will not be able to combat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dowdall dealt with a point with which I intended to deal.  He said that that was on the assumption that there would be £5 in every case.  I have come to the conclusion that while I do not say that there will be £5 in each case, and I do not think the 25 per cent. is based on the full £5 in each case, it will be the maximum in a very large number of cases.  Under the provisions of the Bill, any workman, no matter how small the settlement&mdash;two weeks, three weeks or four weeks&mdash;can go to the court and have that agreed, and approved.  If his medical man says: &ldquo;You get £5 for me or £3 or £4 out of the insurance company or the employer, as the case may be,&rdquo; all he has got to do is to insist on this settlement which, being small, would not have gone to the court, and all he need do is ask his solicitor to take it to court to have it approved.  The medical man can then claim his fee, and I do not say that he is wrong in doing so; I am merely trying to deal with the effect of the amendment if passed.  I do not know who will pay the solicitor's fee in that case, but perhaps the Minister has considered that point and could answer it, but I imagine that the employer would probably have to pay because it would be increased costs.  I know, as an employer in a small way, that in preference to doing that I would prefer to pay £4 or £5, because when a workman goes to court, as he is entitled to do, or his representatives, to get a settlement approved, and you have a claim made which you previously <Col N="317" /> resisted, and the court awards £3, £4 or £5, I think the expenses will come on the employer.  The net result of that will be that in most cases this claim will be made and, in saying that, I am not merely giving my opinion, but the considered opinion of some of the experts.</P>
    <P>The attitude taken by Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger, for which I have the greatest respect, even though I am unable to agree with it, is that as the employer is paying why should not the employer pay the additional fee.  This was put very well, I think, by Senator Comyn in one of the earlier stages of the Bill.  If we were dealing with a case of negligence on the part of an employer, he should pay and should pay the medical costs as well, We are not dealing with a case of negligence, but <i>bona fide</i> accidents for which the employer has no responsibility.  The whole of this Bill is putting on a certain class of the community&mdash;and I am not objecting to the principle of the Bill and I never have&mdash;who are the employers, the responsibility for helping out people who are their work-people in case of an accident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of and in the course of their employment.  That is simply an additional charge to a business or to a manufacturer or farmer and he has to include that in his costs.  I am of the opinion that at present the increases provided by this Bill of about 15 per cent. of his costs are as much as are reasonable and it would be very unwise on the part of the House to add another 25 per cent. or 20 per cent. as the case may be to that amount.  My information is that it will be 25 per cent. and for that reason and not because I am out of sympathy with the suggestion originally made, I would oppose the amendment as it stands.  Senator Johnson has pointed out that the accident was arising in or out of the employment.  If some person meets with an accident which does not arise out of the employment, who pays the medical fees?  If a man is poor he is entitled to certain public services.  I <Col N="318" /> contend that there is no specific reason why the employer as an individual person should meet the fees.  It is not a question of justice or right or charity or good-will towards doctors. It is a matter of what percentage you can reasonably and properly add to industry, to the farming community, to the railways and to the others who will be definitely hit by it.  This Bill means a definite increase of 15 per cent. and I do not think any of us will dispute that figure having regard to the increased benefits.  I think that is as much as is reasonable at present. Most of us know quite well that the tendency of the last two or three years has been to increase costs by various services.  Many of these were desirable but there is a limit beyond which, having regard to competition and to the prices which the public will have to pay, it cannot be increased.  You may say that you can charge industries which have high protection anything because they can get it out of the public again.  That can only be done under tariffs so high that the industry can get it back out of the public and I hold that that is not desirable. Otherwise, if they cannot get it back out of the public you will only be crippling them by increased costs. You may say that 25 per cent. on workman's compensation insurance is not an enormous amount.  To some businesses, it would not be an enormous amount but to others, where rates are high, it will be a very considerable amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have this steady tendency to increase rates without, in my opinion, full consideration of what is being done.  I do not think that the Minister, from his speech, really believes in his heart that it is wise to insert this amendment.  I take it that the amendment is simply suggested to the House and while technically a Government amendment is not one by which the Government stand or fall.  It is a matter for the House to vote.  I think I am correct in reading that into the Minister's speech, and I suggest that we ought not to pass any of these three amendments and that if the House desires to make any provision at present for dealing with <Col N="319" /> medical fees, none of these three amendments provides the way to do it. Senator Counihan will forgive me if I say that his amendment is rather typical of those who represent the farmers&mdash;as long as the farmers do not pay it does not matter who pays and so long as there is no 25 per cent. increase on farmers, it does not matter about other employers.  It may be said that I am being selfish in my attitude but I should be false to my position here if I took the attitude of ignoring the interests of those whom, to some extent, I represent here.  To my mind, if this is to be done it can be done in one or two ways.  It could be limited to fees in cases of larger claims.  I do not think the employer class as a whole would object to a certain addition to the larger claims of over £200 or £300 in order to provide a specific fee for the doctor.  I certainly would not though I cannot speak for others.  If it were on the basis of a reasonable percentage of the claim, we should know where we were and we should know what the increased cost was going to be.  As it stands now, it is £5 whether the claim is a £500 claim&mdash;and conceivably the doctor's fees might be very high&mdash;or whether it is a claim which is the average claim&mdash;and £22, I think, was mentioned&mdash;or even smaller because if the average is £22 there must be many of £10 and below it.  My information is that the increase will be 25 per cent., making 40 per cent. in all, and I put it to the Minister, to the Government and to this House that it is not wise to add 40 per cent. to the premiums as an increased cost on employers generally, particularly in the case of industry at the present time.  It will be serious in the case of railways; it will be serious in the case of the building trade and pretty serious in the case of farmers, all of whom pay fairly high rates of premium. In the case of some trades in respect of which the rates are very low, I admit it will not be as serious a matter but again, it is not of much value because where the rates are low, the number of cases is small.  On the whole, I believe that none of these <Col N="320" /> amendments are worthy of the support of this House and I hope they will all be rejected.</P>

      <P>We were perfectly satisfied with the Minister's proposal, but the speeches of Senator Douglas and Senator O'Neill make us wonder if they are more interested in insurance companies than the relief of injured workmen.  What are these sacrosanct insurance companies any more than &ldquo;laying off&rdquo; bookmakers of the odds against injury?  There is a disparity between the statements of the amounts to be charged against &ldquo;industry.&rdquo;  Senator Douglas in one part of his speech mentioned 15 per cent. and then 26 per cent. Senator Counihan assures us that there will be 35 per cent. charged by these sacrosanct insurance companies which presumably cannot be brought to heel by the Government.  Of course they can.  What is the premium that the employers are required to pay?  About half a crown a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas says: &ldquo;Let us look at what will happen if we accept what the Minister proposes.&rdquo;  I say: &ldquo;Let us look at what will happen if it be not accepted.&rdquo;  You shall have thrown upon an overworked medical profession which hitherto has had no rights in regard to the collection of fees, a set of imposed and unwelcome patients.  I do not say for a moment that these patients are going to get any worse treatment than they have had hitherto, but in view of the fact that every one else connected with insurance is paid and protected a compulsory and unpaid patient probably will not be a <i>persona grata</i> in a hospital ward.  His recovery may be hurried and his convalescence curtailed. There is a story told in connection with the legal profession about a man on whom a brick fell.  When he had paid &ldquo;all fees due&rdquo; to his solicitor, and found that above and beyond the compensation award he was still a debtor he asked the solicitor &ldquo;on which of us did the brick fall?&rdquo; We do not want the brick to fall solely on the medical man because his patient might be in as bad a position if he were to be left to the mercy of an aggrieved and unpaid doctor who <Col N="321" /> has got no chance at all of collecting or even expecting fees.  The position is different while the man is in the hands of a solicitor.</P>
    <P>There is one point which has been overlooked in this discussion, and it is this: the high percentage of cases settled out of court, 80 per cent., that is one in four, never go before a judge. We are told that these sacrosanct insurance companies, with whom nobody is to interfere, will increase their charges by 15 per cent.  At another moment we are told by Senator Douglas it will be 25 per cent., while we have the categorical statement from Senator Counihan that it will be an increase of 35 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

      <P>The Senator differentiates between &ldquo;categorical&rdquo; and &ldquo;definite.&rdquo;  He must have been in touch with some of the insurance satraps.  I think that Senator O'Neill must have had direct information from some insurance society.  These societies soon must cater for the people they insure.  We are told that there is very little insurance business here.  Why, in exception to all other trades, does increased insurance business, instead of resulting in a lessening of costs, lead to an increase of premiums?  Take the recent example of compulsory insurance for motor-car owners.  Do you find the insurance companies, because they have a monopoly of a trade, lessening their premiums to meet a greater income from universal business?  Not at all.  There is instead an increase of 25 per cent.&mdash;and this, why?  Because everyone has to go to them to be insured.  We were told by a banker in this House some years ago that the reason why Ireland had to pay 1 per cent more for money than people had to pay in England was because there was not enough business here. In other words, because we were too solvent and, therefore, less to be trusted!  But now when we have an increased volume of business there is yet to be an increase in the charges. This is contradictory.  There is direct and sinister connection between insurance <Col N="322" /> companies and banks, and it is this, that when the banks invest in insurance companies they can count on about 13 per cent. of a return for their money.  Therefore, they are not inclined to lend capital to struggling industrialists at 5, 6 or 7 per cent. The insurance company, we are told, may throw the charge back on industry. They are one of the greatest brakes and preventatives of industries. When it is only a charge of 2/6 a head it should be an easy thing for the Government to tell the insurance companies that they cannot go beyond that.  They should even reduce it in view of their increased business.  They have insured those employees up to the present for 2/6 a head even though medical fees might reach an unlimited award.  In the early days there was a sort of a ramp in regard to compensation claims.  Some doctors who had not a high sense of ethics made a point of exploiting an accident. Certain solicitors did it too.  An accident, say, at Ranelagh, might have meant a stampede of doctors from Merrion Square&mdash;first aid!  But now it is a matter for legislation to prevent a ramp of insurance charges beyond the ordinary rates that have hitherto obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, so many of these cases are settled out of court, that as regards the doctors' fees there is about a four to one chance of recovery. It is only the odd case that comes into court, or where the man is so injured that he has had to go to the nearest hospital.  The doctor may be up with him all night and his condition may be a matter of concern to the hospital staff.  That presumably is to pass without any remuneration, not from the goodwill of the public and not from the Government, but from these insurance companies. I think it is a monstrous thing that we should be at the mercy of statistics which are, so far as we know, proprietary and not open to the public.  When you have a dispute, the insurance company will send down a person who will divulge certain information privately to a county councillor or public body or harbour commissioner, but not to the public.  They <Col N="323" /> will only divulge certain facts and figures in the absence of the Press. Why should there be anything hidden about a public compulsory or national thing like insurance?  Why all the hugger-mugger?</P>
    <P>We all know that the Hospital Sweep was not very difficult to institute, because after all it was only an extension of an insurance system, the only difference being that when you win a prize in the sweep you get your money, whereas if you win in the case of insurance you do not always get your money if you are exempt from criminal negligence.  Here is a case in point which I would ask the Minister to take note of, because it has not yet been legislated for.  I had the misfortune when motoring from Dublin to Bray, 20 or 21 years ago, to run over a child.  My man happened to kill the child.  The circumstances were such that it was an absolutely unavoidable accident.  Had my car been stationary the accident would have occurred.  The accident happened at Donnybrook.  The father of the child came to me and said that I had killed his son.  I said that I was not going to be a party to any conspiracy of any insurance company and I told him that I was well insured. The case was thrown out of court because it was shown that the accident was nobody's fault.  In other words, my driver was a sober and careful man.  Had he been drunk and it was found by the court that he was criminally negligent the insurance company might have had to pay up to £3,000 or £4,000.  As it was, I paid all that I could afford.  When I went to the insurance company and pointed out the hardship of the case&mdash; that I held an &ldquo;accident&rdquo; insurance and that this was a pure accident&mdash;I was told that if I wished to pay &ldquo;alms&rdquo; to the father, I could do so out of my own pocket!  Nothing, of course, could compensate the father in terms of money for the loss of his child.  I was told by the insurance company &ldquo;if you like to give alms you can do so, but we do not cover that kind of thing.&rdquo;  It is high time, I think, that the workers of this country <Col N="324" /> should not be put at the mercy of people who can look on the payment of compensation when there is loss of life as &ldquo;alms giving!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan talked about farm labourers who get a red ticket.  He knows a lot about the kind of treatment they are liable to on a red ticket.  I know the case of a mountainy man who came from Senator Counihan's district and suffered from a peculiar sickness.  For three days neither the doctor nor anybody else could diagnose his disease.  In fact, the red ticket was turning blue&mdash;like litmus paper.  The priest came to him and said to him: &ldquo;If you do not tell me what is wrong with you, I will not give you absolution.&rdquo;  After a long, reluctant, amorous delay, he said: &ldquo;Father, I am in love.&rdquo;  I think the House ought to bear in mind that we have been fairly met by the Minister. Particularly when we know that it is only in one case in four that the doctor has a chance of recovering or claiming fees.</P>

      <P>Senator Gogarty's complaint seems to be all against the insurance companies.  Our complaint is that if the amendment brought in by the Minister were accepted, it would be a serious matter for the farming community so far as making provision for accidents to their men is concerned.  I do not know where Senators got this figure of 2/6 as the fee that would be charged for insuring workmen.  That passes my comprehension. I know that on a wage bill of about £500 a year you have to pay £7 or £8 to the insurance company, and that certainly is more than 2/6 a head.  Senator Douglas referred to the 15 per cent. that will be collected in future from employers in connection with the passing of this Bill.  As a matter of fact, it was collected two months ago from me.  That charge of 15 per cent. has been made in consequence of the passing of this Bill and now we are asked to add this £5 for the doctors.  In the case of agricultural labourers, I have been told that the increase will amount to 35 or 40 per cent.  The insurance companies will force employers to insure to that <Col N="325" /> extent.  That is a serious matter, because as a rule accidents among that class are not of a very serious character, and even when compensation has to be paid it only varies from about £12 to £14, taking the average case.  Senator Gogarty referred to the man who was in love. Would the Senator consider that it would be fair to ask a farmer to pay £5 in connection with a case like that to a doctor?</P>

      <P>Well, as regards the love case, why should the doctor get the £5 or why should the farmer have to pay him £5?  My objection extends to the three amendments.  We thought last week that the Ministerial amendment would be carried. Our amendment is a kind of compromise. So far as I am concerned, I would be glad to see the Minister's amendment and Senator Foran's amendment eliminated, and leave the Bill as it stands.  The agricultural industry has quite enough to bear at the present time without anything more being added to it.  In the case of my own employees, as I said before, the insurance companies two months ago raised the rate by 15 per cent. I can assure the House that that is no fairy tale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment was put down to protect the injured workman. If Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger will withdraw his amendment, and if the Minister is prepared to leave the Bill as it was when originally introduced to the House, I think it would be much better for the whole of us. I certainly think that the Minister <Col N="326" /> was right in his original attitude on this Bill.  A clause of this nature is unique in workmen's compensation law and it would be very difficult to operate it in this country.  The number of cases in which compensation is paid and which go into court is very much less than the number of settlements made out of court.  In the case of arrangements made outside court, the doctor would not be entitled to the beggarly £5 mentioned in the Minister's amendment.  I think that we would be all much more satisfied if amendments of this nature were entirely withdrawn and the Bill allowed to remain as it was when brought into the House.  Senator Gogarty's reference to the Hospitals Trust reminded me of a story I heard about an injured workman who wrote to his wife and family in the country telling them that he had got £100 compensation. His solicitor said: &ldquo;Of course, you will not get £100, because you will have to pay my fees out of that.&rdquo;  The doctor said: &ldquo;My fees have to be paid out of that sum.&rdquo; The patient turned to a neighbour and said: &ldquo;Write to my wife and family and tell them to go into the poorhouse until I go home.  I have got £100 compensation, but when the solicitor and doctor are paid, there will be nothing, left&mdash;not even the amount of my train fare home.&rdquo;  That is the position for which we are heading in this arrangement.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger that he withdraw his amendment and that the Minister withdraw his amendment.  I shall certainly be prepared to withdraw mine and to leave the Bill as it originally stood.  The doctor has as good a claim for his services in court as any other creditor.  People who make an arrangement outside have the means of enforcing it.  It is up to the doctor to make some similar arrangement, but not in this way.</P>

Everybody here <Col N="327" /> seemed to be very sympathetic in making allusions to the medical profession. They pointed out how much the doctors should be paid, but when it comes to payment, because it will raise the insurance rates&mdash;nobody knows how much and everybody is still talking of the maxima&mdash;they try to influence members.  I think that that is most unfair and unjust.  I withdrew my amendment on the understanding that the Minister's amendment would be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister should consider the question very carefully before he agrees to withdraw his amendment.  Doctors are in an entirely different position from anybody else.  When a workman meets with an accident, his solicitor is paid. He takes good care to stop his payment. There is no use in bringing the grocer, baker or anybody else into the question because they are paid.  If they are not paid, they bring the debtor to court.  The doctor is entitled to adopt the same course but, in practice, he does not do that.  If an accident happens in Dublin, the injured person is brought to hospital. A doctor cannot claim for his services in a general hospital in Dublin. Many people seem to be under the impression that because these are charitable hospitals, a workman who meets with an accident should be treated free, same as people who really need free treatment.  I do not see why a man in business or a farmer should expect either the hospital or the doctor to give free treatment to his employee&mdash;in other words, to give charity to him.  He can insure his workmen and the premium is very low.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>About 37/- per cent.  An ordinary workman, paid £2 per week, would cost his employer in insurance about 37/-.  If that premium is increased by 15 per cent., it is not a great deal.  If a man is loading heavy goods for his employer an accident to those goods might cost the employer £100.  I know of a case where a workman <Col N="328" /> saved his employer damage to the extent of £100 at the expense of having his knee-cap smashed.  The very least that that employer should do would be to see that the man was properly insured.  He had him insured, as a matter of fact.  Senators are aware of the system in Dublin. Outside doctors&mdash;most of them specialists&mdash;attend the general hospitals. When a man meets with an accident, the ambulance comes along. The ratepayers have to pay for that ambulance service.  The injured man is brought into hospital.  The staff in the hospital know that the outside doctor is not paid.  Therefore, they want to make sure that the man is seriously injured before they ring up for him.  The man is examined by the senior medical student, in the first place.  If he considers the case serious, he brings along the house surgeon. If the house surgeon thinks the case is sufficiently serious, he calls in the outside doctor&mdash;the specialist.  Often-times, treatment in that way delays the cure.  If the staff in the hospital knew that the outside doctor would be paid, they would ring him up at once.  The first thing an injured man should get is proper medical attention. There is no use in talking about the grocer or the solicitor or the baker in this respect.  What the man needs is first-class medical treatment.  There is no reason why the doctor should not be mentioned specially in the Bill. Other parties will bring a debtor to court but the doctor will not.  You have to take things as you find them in practice and the doctor should be protected and paid as well as anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion, which has taken place has raised points of very great importance.  I refer particularly to the speech made by Senator Douglas and to one or two speeches made since.  It must be remembered that the accidents covered by this Bill are accidents arising out of and in the course of employment which is normally for the benefit of the employer, financially or otherwise.  Surely the cost of an occurrence due to that employment is part of the responsibilities which the employer is prepared <Col N="329" /> to undertake in the course of his business or personal activities.  I have here the report of the Departmental Committee which inquired into this question.  In Appendix VI are printed the International Labour Draft Conventions and Recommendations Relating to Workmen's Compensation. Article 9 of these Draft Conventions states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Injured workmen shall be entitled to medical aid and to such surgical and pharmaceutical aid as is recognised to be necessary in consequence of accidents.  The cost of such aid shall be defrayed either by the employer by accident insurance institutions or by sickness or invalidity insurance institutions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Internationally, there was a very sharp distinction made between a debt for medical attendance which was a consequence of the injury and a debt for ordinary maintenance &mdash; food and clothing&mdash;mentioned by one or two speakers here.  It is quite customary for large industrial concerns to have medical and nursing assistance attached to their establishments.  From the arguments used here, one would imagine that that kind of assistance should be paid for by the community, that it is unjust and unfair that the employers in these large establishments should have to bear the cost of this special medical attendance.  I could understand that view if the speakers were prepared to argue in favour of a State medical scheme in which all medical attendance for general purposes would be provided by the State. But the people who argue that specialised individual treatment ought not to be paid for by the employer, or the insurance company which covers the risk of the employer, would be aghast at the thought that the medical service should be nationalised.  The case for insuring payment of the medical attendant is, I think, a sound one.  The case against charging the cost of that insurance to the workman is very much stronger.  However, we have Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger and those who supported him on previous occasions, as well as Senator Counihan and Senator Wilson, urging that whatever is to be paid for medical <Col N="330" /> service shall be taken from the injured workman.  That is a proposition which I am surprised that anybody, after the discussion that took place, here, should have included in an amendment such as that put forward by Senator Counihan.  It indicates that, whatever else may happen under this Bill, the workman, in Senator Counihan's mind and Senator Wilson's mind, will have to bear the cost of medical attendance.  That is to be the case notwithstanding that in 37 per cent. of compensation cases in 1930 agricultural labourers received benefits for a period of less than four weeks and that the maximum rate of compensation was 17/- or 18/- a week. Notwithstanding that, Senator Wilson and Senator Counihan want the medical charges to be borne by the workman.  Senator Foran's amendment had as its object the saving of the workman from that imposition. Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger's amendment was in line with that of Senator Counihan.  If that case is not to be pressed, then Senator Foran is right in withdrawing his motion and having the whole thing left as it was.  Nevertheless, I still think that payment should be secured to the medical attendant.  But that payment should be borne by the employer.</P>

      <P>I do not want to discuss this matter, but I want to make a suggestion.  So far as I can see, no intelligent decision is going to be arrived at to-day, and the suggestion by Senator Foran to withdraw his amendment seems to be a suggestion of despair of finding a way out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that Senator Milroy is not correct in saying <Col N="331" /> that Senator Foran has agreed to withdraw his amendment in desperation. There is no desperation at all about it.  Senator Foran's amendment was put down to meet what had been put down by Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger.  Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger's amendment meant that the doctor would be entitled to go to the courts and that, out of the compensation to be awarded to the injured workman, the court was entitled to pay the doctor's fees.  That was the purport of Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger's amendment.  In order to prevent that taking place Senator Foran's amendment was put down deliberately to say this, that if this House insists on the doctor being paid for his services to a workman who meets with an accident the person who should be saddled with the responsibility of paying such fees was the employer in carrying out whose business the workman met with the accident.  In order to meet the situation, the Minister agreed to put down an amendment which he thought would meet the views of a section of the House and which he thought would safeguard the position as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of ground has been covered to-day with regard to this particular matter.  Senator Douglas held up the picture that the insurance premiums were going to be increased out of all recognition.  By the time he was finished adding the premiums on there was going to be about 100 per cent. added on.  For what?  Are the insurance companies not to take into consideration that under the terms of this Bill they will secure a tremendous amount of relief?  Are they to be allowed to get away with the fact that under the terms of this Bill the maximum weekly allowance paid to the workman injured in an accident is reduced from 35/- to 30/- a week?  Is that not to be taken into consideration, when the amount of the premiums is being made up?  Is it only what they have to pay that is to be taken into consideration and that it does not matter by what amount they are to be relieved?  I can say from experience that the workman as <Col N="332" /> a whole is generally prepared, according to his means, to pay for whatever services he gets from the medical profession.  In the trade union of which I am a member I have been paying for the last 16 or 17 years an extra contribution every year for the purpose of handing over that contribution to the hospitals in Dublin in case any of the members of that trade union require treatment in these hospitals, and my particular trade union is not alone in that respect. Some years ago the organised workers of this city went to the organised employers of this city and put up a proposition that we were prepared to meet them halfway if the employers would put up their share of the contributions.</P>
    <P>To get back to the particular amendments: I have every sympathy with the medical profession.  Nobody has more respect for what they do for the poor than I have, but personally I think it is a mistake that we should enact in legislation to be passed here, any provision that would mean that certain people are entitled to go to the courts to be paid under these conditions. Personally, if I were a medical man I should be opposed to it.  I think it is degrading to the profession. I think anybody liable to pay should be compelled to pay, but from what I know of the medical profession and what they have done for the poor I think this would be a mistake. There is no muddle about this, nor is there any necessity to recommit this Bill.  We have discussed this particular item for three days and everybody has his mind made up about the matter.  We put down this amendment, not for the purpose of having it inserted in the Bill but as a safeguard, so that if Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger's amendment was going to be carried, at least you were not going to make the unfortunate workman, who is bad enough through having been injured and having his earnings reduced, in delicate health and with a family dependent on him, pay the medical fees for an accident for which he is not responsible.  With regard to the amendment in the name of Senators Counihan and Wilson, upon <Col N="333" /> my word I am ashamed of them.  They are out to safeguard their own position as farmers but they have no consideration for the unfortunate workman.  I will tell you why.  An amendment is put down here that anybody who is not an agricultural labourer and who meets with an accident is liable for medical fees without limit.  That is what their amendments amount to.  It means that in the case of an unfortunate working man, earning £5 per week&mdash; say, an engine driver&mdash;whose maximum compensation would be 30/- a week, fees without limit should be given.  All I have to say is, God save the unfortunate worker from the farmers.  The unfortunate working man would have to pay fees out of any compensation awarded to him, whether it is a lump sum or a weekly payment, and no limit would be put to these fees.  We are going to resist that and I think that, under all the circumstances, the best thing we can do is to leave the Bill without any amendment as has been suggested. Senator Counihan is agreeable to withdraw his amendment and Senator Foran is agreeable to withdraw his amendment also.  Therefore, I think, that under all the circumstances, the best thing to do would be to withdraw the three amendments and to allow the Bill to remain as it is.</P>

      <P>I explained that my amendment was produced following the introduction of amendments by Senators Foran and Sir E. Coey Bigger and certain discussions that took place between myself and members of the Medical Association, who were introduced by Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger.  Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger's amendment is not now on the Paper because I gave an indication of my intention to put down this amendment. I stated on that occasion&mdash;I quote the words from Column 293, Volume 18, No. 2 of the Official Debates&mdash;that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When this matter was under discussion in Committee I argued against the insertion of any special provision to secure the payment of fees to doctors concerned in accident cases of this kind on the grounds that the doctor had precisely the same right in law to recover the debts due to him as any other creditor of the injured workman, and that there was no special reason why a debt due by the workman to the doctor should have priority over a debt due by the workman to the butcher, the baker, the grocer, or to the landlord for rent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I opened my remarks with that sentence, and then I stated that as it appeared there was some possibility of one or other of the amendments being inserted it would be preferable to provide a section which would provide for the payment of fees up to a certain maximum.  In view of that, Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger has withdrawn his amendment in favour of the Government amendment now on the Order Paper, and I think, therefore, that it is essential, in justice to Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger, that this amendment should go to the House. The procedure would be that if the amendment is carried it indicates the <Col N="335" /> wish of the House that it should be so carried, and, if it is defeated, it would then be open to withdraw the other two amendments.</P>

    <P>(5)  Every animal about to be killed in a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard shall be instantaneously slaughtered or shall by stunning be instantaneously rendered insensible to pain till death supervenes and such slaughtering or stunning shall be effected by means of a mechanically operated instrument in proper repair and condition of a type approved by the Minister for Agriculture used by a person who is at the time the holder of a licence issued by the sanitary authority under the provisions of Section 3 of this Act, and every occupier of a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard shall keep a mechanically operated instrument of a type so approved in a proper state of repair and fit for immediate use and, where such instrument involves the use of explosive cartridges, an adequate supply of such cartridges: provided that the provisions of this sub-section shall not apply to an animal slaughtered for the food of Jews by a Jew duly licensed for that purpose by the Board of the <i>Shechita</i> of the Jewish Community of Dublin and holding a licence granted by the sanitary authority or for the food of Mohammedans by a Mohammedan holding <Col N="338" /> a licence granted by the sanitary authority if such slaughtering is carried out according to the Jewish or Mohammedan method of slaughter, as the case may be.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should point out that all the amendments in my name are drafting amendments, which have been prepared in consultation with legal gentlemen who were good enough to give their assistance.  During the proceedings of the Select Committee 18 amendments of substance were inserted to meet various points put up.  These are drafting amendments some of which have been rendered consequential owing to changes effected in the Bill during the Select Committee proceedings.  If Senators will look at amendment 18 they will find that &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is defined and also &ldquo;person in charge.&rdquo;  The amendment will ensure that a number of words embodied throughout the section will be eliminated and that there will be a considerable reduction of verbiage and a help in subsequent interpretations. The amendments are calculated to put the Bill in a more comprehensive form legally, and generally to improve the drafting.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Sub-section (6) is not drafted in a way that would commend itself, and I propose to substitute the words in this amendment.  As originally introduced, the Bill provided that no person of 16 years of age or under should be permitted to be present during the process of slaughtering or dressing of a carcase. As a result of the evidence of numerous witnesses, it was agreed that that might impose hardship on a boy who, after leaving school, wants to begin to serve his time to the butchering business and it was urged that we should make the age the school leaving age of 14 instead of 16.  At the Select Committee that was agreed to and it was also agreed to strike out the provision whereby a person of 14 years of age or under should not be permitted to be present during the dressing of a carcase.  It was realised that this might be very difficult of administration in the case of the children of a butcher who might, no matter what surveillance was exercised, be present during the dressing of a carcase.</P>

Does this definitely exclude bona fide farmers who for the present, because they are not able to sell their cattle or sheep, are compelled to slaughter them?  Four a week would probably be the greatest number.  It is only a temporary phase of their business and I should like to know definitely if they would be excluded.</P>

      <P>If a farmer turns butcher and proceeds to kill cattle, he would be brought within the ambit of the Bill but after amendment No. 19, which I propose to ask the House to accept, is accepted, it will not apply to him if he confines his activities to the slaughter of pigs or sheep for sale, but it would apply if he has a regular business in the slaughter of cattle for sale.  He will become a butcher for the time being and will be competing with butchers in the slaughter and sale of cattle.  No good argument has been advanced as to why he should be exempt because he is killing cattle for sale because it pays him to do so rather than to continue as a farmer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that that does not satisfy me because farmers at the present time are in the position in which even the purchase of the humane killer would be a very heavy tax on them.  I wish to give notice of my intention to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to exclude them definitely. I am altogether in favour of the Bill but these farmers are going through a temporary phase in their business and they will cease to be butchers of any kind, except perhaps for killing a pig occasionally, when our markets are restored.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>10.&mdash;The provisions of this Act shall not apply to any person engaged in the slaughter of pigs, sheep or goats for the purpose of the flesh being used as butcher's <Col N="344" /> meat who does not slaughter any other animals for that purpose.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was introduced it contained a clause that the provisions should not operate outside of two miles of a Gárda Síochána barracks. From the evidence we had before us at the Select.  Committee, we found that it would be rather difficult to work the Bill and keep that clause in. My attitude was the same as Miss Browne's.  I wanted to protect farmers who occasionally kill for local sale and who, at present, by reason of the prices for cattle, sheep and other animals being so low and in many cases being unable to dispose of them at all, sell them locally to their neighbours.  Several provisions in the Bill prevent farmers from doing that.  Farmers do not want to come under the heading of butchers, particularly in view of what Senator O'Farrell said about butchers in his Second Reading speech.  He stated that they were excluded from juries in the old days and that would be one reason why they would not like to be classed as butchers.  If I started to kill cattle and sheep, I might be prevented from continuing as a member of the Seanad and the insertion of this amendment will insure that these people who kill sheep or pigs or goats will not be required to conform to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the House to accept this amendment.  I am sorry that it should be necessary but Senator Counihan has made a very strong case particularly for the small type of farmer butcher who, owing to the conditions under which we live, has found it necessary to kill sheep and sell them for food.  I am afraid that it is in that connection that a considerable amount of cruelty occurs, but we are at least fortified by the hope that the arrangement is only of a temporary character and the actual number of animals involved will not, in the aggregate, be very large.  Senator Miss Browne would, of course, like cattle to be included, but there is this to be said, that when a farmer turns butcher he ceases to be a farmer only.  He becomes a <Col N="345" /> butcher and entitled to all the profits that a butcher has and he should, consequently, assume the responsibilities that are imposed on a butcher. He cannot have it both ways.  In this case, we are catering for a particular type which will, I hope, find it possible to go out of business in this line within a limited period. The amendment, as moved, will, I think, require drafting and we will look into it between now and the Report Stage.  Meanwhile, I ask the House to accept it or, at least, the principle of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Seanad censures the Executive Council for their action in appointing, pursuant to Section 4 of the Land Law (Commission) Act, 1923, Mr. Daniel J. Browne, and Mr. Eamon Mansfield to be Commissioners of the Irish Land Commission, in view of the implied assurance conveyed by the Minister in charge of the Land Bill, 1933, when that Bill was in process of enactment by the Dáil and the Seanad that such Commissioners would be appointed <Col N="346" /> from within the Land Commission or otherwise from the ordinary Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The object of this motion is to call attention to the appointments recently made in regard to the positions of lay commissioners under the Land Act, and to give the Minister an opportunity of justifying them and, if possible, reconciling these appointments with a certain statement made by him in the Seanad during the passing of the Land Bill in August of last year.  Senators will remember clearly that an amendment was moved to Section 7 of the Bill by Senator Counihan which, if it had been accepted, would have had the effect of securing that the appointments to such positions, in the first instance, would have been men who would have had experience of Land Commission work prior to the 1st June, 1933.  When that amendment came up for discussion in the Seanad, the Minister in charge of the Bill made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not see, for the life of me, why anybody might reasonably fear that the Executive Council in the future will not appoint men to the post of land commissioners or officers of the Land Commission or members of the Appeal Tribunal whom they can stand over in public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He also stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In practice, from the point of view of carrying out the purpose of the amendment, I would have no objection to it, but there is a principle involved which I am not going to accept, and that is that the Executive Council is not to be entrusted with the appointment of the members of the Appeal Tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If those statements were not intended to convey the impression that it was the intention of the Minister to give effect to the purpose and principle of Senator Counihan's amendment it is difficult to know what meaning could be read into them, unless it was the object of the Minister to mislead the House as to his real intentions.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely necessary to stress the importance of these positions of lay <Col N="347" /> commissioners in regard to the administration of the Act.  By sub-section (5) of Section 7 they may override the opinion of the judicial commissioner in matters both of law and fact. It was because of this, certainly, that members of both Houses argued strongly for the insertion of some provision in the Bill such as that embodied in Senator Counihan's amendment which would be a guarantee that the lay commissioners would be men whose experience would ensure impartial and equitable administration of the Act when it came into operation.</P>
    <P>Statements similar to those I have quoted of the Minister, in some respects perhaps more explicit as assurances, were also made by him in the Dáil.  It will hardly be questioned that it is of the greatest importance to have men of experience and administrative capacity discharging the duties which the lay commissioners will be entrusted with.  Will the Minister throw some light on the qualifications in this respect possessed by those who have been appointed?  The only reply made by the Minister to all the criticisms and arguments in regard to this matter in both Dáil and Seanad was to repeat that there would be no appointments that he could not stand over in public.  Can he stand over in public the appointment of a national school teacher and a country solicitor at a cost to the country of £3,000 a year?  Mr. Mansfield will enjoy his pension in addition to his £1,500.  I do not know what the amount of his pension may be, and I would like the Minister to tell us.</P>
    <P>Certain provisions in the Land Act have been the cause of great instability in the country and of great uneasiness in the people's minds.  The farmer with his market taken from him and his property threatened with confiscation is in a terrible position.  The appointment of these two lay commissioners, who are also appeal commissioners, has not tended to allay his fears.  This motion gives the Minister an opportunity to show that he can stand over the present appointments and to furnish evidence of the qualifications of the men appointed in <Col N="348" /> regard to both experience and administrative capacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I rather regret that it takes the form of a vote of censure.  I would prefer if we could have contented ourselves with a simple interrogation of the Minister. I hope the Minister will be able to show in his reply to this motion that a vote of censure is not warranted, and that both appointments have been fully justified.  I regret that the Minister whose statements have been quoted by Senator Miss Browne is not here to-day.  It is not easy for the Minister who is present to, I suppose, take responsibility for everything that a colleague says.  I take it, however, that there is collective responsibility in the Ministry, and that therefore the Minister present takes responsibility not only for the appointments made, but for the statements made in connection with the appointments prior to their actual making.</P>
      <P>Senator Miss Browne referred, in the course of her remarks, to the fact that statements similar to those made by the Minister in charge of the Bill in the Seanad were also made in the Dáil and made in perhaps more explicit terms: in the form of an implied assurance that what was asked for in Senator Counihan's amendment was going to be complied with in principle if not in the actual wording.  I will refer the Minister to these statements which were made in that debate.  They are quite interesting and should not be lost sight of.  They are of sufficient importance, I think, to be dealt with by him when he is replying.  The quotation which I am about to give is taken from the Dáil Debates of the 25th July last, Col. 491.  Deputy Dillon was speaking to an amendment to Section 3 moved by Deputy Roddy in connection with the appointment of these lay commissioners.  He queried the Minister as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: Could not the matter be easily settled if the Minister would say what is in his mind as to whom exactly he will appoint to the rule-making authority?  Does he intend to appoint an existing commissioner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> Mr. Aiken: If it was to be done to-day I would appoint an existing commissioner.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: And may we take it that it is not his intention to appoint a commissioner who has only just been selected?</P>
    <P>Mr. Aiken: Not the slightest.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cosgrave: Will he say that he will not appoint a person without any experience at all?</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General: It is open to the Minister to appoint a land commissioner to this rule-making authority.  A man will be a commissioner the moment he is appointed. These rules are rules for the setting up of machinery, and the Minister has indicated that he has no more desire than Deputy Roddy to select anyone for the rule-making authority who does not know his job.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lynch: What is the objection to putting in the two years' experience?</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General: The man appointed will only be one member of the rule-making authority.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brennan: But what is your objection?</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General: The suggestion that the Minister would appoint anyone without experience is so absurd.</P>
    <P>On Section 5 the matter cropped up again and the following quotation is taken from Col. 570 of the Dáil Debates; also for the 25th July:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Aiken: The position is this, that I think the present Government is as capable of choosing men to be lay commissioners as either the British Government or the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Hear, hear.</P>
    <P>Mr. Aiken: When we appoint lay commissioners we will stand over them in the Dáil and in the country. When we appoint two lay commissioners to be members of the paid tribunal we will appoint efficient and competent men upon whose honesty the country and the Dáil can rely.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: With experience of the Land Commission?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> Mr. Aiken: With experience in these matters.</P>
    <P>These extracts which I have quoted, if they mean anything, would seem to imply that men of practical experience in administration of Land Commission work would be appointed to these positions.  I cannot see how any other meaning can be read into these words. As Senator Miss Browne has stated, the assurances given in the Dáil were repeated in this House, I admit in a slightly modified form, on the occasion of Senator Counihan's amendment. What I am concerned with is this: has the Minister kept faith with the Dáil and the Seanad in these appointments, or is it to be the procedure that implied assurances that certain things will be done will be accepted in good faith and then brushed aside as of no consequence when the carrying out of the assurances is expected to be given effect to?  I hope the Minister will have an answer to these criticisms.</P>
    <P>In regard to the two gentlemen appointed, I have no personal feelings whatever.  I met one of them once in a most casual way, and that is the extent of my acquaintance with him. As regards the other gentleman, I never met him and would not know him if I saw him.  The only evidence that I have been able to secure as to the qualifications of these two gentlemen is what appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> when their appointments were announced. As regards the qualifications of Mr. Browne, they are set forth in the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Browne from 1920 to 1922 was Secretary to the Department for Home Affairs under the Irish Republican Government, and was largely responsible for the administration of the Republican Courts and Republican police.  He was imprisoned for some months and was released shortly before the Truce.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1922, Mr. Browne resumed his practice as a solicitor in Tralee and became solicitor to County Kerry Board of Health, Listowel Urban Council and County Kerry Vocational Education Committee.  He was also appointed solicitor to Kerry County Council, but the appointment did not <Col N="351" /> take effect owing to the amalgamation of that position with that of secretary to the County Council.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Browne won first place at all his legal examinations, and at the final examination was awarded the gold medal of the Incorporated Law Society.  He was one of the three members of the Commission which inquired into the shooting of T.J. Ryan and George Gilmore, at Kilrush, County Clare.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the qualifications.  I presume if there were any additional qualifications they would have been enumerated in this newspaper, but I cannot find one iota of evidence to indicate knowledge or administrative experience of this particular class of work: anything that would show that in making these particular appointments the Ministry carried out the assurance that was given here by the Minister in charge of the Bill when it was passing through this House.</P>
    <P>As regards the other gentleman, his qualifications were set out in the same newspaper in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Mansfield is a member of the Central Executive of Irish National Teachers' Organisation, and has had a long and distinguished career as a national teacher.  He was three times elected President of the I.N.T.O., and from 1911 to 1916 acted as General Secretary.  As President he was spokesman of the deputations which visited Mr. Lloyd George, and Mr. Augustine Birrell&mdash;</P>
    <P>these may be his qualifications&mdash;</P>
    <P>(then Chief Secretary for Ireland) in connection with the national teachers' salaries question.  He also took part in discussions with the Provisional Government in regard to the finance of Irish education.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1922 Mr. Mansfield became a Senator, but resigned as a protest against the execution of Republicans. Subsequently he was appointed, on the nomination of the Labour Party, a member of the Commission of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Mansfield is a keen student of all land purchase problems and <Col N="352" /> has been Chairman of the Land Settlement Association and the Cottage Tenants' Association since their establishment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are Mr. Mansfield's qualifications. I fail to find, as in the other case, the slightest evidence of what, I think, is the essential requirement for this appointment&mdash;administrative experience.  When this amendment of Senator Counihan was passing through the House, Senator Comyn made the following illuminating observation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think that the Minister has shown any disposition to yield to political pressure in the appointments which he has made or which he proposes to make in the Land Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder if Senator Comyn is prepared to repeat that statement to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that the best time to answer a charge such as Senator Milroy has made against me is on the spot.  What I said on the last occasion sounds now to me to be very reasonable and very moderate.  I did think at the time that the Minister had shown no disposition to yield to political pressure in any appointments which he had made.  I think that the same thing applies, to a great extent, to the Government in their appointments. A great number of appointments have been made&mdash;300 or 400&mdash; and instead of giving them to political favourites they have given them&mdash;they are small appointments&mdash;by way of competitive examination.  Here we have a vote of censure based upon what is described as an &ldquo;implied assurance&rdquo; given by the Minister in charge of the Bill in 1933, that the lay commissioners would be members of the Land Commission or the Civil Service.  So far as my recollection goes, there was no such assurance.  I am sure that Senator Milroy will agree with me that when there was a motion before the House to confine the appointments of the lay commissioners, as they are described here, to persons already in office, that motion was not accepted by the Minister.</P>

Therefore, I cannot see how the Minister gave any &ldquo;implied assurance&rdquo; that he would appoint any member of the existing Land Commission, and I think that there was never any suggestion that he should go to the ordinary Civil Service for lay commissioners to sit beside Judge Wylie in his court.  If he gave any such assurance, I should be greatly surprised because it would be a very absurd thing to do&mdash;to put beside a judge of great eminence, great ability, and great experience, a civil servant, presumably with no legal training and no experience, who would pit his opinion against the opinion of Mr. Justice Wylie on legal questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a job for a civil servant.  The Dáil and the Seanad have decided that, instead of one opinion on matters to come before the tribunal over which Judge Wylie presides, a limited number of quasi judicial matters are to come before Judge Wylie and his two colleagues. The Dáil and the Seanad have passed this Bill.  Therefore, they have decided that, instead of one mind as heretofore, there shall be a majority of three minds to determine these questions henceforward.  Supposing Senator Milroy were to look around for people to be lay commissioners on either side of the judge, where would he seek them?  Would he seek them amongst the Land Commissioners who have been accustomed for years to receive the judgments of Mr. Justice Wylie and to obey them?  Would they be likely to differ from any judgment of that learned judge?  If they did differ from him and gave reasons for their differences of opinion, do you think that these reasons would carry much weight on a legal question or on any of the quasi legal and quasi administrative questions that will come before the tribunal?  Suddenly promoted from a position of habitual obedience to a position of quasi judicial and quasi Ministerial authority, what respect would these opinions command, if they were to differ at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> The Minister and the Executive being placed in that position by a statute of this Parliament, what were they to do?  I think that the selection of existing officials of the Land Commission was out of the question.  I think also that the ordinary civil servant was out of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no repeal of the Act and the Act gave them these special powers.  In that position, I do think that the Ministry chose the two men who were most suited for the positions and I shall give my reasons. It is said that Mr. Mansfield was a national teacher or an ex-national teacher.  Mr. Mansfield has been associated with public life for a long time. He was elected a member of this House, though I do not know whether he sat or not.  To my knowledge, he has taken a great interest in one class of the community&mdash;the evicted tenants. That shows he must be a man with a conscience and a heart, because the evicted tenants have been put in the shop window by every political party for the last thirty years.  They have been kept in the shop window and nothing worth while has been done for them.  I suppose they were too great an asset to all the political parties in the past to be lost.  I hope this Government will adopt a different attitude in dealing with what are eloquently <Col N="355" /> alluded to as &ldquo;the wounded soldiers of the fight.&rdquo;  They were the wounded soldiers&mdash;the casualties&mdash;in the fight, but by all previous Governments they have been left derelict. Mr. Mansfield has taken a very keen interest in that class of the community and that is one reason why I think that for the administration of this measure, which is meant to be a genuine measure, his selection is justifiable. There is another reason why his selection is justifiable.  The men who understand the land laws and the various Land Acts are very few.  The men who have a thorough knowledge of land legislation in this country are few.  In former times, Mr. Tim Healy and his brother, Maurice, were regarded as the only men in Ireland who understood the Land Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Cherry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Richard Cherry understood the Land Acts and wrote a book on them, but I do not think that he was regarded as having the same profound knowledge of these matters that was possessed by the redoubtable Tim and his brother, Maurice.  I am not saying that they possessed that knowledge but they had the reputation of possessing it and, perhaps, a just reputation.  In later times, I have not met any man, lawyer or layman, who has such a comprehensive, accurate and detailed knowledge of the Land Acts as Mr. Mansfield has.  I can say that from my own experience.  I knew nothing of the resolve to appoint him, but when I saw the announcement of his appointment I, to use an Irish phrase, said to myself, &ldquo;that is a good appointment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the case of Mr. Daniel F. Browne.  I know Mr. Browne well and I have known him for a great many years.  I knew him as a solicitor's apprentice in Dr. O'Connell's office in Tralee.  I knew him afterwards as a solicitor.  The record which has been read by Senator Milroy testifies to his ability.  He got first place in his examinations and he was a gold medallist.  It is not easy to become a <Col N="356" /> gold medallist, but I agree with Senator Milroy that that in itself would not be sufficient.  Here we find a man who was a brilliant scholar, and with experience as a practising solicitor in Tralee, and Senator Miss Browne says he was only a country solicitor.  That might be all very well for County Wexford but a country solicitor in Tralee in the County of Kerry is a different proposition altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation I should like to say that one of the ablest land lawyers in Ireland lives in Wexford.  He has had more land cases passing through his hands than any man in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but that only proves that he had a big business.  Many solicitors have big practices who are not necessarily very good lawyers.  However, I say that Mr. Browne acquired in a very short time a very extensive practice in Tralee, in the County of Kerry, where every man is a lawyer.  That is the reason why Senator Counihan manifests such a knowledge of law in the resolutions he proposes from time to time.  Let us see what Mr. Browne is.  Is not Mr. Browne, in addition to being a lawyer, entitled to the status of a civil servant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Miss Browne was enthusiastic once in 1920, 1921 and 1922, Mr. Browne was carrying on the business of the Home Office, which was established under Mr. Austin Stack.  In that way he had some claims to be a civil servant, although I do not admit that a civil servant has any right whatever to be made a lay commissioner.  Again, however, Mr. Browne was chosen from a great number of applicants, I am sure, for a very responsible position, that of Secretary to the Department of Justice.  Is there any objection to his work in that capacity?  I do not wish to utter of a member of my own profession too much by way of commendation, but I will say this in relation to Mr. Browne, that I believe that in regard to ability, in regard to experience, <Col N="357" /> and in regard to judgment and a fair outlook, he is as good a selection as could be made.  I would say also in regard to Mr. Mansfield from the point of view of commonsense and honesty of outlook no better appointment could be made.</P>
      <P>Now, it is very right, if occasion arises, that censure should be moved. in this Seanad.  Why not?  But I think that, on the present occasion, Senator Miss Browne has not made&mdash;and I say this with great respect to her&mdash;a proper use of that privilege.  There is no ground for censure here.  I do not wish to make any imputations or to have it understood that Senator Miss Browne has any particular ulterior motive.  In fact, I am sure she has not. She is inspired by political zeal and it has blinded her to the merits of these two gentlemen who have been appointed to this office.  Let her wait and see whether they are capable of fulfilling the duties of that office.  I do not accuse her of any improper motive at all in regard to this resolution, but I think she would have done much better if she had selected some other subject.  It is an invidious thing, when men have been appointed to an office, and before you have any experience of their conduct in that office, to introduce a resolution of this kind beforehand, casting a reflection upon them.  For that reason I hope that Senator Miss Browne will not press this resolution and that, if she does press it, it will be voted down.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Senator Comyn in suggesting that Senator Miss Browne should not press this particular question. My first reason is, to be quite honest, that the assurances which the Minister gave in this House were not sufficiently definite to justify the wording of the motion in its present form. Whether the Minister wanted to evade these assurances or not I do not know, but he did, and I do not think that the motion should be put forward in exactly the manner in which it has been put forward.  There is one point, however, which is important, and that is the question of the qualifications of these two gentlemen.  They are being put up to sit on the bench as judges. <Col N="358" /> In one case I am perfectly satisfied that the selection is justifiable.  That is the case of Mr. Dan Browne.  He is an extremely capable man and bears, in my particular county, an extremely high name.  Everybody was very pleased, quite regardless of Mr. Browne's political views or of their own political views, to see him promoted, as he was, to the Ministry of Justice.  I definitely think that people who have cases before the Appeal Tribunal should be grateful that they have got anybody like Mr. Browne on it.  As regards Mr. Browne, I think he is perfectly capable of being a judge.  It has been said that he is a country solicitor, but he has practised for a considerable time, and it must be remembered that most of the 38 district justices in the country were country solicitors who had got a sound knowledge of every type of law through their practices, and I think that everybody is agreed that on the whole those selections have been justified.</P>
      <P>As to Mr. Mansfield, I question whether the training of a teacher justifies the elevation of a man without legal knowledge directly to the bench of judges.  Beyond that I do not want to say anything more, but I think it is regrettable, when there are people with direct experience of the difficulties which have been experienced in the carrying through of these migrations from west to east, of the expenses entailed and of the impartial administration of justice as between all sides, that such people should not have been availed of to fill these posts.</P>

      <P>It has been attempted to twist certain words and phrases of the Minister here and in the Dáil into a promise that some person in the Land Commission itself would be appointed if anybody was to be appointed.  One of the quotations that have been made has shown very clearly that no such promise has been made. However, whether such a proposal had been made or not, I am strongly of opinion that it is very desirable that the Land Commission should not be kept, as it has been kept to a great extent, in a sort of private establishment to be run by a selected number of people who come in young and live all their lives in the Land Commission, <Col N="359" /> and the very nature of whose employment precludes them from being the likely persons to deal with such a subject as this which extends all over Ireland. As a matter of fact, I think it was extremely desirable that some breach should be made in that impenetrable mass of which the Land Commission consists, and that some people with outside experience and knowledge of the land should be appointed on any committee designed to rectify what has been done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose I have been connected with this matter probably longer than anybody here in this House, and I have had a good deal of personal knowledge both of the Land Commission and of the land itself and of all the different Acts passed from the very beginning; and I say, after consideration, that the Land Commission up to the present has not accomplished the work that was intended for it in the beginning.  The first Acts that deal very much with anything of the sort were passed in 1903 and 1909.  In those days the idea of appointing a Land Commission, and of the whole land legislation of the time, was that the land should be divided as much as possible, that tenants should be allowed to own their land, and that this should be carried out by commissioners who would see that it was carried out as quickly and as reasonably for all people concerned as was possible.  It was said always in the House of Commons and everywhere that this would be a cheap measure and that it would enable the business to be done cheaply and quickly.  Neither of these things has been accomplished. That was 30 years ago and, so far from the Land Commission having carried out the object for which it was established, it has blockaded it and prevented any such happy event resulting from what they were asked to do.  The fact is that it got into such a state of chaos and congestion that it was practically impossible to carry out anything. I myself happened to be connected with the selling of an estate a few years before the Great War.  It was held up, for one reason or another, <Col N="360" /> for some 15 years, although all the evidence that was wanted was put before the Land Commission.  All the previous rights in the land were already before them, and so on, and, in spite of the fact that the owners of the land and the other people concerned were anxious to see it carried through, it was held up for some 15 years, through letters passing and people coming down to see it, and all sorts of other things.  After the Treaty we were all hoping when we came here that this matter would be carried through, but every year we are being told that there are still some hundreds of thousands of acres of land in the hands of the Land Commission.  They are still stuck there.</P>
    <P>I remember, some years ago, going down to the south of County Mayo to pay a visit to a parish priest.  He brought me out on the balcony and said: &ldquo;Do you see that long line of houses over there, all built by the Land Commission&rdquo;?  I said that I did.  He said: &ldquo;Those houses were built six years ago and there is no one in them yet.  Although the land has been bought no one has been put into the cottages yet.  Now I am going to have a mass meeting to see what effect it will have.&rdquo;  It did have an effect, because immediately after the meeting, and the parish priest pressing the matter, people were put into those houses.  The Land Commission had the land and the houses, had the arrangements made, but they were so immovable, and there was so much congestion in the offices, that they could not get the people into the houses.  That is only an example of what is going on all over the country.  People who will get rid of that mess require to have some outside influence.  I know Mr. Browne: I do not know the other gentleman, but I am aware that he always took a popular interest in the land question.  I think it was necessary in whatever appointments were to be made that something should be done to break through the formidable mess that existed.  It was like having 20 or 30 cars blocking traffic in a narrow street, people being unable to get out at one side or the other.  That state of affairs would continue for <Col N="361" /> years if something was not done to end it.  The Land Commission has got very large quantities of undivided land in its hands.  Why?  I do not know.  In some cases, where land was divided, rents were fixed that the people were unable to pay.  To my own knowledge people with good farms of 20 acres were unable to pay these rents, and they let the land for grazing.  I asked them why they let the land in that way and they told me that it was impossible to pay the high rents that had been fixed. The whole question has been blocked in that way.  I am very glad that some effort has been made to break through the system that existed, of having scribblers spending half their time writing notes in the Land Commission offices.  It is time to stop it.</P>

      <P>The circumstances should be very strong indeed before such a House as this should pass this motion.  Ostensibly this is a motion to censure the Executive Council for having made two judicial appointments. There is no gainsaying that if the motion were passed it would be an implied censure, indirectly perhaps, but an implied censure on two men exercising judicial functions. The reason should be very grave, and should be adequate, before such a motion was tabled.  I can speak for one of the Commissioners who, to my personal knowledge is not only a brilliant lawyer but a man of great independence of mind and character. He had a very extensive legal experience in a county where, almost as a matter of course, a considerable portion of his practice would be dealing with problems such as will come before him in the office to which he has been appointed.  There will be this very great advantage that in the discharge of his duties as a practising lawyer in the past he was on one side one day and on the other side the next day, so that he got to know the merits and the demerits of cases in a manner that no civil servant could possibly acquire.  Mr. Mansfield's name has been a household word in connection with the land problem for many years.  He is a man of character. <Col N="362" /> I do not know him personally.  I know Mr. Browne professionally, and in his capacity as Secretary to the Department of Justice.  I know that Mr. Mansfield was one of the best-informed men in Ireland on the land question.  To put it mildly, to table a vote of censure, having regard to the qualifications of these two men, is a rather irresponsible proceeding and I think the Seanad should not, in the circumstances, pass it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only think that Senator Miss Browne did not recognise the full implication of the motion she put down.  As Senator Dowdall pointed out, it is a motion of a far-reaching character.  I know one of the Commissioners intimately for 30 years, and I can speak with full knowledge of what he has learned in the school of experience during that period.  As a brilliant young man, he gained one of the highest places in his college course, and afterwards in his professional career.  He is a Munster sportsman, and when a man is a good sportsman it will generally be found that he is broad-minded, and a good sportsman in most things.  At a very early age, when Ireland was one, he was elected by 11,000 national teachers, composed of men and women of all creeds and politics, not only for three years, but for a longer period to a very responsible position, that of Secretary of the Teachers' Organisation, which he filled with great credit and satisfaction.  Preferring to go back to teaching, and possibly wishing to go back to live in the county in which he was born, he withdrew from that position.  He is the son of an evicted tenant.  He worked on the land in his youth.  The land was one of the loves of his boyhood and it followed him into his mature years, so that his name is a household word in connection with the land question. I do not think there is one man in Ireland who has made such a persistent study of land legislation as Mr. Mansfield.  The various Acts of Parliament dealing with the land question, and with the financing of these Acts are matters with which he is perfectly familiar.  If Senator Miss <Col N="363" /> Browne inquired from some of the members of the Party that she so enthusiastically supports or from the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Hogan, on whose authority we can rely, they would go far to disillusion her, because when the Land Act of 1923 and later Acts were before these Houses Mr. Mansfield was continually in touch with the framers and his help was much appreciated.  He was responsible for many of the amendments that were introduced and passed by both Houses.  That is something to go on in regard to his training.</P>
      <P>For a number of years Mr. Mansfield was in intimate touch with the creameries of his native county, and at one time was manager of some of these creameries.  His activities were of the most diversified character.  He was also on the Wages Board, being the mutual selection of employers and employed.  If the Cathaoirleach harks back to these days, possibly about the year 1921, he may remember meeting Mr. Mansfield in his capacity as Chairman of the Wages Board, which was afterwards taken over by the Department of Industry and Commerce. These were some of Mr. Mansfield's activities.  It was stated recently in a Sunday newspaper that Mr. Mansfield was Chairman of the Evicted Tenants' Association.  That is not correct.  He was Chairman of the Executive of the Land Settlement Association, quite a different body.  In his capacity as Chairman of the Wages Board, and as Chairman of the Executive of the Land Settlement Association, his judgment was always accepted by employers and employees, because he was found to be generous and broad-minded in his outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Miss Browne spoke of land confiscation.  It was not to-day or yesterday that the word confiscation was used.  It was used very frequently in connection with the Land Act of 1923, and even later.  The word was used in this House when the Land Act of 1933 was before it.  In its general principles that Act was nothing more than an alteration, in a detailed way, of the Act <Col N="364" /> of 1923.  I think I can appeal with confidence to Mr. Hogan, T.D., to bear me out when I say that Mr. Mansfield's services were very valuable at that time.  He had the interest of the small farmer and workers generally at heart. He was chairman&mdash;a position he has recently resigned&mdash;of the Cottier Tenants' Association, a very large and important body of people.  Another statement in the same newspaper was not quite correct.  It stated that those appointed were not civil servants.  I think Mr. Browne and Mr. Mansfield have a reasonable claim to be considered civil servants, if that is any recommendation for their selection for the Land Commission.  When confiscation is mentioned, we know that the alarm is only raised by a certain class of people who own large quantities of land, and that the small farmers will not be in any way affected by the administration of the Land Act of 1933.</P>
    <P>I happened to make some extracts in regard to the land holdings in Ireland. Holdings under £15 valuation formed 67 per cent. of all the holdings in the country; holdings under £20 valuation form 75 per cent. of all the holdings in Ireland; holdings under £50 form 92 per cent., and if we go on to holdings under £100 we find that they form 97 per cent. of all the holdings in Ireland. That leaves 3 per cent. of all those holdings with a valuation of over £100. These smaller holdings under £100 will not be affected by the administration of this Act, so that 97 per cent. of the farmers have no reason in the world to be alarmed by any thoughts of confiscation. Many of the holdings over £100 in valuation are worked and are resident holdings and nobody can find fault with the methods upon which they are worked, so that there also confiscation is out of the question.  It is only fooling the small farmers to pretend that their land and homes are at stake in raising an alarm of this kind.  In Senator Miss Browne's county, there are some 41 holdings averaging 750 acres, in respect of which, perhaps, there is some cause for alarm, and, perhaps, that was one of the reasons why Senator Browne was afraid of this man, who is a small <Col N="365" /> farmer's man and a cottier's man.  I hope that that did not influence her.</P>
    <P>These 41 holdings, according to statistics, include about 30,000 acres. Surely those are lands that will need attention and, without any question of injustice, they will have to be dealt with if the country is to approach that measure of self-sufficiency which we all hope it will.  In County Waterford, it is pretty much the same and, strange to say, the average rateable value of what might be called the wheat lands nowadays, the tillage land, is something about 10/- whereas the average valuation of these 30,000 acres is something like 16/-.  It shows that the most valuable lands remain untilled and undivided.  We have the utmost confidence that if there was one man to speed up this division, he is the man selected by the present Government. I do not think there is much more to say on the matter.  In regard to Mr. Brown, I have heard many glowing accounts from people in a position to know his work in Tralee, a town with which I am very well acquainted, and the knowledge and experience he gained there of all classes of work in regard to land division is bound to stand him in good stead.  There is no doubt, but that he will not sleep at his work, and I do appeal to Miss Browne not to insist on the passing of this motion and the vote of censure, not alone on the Government, but on those men who, I firmly believe, will fill, with a due sense of responsibility and high efficiency, the positions to which they have been called.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most unpleasant motions that has been put down, and I think I ought to commence my remarks by protesting against the manner in which this motion was put down and was drafted.  Senator Milroy, who has now left the House, indicated that he would have liked this motion to have been put down in different terms, but if my memory serves me aright, there is little or no change in the terms of the motion as put down by Miss Browne and the terms of the motion which was handed in here last <Col N="366" /> week as an adjournment motion and which you, sir, very properly refused to accept as an adjournment motion.  My feeling about this motion is not because it embodies a vote of censure on the Executive Council.  That is something that the Executive Council will survive even from Senator Miss Browne.  I have a much more acute feeling, a feeling of disappointment, almost of disgust, because it does attempt to censure, in a motion, not the Executive Council nearly so much as the two men who have been selected by the Executive Council to fill these very important positions.  It has to be remembered that when men are appointed to a position by the Executive Council, when they assume a Civil Service position, when they assume a judicial or quasi-judicial position, they are not free to come into this House and defend themselves, and I think it is a gross breach of privilege for anyone in the Seanad with any sense of responsibility, not to speak of sense of decency, to name two people and to proceed in the way in which two Senators have done to-day, to abuse, to criticise and to attempt to throw odium on two men who have been so appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that there is no power in this House, moral or otherwise, to throw any odium on either of the two gentlemen appointed.  Both of them stand at the highest point in the opinions of the people of this country. Senator Miss Browne has referred to one of these gentlemen as a country lawyer.  It is not for me to express any defence of country lawyers, any more than it is for me to express any defence of country doctors or country professional men of any other type, but it does betoken something in the nature of a mean snobbery of the worst type that one does occasionally come across, and I submit that the decrying of a man because he is a country lawyer, particularly by a person who comes from the land, is, as I say, the meanest type of snobbery to me.  The other is an ex-national teacher.  Well, what of it?  Senator Miss Browne, may feel a superiority complex as a landed proprietress. Of that I do not know, but <Col N="367" /> I want to tell her that the people in this country who did work for this country included some ex-schoolmasters and some who were schoolmasters until they paid the penalty for their nationalism, and it comes very ill from Senator Miss Browne to talk in terms of contempt of an ex-national schoolmaster, Mr. Mansfield has an honourable career in Ireland, second to none, and even if he were not a national teacher, even if he were a man in dungarees sweeping the streets of Dublin, he might still have capacity for being a much better land commissioner than some of those we have known in the past.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to restrain oneself when one comes up against that type of snobbery which we thought had died with a lot of other things some years ago.  Another Senator, Senator Colonel Moore, referred to certain aspects of the Land Commission, and before I go into my main argument, I should like to correct an impression that might be created with regard to the Land Commission by some of the remarks here this afternoon.  Again, I say that it is mean and low-down and unjust and unfair to attack any body of civil servants in a House like this. That is no new line of thought with me.  I protested here some years ago when a very important attack was being launched by one Minister against one of his officials, and I think that any fair-minded person will agree that at least the person ought to have an opportunity to defend himself or herself in such a position.  Civil servants come into the same category as the two gentlemen who have been attacked, and I want to protest against any of my staff, at all events, being attacked in this House.  If civil servants fall down on their jobs, then the Minister is to blame, and I should like to take this opportunity to say that with regard to my higher officials in the Land Commission, those of them with whom I have to deal, that I have never yet met harder workers, or men who have put their backs into their work as those officials have done.  They have a most <Col N="368" /> difficult task.  No department in the State is subject to so much public criticism and all I can say, from my experience, is that all those men are giving of their best, and it is my job to see that they give of their best.  If I am going to get the co-operation that I need from them, and if the Government is going to get the co-operation it needs from them, they are certainly not going to be subject to attacks such as have been launched here this evening.  Senator Milroy comes into this House and criticises and abuses people whose boots he is not fit to wipe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At all events, I want to make it clear here, before I go into the main body of my argument on the motion, that civil servants are carrying out their work and no finger of scorn can be pointed at either of the two gentlemen appointed.  Who is Mr. Brown?  The House has heard here this afternoon who he is and who Mr. Mansfield is.  Both of them are, as I say, well known, and the facts that have been stated here this afternoon are all quite true.  I am very glad that we have succeeded in inducing these two gentlemen to take up the positions they did.  Mr. Brown was Secretary of the Department of Justice and it required considerable persuasion on my part to get him to give up the position he held.  Senator Cummins has gone into Mr. Mansfield's past.  He has pointed to his various activities and that saves any necessity for me to reiterate what he said.  Senator Milroy would have preferred the then Acting-Minister to have been here this afternoon, and he wants to know if I take responsibility for what the Acting-Minister says. I take full responsibility, and the Executive Council take full responsibility, for what the Acting-Minister says.  An attempt has been made to give the impression that the Acting-Minister, in coming before the Oireachtas on the various stages of the Land Bill, gave a promise that existing Land Commissioners would be appointed.  I have gone to the trouble of extracting the various references from the debates, and I think it will be admitted when these are quoted that no such implication can be put upon the Acting-Minister's statement.  On the contrary, the Acting-Minister clearly indicated his very definite stand on the question of the Executive Council having full responsibility for what they were doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the original draft of the Bill, as <Col N="370" /> introduced, it was proposed that &ldquo;any two officers of the Land Commission for the time being nominated by the Minister&rdquo; ...should with the judicial commissioner constitute the appeal tribunal.  That is in Section 7 of the Bill &ldquo;as introduced.&rdquo;  But on the Second Reading of the Bill the Acting-Minister indicated his intention when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the Committee Stage it is proposed to amend Section 7 so as to provide that the lay members of the appeal tribunal shall be Land Commissioners appointed by the Executive Council instead of by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That simply transferred the power of appointment from the Minister to the Executive Council.  This course was adopted by the amendment No. 14 on the Committee Stage in An Dáil by substituting the words &ldquo;two lay commissioners nominated for the purpose by the Executive Council.&rdquo; These quotations are from volume 48, No. 6, column 2382 and volume 49, No. 2, column 570, Dáil Debates.</P>
    <P>That amendment (No. 14) was the subject of a very protracted debate in An Dáil, and I think the Acting-Minister made the position quite clear when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When we appoint lay commissioners we will stand over them in the Dáil and in the country.  When we appoint two lay commissioners to be members of the appeal tribunal we will appoint efficient and competent men upon whose honesty the country and the Dáil can rely.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think Mr. Aiken's statement makes the issue very clear indeed.  Moreover, the Acting Minister made it perfectly clear when, following various suggestions, he definitely stated that &ldquo;we are not going to accept any of these restrictive clauses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This matter was again dealt with on the Report Stage when an amendment was moved by the Acting Minister <Col N="371" /> deleting the words &ldquo;an officer of the Land Commission&rdquo; and substituting the words &ldquo;a lay commissioner.&rdquo;  In dealing with the objection raised by Deputy Roddy, the Acting Minister clearly indicated his views and the views of the Government when he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I thought we had already thrashed out this amendment.  The Deputy may be sure that any person whom we appoint as a lay commissioner will be suitable for his job. This amendment would be restrictive. It presupposes that the Fianna Fáil Government is not as fit to make an appointment of an officer of the Land Commission as was the British or Cumann na nGaedheal Government, and that is an argument that I would not for one moment accept.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of the same debate the Acting Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government in appointing the lay members of the appeal tribunal will have regard...to the fitness of the man for the post. In no Land Act was it ever laid down that the men appointed to any post should be men of two years' standing.&rdquo;  (Vol. 49, No. 4, Cols. 1261 and 1262.)</P>
    <P>I think it is quite clear that the Acting Minister conveyed definitely that such restrictions as were sought to be imposed would not be accepted. Moreover, it is definitely made clear that such persons as were to be appointed were to be lay commissioners who would be nominated for the purpose of the appeal tribunal by the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the Seanad Debates. I quote from Vol. 17, No. 4, Col. 1093, where it will be found Mr. Aiken said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While the present judicial commissioner is a man who is well versed in land law, rather an expert in it, and must have by now a fair knowledge of the price of land, that might <Col N="372" /> not always be the case, and we have associated with him in our new appeal tribunal for deciding this question of price and other questions that are not strictly matters of law, two lay commissioners who will have a knowledge of the value of land and generally of the problems that are connected with the particular subject.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think that on the whole that is a better tribunal for the adjudication of appeals connected with land purchase than one single legal gentleman, no matter how great or how deep his knowledge of law may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was our point of view.  It was our point of view all through.  I am satisfied to stand here to-day and to say that in all Ireland we could not have got two better men for the positions than the two we have appointed.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan in the Seanad moved as an amendment to Section 7 (2) requiring that &ldquo;the first lay commissioners so appointed shall both have been officers of the Land Commission prior to the 1st day of June, 1933.&rdquo; The Acting Minister resisted this amendment pointing out that he had &ldquo;refused an amendment similar to it in An Dáil because he believed that this Executive Council is just as competent to appoint Land Commissioners as any other Executive Council in the past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan carried his amendment, but it was later rejected in An Dáil.  The Acting-Minister made it clear all through all phases of the debate that he would not submit to any of the restrictions that members of the Opposition sought to impose. In dealing with the Seanad amendments in An Dáil Mr. Aiken made it perfectly clear again that under no circumstances would he accept any restrictive clauses, and in spite of that we are told that an implied promise was contained in Mr. Aiken's speech while Acting-Minister.  I think that effectively scotches any suggestion that the Acting Minister of the time had any other <Col N="373" /> notion than that the Executive Council should have full authority to exercise the powers of selection for the positions.</P>
    <P>Now there were various matters quoted which I do not think were relevant to the subject.  My regret is that it has been possible in either House of the Oireachtas to bring forward a motion such as this is and to deal with it as it has been dealt with. I have already expressed myself pretty forcibly as to my reactions to such an attitude.  I suggest that it is lacking in justice and in ordinary decency not to speak at all of Christian charity or any other feeling of self-respect that those who move these motions ought to have.  I suggest that the country is more than gratified by the two appointments, and as Minister I am more than gratified and I am glad to be able to say that my principal officials in the Land Commission are quite content and satisfied that two better men could not have been appointed to the positions.</P>

      <P>The Minister has adopted the well-known and the well-tried course: when you have a bad case abuse your opponents.  He has stated that the country is satisfied with these two appointments, and that this vote of censure is not merited.  If he goes to the country to-morrow he will find that out, whether he will be censured or not.  As I stated in my opening speech, the country is in a state of great uneasiness, and great instability has been caused by the provisions of the Land Act.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, the fears of the people in the country have <Col N="374" /> not been allayed by the appointment of these two land commissioners.  We were told by Senator Comyn that Mr. Justice Wylie is a very eminent judge, that he is of high standing and great legal ability, that he has been judicial commissioner for many years and has given satisfaction to everybody. If so, why is he not capable of doing the work under this Government that he did under the other Government?</P>

      <P>We know that high officials who were too upright and honourable in carrying out the work of the Government were removed, but a judge cannot be removed, except by a vote of the two Houses.  The Minister knows well that he could not get that, and what does he do?  He appoints two chosen men to carry out the provisions of this Land Act.  Now, I think, I need say no more on that question.  Everyone knows very well the reason why they were appointed. I do not wish to cast any aspersion whatever upon the character of these two men except that they are unsuitable for their work.  Senator Cummins said that the Land Act was of an exceedingly far-reaching character.  I thoroughly agree with him.  He also said that no new principles were being embodied in it.  That is not so.  There are new and very dangerous principles embodied in it, such as were never in any other Land Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that a vote of censure on the Government is well merited, but on account of appeals that have been made to me by certain members of my own Party I do not wish to press this motion.  My object in bringing it forward was to show the country that their rights and their liberties cannot be frittered away without some voice being raised in this House in their defence.  I do not admit for one moment that this vote of censure is not merited.  I think it is well merited <Col N="375" /> by the Executive Council.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Seanad calls the attention of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to the remarks, as reported in the public Press, made by the Chairman of the Inland Fisheries Commission at its meeting on the 31st <Col N="376" /> ultimo and asks the Minister to take suitable notice of the matter.</P>
    <P>The motion I put before the House is somewhat different from the motion which we have just been discussing.  It is worded in quite a different manner but, in many ways, it is much more serious that the last motion.  I regret to have to move it.  I do not expect very much from it.  No doubt, the Minister will stand for the appointment which has been made and explain the situation to us.  The facts are as follows:</P>
    <P>A short time ago, a Commission was appointed by the Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  The terms of reference of that Commission were (1) to enquire into the salmon fisheries and fresh water fisheries of the Free State; (2) to investigate the modes of tenure and the laws relating to control and preservation; (3) to recommend such steps as may be necessary or desirable to promote their development and increase their national utility.  Commissions of this kind have, as a rule, in the past, been constituted in the majority of persons who&mdash;shall I say&mdash; have supported the general policy of the Government or, at any rate, have shown an interest in the policy of the Government in office.  In the constitution of this particular Commission, there is patently no departure from precedent.  To the credit of past Governments, it can be said that, as a rule, invitations to sit have been extended to persons who held views opposite to theirs.  I think that that was a wise provision, because some of those persons who held views which were contrary to the policy of the Government in power were convinced, after hearing the evidence brought before the Commission, and joined in the majority report.  We also had the benefit of minority reports which showed another point of view.  In this particular case, no such invitations were issued.  The Administration have seen fit&mdash;unfortunately, I say&mdash;to appoint to the chairmanship of a Commission of immense importance a gentleman who was intimately associated with one of the most important fishery actions of recent <Col N="377" /> times.  Had he remained silent and contented himself with hearing evidence and making his report in consultation with his colleagues, this fact might have escaped public notice. But, at the first public sitting of the Commission, the Chairman addressed those present and is reported to have said, inter alia&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Personally, he thought the fishery code was framed in the interest of the landlord class and, while the land had been wrested from them, the fisheries remained in their hands. The Commission before making up their minds as to nationalisation or modified State control or otherwise would consider this aspect of the question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further, he dealt with the question of the Erne decision which, though he had knowledge of it, had not come before the Commission in any form.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They had been informed by a responsible official of the Fishery Department that, as a result of this enquiry, it was hoped to get an order defining the mouth of the Abbey River, which runs into the Erne estuary and which never had its mouth defined before.  An order defining the mouth of a river automatically gave effect to a hoary old Victorian statute which would keep the public from fishing within half-a-mile of either side of, or seawards from, the defined mouth.</P>
    <P>Lastly, he is reported to have said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He hoped that after their interim report, native Irish fishermen would be fishing in waters hitherto protected by a private company under Government control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the three things I am taking exception to in the statement made by the Chairman of the Commission. These statements were made before a single word of evidence had been given by interested parties before this Commission. I submit that the chairman of a public commission of this nature <Col N="378" /> is very much in the same position as a judge.  Were any of our judges to preface the pleadings to be brought before them in a manner similar to that adopted by Mr. Commissioner Gallagher, the confidence which, I am proud to say, exists in regard to the probity and impartiality of our courts of justice would be irreparably shaken. There can be no doubt that the future proceedings of this Commission will, as a result of these utterances of the Chairman, be suspect in the minds of the general public and that the eventual findings will be widely questioned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the first extract of the Chairman's address, I submit that the statement that the land had been wrested from the landlord class, but that the fisheries remained in their hands, contains an inference as to the Chairman's attitude of mind which cannot be misinterpreted.  Secondly, as regards the defined mouths of the rivers, there is a certain inference by the Chairman&mdash;that there will be variations in the defined mouths of a great many rivers, with consequent dislocation&mdash;before any evidence by the public has been adduced.  Finally, he expresses the hope that after their interim report, native Irish fishermen will be fishing in the waters hitherto protected by a private company under Government control.  That, I submit, makes assurance doubly sure of what his idea will be regardless of the evidence.  If ever a case has been deliberately and openly prejudged, it is the evidence which will be given in the present instance.</P>
    <P>I put down this motion in order to allow of discussion and to draw attention to what may lead to a travesty of justice.  Incidentally, I cannot help referring to the calculated words &ldquo;native Irish fishermen.&rdquo;  I think that these are words definitely calculated to perpetuate the divisions and dissensions among the people of this country.  There are many national heroes of the past and the present whose names would have had more of a foreign twang than mine or that of Seán O Cátháin.  Yet, there would have been no question in a bailiff's <Col N="379" /> mind as to whether they had a right to fish or not.  Personally, I resent and condemn the constant references made on the public platforms to the nationality of the President of the Executive Council.  After all, he happens to be the first Minister of the State and I think that, in dealing with personalities of that kind, there must, at any rate, be a certain courtesy. This type of thing is really the product of the lowest petty politician and is only calculated to appeal to people of the lowest standard of education.  It is calculated to drive people apart rather than to bring them together.</P>
    <P>In this particular case, I have not consulted anybody, nor am I put up to speak by any Board of Fisheries or any organisation like that.  I have already given my evidence before that Commission and, in giving that evidence, I have slated both the net owners and the rod fishermen.  I have given evidence to show how, in my opinion, the fisheries can be improved.  I have no axe to grind in the matter. Although I am a net owner and a fisherman as well, I run both these concerns at what amounts always to a yearly loss, and I run them simply to keep in continuous employment certain men&mdash;all of them men whom Mr. Gallagher would describe as &ldquo;native Irish fishermen.&rdquo;  I continue them in employment so that they can maintain their families, which otherwise they would be barely able to do.  I ask the House to consider this motion.  It is not a motion I want to press in any way, but the House can do sufficient to have general notice taken of what I consider very undesirable views on the part of a chairman of a commission of this nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to second this motion.  The mover spoke with a certain element of coincidence when he associated the O Cátháins with native fishermen.  For the benefit of those who are not Irish speakers, I should explain that Keane is the anglicised form of O Cátháin.  When it was unpopular to be a Celt and popular to <Col N="380" /> be associated with the powers of the day, the anglicisation of the name took place.  That shows that even the best of us are inclined to make friends of the Mammon of Unrighteousness.  It is, perhaps, rather strange that the arms of those members of that old and honourable tribe entitled to the privilege represent three salmon, showing the antiquity of a native industry. Most of those who bear those arms have not a record of confiscation as regards fishing rights.  The confiscation was by our traditional enemies.  That only by way of historical allusion.</P>
      <P>I was reminded last night when I went to the theatre that a great deal of the play&mdash;&ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo;&mdash; is applicable to what is happening to-day.  Senators may remember where the jury come in and say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, sentence first and verdict afterwards.&rdquo; I suggest that that is the attitude of the Chairman of this Commission to the very important question which he is considering.  I hope that the Minister will not suggest that this motion is, in any way, a breach of privilege or an exhibition of bad taste on the part of this House.</P>

      <P>It may be a little out of order, but it is somewhat audacious for a member of this House to suggest that the Chair is out of order and acting improperly, because this motion could not be on the Order Paper without the authority of the Chair.  If the Senator does think it is out of order there is a procedure under which the authority of the Chairman can be challenged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never heard of a case, and I suppose it is unparalleled, where the head of a Commission of Inquiry delivered a partisan statement of such a character as this before he heard a word of evidence. It is his duty to regulate the procedure and at least to show impartiality in his duty as Chairman and there never could be, in one sense, a more biassed and, in another sense, a more irrelevant statement than that which was made; biassed in the sense of an attack on one class and irrelevant in that he proceeds to admit its irrelevancy by saying that the matter had nothing to do with the Commission.  I rather pity the Minister in his duty of having to stand over an appointment of that kind.  I was astounded that a man accustomed to law and to looking at things in a judicial capacity should commit such a glaring indiscretion as this person has certainly committed, and I make no apology whatever for saying this although it may be construed as a personal attack on a citizen of this State.  It is our duty in this House, when we have evidence of this kind, to speak out and have the matter fully and adequately ventilated.  With regard to what suitable action should be taken I do not see how the Minister, or how the public at least, ever could have confidence in a report of this kind, and if the Minister wishes this Commission, so constituted, to command confidence it should be reconstituted, at least by the removal from that body of a person who has acted in the most improper manner in which the Chairman, if reported correctly, has acted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not quite follow the mover of the resolution when he said that it was the practice in the past to rather weight a Commission according to the policy of the Government.  I have been on several Commissions and have never been conscious of any such weighting. I understood that the duty of a Commission was to inquire on the evidence into certain facts and to report on that evidence more as judges than as partisans.  I think it would be exceedingly <Col N="382" /> unfortunate for us ever to accept the attitude that the object of Commissions is merely to pack them with people who can be trusted to write a report that will suit the Government. This Chairman has certainly shown bias from the outset, and I say deliberately that he is not a fit person to occupy the position he now holds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it should be a matter for satisfaction for me to get all these coroner's inquests all on the one day.  With regard to this particular motion I have, in intervening, suggested that I did not think the motion was in order.  That is purely a personal point of view of course, and when the Chairman rules that it is in order, that is all there is to be said about it.  However, I would point out that this Commission is a Departmental Commission, that it has no authority from this House, and that this House is not officially cognisant of such a Commission. It is purely a Departmental Commission.  I would also point out that the Commission inevitably will submit a report which will be, probably, a majority report and, perhaps, several minority reports.  It is well to keep in mind what were the terms of reference of this Commission when it was set up.  They were (1) to inquire into the salmon fisheries and fresh water fisheries of the Free State; (2) to investigate the modes of tenure and laws relating to control and preservation; (3) to recommend such steps as may be necessary or desirable to promote their development and increase their national utility.  In the selection of the people for that Commission, whilst I am not at the moment the Minister responsible for the Fisheries Department, as it has been transferred to Agriculture, I did nominate to the Executive Council the personnel of that Commission and asked the Executive Council to endorse the nominations that I made.  We very definitely wanted to get a Commission that would be representative of all the different elements connected with fishing. The Chairman suggested was Mr. Francis Gallagher, whose handling of the long-drawn out Erne case showed <Col N="383" /> him to be a man of judgment and whose ability in the handling of that case earned him the commendation of the Chief Justice.  Senator Sir John Keane may not approve of that choice: undoubtedly, he will not approve of it because, perhaps, there is some justification in the remarks which the Chairman made.  The second member of the Commission is Senator Michael Duffy, representing, I think, the Labour interests, and also representing this House.  Mr. J.P. Digby is an amateur angler and has had much experience of amateur angling.  Mr. Forde is manager of the Lax Weir Company and is, I believe, interested in one of the big fishing concerns in this country.  Mr. Moriarty is the representative of the Department on the Commission.  Mr. Thomas J. O'Reilly is well acquainted with the Kerry fisheries.  Mr. H.G. Ryder is Secretary of the Trout Anglers' Association and Mr. Barry Sullivan is solicitor to the Lismore Conservators, which is one of the most highly-rated fisheries in the country.  To suggest, as the proposer has suggested, that that is a Board deliberately picked in order that it should have a certain bias is something that cannot be borne out by the names of these gentlemen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that. When a Commission is appointed it has to be remembered that they are appointed because of their knowledge of their subject and their independence of view.  These men are not subject to Civil Service discipline.  We cannot induce these people to take a certain line and we have no right to interfere with them with regard to whether they express an opinion or not.  Any member of the Commission can express <Col N="384" /> whatever opinion he feels like expressing. Representatives of the Department have to exercise a certain reticence but that does not apply to the members of the Commission, whether the Chairman or otherwise.  It is quite obvious that what the motion means is that the Chairman should be removed from the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there is no intention to do anything of the sort.  I take full responsibility for the nomination of Mr. Gallagher and, while I have not the authority to keep him there, I shall certainly use my influence with the Minister to see that he is kept there.  What the Chairman said, and it has to be remembered that he was speaking with regard to the question of an inquiry that had to take place over the Erne decision, was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Personally, I thought that a great part of the fishery code, while aimed undoubtedly at the protection of fisheries, was framed mostly in the interests of the landlord class, who were all-powerful during the Victorian period, when a large part of the legislation was enacted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it will be admitted that that is no more and no less than the facts. No one, I am sure, will attempt to deny that the legislation of the period was more in the interests of the landlord class than in the interests of the ordinary people of the country.  It has also to be remembered that very drastic legislation has taken place over all these years in connection with the land and that there has been no simultaneous adjustment of the law in connection with fisheries.  It is to correct that that we set up this Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point to which, I presume, exception has been taken is, perhaps, the statement referring to the Inquiry that has been ordered to take place in <Col N="385" /> connection with the Erne Fisheries. As everybody is aware, the several fisheries and the tidal waters in this case are matters that required very careful consideration and since the decision in the Erne case attracted considerable attention in legal and other circles the Minister felt that if possible the services of Mr. Gallagher should be secured, and it is for that reason he is there.  I do not know what the purpose of Senator.  The McGillycuddy of the Reeks is except as I say, that he does not approve of this particular gentleman acting as chairman.  I do not suppose it would be possible to get a particular chairman who would be acceptable to everybody in the country and I certainly think that in a matter like this we are more concerned with the national utility point of view, as embodied in the Terms of Reference, than with any other point of view.  That is the reason we have set up this Commission and it is why the personnel has been what it is.  The various interests I have mentioned have been represented on it.  The Commission was selected with considerable care to ensure that all the different interests would be represented on it.  So far as any line of action in regard to the Chairman's speech is concerned, I personally feel no grievance against him for making the statement he did, nor have I any sympathy with the suggestion, which Senator Sir John Keane has made, that he should be removed from his office.  In so far as my influence can go with the Minister who is acting there will be no such action, and I am satisfied, after having discussed it with the Minister for Agriculture, who is at present at the head of the Fisheries that no such action will be contemplated.</P>

      <P>May I be allowed to state now that the question of whether this motion is or is not out of order has been considered very carefully by me.  Perhaps, I never gave such consideration to such a matter before.  Having considered it carefully, I came to the conclusion, without any hesitation, that, as this <Col N="386" /> Commission was appointed by the Minister, the Minister has absolute powers over it and that, consequently, the Minister is liable to be interrogated by us as to the action of the Commission.</P>

      <P>The Minister has asked me my reason for moving this motion.  It is very obvious. We want for a public Commission of this kind, whether Departmental or not, a completely impartial man who does not prejudge a case and who keeps his mouth shut until he hears the evidence.  Senator Sir John Keane suggested that the Chairman should be removed from the position.  I never suggested that at all.  The motion is mine, not Senator Sir John Keane's, and he and I differ on some things. I believe it would be better to leave the Chairman there, as otherwise the mess would be a colossal one.  I am simply questioning the facts.  There is probably a great deal of justification for what the Chairman said, regarding the laws that were made, and the alterations that are necessary, but it will take some time until he has heard evidence from the whole country.  My last point is that in a public speech the Chairman stated that the Interim Report had gone in.  On the following day we saw by the <i>Irish Press</i> that action was about to be taken to tighten up the bye-laws and the fishery laws during the coming season.  I take it that I was justified in bringing this matter to the notice of the public.  I trust the Minister will not consider for one moment the question of removing Mr. Gallagher from his present position.</P>
