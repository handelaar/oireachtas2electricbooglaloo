      <P>I rise simply to repeat what I said yesterday, that it was my misfortune to be absent from the meeting of the Seanad last Thursday night, when the Minister explained the Bill now before us.  Yesterday I intended to ask the Minister, if at all possible, to postpone the consideration of this Bill.  It is a measure of very great importance and it comes to us at the fag-end of the session, when there is scarcely time to consider the details in any shape or form.  I have had the good fortune to be able to read in the Official Report what the Minister said last Thursday night. One sentence of his remarks seems to me to support my view that it would be of great advantage to the Bill and to the House if the consideration of this important subject were postponed, at any rate, until the autumn.  The words used by the Minister towards the end of his speech were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not yet possible to give any definite indication as to what the policy is likely to be, because we are awaiting the reports of experts and others who are examining this matter for the purpose of giving us their opinion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That appears to me to support my view&mdash;that time is required to consider this matter and to consider the reports to which the Minister looks forward. There is no use in my wasting the time of the Seanad by entering into the details so far as I have been able to make them out.  Senators know <Col N="450" /> that I have almost a prejudiced view against the Shannon, and in favour of the Liffey.  I do not think that it would be advisable at this stage to occupy the time of the House in discussing details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it would not be possible for me to agree to the postponement of consideration of this Bill.  It is a necessary measure.  The additional storage for which the Bill makes provision will be required within the time during which the works to be undertaken can be constructed. The remarks of mine which the Senator quoted, and the reports to which he has referred, related to the development of production of electricity in the Saorstát after the full utilisation of the Shannon had been achieved.  This Bill is, of course, only a step in that direction.  The original experts' report on the development of the Shannon contemplated the creation of storage so as to yield 827,000,000 cubic metres of water per year.  The existing storage provides for only 210,000,000 cubic metres, and this Bill makes provision for 260,000,000 cubic metres, giving a total of 470,000,000 cubic metres which, as Senators know, is well within the original experts' estimate of 827,000,000 cubic metres. The construction of these works marks a necessary and inevitable step in the development of the Shannon&mdash;a step which was contemplated when the harnessing of the Shannon was originally undertaken.  The remarks of mine which the Senator quoted referred to the further development after this additional storage had been provided.  Before any legislative proposals affecting such additional development are enacted all the information upon which the Government's decision is based should be, and will be, given to members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Griffith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is fair to ask the Minister whether the works contemplated for the storage of water are the identical works recommended by the experts on the Siemens Schuckert report.  If I remember rightly, it was proposed in <Col N="451" /> that report to save land from flooding. Under the present Bill, I gather from what the Minister has said that it is proposed to flood some 6,000 acres, and to compensate for the loss of that land.  The original scheme by Siemens Schuckert, supported by the experts employed by the Government, appeared to me to indicate that they intended to keep the reclamation of that land safe by the construction of a very expensive system of pumping.  I cannot find that any item in respect of pumping has been included in the Estimate under this Bill.  It occurs to me that the Minister has made up his mind to purchase the land in preference to attempting to maintain it as suggested.  These are some of the points that struck me, but I should have liked to have time to look into the whole subject and to have seen the reports of these gentlemen to whom the whole system, if I understand rightly, has been referred &mdash;the question of the Shannon extension, the question of the Liffey, and the question of steam.</P>

      <P>So far as the storage works contemplated are concerned, I should say that the experts engaged by the board reported upon three alternative methods of securing additional storage from the Shannon, each method giving a different result in storage and costing, it was estimated, a different sum.  The decision as to which of the three methods should be adopted was made by me in consultation with the board.  The experts merely indicated the quantity of water that could be procured by each method and the works which would be necessary to procure that quantity of water, with the estimated cost of these works.  It was fairly obvious from the alternatives submitted that one of them had outstanding merits, inasmuch as the volume of water, in relation to the cost, was considerably greater than in the other cases.  The decision to undertake that particular method of creating additional storage in the Shannon was made by me in consultation with the board and the experts of the Board.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell us whether the method now adopted was the method recommended by the experts, or whether that decision was taken on the ground that the method was the least expensive? This is the first we have heard of alternative methods.  The Minister accepted one which, in his wisdom, he considered to be best.  We have had no reason given as to why this particular system was adopted.</P>

      <P>Sections 1 to 15 put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
      <P>(3) Every grant made by the Minister for Finance under this section shall be applied by the board for such of the following purposes as is specified in the relevant certificate of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that is to say, the execution of the scheduled works or the doing of any other thing which the board is authorised by this part of this Act to do or the payment of interest on moneys advanced to the board from the Central Fund under this Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 16, sub-section (3).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;do&rdquo; in line 60 down to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that these grants made by the Minister for Finance are grants to supplement the ordinary moneys that are advanced to the Electricity Supply Board in this way, that it is agreed that these works are not fully economic and, partly on account of the employment involved, the Minister for <Col N="453" /> Finance has to advance the difference between the actual and the economic value of the work.  That being so, it would appear only right and proper that these moneys should be spent solely on the work itself and not applied to the payment of interest. There may be some purely book-keeping reason why these words are in, but in the absence of any explanation, I think these words should go out and that those grants made by the Minister for Finance should be spent solely on works and not on the payment of interest charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained to the Seanad that it is very probable, having regard to the reduction in the rate of interest charged upon advances to the board, that no grant will be made at all, inasmuch as the actual cost and the economic value will coincide.  On that point, I am quite prepared to accept this amendment.  It is most unlikely, even if a grant does arise to be made, that any portion of it will be used for this purpose.  The reason the words were inserted was because the total cost towards which these grants were to be made included, of course, interest upon the advances until the works proved remunerative to the board.  Consequently, in drafting the Bill, provision was made for all charges that would arise to be made out of moneys provided. As it is most unlikely, under any circumstances, that any of the grant will be used for this purpose and, as it is now becoming extremely improbable that any grant will be made at all, I have no objection to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask whether any profits are being made out of the Shannon scheme?  Some years ago, when this scheme was started, we were told that after a certain number of years it would be economic and, in fact, it would mean an addition to the income of the State. I was a strong supporter of the scheme when it was introduced.  The starting of it involved an expenditure of £5,500,000.  It has up to this cost nearly £10,500,000.  I do not know <Col N="454" /> how we are going to get on if we continue pouring out money like that. None of the promises made at the beginning, even after we doubled the original expenditure, is being carried out.  I think it is a very objectionable thing partly to dry up some of our finest lakes.  Everything seems to be sacrificed to the development of this scheme, which one of our Ministers has described as a white elephant.  I should like to have some explanation as to its present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite correct that it was ever stated that if the Electricity Supply Board realised a profit it would accrue to the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the Act of 1927 is so framed as to debar the board from making profits.  The board is required to fix charges to produce revenue to meet working expenditure and provide certain reserves.  It is clearly indicated in that Act that profit out of the working of the scheme for the benefit of the State was not contemplated.  The profit and loss account for the year ended 31st March, 1933, showed a small surplus of £5,800.  The accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1934, have not yet been published.  The accounts are in process of audit and will probably be available in the course of a short period.  What those accounts are likely to reveal, I am afraid I cannot indicate at this stage.</P>

      <P>(1)  Whenever the Minister is satisfied, on the application of the board, that the erection of buildings or of a particular class or particular classes of buildings under or within a particular distance of any particular transmission wires involves risk of injury to the public or to such buildings or the occupiers thereof and that the removal of such transmission wires to another site would involve unreasonable expense or substantial technical difficulty, the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, by order (in this Act referred to as a building prohibition order) prohibit the erection of any building whatsoever or any building of a specified class or specified classes under or within a specified distance of the said transmission wires.</P>

      <P>Section 19, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in line 41 to insert the words &ldquo;after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection in principle to the amendment.  The only doubt as to the wisdom of accepting it is the possibility of loss of time which may be involved.  In the ordinary circumstances consultation with the Minister for Local Government would undoubtedly take place, but it is quite possible that there may be obvious cases such as repetition cases, cases where a decision having been given on a typical case, it would be held to govern all similar cases. The amendment in the form proposed would require automatic consultation and consequently be the occasion of delay.  If the Senator will be satisfied with my assurance that such consultation would take place whenever anything would arise that would be of interest to the Minister for Local Government and withdraw his amendment, I would much prefer it, but if he presses the amendment I am quite prepared to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Industry and Commerce view of what is in the interest of local government may differ from that of the Minister.  I feel it is an important issue and it would be far better to have something of this kind inserted in the Bill.  Of course I accept at once the assurance that, in the normal course, consultation with the Minister for Local Government will take place before an order is issued.  I think it is desirable, nevertheless, that before the Minister makes up his mind to issue such an order, which he does on the application of the board, the views of the Minister for Local Government should be asked for.  I do not think there will be any delay, because an order would not be issued without inquiry, and while the Minister for Industry and Commerce is making his own inquiry he could automatically ask the Minister for Local Government to express his views.  I think it is a desirable amendment and I would like the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there would be great delay and there certainly would be duplication of work and consequent expense.  Moreover, this is a section <Col N="457" /> prohibiting building under transmission wires.  What interest has the Minister for Local Government in transmission wires running over the open country? He has only a very indirect interest in transmission wires that go into towns and villages.  There would be duplication of responsibility, duplication of trouble, and duplication of official expenses, and seeing that you have swallowed the camel in this section, it seems to me that you are straining at a gnat.  You are taking power to prohibit building under transmission wires without compensation to the person who owns the land.  A man may have given a licence to put up wires and pylons, when he thought that an agreement made by him would not involve the serious position which now arises, which prohibits him from the free use of the land.  Seeing that you do that in this section it might be let go as it is drafted.  As far as I know anything about official matters, duplication of responsibility means the doubling of delay and the doubling of expense, and less of that efficiency which arises from the direct control of one man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Senator Comyn's remarks, that there is no object in tying the Minister up in this way.  The section is a trivial one, as people are not going to build under wires.  Where some foolish person may attempt to do so the matter may be left to the Minister to decide, without going to another Department for sanction. The amendment is quite unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>From Senator Comyn's argument one might say that the Minister should not consult the Minister for Local Government, notwithstanding the fact that we have been assured by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that normally he would do so, except in repetition cases, so that that disposes of the suggestion that delay would ensue from the insertion of this amendment.  What I feel about it is that it is a question of public interest as distinct from the interest of the owner of the land.  There is a question of the development of building operations <Col N="458" /> where the authority is the Minister for Local Government.  In this case the Minister for Industry and Commerce is assuming authority to act on the application of the Electricity Supply Board.  To my mind that is a reversal of the proper order of things, as when we are dealing with matters affecting local development, building operations, housing or other things, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not the authority which should be empowered to issue these prohibitions against building.  The proper authority would be the Minister for Local Government, but, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is so closely associated with the Electricity Supply Board, it might be advisable for that Minister to have this power, provided he exercises it after consultation with the Minister for Local Government, who is looking after the interests of local authorities in respect of local developments.  This matter is important and I should like the House to agree with the amendment.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is to effect a verbal change in the wording of the Section, the purpose of which is to permit the Electricity Supply Board to pay certain sums due under the Act of 1933 to officers of a local authority who were absent from duty due to internment and other political causes during the period 1919-1923.  I explained previously that the Dublin Corporation declined to make payments due to its officers who had been transferred to the Electricity Supply Board, on the ground that the assets and liabilities and everything attached to the electricity undertaking had been transferred to the Electricity Supply Board.  They contended that payments should properly be made by the Electricity Supply Board.  That view was accepted, and a section was included in the Bill to enable the Electricity Supply Board to make these payments.  As the section was drafted it referred only to officers transferred to the service of the Board, but it appears there is one case where an officer entitled to payment was not transferred, through illness, and who would be entitled to payment but for the fact that the assets were transferred to the Electricity Supply Board.  The purpose of the amendment is to cover such cases, so that injustice will not be done.</P>

The revenue from the sales energy was £1,150,000, as compared with £1,044,000 during the previous year.  The number of consumers was 86,554, as compared with 81,675 during the previous year.

      <P>Arising out of those figures, I should like to know from the Minister if he considers them satisfactory.  On the other hand, I might point out in regard to consumers that in 12 months they increased by about 4,000, from 81,000 to 86,000.  That does not seem to be a very large increase but, on the other hand, it is fairly reasonable and the Minister is satisfied.  I must say that an increase of only 4,000 consumers from the year before does seem very small.  It looks to me as though they are getting to the end of their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the number of consumers was 5,000, which compares with 3,300 as between 1932 and 1933.  The number was 86,544, as <Col N="461" /> compared with 81,000.  It is nearer to 87,000 than 86,000.  It represents an increase of very nearly 5,000 consumers, which is a greater increase than took place as between 1933 and 1932.  The most satisfactory aspect of these figures, however, is the very substantial increase which has taken place in the industrial motive power load, which has doubled since 1931.</P>
      <P>I have just got a correction which shows that the number of consumers was 89,890 and not 86,500, which makes it much more satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Section 4.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not clear from the wording of the schedule of the Civil Service (Regulation) Act, 1924, that persons who would be employed in connection with this undertaking would be excluded from the provisions of that Act.  It is obviously desirable that they should be excluded; in other words, that the ordinary procedure for appointing and dismissing such persons as if they were civil servants <Col N="462" /> should not operate.  It would, I think, be impossible to work a commercial undertaking on that basis.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 18 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>18.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall cause to be kept, in respect of every business carried on by him under this Act, all proper and usual accounts (in such form as shall be approved of by the Minister for Finance) of all moneys received or expended by him, including a capital account, revenue account, profit and loss account and a balance sheet.</P>
      <P>(2)  The accounts of the Minister in respect of every business carried on by him under this Act shall, at the end of every accounting year for such business, be transmitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who shall audit, certify and report upon such accounts.</P>
      <P>(3)  Upon the completion of an audit under this section of the accounts of any business carried on by the Minister under this Act, the Minister shall cause a copy of the balance sheet and profit and loss account as passed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and a copy of his report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading I referred to this matter.  The only information in the form of figures that the House will get, as the Bill now stands, is that set out in Section 18, which authorises the Minister to receive from the Minister for Finance certain moneys as provided by the Oireachtas and then causes the Minister to pay into the Exchequer any moneys received under the Bill.  If there is no profit or no available cash, the public and <Col N="463" /> the Parliament will know nothing whatever about the trading operations of this experiment.  That does not seem right or proper.  Under the Slaughter of Animals Bill the Minister takes power to engage in trading operations in connection with canning, dealing with old cows, etc., and he undertakes to give full accounts to the Oireachtas in due course&mdash;a profit and loss account, balance sheet, etc.  I think it is only reasonable that the Minister should be asked to do this in the case of industrial alcohol.  I am not tied to the exact wording of the amendment, which is taken actually verbatim, with one or two small alterations for the purpose of adaptation, from the Slaughter of Animals Bill.  It is the principle I am concerned about, and if the Minister accepts the principle the amendment can be put in suitable form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite correct to say that all the information which members of the Oireachtas will obtain as to the activities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under this Bill will arise under Section 18 in relation to money actually paid into or received from the Exchequer.  The report contemplated under Section 17 will, I think, give fairly complete information upon financial as well as other matters, in so far as one of the main activities of the Minister under the Bill is to receive and pay out money, and he has got to report on all his proceedings under the Bill.  If, however, the Senator considers it desirable that there should be inserted a section requiring the Minister to keep all proper and usual accounts, I am quite prepared to produce on the Report Stage an amendment to that effect.  These accounts, like all accounts relating to public money, will, of course, in the ordinary way be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and would be reported on by him if, in his opinion, a report were called for.  I do not know, however, that it is desirable in relation to this particular measure that we should ask the Comptroller and Auditor-General to submit a special report or that these <Col N="464" /> particular accounts enumerated should be published.</P>
      <P>The proceedings under this Bill are somewhat different from those under the Slaughter of Animals Bill.  In that case the accounts relate to an undertaking which is a commercial undertaking, initiated as such, intended to be run as such, and intended to produce a commercial profit at the end of the year.  In this case we are undertaking something which is admittedly an experiment.  The capital of the undertaking is being provided by Vote from the Dáil and is regarded as a Vote for experimentation.  It is possible that it may prove to be remunerative expenditure as well, but even if that possibility were not there, it is quite possible in theory that the expenditure would, nevertheless, be undertaken for the purpose of getting the information which it is hoped that the experiment will provide.</P>
      <P>I think, therefore, that it would be in a sense unfair, certainly during the initial stages, to regard this enterprise in the same light as the commercial enterprise with which the Minister for Agriculture is associated under the other Bill.  I am quite prepared to move an amendment providing that all proper and usual accounts should be kept, as I prefer that to the particular phrase that we should enumerate the particular accounts, because there may be reasons why different accounts should be kept.  I do not claim to be speaking with authority on the matter. These accounts would, of course, under the Exchequer and Audit Acts be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and any matter that required to be brought to the attention of the Oireachtas in the opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor-General would appear in his annual report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will do something of the kind, because I think the principle is right, even though he may make a good case that it is not absolutely essential in this case.  I also hope that the practice will be adopted in this case of showing a profit and loss account for the year. That does not mean that in considering it you should judge it simply as a commercial <Col N="465" /> concern, but it does mean that it is easier for the ordinary person to judge its value and success.  For instance, if you take post office accounts which, some time ago, I spent a considerable time examining in connection with the Postal Commission, it is extremely difficult to judge them and to estimate them from the business point of view.  Even if this experiment showed considerable loss, that does not mean it would not be justified.  It would be better to have the figures showing income and expenditure, and I hope the principle will be adopted of a profit and loss account such as is presented in the ordinary course of business.  This will be more readily understood in connection with a concern of this kind.  I think the Minister would find it easier himself to judge the position with such an account available.</P>

      <P>When discussing the Slaughter of Animals Bill I thought that Section 35 was a very desirable one and fitted in with the plea put forward by me, and others in the past, in connection with semi-governmental or governmental concerns.  I thought that was adopted in the Slaughter of Animals Bill as part of a definite policy.  But I am sorry to find now from the statement made by the Minister that I was mistaken.  I cannot see any difference between the industrial activities under the Industrial Alcohol Bill from those undertaken by the Minister under the Slaughter of Animals Bill.  In one case it is an experiment which is not expected to be profitable, taken alone, and in the other it is clearly <Col N="466" /> an experiment not expected to be profitable at all in the ordinary business sense.  Both are to be financed by moneys provided by the Oireachtas. I am not saying anything about the form or the number of the accounts that ought to be submitted.  But as all moneys for agricultural problems have to be discussed with the financial authorities, and as there are numbers of these forms under the Cattle and Sheep Bill, it appears to me it would be convenient for that procedure to be adopted in connection with the Industrial Alcohol Bill.  The Minister can take it, and it would be a mistake to assume otherwise, that none of these experiments is likely to be profitable taken by itself; and the public will have that present to their minds, so that whatever is justifiable under the Slaughter of Animals Bill seems to me to be justifiable under the Industrial Alcohol Bill.  I think it is not enough to say, what the Minister has said, that if there is anything that the Comptroller and Auditor-General wished to call attention to he will call upon it.  I think it is desirable that the auditor's statement should be formally signed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General whether there is anything to call special attention to or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.L. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to call the Minister's attention to sub-section (3) of Section 2 which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Each of the following persons shall for the purposes of this Act be qualified persons; that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person born in Saorstát Eireann or the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann;</P>
      <P>(b)  a person who at the relevant time is and for not less than five consecutive years immediately preceding the 2nd July, 1934, has been ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means that certain persons, certainly well known to the existing law to be nationals, would lose certain rights as nationals.  That is to say, under certain circumstances, although <Col N="468" /> nationals, they would never be qualified persons and would be denationalised and would have rights denied to them.  I think any question touching upon nationality in any shape or form is rather important at the moment. There are persons who, for one reason or another, frequently refer to other persons' nationality.  Twice, quite recently, in this House, Senator Miss Browne referred to the nationality of two members of the House, one of whom was myself.  She said I was an Englishman.  I quite understand she meant that statement as a compliment, but still, like most compliments, it was more imaginary than real, and had no relation whatever to the truth.  I was born in this country, and so was my father and grandfather, and all the other paternal ancestors that I have been able to trace.  But that is only a detail.  Take the case of people who, for one reason or another, live abroad &mdash;people who have gone, perhaps, into the service of the State in a diplomatic position, or some other such position. I understand&mdash;though I do not profess to know&mdash;that diplomatic usage is that if your child was born in a legation or embassy, that legation or embassy is regarded as part of the country you represent.  It is conceivable, however, that a child of a diplomatic representative, or of somebody else representing a country in some special way, might not be actually born on the legation or embassy premises.  In that case the child would be a national of Irish parents, but, according to this, that person would have no right to be regarded as a qualified person under this Act, because he was not a person born in Saorstát Eireann, or who had not been ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann, for not less than five years immediately preceding the second day of July, 1934.  Therefore, it seems to me to be quite obvious that the person to whom I have referred, under those circumstances, would be denied some of the rights of a national.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to raise, in somewhat different form, a similar question to that raised by Senator David Robinson.  I did not put down <Col N="469" /> an amendment in this particular respect because, apparently, that form of amendment has been regarded as a hobby of mine, and I saw no reason why people born in the Six Counties should not be within the amendments I put down before.  However, I wanted to get from the Minister some kind of assurance that, when the Bill that is promised for dealing with nationality comes in, it would be in some way or another related to this Bill, because I think there is a great danger that you will have a form of nationality defined, and a method by which nationality may be acquired under such a Bill, which, nevertheless, might not come under this Act.  I am not speaking for myself here, but I should like to have some assurance from the Minister that that point would be very carefully considered.  I should like to make a further plea also for the position of persons born across the Border.</P>
      <P>Senator David Robinson has told us &mdash;and I presume that, if it is in order in his case, it is in order in mine&mdash;that he was an Irishman and for at least some generations back his ancestors were Irish.  In my case, I have had my family tree pretty carefully prepared and it goes back nine generations; but as far as this Bill is concerned it is only one generation because, although I was born in Saorstát Eireann, all the other generations were born in the Six Counties.  Notwithstanding that, I am not the less prepared to say that I am an Irishman.  My wife is in a similar case.  She can go back six or seven generations.  She was born in the Six Counties but has lived long enough here to come within this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to put to the Minister is that the change here is too confusing. I could understand the reasons for providing a particular date and changing the position with regard to the old Bill, which meant a five years' residence commencing at any time to enable a person to qualify.  In the case of a person coming from another country, I approve of the change; but this is making it more difficult still in the case of a person born inside the Six Counties to become a national here. I am strongly of opinion that a person <Col N="470" /> born inside the Six Counties, who wishes to put money into an industry here, should not be put into the position of having to get a licence because he did not do it within a particular date.</P>
    <P>As things are under this Bill, they can never qualify if they were born inside the Six Counties, and that is making the position of residents in the Six Counties impossible.  I do not believe that it is good policy to do that.  Admittedly, the numbers may be small, but there are people&mdash;and if the Minister likes I could mention names &mdash;who, quite recently, and certainly since the establishment of the Free State, if not since the establishment of this Government, left the Six Counties and established businesses here.  They wanted to get the trade of the whole of Ireland, and they had to choose between the Six-County area and this area.  They chose this area.  I think that the people to whom I have referred are all right, because they came in soon enough; but others may come in and I think that the Minister should consider whether or not there is any way in which this would apply to persons born inside the Six Counties, or, better still, that he should provide for a person becoming a national of the Free State who is born inside the Six Counties, and then that he would promise that that will apply to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense Senator Douglas answered Senator Robinson, when he pointed out that there is no Nationality Act in operation here. Leave to introduce such a Bill has been granted already in the Dáil and it is probable that it will be taken in the Dáil during the next session.  When that Bill becomes law, it will alter the position in relation to this Bill considerably, because, presumably, it will provide machinery by which persons can become nationals of Saorstát Eireann and therefore become entitled to the rights enjoyed by nationals of Saorstát Eireann, in which case all existing legislation will have to be examined with a view to ensuring that <Col N="471" /> there will be no conflict between the terms of the existing Acts and the terms of the Nationality Act when it is passed.  That is a matter which, I think, we can leave over until the Nationality Act is passed.</P>
      <P>It is not very easy to say in what form that Act will reach the Statute Book.  The intention here is merely to define the type of persons who will be entitled to carry on manufacturing enterprises without interference or without a licence.  In so far as that is the intention, I should prefer that the Bill should be allowed to stand as it is.  If and when a Nationality Bill is enacted, however, then I think we would have to reconsider this and other Bills in respect of which definitions of nationality have been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to the fact that that would not automatically apply, because this would be a qualified person, and therefore a national would not necessarily be a qualified person, and unless the Bill, to which the Minister has referred as being likely to be introduced, would deal with these persons, they would not be qualified.  Would it be possible that this definition would apply until a Bill is passed defining what is a national?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on what the Nationality Act would provide. If it should happen that the Nationality Act provided the machinery by which a person not born in the country, or not qualified because of ancestry to be regarded as a citizen, could obtain our nationality without, say, a residence qualification, then we would have to definitely consider whether we should not still preserve provisions in this Bill to debar that person, although legally a national, until he had a certain residence qualification.  It is possible that any Nationality Act may contain residence conditions, in which case we might then take the definition of nationality therein contained and use it for the <Col N="472" /> purposes of this Act.  If, however, a man could become a national without having that period of residence, we would have to consider it.  I do not say that we could not accept that definition of nationality, but we would have to consider it in relation to its effect upon the scheme of these Acts.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 6.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Every regulation made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat annulling such regulation, such regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such regulation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there is any need to labour arguments in favour of this amendment.  Senator Johnson, in discussing a certain amendment, said that anything that was desirable with regard to the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill was desirable in the case of the Industrial Alcohol Bill.  This amendment <Col N="473" /> simply proposes to insert in this Bill sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill. Section 6 of this Bill provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order make regulations in relation to any matter or thing referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.</P>
    <P>There is a similar section in the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill, and it is followed by a sub-section identical with the new section that I am now moving to have inserted in this Bill.  Senators will remember that the Minister for Agriculture when resisting an amendment that was moved yesterday to the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill&mdash;an amendment that proposed to limit the duration of that Bill&mdash;stressed very strongly the idea that provision was being made in the Bill obliging the Government to lay all orders made under it on the Table, so that the members of the Oireachtas would have the opportunity of raising any matters that they desired to.  On the Second Reading of this Bill, I referred to sub-section (6) of Section 16 of it under which the Minister is taking power to make orders subject to getting the approval of the Dáil only. The Minister, in reply, said that all that was necessary constitutionally for this purpose was that the Minister should have the confidence of the Dáil, but as regards the section I am dealing with now, it is not even necessary for the Minister to have that confidence.  He is left with an absolute discretion to make orders at his own sweet will without getting the sanction of either House of the Oireachtas.  I do not think that the Minister is likely to resist this amendment. The absence of this provision from the Bill must really have been due to an oversight, and I am sure that its insertion will be agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator is slightly confused by the fact that this is a Bill to amend an Act.  It does not repeal that Act but merely amends it.  The original Act provides that regulations made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under any of the sections of it must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. <Col N="474" /> Senators will remember that that was a matter the Dáil and Seanad had a little dispute about, and that the Seanad got its way in the end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in this particular respect.  If the Senator will wait for a minute he will see that it is not at all necessary in this case to have this particular provision inserted in the Bill.  I take it that it is only required to table Orders of the kind where any matter of importance might arise and where a difference of opinion, as to the wisdom of an Order made, might exist.  If the Senator looks through the Bill he will find that there are only three things to be prescribed in this Bill, and in each case they are simply forms. They are not of importance.  There is first, the form of application for a licence; secondly, the form of the licence itself, and, thirdly, the form of certificate under Section 16.  These are the only things for which power to prescribe is taken in the Bill. Therefore, I think it is unnecessary to have the trouble and expense of making a statutory order and of tabling it merely to regulate forms. There is nothing of substance to be prescribed under this Bill.  The matters to be prescribed are of such minor importance that it is hardly necessary to have this provision in relation to them, having regard to the fact that all the regulations that are of importance are made under sections of the principal Act and must be tabled.</P>

      <P>I only saw this amendment this morning and, having read it carefully, I came to the same conclusion as the Minister.  If it were not for the provision that is made in Section 16, under Part III of the Bill, I would support the amendment of Senator Milroy.  If the amendment were to be insisted on it would create an absurd position in this way: that while you were prepared to give the Minister power to grant a licence without any reference to the Oireachtas, you were not prepared to give him power as to <Col N="475" /> the form in which application should be made for these licences without having those forms laid on the Table of the two Houses.  That, I think, would be an absurd position to create. If Senator Milroy looks through the two first parts of the Bill he will find that there is nothing to be prescribed except the forms of the way in which a thing shall be done.  It seems to me that when you give the Minister power to issue licences, which are binding on the whole State, without coming before the Oireachtas, it would be rather ridiculous to insist on this which deals only with the forms.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides that any company established after the qualifying date to be entitled to carry on in Saorstát Eireann a manufacturing operation without a licence must have, in addition to 51 per cent. of its shares held by Saorstát citizens, two-thirds of the shares carrying voting rights similarly held. It was considered that that phrase &ldquo;shares carrying voting rights&rdquo; was sufficiently wide to cover all classes of shares to which voting rights might attach at any time, but doubt has been raised in that connection. As Senators are, no doubt, aware, it is frequently the practice to confer voting rights upon preference shares <Col N="478" /> in certain eventualities.  The usual eventuality is where the preference dividend is in arrears and it is intended that the Bill should provide that such shares must also be held, as to two-thirds, by Saorstát citizens in order to qualify a company to operate their business.  These words in brackets are inserted to make that clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This certainly clears up the doubt.  I had not much doubt about what the Bill was for but there was a possibility of a position in this respect that might be extremely unsatisfactory by which a share would not be a voting share until the dividend was not paid and then suddenly becoming a voting share.  I wrote to the Minister pointing out the difficulty and I think this clears it up.  I presume that he is satisfied as to the wording of it but I would point out to him that the effect may not be quite equitable as between different classes of companies, but perhaps that is more or less inevitable. A large, well-known, powerful and financially strong foreign company can very easily get preference shares taken in the Free State without voting rights, the simple reason being that the guarantee of dividend of certain corporations is good enough for almost any Irishman.  Concerns not so large, but which, from certain points of view, might be even more desirable in the Saorstát, as not being connected with big combines and powerful companies, will find it very difficult indeed to get Saorstát citizens to take a preference share unless there are voting rights, in the eventuality of the dividend not being paid.  I confess that I only saw this amendment this morning and I cannot see any immediate way out of it, but I am not quite satisfied that the effect of the amendment, while it does clarify the position and is in that sense an improvement, is quite what the Minister would desire or what I, myself, would like to see.</P>

      <P>Section 9, sub-section (1).  After sub-paragraph (ii), line 58, to insert a new sub-paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(iii) a majority of the directors of the body corporate, other than managing directors giving whole-time attention to the business, are nationals of Saorstát Eireann; or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to explain to the House, although, of course, it is quite clear to the Minister, that this amendment deals only with absolutely new companies.  Existing companies are protected under the Bill as it stands. Under this Bill, a company, before it can manufacture, will have to have 51 per cent. of its total shares&mdash;it does not deal with debentures&mdash;and two-thirds of the voting shares held by Saorstát nationals.  Incidentally, while I am speaking, I want to ask the Minister the exact meaning of &ldquo;every class of shares&rdquo; because I am not quite sure what it does mean.  For instance, if a company has first preference, second preference and ordinary shares and, after the other amendment has been passed, and assuming that all these are now classed as voting shares, do you take the total of the first preference, second preference and ordinary and then take two-thirds of them all put together, or if you by any chance have a separate class of shares, for any internal convenient reason&mdash;<Col N="480" /> sometimes they are divided into first and second and it is frequently done in private companies for family reasons &mdash;must you take two-thirds of each separate class?  I take it that it is meant to be each separate class, although I am not quite sure.  The Minister might look into the question and see if that is correct.  I am assuming that it is correct for the purpose of my argument.</P>
    <P>The object of that is to provide that no new industry will be started here unless, as far as possible, the control of that industry is in the hands of persons who are either Irish nationals under the previous Bill or qualified persons under this Bill, unless, of course, they go to the Minister and obtain a licence.  If you accept the principle of this Bill&mdash;and I said on the original Bill that I believed that with a high tariff policy some such Bill as this was necessary&mdash;and if you, therefore, accept the principle that control should be in the hands of Irish nationals&mdash;using the phrase in the general sense&mdash;it seems to me that the case for this amendment of mine is a fairly strong one.  I want to add to that qualification that the majority of the directors of the company should also be Irish nationals, excluding any managing directors who give all their time to the business and who, for technical reasons, may have to be imported. The Federation of Irish Industries are very anxious to see this amendment carried and they feel rather strongly that it is desirable that this should be done.  One of the grounds on which they are strongly in favour of this amendment is that they find that one of the difficulties arising at present, particularly with regard to new industries which are being developed, is the difficulty of getting one industry to support the other.</P>
    <P>That is that you have two industries developing side by side and one will not give the other the necessary friendly facilities which will enable them to make goods that they themselves are not putting in the ordinary way on the market.  If you had a fully established industrial company that would be of no importance. It would be desirable; but in <Col N="481" /> the present situation here in which many industries are only being developed, there are many things which one firm could make and supply to the other if they were given, in a friendly way, an opportunity to quote but which they are not in the ordinary way given a quotation for.  There is a feeling that persons who are residing here&mdash; and therefore financially and in every way interested in the company&mdash;would, if acting as directors, be far more likely to be willing to carry out this sort of co-operation than directors who reside at the other side of the water or reside in some foreign country.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the result of the Act has been in some cases to provide a guarantee of certain shares to large concerns.  As a result of that provision these firms have got over 51 per cent. of their capital here.  I think with similar guarantees you may get half or two-thirds of the directors or even more who would be people who would only come over here for the directors' meetings.  It is reasonable to suggest in those circumstances that half the directors of the body corporate other than the managing directors should be persons qualified in the same way as the shareholders. If you are to have <i>bona fide</i> Irish shareholders holding shares they ought to look after their own interests but if these are guaranteed shares they are not likely to do so.  Theoretically the shareholders control the company. Very often when a company is in difficulties they actually control it but I think most persons will agree the position usually is when a company is doing well and paying satisfactory dividends the shareholders do not bother at all in the management of the company and the actual control is in the hands of the directors.  For that reason to fit in with the policy of this Bill it would be a reasonable proposal that the majority of the directors of the body corporate, other than the managing directors, should be nationals of Saorstát Eireann and have the same qualifications as the shareholders under the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another reason in favour of this amendment and it is this&mdash;some of these companies which have been <Col N="482" /> started and some of which will start are firms manufacturing products of which there has been distribution in this country before.  I believe this provision would give a chance to Irishmen who have been engaged in distribution.  It would give a chance to men who have a knowledge of the distribution side, which is very important, of becoming directors and of being offered directorships.  I think that is a class that has been rather hit under the legislation, inevitable legislation if you like, of the present Government.  I think this is a case where they would have been offered directorships had such a provision as this existed already.  I suggest to the Minister that this amendment will not make it in any way more difficult to get his industries started here.  Irish shareholders who put money in a company should have certain representation on the board of directors.  It is sound policy to suggest that a majority of the directors should be Saorstát Eireann nationals, provided that this does not affect the managing directors to whom I would not like to see this provision apply because there would be some danger that a provision of that kind might affect the proficiency of the industries to be started here now.  For a considerable time we want to have persons who are very competent to act as managing directors and that is the reason why I am making an exception in their case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very hard to argue against this amendment.  When the Bill was being framed I gave very careful consideration to the advisability of the insertion of a provision of this kind.  I decided against it because of a number of reasons.  Any one of these reasons by itself might have seemed very inadequate for failing to make this a provision in the Bill.  But I came to the conclusion that the sum total of these reasons was sufficient to make it unnecessary to require in the case of companies otherwise qualified to operate without a licence that a majority of the directors should be nationals of Saorstát Eireann. In the first place, I think Senators will agree that it is desirable that we should <Col N="483" /> have the least possible amount of regulation which will achieve our purpose in relation to this measure.</P>
      <P>The question which we are asked to consider in relation to this particular proposal is not whether the proposal is in itself desirable or not but whether it is essential to the achievement of the main purpose of the Bill.  We decided it was not essential in so far as we provide for the holding by nationals of Saorstát Eireann of two-thirds of the shares carrying voting rights in every company undertaking manufacturing processes in the future. We are therefore very directly providing for the effective control, even though it may be only ultimate control in such company, by citizens of Saorstát Eireann.  These citizens may use their control wisely or unwisely. They may in relation to their own company do things which some of us might consider unwise or find it difficult to understand.  A company composed of 100 per cent. of Saorstát nationals might decide to appoint as directors persons who are not nationals.  But they do that of their own free will and do it knowing that certain disadvantages to them and their company may follow.  I am not clear why we should interfere with them.  I admit that that argument is not very strong.  I will admit that when certain companies constituted in such a manner as to avoid the necessity for a licence under the 1932 Act proceeded to appoint as directors persons who were in some cases entirely non-national persons, ordinarily resident outside the State, I felt that a situation has arisen in which the Government should seriously consider the advisability of adopting an amendment of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came to the conclusion, however, that the objection to the appointment on these boards, 100 per cent. non-national was an objection which was largely based upon the fact that these boards were operating companies constituted in a manner which conformed to the terms of the 1932 Act but which nevertheless insured that effective control and ownership remained outside the country.  Now that we are dealing <Col N="484" /> with the question of ownership we can afford to leave the nationality of directors to look after itself.  Another reason why I decided in that manner was because I felt that certain difficulties would arise in practice in operating any such provision.  The adoption of this clause would, of course, mean that the Department of Industry and Commerce would have to keep itself informed of the persons appointed on the boards of new manufacturing enterprises started after the beginning of July.  It might, in certain cases, have to make inquiries in order to ascertain the nationality of these directors.  A certain amount of unnecessary labour might be involved in that and there might also be a certain amount of annoyance for individuals. There is not much sense in putting down a provision of this kind in a Bill unless you make sure of its enforcement; and its enforcement would mean that in the case of companies which were 100 per cent.  Irish-owned the Department of Industry and Commerce would have to investigate the nationality of the directors.  These are some of the things that decided us against the insertion of this provision. I admit I have been shaken in the position I took up then because of representations from many quarters concerning a provision of this kind.</P>
    <P>The matter was argued elsewhere and certain considerations were put forward in a forcible manner which affected my mind concerning them. Consequently I am quite prepared to say that if the Seanad think that an amendment of this kind should be inserted in the Bill, I shall make no objection to their doing so.  It is possible that the insertion of the amendment may involve one or two consequential amendments in the section relating to the furnishing of information, in which case I shall have consequential amendments prepared but still, I am on the whole inclined to the view that this provision is not essential.  I will admit that the weight of argument on one side is very nearly as heavy as the weight on the other and that it would take very little to tip the balance in the opposite direction but if there is anybody of an <Col N="485" /> opinion which thinks it desirable that we should have this additional safeguard, then I am not prepared to stand against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I came here without any definite opinion on the amendment but having heard two speeches, I am inclined to think that the opposition to the amendment is very weak indeed.  I would imagine that it is easier for instance to make inquiry as to the position of the proposed directors of the company than it would be to inquire into the position of the shareholders.  The burden thrown upon the Department would be much smaller in the one case than in the other.  But, touching the whole question of policy, it strikes me as very much more important that the directors of a company should be the persons who should be qualified according to the requirements, rather than the shareholders, unless one has in mind merely the profit making capacity of the business or the investment value of particular businesses.  I have always approached this group of questions from the point of view of the industrial development of the country as a whole, not particularly or primarily in regard to the possibilities of incomes to be derived from manufactures by Irish shareholders. I can very readily see&mdash;and the Minister has admitted it&mdash;that the bulk of the investing public in this country would be quite careless as to the ultimate purpose and effects of the industry if it were giving a temporary profit.  The general industrial interest may be only secondary or of much later concern following the question of the immediate return.  Therefore, if the purpose of this body of legislation is to develop the industrial activities of this country, as distinct from the mere dividend earning capacity of particular industries for a particular body of shareholders, it is much more important that the qualifications should be looked for on the management rather than on the owning side of the business.  On that ground I would say that if the whole group of Bills, of which this is one, can be justified it is obvious that an amendment <Col N="486" /> of this kind is desirable, much more so, in my opinion, than that the mere shareholding should be in the hands of nationals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with what Senator Johnson has said.  If there is to be effective industrial development in this country it is essential that people who are in control should be of the right character. I am connected with some companies which are doing well and, as Senator Douglas has pointed out, our great difficulty at the annual meeting is to get a sufficient number of shareholders to form a statutory quorum to attend.  In fact we had to put certain shares in nominees' hands so as to carry through the statutory requirements at our annual meeting. It does not matter, even if 75 or 80 per cent. of the capital were owned by nationals, if the technical skill and knowledge of the managing directors are such that you will have no effective control of the throttle valves, these men can keep their processes and their technical knowledge to themselves.</P>
      <P>I was rather disappointed at the opening part of the Minister's speech but when he said that if there was any substantial volume of opinion in favour of this amendment he would be prepared to accept it, I was prompted to rise to let him know that I hoped he would accept this amendment and introduce any consequential amendments which may be necessary.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to Senator Douglas that the difficulties of establishing a new company are very great.  I would like to impress upon the Minister also that the fewer obstacles put in the way of people who are trying to develop industries, the better.  I think in all human probability that the directors of both of these new enterprises will be Irishmen but there are many cases in which it is not possible to get such men.  Frequently the only qualified men available have not been born here &mdash;that is outside the managing director altogether.  I would suggest to the Minister that the less impediments he puts in the way of organising and starting new industries, the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that this question has no political colour whatever.  This amendment is in favour of a certain class of men, a small class of men, men who hope to become managing directors, who hope to be on more than one or more than two companies.  There is an objection, I think, to this amendment, adverted to by the Minister but I think not very much stressed, and it is this.  You take power under this Bill to secure that two-thirds of the money&mdash;to put it in general terms&mdash;should be Irish money. When you establish a company it is very essential in the interests of trade and industry that there should be no official interference in the internal management of that company either by legislation or otherwise.  Here now is an amendment which prohibits the members of a trading company from selecting whom they wish to be directors of the company.  No doubt, in the ordinary case, the men resident in Dublin who are well known will be selected before strangers.  It is only in the case where the stranger is known by the shareholder to be the most competent man that he will be selected for a directorship by Irish votes, so that you are now preventing a company from selecting the best man to conduct the business in which the shareholders have invested their money and, that, for a reason which I think is not adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only reason put forward by Senator Douglas is that if there are a number of men directors of a great many companies&mdash;in London they are called, I think, guinea pigs&mdash;there is a greater chance of co-operation amongst the various companies.  In a new State like this, where we are in the infancy of industrial development, independence is a great thing&mdash;independence of one company as regards and as against other companies.  Individuality will promote that feeling of rivalry which is so good for trade and so good for the people engaged in trade.  I have dealt with Senator Douglas' reason.  Senator Dowdall had another reason.  He says that the managing directors control the nerves of industry and that it is essential <Col N="488" /> that the managing directors should, as far as possible, be Irish.</P>

I mention these matters merely for the purpose of having the matter thoroughly thrashed out and that the Seanad may have an opportunity of seeing the matter in all its bearings.  I do not think that the arguments in favour of the action the Minister took are weak.  He has, probably, a great many arguments in his mind which he has not expressed here to-day.  He wants to make it appear that Senators decide this matter for themselves.  He is a very reasonable and moderate man, gets on very well with Senators, and allows them to do little things.  I think the Minister had very sound and shrewd ideas when he left this provision out of his Bill.</P>

      <P>Objecting, as I do, to the whole principle of this Bill, I do not think that this additional blister matters very much.  I cannot help feeling that, whatever the Minister may have said, the supporters of this amendment have not told us all that is in their minds.  I hope I am not doing an injustice to those responsible for these proposals when I say that they want to make industry as close a borough as they can and to exclude all light, zeal and competition.  They want to stabilise inefficiency.  They do not say that, of course, and I do not blame them.  If I were in industry and engaged in competition I should probably feel the same as they do but, not being in that position, I have much more regard for enterprise, development, progress, and what I may call the interests of the consumer as against the interests of monopolists.  I object to this further restriction on freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, the argument&mdash; I am glad to find myself in agreement with Senator Comyn&mdash;that the control of industry should be left in the hands <Col N="489" /> of the shareholders.  He said that we should tell shareholders how to do their business.  That is being done by this amendment.  The shareholders will, I presume, be reasonable people who understand their job and I do not see why they should not be allowed to be masters in their own houses.  We have done enough by providing that two-thirds of the shareholders be nationals without putting a limitation on how they shall vote.  There is another aspect of the matter.  There is a strong bias not only here but all over the world towards insularity and exclusiveness. The argument against that aspect will hardly appeal to some Senators but I suggest that it is a practical one.  I think I am right in saying that the people who occupy the position of directors will also come into the net of the Minister for Finance.  It is possible that a number of these people will possess very substantial incomes. Under the present arrangement, the Minister for Finance will get practically half the tax on their incomes.</P>

It may not apply to all, but it would probably apply to some.  I do not believe that we are being told the true reason behind this or any of these other Acts. It is to maintain a close borough in industry.  That is done, of course, with full lip service to nationalism.  I do not like it at all and I shall oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not see the necessity for this amendment at all. If the majority of shareholders are nationals, I presume they are competent to elect a majority of directors in sympathy with their outlook.  To impose this statutory obligation on them is, to me, indicative of distrust. It seems to assume that the majority of shareholders are not going to do <Col N="490" /> what is expected of them and that they must be bound by statutory obligation. My view in regard to this matter is very radically different from the view expressed by Senator Sir John Keane. One thing I dislike is the doctrinaire mentality as expressed by Senator Johnson in regard to industrial development. He seems to think that the question of whether an enterprise should or should not bear profits is a consideration that should be entirely lost sight of in relation to economic development.  I venture to say there has not been a single enterprise started since the industrial movement began that has been instigated by mere altruistic considerations and that has succeeded.  The only business that succeeds is the business that is going to bring a profit to the people engaged in it.</P>

I take it that once you have secured that the capital in an enterprise is national and that the control of the enterprise is in the hands of a majority of national shareholders, the next consideration is that those who direct such an enterprise shall be efficient in their jobs.  I take it that will be the dominating consideration in the minds of the majority of the national shareholders in any enterprise.  I say that the selection of the directors should be left entirely to their discretion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make my position more clear.  Senator Milroy thinks that I was decrying the establishment of industries having a profit for the shareholders in view. That is not my point.  I am assuming all the industries will be expected to pay a dividend to the shareholders. This question is bound up with the general policy of this Bill and its predecessors, measures whose purpose is the development of manufacturing activities in this country.  We know that manufacturing activities have been held back; they have been undeveloped. And we know, too, that many of those that have been developed in recent times are branches of businesses across the water.  I am not by any means disinclined to approve of the establishment of industries as branches or off-shoots of established firms who know how to do the job.  They are probably going to be of very great benefit to the development of industry here.  But this whole scheme is to prevent businesses being formed here nominally in the interests of industrial development while, in fact, retarding the development of industries in this country, probably for the benefit of the parent business in Britain.  It is no use pretending that business enterprises do not quite frequently establish blocking branches, branches where they may operate in reality, but with a policy subsidiary to that of the parent company.  I take it that that is one of the real causes of this type of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then come to the question of effective control.  It is said the shareholders are the effective controllers. It is quite impossible to speak with knowledge at the moment, but I would venture to say that even to-day the shareholding, the investing public in this country are not very much greater numerically than the shareholding public in 1921.  The people who actually hold shares in limited companies are probably not very much greater in number.  The same people will, <Col N="492" /> perhaps, have a greater variety of holdings, but it is the same body of people who hold the shares in limited companies.  They are a comparatively small proportion of the total population. The initiation of most companies of a public character comes largely through the directors, and it is the investing public to whom they appeal. They hold out hopes of making a decent profit, of paying a decent interest on the investment.  I am not finding fault with that, but I say that the impulse of the shareholding public is to see that the business brings a return on the capital invested.  That may or may not be in the best interests of the country, but if it is desired by legislation to secure that the industrial development shall be furthered, in my opinion it is more likely to be developed by legislating in respect to the directors rather than in respect to the shareholders. I am assuming that the purpose of this Bill and its predecessor is accepted by the House.  Having that purpose in mind, I ask myself whether it is more likely that it shall be effected by limiting the choice of directorships rather than by limiting the choice of shareholders.  I think the greater argument lies in the limitation of directorships rather than in regard to shareholders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a choice between making the majority of the shareholders nationals or the majority of the managers nationals, I wonder what would Senator Johnson's wish be?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should say in that matter that I agree with Senator Johnson.  In this amendment I am speaking for myself and not for any group.  Incidentally, I might mention that when the proposed amendment was considered by the Federation of Irish Industries and certain persons connected with it, I expressed the view&mdash;which was not shared by them&mdash;that the change from 51 per cent. to two-thirds of the shareholders was not worth anything without Irish directors.  That is still <Col N="493" /> my view.  I am not dealing with it now because of Government policy. My own view is that control, certainly as far as 95 per cent. of companies are concerned, is exercised by directors.  Both Senator Comyn and the Minister are visualising a whole lot of shareholders looking for directors.  That is not the way companies are formed.  A prospective board gets together and looks for shareholders.  When a company gets into difficulties I admit that it is sometimes a question of looking for better directors.  The Minister knows as well as I do that at present it is very largely a matter of a few people getting together with a view to having a certain commodity manufactured here and the difficulty is to get shareholders.  If Irish control was effective I would not mind if the money was all English money.  I could never see that it mattered where the money came from if the spending and the control was here.  I admit in practice that you could not maintain that except in a private company, unless you had a very substantial amount of the shareholders Irish nationals or qualified persons within the meaning of the words in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a note of the matter dealt with by Senator Johnson and agree with him that the amendment should not add to the work of the Department. The average number of directors is from three to seven but in the case of shareholders it will vary from say 100 to a couple of thousand.  The question of increasing the figure from 100 to 103 will not be a very serious obstacle.  The enquiries can be made at the same time.  I venture to suggest that the Department will have a pretty good idea when making enquiries and that in the case of directors it will not be difficult to find out the facts.  I suggest that if the Department does not know there will be other competitors ready to tell them about the directors and that they will soon get all the information.  That will not be as easy in the case of shareholders.  Senators are assuming that the shareholders always control a company.  It gives me very considerable satisfaction to <Col N="494" /> see Senator Comyn agreeing with Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Milroy.  Senator Comyn is a lawyer and presumably knows considerably more about company law than I do.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am mistaken, but I do not think I am wrong when I say that as far as private limited companies are concerned you can set them up, and even though the shareholders might have voting rights, they might not have the right to vote for the directors.  The directors may be elected for life at the beginning of the company.  I am not certain that if outside companies are going to form branches and to get Irish people to subscribe that they will not take some such steps in the original articles of association if it suits them. There are definite limitations if there are subscriptions from the public but, in private companies, almost anything can be arranged.</P>
    <P>I am not pretending that the amendment will solve all the difficulties, but I agree with Senator Johnson regarding the basis of control.  The most effective control in most cases lies in the directors of the companies.  I do not understand the position taken by Senator Comyn.  I understand Senator Sir John Keane's position.  He is perfectly logical and reasonable.  I realise that this is an amendment upon which there is plenty of room for honest differences of opinion.  I am not much worried whether it is Party political or not.  Senator Sir John Keane does not believe in this type of legislation at all.  There is a great deal to be said on his side, I admit.  I would point out that I have given this question a considerable amount of personal thought, and although I am not attracted by this kind of restrictive legislation, I cannot see how it can be avoided.  We have adopted a definite State policy of developing certain industries here.  We are either going to have these industries developed by the State or by private persons.  We will not get things done by private persons even under high tariffs in a country of 3,000,000 people if as soon as the market has been created a big combine from some other country can walk in and take all the advantages.  That money would be immediately lost.  If that danger was <Col N="495" /> there Irish nationals dare not put their money into new industries here. Senator Sir John Keane believes in developing only such industries as are suitable to this country.  That may or may not be sound, but everyone who does not believe that thinks there ought to be restrictions.  The question is, &ldquo;Are you going to have complete restriction.&rdquo;  There are manufacturers here who would like to have a provision that there could be no manufacturers without a licence from the Minister. Some of these persons would like licences to be granted automatically to persons who are nationals, but some would like the Minister to have complete control of all manufacturers.  I am opposed to that.  I want a measure of competition.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government is to endeavour to get industries here. While that is so, the right course is to leave competition among Irish nationals as free as possible.  That has been made more difficult in some respects by the Bill, but the alterations are such as have been found necessary in practice.  The Minister is in a happy position.  He does not mind about the amendment and leaves it to the House. Therefore I have not directed my arguments to him to any extent, but I intend to press the amendment on which there will be a free vote and I hope the House will accept it.  If it is accepted there will be one or two matters to be considered on the Report Stage.  One is the question raised by Senator Guinness.  The difference between an Irish national in this Bill and a qualified person is that a qualified person must have been residing here for five years prior to the given date in July.  A national must be born here or must have resided five years at the relevant date.  I am in favour of the principle of raising employees to the position of directors, and I wish to make it easy for employees who may have come here in connection with the industry to become directors.  For that reason I prefer the term &ldquo;national&rdquo; to the term &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; and I deliberately put in the provision dealing with nationals for that reason.  I do not think it matters <Col N="496" /> if a person has resided here for five years and is working in the business, and I would like to make it easier for such a person to become a director.  I put down the amendment after consultation with the Federation of Irish Industries, and I may say that some members of the federation would like to have 75 per cent. of the shareholders and 75 per cent. of the directors.  I did not feel that I could go that far.  I feel that the proposal I make is moderate and suitable to present circumstances.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>12.&mdash;(1)  Where a new manufacture licence is granted after the date of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall, within one month of the granting of such licence, cause a notice to be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> giving the name of the individual or body corporate to whom such licence has been granted and the article, material or substance specified in such licence and stating whether such licence is to manufacture, to alter, repair or finish or to adapt for sale.</P>
      <P>(2)  Within three months from the date of the passing of this Act the Minister shall cause to be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a list of all manufacture licences granted before the passing of this Act, giving the particulars specified in the immediately preceding sub-section of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is put down after consultation with the same persons.  I am not at all certain that the wording of it is perhaps the best form and absolutely correct, but if the amendment is passed it can be amended on the Report Stage. I shall give you the reasons definitely for the amendment.  At the present time there are a number of persons operating as manufacturers here, and I hear it again and again discussed whether they are Irish nationals or breaking the law and all sorts of things.  There is no method by which you can ascertain whether or not these persons are working under a licence from the Minister or whether they are breaking the law. It may be that it is entirely a matter for the Department and that persons outside should have complete faith; but, strange though it may seem, the particular Federation with which I am concerned is rather anxious to watch these things itself and has no way of ascertaining the facts.  Apart from that, without going into the question of publication of other kinds of licences, as to which I know the Minister says there are certain administrative difficulties, in this particular type of licence, while this kind of Act is in <Col N="498" /> force, while this is the policy of the country, I see no reason why any person who obtains a favour&mdash;because it is a favour while this is the law&mdash;or any company outside which obtains a favour, should have any objection to the name appearing on a list.  I do not much mind whether that list is published in the official Gazette, which very few people read, or made available at the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so that a person can go and see it.  My point is that the list should be made public within a reasonable time after the licence has been granted.</P>
    <P>The Federation feel rather strongly on this and they believe that to make this Act effective and satisfactory it is essential that some such publication should be made.  As the total numbers, I gather from the Minister, are comparatively small, not running into thousands or millions or anything like that, as in the case of licences for the individual importation of goods, there should be no serious administrative difficulties.  The suggestion in this is that a new licence should be published immediately, or within a reasonable time, and that the licences previously granted&mdash;because it is no use without them&mdash;should be published in a list within three months.  I do not mind much about the details as to how exactly this is done.  If the Minister wants six months I do not mind.</P>
    <P>I should have said that in introducing this Bill the Minister drew attention to certain difficulties he had in administering it&mdash;the difficulty in obtaining information, etc.  I am not at all certain that one of the difficulties at present is not due to the fact that it is not obvious who are working under a licence or who are operating within the provisions of the Act as Irish nationals.  I have heard long discussions about certain firms.  It is not desirable, nor is it a thing any firm would like to do, that minute inquiries should be made about competitors unless they have good reason for doing it.  It would be extremely unpleasant if inquiries were made as to the operations of certain firms.  The Minister knows&mdash;I do not want to go into details&mdash;that there are some about <Col N="499" /> which there has been a good deal of complaint.  It is not very nice or desirable to be doing that, if you discover after inquiries are made and, perhaps, unpleasantness caused, that the firm had received a licence.  Apart altogether from these reasons, which are the reasons mainly in the mind of the Federation of Irish Industries, my own reason is that I believe this kind of thing ought to be done above board, that it is good policy that it should be, and that the Minister, in the long run, will find it easier to administer if, when any firm from outside the country asks for a licence, it should be part of his duty to publish the fact that that firm has obtained a licence and to say the goods they are entitled to manufacture, and whether they are going to manufacture or repair, or whatever it is they are going to do.</P>
    <P>I have, of course, advocated publicity in the matter of other licences, but that does not arise under this Bill. This is solely for the class of licence which this Bill provides, that is a licence to a non-national to come in and manufacture.  Personally I cannot think of any good argument against the publication of this type of licence. I think it would be healthier and do away with that kind of underground charges which the Minister knows as well as anybody else that I have never made, that I do not make, and do not believe in.  This is, however, the sort of thing that you get whispered round and I believe that a good way to avoid that is by publishing the names in an open way.  Whether it is done in the official Gazette or simply put in the Bill that they are available at the Minister's office or in the National Library or anywhere else, I do not much mind.  The whole point is that somewhere there should be a list which a person could see if he wanted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course publication in the official Gazette, publication in a register in the Minister's office, and publication in the newspapers are the same things.  The average citizen may not read the Gazette, but the newspaper editors do and you cannot have confined publicity of that kind.  I am <Col N="500" /> quite satisfied in my own mind that it is unwise to pass this amendment. I am satisfied that it is not in the best national interest that this publication of the list of licensees should take place.  At the same time, I am reluctant to argue against the amendment for the reasons which Senator Douglas mentioned in the concluding portion of his remarks.  For various reasons, the reluctance shown on the part of the Government to supply certain information relating either to particular industrialists or a body of industrialists has been represented as a desire to cloak something which has to be cloaked, which the Government are ashamed of, which is indicative of proceedings which might have political reactions against the Government.  Those who are familiar with the facts know that that is not the case.  Where we have tried to avoid publicity we have done so in the interests of industrial development and the desire on our part to avoid publicity in the matter referred to in this amendment has that aim in view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Licences are issued to various firms that, in the opinion of the Government, it is desirable should be allowed to undertake manufacture here.  The circumstances may be such that it is not possible to get the particular class of goods manufactured by a firm that can operate without a licence.  Consequently by various methods, whether by invitation on the part of the Government or otherwise, a firm, not owned by Saorstát citizens, is permitted to undertake the manufacture of these goods here and gets a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act.  It is quite clear that that licence is not issued except the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Executive Council, are satisfied that it is desirable to issue such a licence. A licence is issued, and the publication of the fact that such licence is issued to a firm is an advertisement that it is a foreign owned firm.  On that account its operations here may be prejudiced as, in some cases, these foreign owned firms are in competition with nationally owned firms. There were quite a number of <Col N="501" /> industries established, owned by Saorstát nationals, and given an opportunity of vastly developing their operations and showing greater enterprise; but they showed no initiative and took no advantage of the opportunities given them, and were not showing any great activities until one, two, three or more licences to foreign firms were issued.</P>
    <P>These foreign firms came in undoubtedly to make profit, but they have given us a very definite national advantage.  I would not like to put them at a disadvantage as against their competitors by the State advertisement of the fact that they are not nationally owned, but that they are foreign owned corporations. But, I say again, that if there is any feeling that the publication should take place, if there is any feeling strongly expressed by persons in a position to exercise impartial judgment, I may be prepared to undertake the publication.  I think it is not quite fair to the firms or desirable in the national interest, but I am prepared to undertake it rather than have any strength given to those who are using the Government's natural reluctance to undertake this publicity for the purpose of spreading the idea that there is something to be cloaked.</P>
    <P>Our concern in this matter is purely disinterested.  We think it best that this publicity should not take place, but if there is an insistent demand from impartial sources for it, it may be different.  I am not inclined to take the Federation of Irish Industries or any kindred body as impartial. Some of them have an interest in the publication of the names of those licensed firms in competition with themselves, and, consequently, their attitude in relation to questions of this kind is naturally different from what the action of impartial persons would be.  However, that is as it may be. Senators have heard the point of view expressed by Senator Douglas&mdash;and there is a lot in it&mdash;and they have heard a contrary opinion from me. But I am quite prepared to accept the decision of the Seanad in the matter.</P>
    <Col N="502" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that it would not be fair to firms invited to come in to carry on certain businesses in this country that he should publish broadcast the fact that they are foreign firms.  Some of them have been invited in because existing firms in this country have not shown that industry, or that desire for extension or development, that they ought to show.  Now if there are any of that class, and I am afraid there are many, they are the very people who, through motives of jealousy, would be inclined to start a boycott against the people who came in here and showed them their business.  I think there is a certain amount of responsibility upon the Minister to see that people who have been invited in, or allowed in, for national purposes should get protection from the malice of their competitors who were not able, or who had not the energy, to conduct the business of the country themselves.</P>
      <P>That is one aspect of the case.  There is another aspect.  It may be that in some industry it will be still desirable to get foreigners to come in and establish business here.  Now should that happen, it would be very hard to get people to come in.  You have such people here already.  If you expose them to a boycott, or to reflection after they have come in, it will be very difficult to get other people to come in and face a situation of that kind. I can see what the Minister has in mind.  He wants to avoid the unworthy suggestion that the Government has some indirect motive in failing to publish these things.  He wants to avoid that.  It is natural that he should, but I think people who were invited in here to establish industries should be protected, and, further, that people who may hereafter come in on our invitation should not be dissuaded from coming in by the treatment their predecessors have received.  This is a question in which I think the Seanad ought to exercise that sound judgment which in many cases I think it has shown.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given the answer that I expected he would give in this case.  I think it was <Col N="503" /> one that most of us thought he would have given.  When it comes to balancing publicity and the danger of losing somebody who is coming in to establish a business here against the implication which may be made against the Government for not publishing the name of such a firm, I think the Minister is very wise in keeping himself clear of those things.  At the same time I think that the position is better supported by publicity than by secrecy.  I cannot see that any firm coming in here, if the whole of their business depends upon secrecy, are not worth much attention.  In all cases where licences are given by the Government I think they are a necessity.  In the line of business that I know most about we have our premises licensed and I never found that putting statement of the licence over our premises did any harm.  The same applies in this case.  Secrecy is a bad thing.  I cordially agree with the Minister in his determination to leave this matter to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I support very strongly what Senator Jameson has said.  Secrecy in all these matters is very wrong.  On the Second Reading I asked for some information on the subject, and was rather sat upon, to use a common phrase.  I was really in the dark.  I asked about three companies and whether they came into the purview of the Bill and I was told not. I asked could the particulars of companies that did come within the purview of the Bill be given but I did not get the information.  There is a further point.  The Minister has drawn a picture of the national, and of the foreigner coming in.  Is it the intention of this Act that this shall only apply to foreigners coming in and that only foreigners shall obtain a licence? Is it not intended that a national shall obtain a licence?</P>

With regard <Col N="504" /> to publication in the Official Gazette, you have only got to read it to see the mass of publications in it, some of which are necessary and some not.  It is advisable, however, when the Government enters into these matters, that the fact that they issue a licence, and to whom and in what circumstances they issue the licence, should be available to anybody who is anxious to know that fact, and more particularly to those in competition with the person or firm to whom the licence has been issued.

      <P>I also support the amendment.  Senator Jameson yesterday put up some very cogent reasons as to why publication of this kind was necessary and the Minister for Agriculture, I think, in somewhat parallel circumstances, agreed with Senator Jameson.  The Minister said that this country is, happily, free from graft; but you have to look at these things in the big way, from the point of view of the future.  I do not suppose that we have any less original sin in our composition than other people, and all countries have found very grave dangers in placing powers such as these in the hands of Governments.  I think that, in the interests of the future of the country, we have to look upon those things from a broad point of view and that we have to balance the advantages against the disadvantages. I cannot help feeling that publicity of this kind forms a very big protection against the possible dangers of corruption.  I do not consider myself any the less patriotic for mentioning that as a possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Jameson said, what firm, coming in to do business is unable to do business because of publicity, and who is going to boycott a firm manufacturing under licence because they are British?  The consumers want value for their money, and, really, the whole of this business of Irish-made goods&mdash;whether they are good or bad &mdash;appeals very little to the consumer. It is not a question of sentimentality. The consumer wants value for his money&mdash;especially as he is getting less and less money every day, which is the <Col N="505" /> case with many of us.  If foreigners can give them better value there are going to be no reactions on the foreigner. This amendment is a very limited application of the principle of publicity which should also obtain in connection with all those licences which have resulted from the tariffs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that the position the Minister has taken deserves sympathy, because I should rather judge, without any knowledge except that which I have gained here, that the pressure for publicity in regard to licences has come from those who, it may be feared, are going to use it for mere trade competition purposes&mdash;not fair competition as to the merits of the article, but merely on what might be called sentimental grounds.  It is to be used as an instrument of trade attack.  On that ground, I think that the Minister was well justified in refusing that importunity.  On the general principle that where licences are issued for privileges there should be publicity, I think that the general principle is sound, and I should be inclined to support the amendment on these wider grounds; but I think it would be well, instead of having publication in the manner suggested, to have a register where a person who seeks information can obtain it by paying a small fee.  I think that that would be better than obtaining the information by publication in the Official Gazette.</P>

If the Minister would bring in an alternative amendment providing for the preparation of such a register I should prefer that course.  On the one point made against this amendment, if I agreed with the Minister that this would be unfair to firms to which it was thought fit to give a licence, it would be different.</P>

      <P>Yes, but if I believed for one moment that the provisions of this amendment were going to be unfair to them, I would not press this amendment.  However, I want the House to consider what the case is.  Very few of these manufacturers deal directly with the public.  In certain parts of the country there may be a certain amount of sentimental feeling in favour of Irish manufactured goods, but, to be honest, I am afraid that that feeling is worth very little.  My own experience has been, and my own case is, that we put our own goods in our window but do not mark them Irish now, and we can sell a greater proportion now than ever we sold because, with the operation of tariffs and all the rest of it, they are better value.  There is a considerable number of people still, however, who believe that a thing is better if they think it is English.  I am not at all convinced that this amendment would work against the manufacturers.  They are not dealing with the public.  They are dealing with the wholesalers and sometimes dealing directly with the retailers.  Does the Minister find that there is a tendency on the part of the wholesalers and retailers to give the preference to Irish goods?  The general experience is that the preference is given to English manufactured goods.  There might be something to be said if there were a question of the retailers dealing with the manufacturers, but I am convinced that publication in this case will not do them the least bit of harm.  I believe that the principle is right.  I belong to the federation and I agree with the Minister that it is unbiassed.  At the same time, I have given thought to this matter for a very long time and I have not yet heard an argument which would change my mind as to the advisability of publication being made or of a register being kept.  Accordingly, I ask the House to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 22, sub-section (1).  Before paragraph (c) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c)  the compensation which is to be paid to persons or bodies corporate who were manufacturing for sale to the public such reserved commodity in Saorstát Eireann at the time the order made under Section 16 of this Act came into force and who have not been granted a licence under this Part of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for reserved commodities, and that these may be declared by order.  It also deals with the case where the Executive Council are of opinion that such a commodity is not being manufactured&mdash;in that case this amendment would not arise&mdash;in Saorstát Eireann to a substantial extent.  I think the Minister on one occasion stated that his idea was that the words &ldquo;to a substantial extent&rdquo; would apply generally except in the case of manufacturing experiments or something of the kind.  There is a feeling, I think, in this case&mdash;a very reasonable feeling on the part of certain manufacturers&mdash; I do not want to pretend that they are unbiassed&mdash;that if an opportunity <Col N="511" /> should arise for making something in a small way as a sideline in connection with their business, and that the Government should decide to make that a reserved commodity, then the person who gets the monopoly of making that reserved commodity should be asked to pay some reasonable compensation. The Minister says that is not likely to happen, in which case there is no objection to my amendment.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the amendment does not go as far as I would like it to go because it does not force the payment of compensation.  It gives the Minister power, in the conditions under which he will grant a licence to manufacture a reserved commodity, to provide compensation for the persons from whom he has taken the manufacture of that reserved commodity, provided, of course, that those persons were making it for sale to the public. That does not force him to provide for compensation, but it does give the Minister for the time being power to provide that there shall be such compensation. I contend that he ought to have that power.  It is reasonable, I think.  If people have been selling to the public or manufacturing for sale to the public&mdash;the matter will not arise if they have not been manufacturing for sale to the public&mdash;and he is not satisfied that there is any substantial loss, he will not put that condition in the licence, but if by any chance it should seem desirable at some time to make a certain commodity a reserved commodity, and that somebody was manufacturing it, then under this amendment he can provide for compensation.</P>
    <P>My strongest argument in support of the amendment is this: it is not desirable to have any manufacturer who might make some commodity here, whether in a new concern or, more important still, as a sideline to his present business, afraid of spending some money on it for fear of the provisions of Part III of the Bill.  The Minister says that there is no substantial ground for thinking that the people are nervous.  My information is that he should take power to provide, not by the State but by the <Col N="512" /> person who gets the monopoly, compensation in the circumstances I have indicated if he thinks it is desirable that it should be done.</P>

Would such manufacture be regarded as a reserved commodity? I know one or two businesses in which the development of a sideline to them is possible.  Such a development is made possible by the existence of the business that is now being carried on.  If such a development took place would it necessarily follow that a licence to manufacture would have to be obtained, and would the manufacture of some particular article in such circumstances be regarded as a reserved commodity? There may be many people anxious to develop sidelines to their present business.  If such developments are to come under the description of reserved commodities, these people may find themselves in considerable difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If it has been made in the Saorstát to any substantial extent, it cannot be made a reserved commodity. It is that phrase &ldquo;to any substantial extent&rdquo; that has caused <Col N="513" /> the uneasiness to which Senator Douglas refers.  In drafting this Bill, it was intended that power should be taken to make a reserved commodity only a commodity which was not being manufactured here, and an order to make it a reserved commodity would not be made unless it was considered an essential step towards securing that it would be manufactured here, but in order to allow a certain amount of elasticity and for purely drafting purposes, the phrase &ldquo;to any substantial extent&rdquo; was considered necessary in the Bill.  That has given rise to apprehension in the minds of some people, that an article now being made by them might be made a reserved commodity in the future, and that they might be prevented from continuing their manufacturing industry in consequence of a refusal of a licence under Part III of the Bill.  If there is apprehension in the mind of any person which might prevent him from engaging in industrial development of one kind or another, I think we should take steps to remove it.</P>
      <P>I think the apprehension is not based on any reality, but if it is there, it is something we must take into account, but I am strongly of opinion that the way Senator Douglas suggests, of providing compensation for such persons, is the wrong way.  My idea of dealing with the situation would be to provide that any person who is manufacturing that commodity in the Saorstát must get a licence.  It is easy to say that, but it brings in complications immediately you say it, because if there was any person manufacturing the article to any substantial extent&mdash;and my interpretation of that phrase is to an extent which made it commercially profitable to do so&mdash;an order making that article a reserved commodity cannot be made at all, and therefore we have really to deal with the case of a person who was, or who claims to have been manufacturing the article concerned on a very small scale&mdash;to an extent which, in the opinion of the Executive Council, was not a substantial extent.  Nevertheless, I still say that the way to deal with that person, if he can establish his claim, is to give him a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> The establishment of a claim of that kind is obviously not a matter for the determination of a Minister. Questions of fact arise for decision and in any event, the Minister might not be an unprejudiced person in relation to a claim of that kind where he had already in fact decided against it in determining to make an order at all and therefore, the provision should be one which would enable such a person to appeal to the court.  If Senator Douglas will withdraw his amendment at this stage, I will undertake to endeavour to frame an amendment for Report Stage which will provide that where any person who has applied for and has been refused a licence under Part III of the Bill, appeals to the High Court and gets from the High Court a declaration that he was, in fact, engaged in the manufacture of the article which has been declared to be a reserved commodity, a licence must issue to him and the Minister will be given no discretion in the matter.  I think that is by far the most satisfactory way of dealing with it rather than by making any provision for compensation, because it is more in accord with the general idea of the Bill, which is that if anybody is manufacturing that article at all, power to make that article a reserved commodity should not exist.</P>

If the Minister refuses the licence&mdash; and the Minister, knowing that he has this power of appeal, will not refuse the licence unless he thinks there is good ground for doing so&mdash; the applicant then has an appeal from the Minister to the High Court and I think it is a necessary provision.</P>

If the law says that he must get it if he is manufacturing to a small extent, I shall be quite satisfied.  I think the Minister knows that I am not manufacturing uneasiness.  There is a perfectly genuine feeling of uneasiness and the case which impressed me, apart from uneasiness that may not be reasonable, is that there are certain business&mdash;and when I used the word &ldquo;side-lines&rdquo; previously, I, perhaps, did not make myself clear&mdash;in which the owners from time to time consider experimenting with a view to making something.  They may never go on with it and if they are afraid that these things may become reserved commodities, they will be extremely unwilling to make experiments in the early stages.

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>(1)  Where a person is found guilty of an offence under Section 13 of the Principal Act, the court may, either in addition to or in lieu of imposing a fine, order the seizure and forfeiture of all machinery, plant, utensils <Col N="517" /> and equipment (whether the same are or are not fixtures) suitable for use in a creamery found in the premises in which such offence was committed.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a creamery is alleged to be maintained in contravention of Section 13 of the Principal Act and the person by whom such creamery is so maintained is not known or cannot conveniently be ascertained, a prosecution for the offence under the said Section 13 of so maintaining such creamery may be brought against the person so maintaining such creamery by the description of &ldquo;the person maintaining a creamery at (a named place)&rdquo; without naming or further identifying such person, and whenever any such prosecution is so brought, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the summons or other document originating such prosecution may, notwithstanding anything contained in any rule of court, be served by affixing a copy thereof in a prominent position on the outside of the premises in which such creamery is alleged to be maintained, and such service shall for all purposes be good and sufficient service;</P>
    <P>(b)  if at the hearing of the matter any person appears (whether in person or by solicitor or counsel) and either is proved to be or admits that he is the person maintaining the alleged creamery, the court may amend the summons or other document aforesaid by inserting therein the name of such person as respondent and make such order on such document as so amended as justice may require;</P>
    <P>(c)  if at the hearing of the matter the court is satisfied that the offence alleged has been or is being committed but no person appears (whether in person or by solicitor or counsel) who is proved to be or admits that he is the person by whom such offence was or is being committed, the court may order the seizure and forfeiture of all machinery, plant, utensils, and equipment (whether the smae are or <Col N="518" /> are not fixtures) suitable for use in a creamery found in the premises in which such offence was or is being committed.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every seizure and forfeiture of goods under an order under this section shall be effected by the proper officers of the court and for that purpose such officers may break and enter the premises specified in such order and may use such force as may be necessary therefor.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the section.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I was not in the House on the occasion of the Second Reading of this Bill, but I may say that I put in an amendment, together with the two amendments on the Order Paper, suggesting that this Bill should be referred to a joint committee of both Houses for its further consideration, but in view of the Bill having got a Second Reading, that looked as if I were blocking its progress, and, although I think it was doubtful, the amendment was ruled out of order.  I wish to move the deletion of Section 4. That section, though it does not say so, is I think, in effect an extension of the powers given under the Creamery Act, 1928.  It is an amendment of Section 13 of the Principal Act which states:</P>
      <P>it shall not be lawful for any person to acquire, by purchase or otherwise, a creamery which at the time of such acquisition is being worked and carried on as a creamery or to establish a creamery in any premises in which the business of a creamery is not being carried on at the time of such establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other provisions of a kindred restrictive nature of that sort.  At no time was it an offence for a farmer to separate his own milk and make butter of it.  That was a practice which was carried out pretty <Col N="519" /> largely.  Some farmers, prompted, I think by traders in the butter business, started some small class of power separator where the milk of a number of farmers was separated.  Though that was not a creamery technically, by definition under the Creamery Act it came to be construed as a creamery. This section which I seek to delete gives most extraordinary powers to the Minister in the case of an offence under this section.  Not only may a person be fined, but the court may order the seizure and forfeiture of the machinery, plant and equipment suitable for use in a creamery.  My object in asking that this Bill be referred to a joint committee of both Houses was that less rather than more restriction should be required.  I very well remember that when the Minister's predecessor was putting through the Creamery Act of 1928, I privately suggested criticism to him in connection with the Bill, and he put it to me, as he put it publicly in this House afterwards, that he should be treated as the managing director of a very big concern, and given a fair chance whether he succeeded or failed.  I must confess that in view of the acquisition of a very large number of creameries and the establishment of the Dairy Disposals Board there was a great deal of reason in his contention at the time.  I wish to point out to the House and to urge on Senators that these restrictions should be lessened and not increased, because the condition of things then in the dairy industry was very different from to-day.  One fact was that the price of butter at the time was practically 80 per cent. more than it is now. These farmers who are utilising this method of separating their milk and making their butter are doing the work themselves, and doing it very economically, perhaps not quite as efficiently, but at a very much cheaper rate than that at which the creameries could do it.  I have very little doubt that this section is put into this Bill purely and simply for the reason that these small separators are able to pay for the farmers' supplies considerably more than would otherwise be possible. They pay more for the butter fat than <Col N="520" /> the creameries do.  Now these separating and churning stations are to be called illegal creameries.  Possibly they may be so by reason of the definition of the Dairy Produce Act.  But in effect they are not creameries.  They have none of the advantages from the Minister that the creamery has.  They do not get the creamery bounty nor the creamery subsidy, nor is their produce to be sold as creamery butter.  This is butter made by a number of farmers, and it is not and cannot properly be described as creamery butter.  Within living memory, in fact within my own memory, the Cork butter market was the greatest butter market in the world. That was its position at a not very remote period.  The merchants not only did a very big export trade with England, but they did a trade down the Mediterranean.  Tinned butter for ships' use was shipped by the Cork merchants.  That was sent to countries like India, Spain and China.  Cork butter, tinned and packed so as to secure it against a very high temperature, went to every part of the world. Cork, because of the creameries, has gone down as a butter centre, but there is still a very considerable butter trade left in Cork, and this butter is being shipped to centres outside.</P>
    <P>By reason of Great Britain going off the gold standard other markets have been opened up.  These markets hitherto had been held by the Dutch, which had a very big business in that class of trade in past years.  Now some of those exporters are associated with the farmers who produce this class of butter made in so-called illegal creameries.  I hope the House will not give power to the Minister to make any restriction on that class of trade.</P>
    <P>As a mere matter of detail, I may say that I have in my safe in Cork a passport to America which was issued in the year 1913 or 1914.  Certain things happened then which entailed that I did not go to America.  Now I took out that passport because in the previous year very large quantities of Danish and Siberian butter had been sent to the United States.  I had an idea that I might open up this temporary market there for Irish butter.  At one time I traded largely in Canadian <Col N="521" /> butter.  The last Canadian butter I bought from Canada I sold it back to Canada with some boxes of Irish butter.  That was the class of trade that could be done by merchants and traders in butter but which the Irish creameries as constituted in this country will never do.  Some correspondence was sent me in connection with this class of trade.  I will not mention names but I will read for you the concluding letter of this correspondence. You must bear in mind that the Minister for Agriculture, through the Dairy Disposals Board, is, I think, by far the largest trader in the butter business in this country at the present time.  I am not complaining of that.  Circumstances have been such that the Dairy Disposals Board have not been able to part with the creameries that were acquired by the Minister's predecessor. I have no complaint to make of the trade or the manner of trading.  But it is a fact which this House should take into consideration in considering the Bill.  This letter which I am about to read for you was written by a firm in Cork.  It was written obviously to the person who tried to help a Cork firm. It is quite recent; it is dated the 8th August, 1934.  The letter says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,&mdash;I thank you for yours of the 7th.  The Irish Department of Agriculture have refused to do anything other than their previous decision. The position is that these people are direct sellers themselves and do not want anybody to do business direct, as success by a private individual in finding alternative markets would not be to their credit where they themselves have failed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not giving this letter in full. Obviously the person to whom this letter was written failed to remedy the grievances from which the person who wrote it had suffered.  The letter goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My firm is not further interested, as trying to do business in conjunction with the Irish Department of Agriculture is practically impossible.  On account of the drought in the States, Reeves&rdquo;&mdash; Reeves, I may say, is a very big multiple shop trader in New York&mdash;&ldquo;had an ideal opportunity of putting <Col N="522" /> Irish butter on the market with success.  His trade is 30 tons a week and he told me during dinner, which I had at his house, that two years ago he was in Dublin and got in touch with the Department whose treatment of him was such that he left in disgust.  It seems a pity to me that matters of this kind should be so badly handled. Thanking you for your interest in the matter and also for your courtesy in New York, and hoping at some time to have the pleasure of renewing your acquaintanceship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the letter of a trader who feels aggrieved at the treatment meted out to him.  Yet it is sought to give the Minister further powers.  If the Minister came out honestly and said that there should be no trading in dairy produce, except through the avenues permitted by the Ministry, I could understand it, but I cannot understand why, at the present time when the market is restricted and when alternative markets are very urgently wanted, any restrictions should be put in the way of those who are permitted to carry on the trade.  There was a considerable amount of talk last night when it was even suggested that the Minister might trade in cattle.  He is trading largely in dairy produce.  As I have said I have no particular objection to his doing so, but I do object that any further restrictions should be put on private trading.  I would ask the Seanad to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that I never made or never sold a pound of butter.  It is perfectly true also that I have never been interested in a fair. I could not tell you the difference between a &ldquo;tangler&rdquo; and a &ldquo;blocker&rdquo; who, we are told, attend fairs.  My general feeling would be in favour of the producers of cattle and if there is anything that would make me more interested in them it is the fact that my friend, Senator Counihan, would not listen to me when I suggested that I might be taken into that &ldquo;ring&rdquo; of his which apparently can make money very easily.  This question of the manufacture of butter is very important for the small farmers in the <Col N="523" /> south of Ireland.  I am not an expert in this business and I do not claim to be, but I have followed the history of the butter trade in Cork for a long time.  We had, as Senator Dowdall knows, a very fine trade at one time in Cork.  It was killed very largely&mdash;and I think the Senator will agree with me in this&mdash;by our own indiscretions and to a lesser extent, perhaps, by our own dishonesty, but we were dishonest not at all to the extent that people say we were.  We were, however, fools enough to proclaim that we made extremely bad butter and that it contained an undue proportion of moisture.  In those days there were a number of people very enthusiastic in the cause of creameries and they took advantage of our attacks on the butter we made ourselves, with the result that they destroyed the export of what was then known as farmers' butter, which, according to Senator Dowdall, who is an expert in the business, was bringing in 80 per cent. more than the creamery butter of to-day.</P>
      <P>I have been in Holland and I have seen the very wonderful farms which they show to tourists going there but I have also seen in Holland cowsheds and other places and if they existed in any part of the Free State, I think the Minister would very properly come down upon their proprietors as heavily as the law would permit him.  We are inclined to show up our own shortcomings. We sometimes go a little too far, perhaps a bit beyond what we deserve.  It is a dangerous thing to give a handle to anybody to suggest that the goods we turn out are not the best in the world and I would point out to the Minister that he is running a serious risk in this way.  The creameries have been producing an admirable commodity.  Whether it will improve the position of creamery butter if it gets around, as it is getting around to-day in this country, that a great deal of the cream that is used in the making of creamery butter is collected in a travelling creamery as set out here in the Bill, remains to be seen.  I am dead against travelling creameries.  Their object is to gather&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I am interested in is that there are small creameries which turn out what we know as farmers' butter.  Farmers' butter is flavoured in the same way as what is known as Danish butter.  I believe it will not keep as long as creamery butter but it is, when freshly used, a more palatable butter than our creamery butter.  This butter is turned out in the very remote places which are inaccessible to creameries.  As Senator Dowdall has told you, the price it has commanded is very much in excess of the price of the butter turned out in creameries. The cost of manufacturing this butter is ½d. per lb.  If I am right the cost of manufacturing a pound of butter in a creamery is 2d.  Am I right in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>That, in itself, is a very big consideration.  As I say, this trade is a remnant of our former trade in Cork.  It was a pity, in my opinion that it was ever put aside.  It could have been reformed.  Many people hold that it could have been reformed and that it would have been a more valuable asset to the country than the butter trade is to-day.  I claim that it is quite wrong to prevent these <Col N="525" /> small farmers from setting up their own little creameries but, of course, I am perfectly satisfied that they should be watched in the most strict way. There is an obsession, it would seem, in the Department, started a long while ago by Sir Horace Plunkett, that all milk produced in this country should be turned into butter in a creamery and not in the farmer's house.  I would ask the Minister, in all the circumstances, to make an exception of these small creameries and not force these people out of business. In addition to forcing these men out of their own trade, you are putting out of business a great number of butter merchants in the City of Cork who, as Senator Dowdall will tell you, have, in spite of all that has happened to the butter trade, continued to keep up their connection.  I am not quite so sure as to England, but I am quite satisfied that along the littoral of the Mediterranean, Cork butter is still put up and it goes there in very considerable quantities.</P>

      <P>If the amendment is carried or even if it is defeated it will not have any bearing upon the arguments of either the mover of it or Senator Crosbie.  If there had been an amendment to repeal Section 30 of the Principal Act, then the speeches would have been appropriate; but as it stands, the section which is sought to be amended is a section which attempts to make the Principal Act effective.  I cannot understand the case made in support of the amendment, because it would not achieve the ends for which either of the Senators is arguing.  The Minister has found that the Principal Act cannot be effectively enforced because of a defect, and the amendment, if it were successful, would enable persons who are disobeying Section 30 of the Principal Act to go on disobeying it.  It would have no other effect.</P>

      <P>Although I dislike altogether this regulation, I admit that there comes a time when you have to accept it and make it work whether you like it or not.  I think that the time has now arisen.  In the case of the creameries you have a lot of capital sunk and a great many districts <Col N="526" /> rationalised and I think you must accept the principle inherent in this new form of controlled marketing. Although I dislike the regulation intensely, I realise that it would jeopardise the whole thing if you do not work on those lines.  I think this is a case where individual liberty has got to be sacrificed.  In view of the principle involved I could not see my way, much as I sympathise with the amendment, to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Johnson is quite right when he says that the speeches of Senator Dowdall and Senator Crosbie are really directed to the repeal of Section 30 of the principal Act.  This Bill seeks to make the principal Act effective from the point of view of the small group of people who are not carrying out its provisions and whom we cannot get at properly owing to a trick of theirs.  The main object of the Act of 1928 was to consolidate the dairying industry.  A considerable amount of money was spent at that time buying out proprietors and handing the business over to co-operatives. The Minister was given power to license creameries in future so that we would not have the position of one creamery starting up against another in competition, with big losses being incurred during the fight for supremacy. Eventually, when one creamery would go out the price of milk would go up in order to make up for the loss. Nothing would be gained for the farmers; on the contrary, a good deal would be lost because all the creameries would have to pay for the losses sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1928 Act sought to prevent undue competition, price-cutting and so on and fully £500,000 was spent by the State buying out proprietors and handing the creameries over to co-operatives. The Minister for Agriculture has power to issue licences for establishing creameries, but in practice no licence has been issued to a proprietor. Licences have been issued to co-operatives and to the Dairy Disposals Board where they are organising districts with the intention of handing them over to co-operatives as soon as possible. Within the last year there have been <Col N="527" /> what are called joint dairies put up, principally in the County Cork.  These are supplied with milk by the farmers. The milk is separated into cream and then butter is made and it is sold as farmers' butter, not creamery butter. These particular institutions have no licences, though they should have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is where they are joined together, and it becomes a factory.  Surely it cannot be said that the farmers are making their own butter when 100 of them come together, do the separating and make the butter? It is really a factory.  These people know very well that they should have a licence.  There are four of these men&mdash; of course they are not farmers at all&mdash; who are Cork butter merchants. Senator Dowdall is not one of them. They came to me some months ago asking permission to set up those joint dairies.  I said I would permit them in districts where they would not compete with existing creameries.  I told them to make application to me, and if they selected a district that would not interfere with existing creameries, a district that would be miles away from a creamery, I would assure them that they would get a licence.  They sent up a list of places, and afterwards in one of those places they established a branch which, of course, proves conclusively that these men are at the back of the whole thing.  But we have no proof legally that they are, and that is what we want this Bill for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment we cannot deal with them.  We cannot serve a notice on them because they are working in a very clever way.  The farmers bring in their milk, do the separating themselves, and they make the butter, and <Col N="528" /> then it is sold to one of those Cork butter merchants.  We all know who the owner is, but in law we do not know.  We want to make Section 30 of the Principal Act effective so far as these people are concerned.  We are asking permission in this section, instead of serving notice on the owner, to serve it by pinning it on the door, just as the Dublin Corporation can do where they cannot find the owner of a condemned house.  In such a case they serve the notice by pinning it on the door.  If the owner appears in court the summons is amended, but, if he does not appear, then the order is made for the house to be demolished.  We are following exactly the same procedure. If the owner appears in court the judge will amend the summons, and the owner can put up his defence.  But we have to go through the court to show that these places are established in contravention of the 1928 Act.  This Bill will have the effect of making the owner appear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is he has no licence. I do not say that we would give him a licence where he is competing with an existing creamery.  As a matter of fact we would not give him a licence in this case.  I met these men and I told them that I would be very glad if they would develop certain areas where there were no creameries.  They did not choose to do that.  They went to districts where creameries were established.  If you have 700 suppliers to a creamery, and if these people come along and secure 100 of these suppliers, obviously that is going to do harm to the existing creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the figures that were given by Senator Crosbie, that there was a difference of between 2d. and 1½d. in the price.  These particular men may do it for 10/- per cwt. which is a little over a penny.  The average cost of creamery butter is from 18/- to 20/- per cwt.  That works out at about 2d.  The difference is between 1d. and 2d.  Why should not these men be able to give a better price for milk? It is true that they are getting no <Col N="529" /> bounty or subsidy.  If we give the bounty and the subsidy to a creamery to export butter, the butter that creamery sells on the home market gets as good a price as on the export market, because the price the home market gives is the export price.  It is the same as if we had one creamery exporting all the butter.  The creamery that sells all the butter at home gets the same price.  It gets the price that the value of butter on the foreign market is raised to by the bounty and the subsidy.  By selling at home these people get the advantage of the bounty and the subsidy.  They do not need a subsidy or bounty when they sell at home.  The creameries pay 3½d. at home by way of levy.  The other concerns pay nothing, so that it is easy for them to give the farmers a better price.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the effect of carrying this amendment would be to give these merchants a free hand to expand their activities to other creamery areas, and inevitably, in the course of time, the creameries could not continue to pay the levy and we would have to drop the stabilisation plan.  In that case creamery butter exported and sold at home and all other butter, would fall in price by the difference which there is between the levy and the bounty by about 24/- or 25/- per cwt.  All butter would fall in price if we dropped the stabilisation plan. Undoubtedly the stabilisation plan cannot succeed if this practice goes on, because these men can work their way gradually into creamery districts, having the advantage of 3½d. per lb., which they are not paying.  I am aware of the letter that Senator Dowdall quoted.  That merchant applied to us for permission to export butter to foreign markets.  We said that we would give him butter to develop that market at 5/- per cwt. less than the price of Australian butter delivered in London, in order to compete with Australian or similar butter in markets outside British markets.  Obviously when Australian or New Zealand butter can be got at a certain price in England, they will not sell their butter in any other market at a less price.  We were <Col N="530" /> going to give this particular merchant an advantage of 5/- per cwt.  He was not satisfied with that.  Now, we have a letter quoted in the Seanad saying that the Government want to keep all the business for themselves.  The Dairy Disposals Board purposely kept out of foreign markets in order to give existing merchants any opportunity there is to develop these markets.  We also give them the advantage of 5/- per cwt.  Four merchants in Cork availed of the offer and are getting butter 5/- per cwt. less than the quoted price of Australian butter in London.  They sell whatever they can in certain foreign markets outside the British markets.  The merchant that Senator Dowdall has referred to was not satisfied with these terms.</P>
    <P>Senator Crosbie also referred to Danish butter.  I would not like the Seanad to get the impression that we in any way prohibited creameries making butter on the Danish plan. Danish creamery butter is made from ripened cream, while our creamery butter is made from unripened cream. We do not prevent creameries making butter from ripened cream.  They may make butter on the Danish plan if they like.  Senator Crosbie spoke about the difference between farmers who make butter in their own homes and those who have it made in the creameries.  That is not the issue. The issue here is that of unlicensed creameries making butter against licensed creameries.  Unlicensed creameries are really treated as factories now because they are only selling factory butter.  In reply to Senator Sir John Keane's remarks, we are not, by any means, coercing the minority.  We are only making the working of Section 30 of the Principal Act effective in the case of a small group of Cork merchants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures given by the Minister cannot be accurate.  This association of farmers can produce butter 1d. per lb. cheaper than the creameries and can compete without a bounty or a subsidy with butter from the creameries.  I do not stand for everything in the correspondence but I will refer to it again:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" />&ldquo;Dripsey Dairy has paid a higher price to their suppliers than local creameries, although subject to levy and only getting bounty on factory butter; and as this butter was sold through our factory levy was paid on it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement was not accurate.  This butter is not sold in Ireland.  Some of it may be sold here, but the bulk of it is exported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It gets the bounty so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>It gets the factory bounty.  That is a very different thing from the creamery bounty.  Notwithstanding that, it is able to hold its own and to give the farmers a better return for their produce.  If the House in its wisdom wishes to put restrictions on farmers getting more for their produce, then I say it is going against the interests of dairy farmers.  I am willing to withdraw this amendment subject to this: that the Minister tells the House if he is prepared to have a Joint Committee of both Houses, or of the farmers of either House, to go into the working of the Dairy Produce Act, the Creamery Act, and this Bill. Otherwise I will force it to a division.</P>

      <P>I cannot answer the Senator definitely on that point.  I do not know the districts sufficiently well. They might go within five miles of a creamery.  I told them that if they suggested certain places we would examine the question to see where we could allow them.  I suggested places where we were about to build <Col N="532" /> creameries, and asked them if they considered doing it instead of the Department, but they did not.  Another thing is that they appear to put up these creameries to compete only against the co-operative creameries.  There are proprietary creameries in County Cork but none of these were put up to compete with proprietary creameries, only against co-operative creameries. With regard to what Senator Dowdall said, I see no objection to setting up a committee such as the Senator suggests.</P>

      <P>There is a feeling amongst those farmers that the creameries have been assisted at their expense, and that to a great extent they have been neglected both by the present and the previous Government. The Minister has stated that the creameries should not be erected near existing co-operative creameries.  That appears to me to be a very sound suggestion. I know one of those creameries, and it is a considerable distance from any existing co-operative creamery.  It is fairly near a proprietary creamery.  The farmers have the option of going to the proprietary creamery.  They have gone to the newly-established creamery and have got a considerable increase in the price paid for milk.  I understand this creamery adopts a new system of separation.  They do not find it necessary <Col N="533" /> to heat the milk before separating it, and in that way considerable expense is saved.  I am very pleased that the matter is to be left to a committee, and I hope that the result will be that some arrangement will be come to whereby those creameries which are established and have no licence at present will receive a licence from the Minister.</P>

A manufacturer at times, perhaps, from being overbusy, or perhaps for other reasons, may ask another manufacturer to do some work for him, but he does not like to have the other manufacturer put his own name on the stuff.

      <P>With regard to Section 51, a matter arises on Section 50 which is continued in Sections 51 and <Col N="538" /> 52.  Section 50 entails that a register must be kept of all oats and barley purchased on the premises, etc., and of all dispositions of such oats and barley.  Section 51, sub-section 4, says that any person may obtain a copy of any entry in any register on payment to the Minister of the fee of 1/-.  I think that is open to objection and I would suggest that on Report Stage he should insert some amendment to the effect that it should be proved to the satisfaction of the Minister that a person has a valid interest in obtaining such information, because, otherwise a trader, interested from a competitive point of view, might obtain particulars of another trader's business and of the prices that other trader was either paying for his stuff or getting for it&mdash;to the detriment of the trader whose register was kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if the Senator examines the section closely he will find that under Section 50 we ask the manufacturer to keep certain records and make certain returns.  Under Section 51, we must, if the person pays the fee and complies with whatever other regulations there may be, give certain information from the register&mdash;not from the records or returns, but only from the register.  All that is contained on these registers is the name and address&mdash;just sufficient to identify the person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to Section 58, the Minister there is fixing prices in respect of each class of home-grown barley&mdash;the minimum price, in terms of a rate per hundredweight, and on the basis that such barley is to <Col N="539" /> be delivered at the premises of the purchaser to be paid by registered oat and barley dealers, and so on.  Now, what is the real meaning of that?  How does that apply to general business and everything of that kind?  I should like the Minister to tell us how his fixing of that minimum price is going to affect general barley markets.  That is the information I should like to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it is only maize-millers, oat-millers, and manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs that must buy from the registered dealer.  The registered dealer must pay the fixed price, but nobody else is forced to do so.  For instance, if a man buys oats to sell for the use of racehorses, he is not bound by the fixed price.  Neither is the maltster.  It is only grain that is being passed on to the maize-miller, the oat-miller, or the compound feeding stuff manufacturer which is affected.</P>

      <P>No.  The market price might not be high enough.  The Minister has to bear several things in mind &mdash;a price that will induce farmers to grow more grain, if possible, or at least to keep in tillage what there is already.

      <P>I take it, therefore, that if the market price for barley and oats is kept up to a figure that the Minister considers reasonable, such a price as will encourage people to grow barley and oats, there will be no reason for the Minister to interfere, and the two prices&mdash;the fixed price and the market price&mdash;may amalgamate?</P>

      <P>But supposing the market price for barley was 12/- a barrel, and that a farmer felt the Minister was likely to fix his price at 16/- per barrel, surely that man will not sell to Jameson's at 12/-?

      <P>That may be so.  But the Minister, when he fixes a price, will surely have a very considerable influence on the market, as Senator Wilson has pointed out.  The market price for barley may be 12/- a barrel, but if the Minister says that he is going to fix <Col N="541" /> the price at 15/-, then I suggest the fixed price will become the market price, so that in reality the Minister is going to be a very important competitor in the grain market.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 59 to 66 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 67.</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks proper, by order (in this Act referred to as a sale (composite flour) order) do the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  prohibit the sale by any holder of a milling licence of wheaten flour unless under and in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister under this Part of this Act; and</P>
      <P>(b)  do any of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  prohibit the sale, by any holder of a milling licence, of any flour of which wheaten flour is a component part unless such flour is composed of wheaten flour and not less than the percentage of oaten flour for the time being fixed by such order, or</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 67, sub-section (1).  To delete paragraph (b) and to substitute therefor a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  order that every master baker shall purchase oat groats or milk powder in such quantities as the Minister may prescribe to be used in the wheaten flour in all bread manufactured by him.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister will have any difficulty in accepting this amendment.  The Minister is stipulating in this Bill the mixture that millers are to use in the manufacture of flour but they fear that this mixture may not keep.  What they propose is that they should take a quantity of milk powder and oats proportionate to the quantity of wheaten flour they buy.  It is really a distinction without a difference, and I trust the Minister may see his way to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the administrative point of view it would be impossible to accept this amendment.  Secondly, the amendment would not have the same effect at all as the provision in the Bill with regard to the using up of oats and dried milk, if the necessity for that arose.  It would be practically impossible, I think, to see that the bakers used milk powder.  It is an easy matter, in a way, to see that the flour millers do so.  You can find that out from an examination of their books both as regards the amount of dried milk that comes on to their premises and their output of flour.  There is a very complete record kept of the output of flour in each mill.  It is easy to see the amount of dried milk that goes in, and to ascertain that the proper proportion is used.  Flour can also be tested chemically from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very difficult, I am afraid, <Col N="543" /> to have all the small bakers registered as they would have to be registered, and to have them properly controlled and supervised.  The amount of inspection required would be enormous.  The number of flour mills in the country is small, but the number of bakeries is very large.  The big objection that I have to the amendment, apart from the administrative difficulty, is that only about one-third of the flour that is used is bakers' flour, and two-thirds of it is household flour.  The household flour would not contain either the oaten flour or the dried milk.  It is with the dried milk that I am more concerned at the moment, because I am doubtful if the occasion will arise, for some years, for mixing oat flour.  We would, therefore, only be able, if this amendment were carried, to use one-third of the dried milk that we would otherwise use.  That, of course, would make the Bill, in a way, to a great extent ineffective.</P>
    <P>Senator Crosbie said the objection had been raised that the flour may not keep.  Much more has been done in other countries in the way of carrying out experiments than has been done here.  That is so in Germany.  I am told that the Germans have discovered a remedy for the trouble as regards the keeping quality of the flour.  I am not able to say that for certain, but I am told that is so.  If the Senator will look at Section 66 he will see that &ldquo;the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, may by order make regulations prescribing the standards to which milk powder must conform&rdquo; and so on.  We may carry out experiments during the next six months to see what is the amount of moisture and perhaps the amount of fat, and so on, that dried milk can contain while not injuring the flour that is being mixed with it, if the flour is to keep for some time.  As a matter of fact, we are experimenting to some extent at present on the making of bread with dried milk.  We have not done any considerable experimenting as regards the keeping qualities of the dried milk in the flour, but we mean to carry out experiments.  We would certainly not bring this part of the Bill into operation <Col N="544" /> until we were quite certain, as the result of experiments, that we had got a dried milk that would keep in the flour.  The Senator may feel quite happy on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the setting up of a tobacco advisory committee and I draw attention to the matter because it has given rise to a good deal of misunderstanding amongst tobacco growers in the country.  I think it well to give the Minister an opportunity of explaining it.  I understand <Col N="545" /> that this advisory committee will consist of representatives of manufacturers and that they will deal only with the disposal of tobacco when it has left the rehandling station, so that neither the growers nor the rehandlers have any reason for representation on this committee.  Growers throughout the country do not understand why the committee is limited to manufacturers and they approached me to ask why no representatives of the growers were on it.  I think I am right in saying that this committee will deal only with the disposal of the tobacco when rehandling is finished, but I should like the Minister to say if that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite right.  When the tobacco is catalogued under Section 38, which comes later, the Minister for Industry and Commerce makes a sale order under Section 40 and distributes that tobacco amongst the manufacturers. This particular advisory committee is to advise the Minister as to how the tobacco should be distributed amongst them.  As far as growing, curing and rehandling are concerned, these three processes are in the province of the Minister for Agriculture who has power under the Agriculture Act of 1931 to set up an advisory council for any purpose he thinks fit. It is quite possible and, in fact, quite probable that the Minister for Agriculture will have an advisory council under this Bill.  That advisory council will consist of growers, curers and rehandlers and manufacturers would not be represented on it at all because they would have nothing to do with that part of the business.</P>

      <P>This deals with the fixing of a minimum rate of wages for employees in the rehandling stations. In the case of co-operative rehandling stations, the rehandlers may be the growers, or representatives of the growers, and it may happen that the same man or men may be employed for one part of the year in the field on the cultivation of the tobacco, and at another time of the year, in the rehandling station, and it seems to me that a good deal of discontent may arise if a man gets a low rate of wages in the field because the farmer or grower is unable to pay him the same rate as he would get in the rehandling station.  Further on in this section there is a provision that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, may, if he so thinks fit, establish an advisory committee to advise him in regard to the making of orders and that this advisory committee shall consist of workers at rehandling stations and persons representing the employers of such workers.  It may happen that the employers of such workers may not be the growers, so that the growers are left out altogether.  A certain amount of discontent may arise in a district on account of this section, and I think the growers should be included.  Would the Minister accept an amendment to add after the words &ldquo;persons representing employers of such workers&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and growers or representatives of tobacco growing societies or associations&rdquo;?</P>

The Senator's suggestion is that there should be two sets of rehandlers' representatives, one representative of rehandlers who are not growers and another representative of rehandlers who are.  That would, I think, be quite an impossible thing as an administrative proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">

      <P>The majority of them are. I hope in time that they will all be co-operative.  I think if the Seanad understood how this matter arises they would perhaps see why it is worded in this way.  The Trade Board Acts, 1918-1919, already apply to the manufacture of tobacco.  As the order stands, we were informed on legal authority that the rehandling, even the curing and growing would come under the Trade Board Act, so that there would be a fixed wage for the men while attending to the tobacco in the field.  When a man would leave the tobacco field and go to work on the wheat field he would be paid the ordinary agricultural wage, but he would be paid the Trade Board wage while in the tobacco field.  This amendment was put in to exempt the growing and curing of the tobacco from the operation of the Trade Board Act.  Rehandling, as it comes more within the industrial side than within the agricultural side, should really come under the Trade Board Act.  As the majority of the rehandling stations are co-operative naturally there would be representatives from the board, so that the growers will have representatives any way.  They will not have all but they will have some at least.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the section is not worded in this way the industry will be brought in under the Trade Board Act. The Trade Board is doing the same thing in a different form.  The Minister fixes on the advice of the Trade Board. If you leave this out the probability is that the rehandling station would be brought within the tobacco trade board and even the curing stations may be brought in.  But this particular provision leaves the curing outside the purview of the trade board system.  It is a kind of <i>via media</i> in respect of the rehandling part of the tobacco industry. Instead of leaving rehandling within the Trade Board the Board would recommend the Minister to fix the minimum rate which would be operative. This leaves the matter with the Minister if he thinks fit after consultation with the Advisory Committee.  It is a little less definite and perhaps a little more effective than the Trade Board would be.  But it is acceptable in its present form and it is not by any means a departure, for there is a Trade Board already for the tobacco industry.</P>

      <P>Section 33, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;Provided always that fifty per cent. of the price payable to the grower under this Part of this Act shall be paid on account by the rehandler to the holder of the grower's licence within seven days after the determination of such price.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of complaints by growers throughout the country that the rehandlers do not pay them quickly enough.  In one case of which I heard the man sowed his seeds under glass early last year, subsequently transplanted the plants, cleaned them, weeded them, cured them, and gave them over to the rehandler, but he did not get paid until July of this year.  The farmer in this country is not used to that. The farmer is accustomed to getting ready cash for his crops or for his produce.  The only produce for which he does not get ready cash is milk. In that case I believe there is a <Col N="551" /> system of monthly accounts, and he gets paid from the creameries or the big distributers here in Dublin every month.  That is the only product for which he does not get paid cash.  I think it is only fair that the rehandlers in this case should pay at least 50 per cent. of the cash to the producer within seven days of the determination of the price.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I had not time before these amendments were put in to have a conference with the tobacco growers in my part of the country, but I have had since and they are unanimous in the opinion that the price, as fixed is altogether inadequate.  That fact makes this amendment even more important.  The price was fixed on last year's crop which was a record one, grown in a record year.  The crop is a very different one this year. It has been seriously affected by the drought and still more seriously affected by the storm of a couple of weeks ago.  In fact a good many crops were completely destroyed.  The farmers' financial condition does not enable him to wait for a very long time for his money especially in the adverse circumstances of this year, and I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  I have a letter here from a tobacco grower which bears out what Senator Staines has said. He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In addition to the low price, it is also very serious for the farmers if they are left out of their money&rdquo;&mdash;he is a Munster man and uses the Munster idiom&mdash;&ldquo;for another six, eight or, perhaps, 12 months, if they are compelled to hand it over to a rehandler who need not pay them until the crop is finally disposed of.  In some cases last year's crop was not finally paid for until July of this year. Farmers are now in such low financial circumstances they should be paid for their crop when it is cured enough to be rehandled or sold to a manufacturer, that is, in November or December of the year in which the crop is grown.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> That is a very serious handicap considering that the crop is an exceedingly precarious one and liable to be damaged by storm.  In fact, it is a crop that is altogether unsuitable to this country.  It is like wheat in the fact that it is only in very good years that it can be grown at all.  I would certainly urge on the Minister to accept the amendment.  Under the whole Bill, the grower is made the Cinderella. The rehandler, the manufacturer and everybody, except the man who grows the tobacco gets a big pull out of it.  He is the last person considered in this Bill.  All the circumstances are against him, and I think that whatever he makes out of it, he should not be kept waiting for nearly a year for it.  There should be some time limit, and as the amendment suggests, 50 per cent. of the money should be paid to him within seven days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The manufacturer, as a matter of fact, is not getting anything out of this Bill because it is definitely laid down that the manufacturer must pay the same price for Irish tobacco as he would pay for imported tobacco at that particular time&mdash;that is, imported tobacco of the same quality.  It is an inspector appointed by the Minister for Agriculture who determines that quality.  If my inspector has an optimistic opinion of Irish tobacco I think he will make the manufacturer pay all right for it, so that the manufacturer gets nothing out of it.  The rehandler will get whatever the Minister for Agriculture prescribes.  He cannot charge whatever he likes.  He must charge what the Minister prescribes from year to year.  If the rehandler gets more than his due, it will be the fault of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the circumstances which Senator Miss Browne has mentioned&mdash;the farmers having a crop and the storm injuring it&mdash;I think that we must have growers who are good growers&mdash;I mean above the average. <Col N="553" /> These are the only growers who will survive in the growing of this crop as in the case of every other crop.  After all, if you have a certain price for oats, barley or wheat, it is only good growers who can hold out and continue growing these crops.  The men who do not know how to grow oats, barley or wheat, who sow these crops in unsuitable land or under wrong conditions, do not survive. They have to give it up.  The very same thing will apply in the case of tobacco.  Only the good tobacco growers will survive Those people who do not pay any great attention to the crop will have to drop out because they cannot make it pay.  As a matter of fact, some growers to whom I was speaking before the Bill was drawn up said that the price was going to give them as good a return, or even a better return, than the crops I have mentioned&mdash;oats, barley or wheat.  We cannot give very much more than that because the acreage is limited.  It would be very unfair where there are selected people to whom that limited acreage is given to give them a very big advantage.</P>
    <P>Coming to the amendment itself, I do not see how it could be made effective.  If Senators will remember the discussion we had on the Second Reading of the Bill, they will recall that it was pointed out that when the tobacco is sent by the grower to the curer and the rehandler it is graded into different grades.  The rehandler does not know at that stage what price he is going to get.  He grades it into A B C D and E grades.  He may have a fair idea of what he is going to get then but he does not know definitely.  The tobacco has to be rehandled, it has to be packeted, catalogued and sent on to the manufacturer. At that stage the price is fixed but at the time the rehandler receives it he does not know what he is going to get.  He does not, therefore, know what 50 per cent. of the price would be, for one thing.  Another difficulty is that I do not know how we could enforce this amendment.  Suppose the rehandler were paying 50 per cent. and he said that the tobacco was eventually going to make 6d.  He <Col N="554" /> would then pay 3d.  I do not know that we would have any power to argue the matter with him because at that stage neither the Minister nor the manufacturer could say definitely whether in six weeks or two months' time, the price of imported tobacco might not have fallen below the figure it was fetching at that time. Apart from that I know for a fact&mdash; several growers have told me&mdash;that every grower is being circularised by rehandlers.  I think the grower is in a position therefore to make a very good bargain with his rehandler.</P>
    <P>If we were to stick strictly to that 50 per cent. he would probably get more than the actual 50 per cent.  The rehandler would naturally pay on the lowest grade because he would say: &ldquo;I do not know, but this may be the lowest grade before it leaves my premises.&rdquo; Under the other arrangement, they are likely to give more because they are competing for the tobacco. No grower need send his tobacco this year or during the coming years to any rehandler without getting an advance on it on receipt.  There was a different position last year.  When growers sent their tobacco last year to a rehandler, there was an element of chance about it.  The rehandler proceeded to rehandle the tobacco but he did not know whether there would be a market for it or not.  The manufacturer was not compelled to buy tobacco from the rehandler.  There was no guaranteed market.  There is now.  The rehandler knows definitely that he can dispose of his tobacco to the manufacturer.  That should make it possible for every rehandler to get a good advance from his banker on the stock on hand.  If the banker knows that the tobacco is going to be sold to a manufacturer within six weeks or two months&mdash;that the manufacturer has no option but take it&mdash; I think that the rehandler will be able to get an advance from his banker and that he will be able to make an advance on receipt.  Last year, he could not do that because there was no certainty that he would be able to dispose of the tobacco.  That made it impossible for him to get any great <Col N="555" /> advance from the banks.  This year, I think he will have no difficulty in that respect.  It would be, in my opinion, impossible to implement this amendment.  I should like to see the growers get an advance but I think that they will get that advance in the ordinary course of events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  The amendment only asks for an advance of 50 per cent. of the estimated value.  Even if the price of tobacco falls, it will not fall to that extent.  The farmers are handicapped at present by want of capital.  They find it very difficult to get money from the banks, whereas the rehandler, who will have a stock in hands, can easily get an advance from his bank and pay it to the farmers, who badly need it.  The Minister says that the rehandler will not have any difficulty in raising the money on the stock he holds.  I think that the amendment is very reasonable and, even if the Minister does not accept the percentage of 50, I think he should provide for the advance of some percentage of the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly urge this amendment.  The price for rehandling at the stations is I understand 5d.  Did I understand the Minister to say that the rehandling stations are competing for the grower's crops and offering him advances on them?  What about the position in South Wexford?  The only rehandling station there is far removed from the place where a great deal of the tobacco is grown.  There should have been another rehandling station there.  The pioneer growers have not got the rehandling station they should have got.  The societies which rehandled tobacco last year have been favoured by the Minister.  These are enthusiasts, inspired by ignorance. They do not know what they are doing. The Minister may say that the pioneer growers did not apply for a rehandling licence in time.  That was because they knew what they were doing and they wanted to consider the question. The others rushed in.  As fools rush in where angels fear to tread, the ignorant rush in where experienced <Col N="556" /> men would not.  There is one rehandling station in Wexford, at a very considerable distance from where most of the tobacco is grown.  Will Wexford growers have to send their tobacco to Kildare or Meath instead of sending it to the station in Wexford?  If the Minister objects to 50 per cent., let him fix upon some figure which will be of definite help to the farmer in paying the expenses of the cultivation of the crop.</P>
      <P>The one attraction about beet is that money is advanced by the factory.  If that had not been done, the Government could not have got contracts filled for these new beet factories.  The Minister does not seem to realise the position in which the farmer is&mdash;that he has no cash and cannot pay his wages.  A crop like tobacco takes a lot of weeding and handling.  One is never out of the field from the time it is sown until it is harvested.  It is not like other crops, where you lock the gate after sowing them and trouble no further.  Tobacco is a constant expense to the growers.  The price this year is very small, indeed, and a number of farmers are going to lose heavily.  In some cases the tobacco crop has been destroyed and in others it is very poor. I hope that Senator Staines will press his amendment to a division.</P>

      <P>From what the Minister said about tobacco growing in Ireland, I should have thought that Senator Staines was appealing to a judge who would be very much inclined to give him a favourable verdict.  I was almost frightened out of my life when <Col N="557" /> I heard the Minister say that he was going to make it necessary for every resident in the Free State to smoke Irish-grown tobacco.  If he wants to get such a state of affairs as that, the one individual he has got to make a pet of is the grower of tobacco.  This claim that the grower should get a portion of his money fairly quickly represents a good commercial principle.  The growers of practically every other crop get their money practically on the nail. Those who buy grain pay for it at once. I feel that what Senator Miss Browne says is correct&mdash;that, for some reason or another, the rehandlers do not give the growers the money within reasonable time.  A great many of these growers are pretty hard up.  There is evidence that the growers have to go to the banks.  They have to pay interest on the money they receive from the banks and, to get the money, they must be persons of exceptionally high character.  What Senator Counihan suggests is, I think, right&mdash;that the Minister should think this matter over and see if there is not some means by which the grower would get portion of the money advanced to him fairly quickly.  That is a necessity in the agricultural situation of the present time. A man who has his crop ready needs the money for it.  The Minister, evidently, wants to help tobacco growers. I do not think that he can do that in any better way than by taking steps to give the growers some part of their money as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the rehandlers are making offers of advances on the tobacco, and I know that some of them are offering the full relative value.  As soon as they have the tobacco graded they will give what in their opinion is the value of that tobacco.  The amount kept back is the amount of subsidy that would be payable afterwards.  I do not see any point in what Senator Jameson says&mdash;that some growers have to go to the bank and pay interest on money borrowed. It is quite obvious that the rehandler in some cases has to get money from the bank, and charge interest to the grower also.  They are offering a good deal more than 50 per cent., and I think it <Col N="558" /> is a case where the Seanad is inclined to go in too much for regulation. Sometimes if you go in too much for regulation it is bad.  Free commerce in a case like this is better than too much regulation.  I think the Seanad should be careful about going too far in that direction.  Where you fix a minimum price, in nearly all cases it becomes the maximum price.  If we say the rehandlers must give 50 per cent., that is the maximum they will give.  They are offering more at present, and we should not stop them from giving more.  It would be a great mistake, I think, to put in this amendment.</P>

      <P>The growers go to those who give the best terms.  Now, with regard to the point raised by Senator Miss Browne, about the freight on tobacco from Wexford to a rehandling station, the freight from Wexford to Navan is only 12/6 per ton, so that the freight really makes very little difference compared with the cost of a small rehandling station.  I think our object should be to have as few rehandling stations as possible so that they could be worked as cheaply as possible.  At the moment we have to pay 5d. a lb., and we hope to reduce that by at least 1d. a year until we get to 2d. per lb. It is only the large rehandling stations that will eventually be able to carry on at 2d.  Every time we cut down the rehandling charge by 1d., it goes to the growers.  In the interest of the growers, nobody should advocate a large number of rehandling stations.</P>

      <P>Judging by the discussion that took place on the last occasion that this Bill was before the House, everyone admits that it was very well received by all parties.  It was received unanimously by the Opposition Party.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment in the same spirit.  If he does, it will promote what we want most in this country, unity, concord, and peace.  It will do away with the bitterness of the Civil War.  The sooner that bitterness disappears the better.  Most of the amendments standing in my name are, so to speak, levelling up amendments, to give the same rights to people who fought for Ireland before the Civil War, and who took no active part in that conflict, as are given to those who took part in the Civil War.  As I stated on the Second Reading, Cumann na mBan were just as useful and did as much solid work for Ireland in the Insurrection and in the Black and Tan War as the five other bodies mentioned in the Bill.  All are justly included.  In order to be fair to all I am asking that Cumann na mBan should be included.</P>

I want to point out, however, that the same test of service will be applied to women as was applied to men and that that will result, in my opinion, in very few being granted an active service certificate.  If the Seanad inserts this amendment, I propose on the Report Stage, to move a further amendment to the Bill which will have the effect of ensuring that while members of Cumann na mBan are treated equally with men, they will not be treated better.  If the officers of Cumann na mBan of nominal high rank were treated in the same way as officers of the Volunteers there would be a very big discrepancy, because their responsibilities were not as great.  I propose to <Col N="562" /> introduce an amendment to make it clear that if a member of Cumann na mBan was in charge of 100 other members, or was senior in rank to a person in charge of 100 members, or members of the executive, that person will be treated as Rank D; that is a £10 a year scale, and below that in seniority will be treated in Rank E. It means that no member of Cumann na mBan will be graded higher than Rank D.  I think it is only fair to say that while Cumann na mBan had a national organisation, they acted as auxiliaries to the local units of the Volunteers or I.R.A.  I think that will meet the case.</P>

      <P>The Act applies to some persons who are not drawing pensions because they were late in applying.  As there are only a few concerned it is only fair to put them in.  If the word &ldquo;applies&rdquo; remains in the section it will prevent them applying.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, the Bill, as a whole, is not drafted in such a way that it applies to anyone to whom the 1924 Act applies.  That Act is still there.  This section is worded in this way in order that we might not now have to re-try the 25,000 cases that applied under the Act of 1924. We do not want to have to re-try all these cases again, and to put these people to the trouble and expense of applying again.  They would apply if they thought there was any hope.  The Act of 1924 still covers people governed by it.</P>

      <P>I know they were late. The last Government had seven years to deal with the matter from 1924, and under the terms of the Act they had power to prescribe the time within <Col N="564" /> which applicants could apply.  They extended it for one or two periods, and, I take it, that they would have extended it still further, as there was power to do, if they thought there was any particular reason for doing so.  The Bill is still there, and if a case was put up to the Government, and proved home, they could extend it if they so wished.  That Act is still there and covers late applicants, if there are such, but no representation has been made to the Government.  I have been in the Department of Defence for 2½ years, and no case was put to me, beyond a passing reference by Deputy Cosgrave in the Dáil.</P>

There are only a few cases as far as I know.  Some men went to Canada and were away two years, and when they were eligible to apply they neglected to do so.  Probably some did not know about it.  There is very definite hardship in these cases. One man was away on a vessel.  That particular man happened to be blown up in an ambush before the time of the civil war.  I suppose he would be eligible for a wound pension but he does not seem to have applied for that either.  He writes to me now to see if I can get him a pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>The amendment was drafted to meet the case that was put up for granting pensions to men who took part in the Easter Week rising only or men who took part in that and continued through the Black-and-Tan war and whose service ended then. The second part is to meet the case of men who had continuous service during the last four months of the Black-and-Tan war from 1st April to 11th July, 1921.  If a man had active service during that period then that can be counted as service during the Black-and-Tan war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Staines' amendment, I think the Senator who is sitting on his left can give him some information as to the breach that that amendment would open.  The Senator wants a pension to be given to anybody who &ldquo;served in the Forces and was engaged in or gave assistance <Col N="569" /> in military activities during the period commencing on the 23rd day of April, 1916, and ending on the 1st day of April, 1920.&rdquo;  The first thing is that they gave assistance.  That is a pretty wide term.  Everybody gave assistance; the whole population gave assistance.  The second point is that the Bill, with Senator Robinson's amendment, is providing for people who took part in the Easter Week rising or who served continuously during the last four months from 1st April, 1921, to 11th July, 1921.  Then if they had any additional service it will count for pensionable purposes.  I do not think that the Senator ought to press his amendment in these circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a year more in the Bill than in Senator Robinson's amendment.  If the dates are made the same as in the Bill, I shall accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this there are two qualifying periods.  One is Easter Week 1916 and the other is the last four months of the Black and Tan war. There was a third qualifying period under the 1924 Act&mdash;that was from 1st April, 1920, to 1st April, 1921, but in addition to service during the Black and Tan war the men had to have a civil war service.  I think that a man who had that year's service during the Black and Tan war and who did not continue should not get a pension.</P>
      <P>If his active service was interrupted by imprisonment, or breakdown in health, it counts for pension purposes; it does not count as an interruption of his services.  But if he gave up before the truce I do not think he is entitled to pension because of his service solely during the Black-and-Tan years.  The critical periods are contained in the amendment moved by Senator Robinson, namely, the period of 1916 or the period commencing 1st April, 1921, and ending 11th July, 1921.  If a person did not serve continuously between one of those periods I do not think he is entitled to a pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 5, I think it is desirable that the Seanad should realise at this stage the position of the referee.  He has tremendous powers. Under the old Act there was a board of assessors, consisting of one person who had had either judicial experience or was a barrister, assisted by other persons who, as it happened, were members of the Government at the time.  Under this Bill, a referee is to be appointed, and not a board, and he is to be assisted by an advisory committee. I think it is desirable the Seanad should realise the position of the referee.  He will be asked to examine claims that are referred to him and the Minister may make rules regulating his procedure.  He may deal with matters almost privately, certainly in camera, and there will be no publicity. He will be awarding £400,000 a year for a period of 30 years, or £12,000,000 roughly.  When the referee has made his report the Minister is bound to issue a certificate.  According to a recent judgement, if I understand the position rightly, wherever a certificate is issued there will be no alternative but to grant the pension. <Col N="571" /> I am calling attention to this because I want to lead up to an amendment of mine later, to make the House realise how great the powers of this referee will be.  He will have to decide an expenditure of, perhaps, £12,000,000 over the next 30 or 40 years.  If the period be 40 years the amount will be more.  The power of this referee will be greater financially than almost any other person in the State.  He will, as things are, be the sole custodian of the material upon which he bases his report to the Minister.  The Minister will then have to issue a certificate and the Minister for Finance will have to pay the pension.  I am calling attention to this matter as a preliminary to an amendment which I will move later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Johnson is basing his amendment on the interpretation of Section 10, he will find he will have to change his view.  The Minister is not bound to issue a certificate. The recent court decision was that if a certificate is granted a pension cannot be refused, even though to the ordinary person the section of the 1924 Act would seem to imply the Minister had that power even though the certificate was granted.  But under the section here the certificate is issued by the Minister, not by the referee, or the board of assessors under the 1924 Act. &ldquo;Where it appears from a report under this Act that the person to whom such report relates is not a person to whom the Act applies, the Minister shall refuse to grant to such person a service certificate.&rdquo;  It is in the Minister's discretion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  &ldquo;Where it appears from a report under this Act that the person to whom such report relates is a person to whom this Act applies, the Minister shall, subject to the provisions of this section, grant to such person a service certificate.&rdquo;  That is, if it appears to the Minister.  If it is a fact that the man had the necessary service the Minister will give him a certificate.  The referee frames his report after having heard the case of the <Col N="572" /> applicant in the presence of the board of assessors.  The board will contain two members appointed by the Government, one appointed by the Minister for Finance, and one by the Minister for Defence; so that the full facts of the case are known to two Government Departments whose nominees are on the Board.</P>

      <P>Sections 6 and 7 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister shall refer every application for a service certificate to the Referee and thereupon the Referee shall investigate such application and make a report to the Minister thereon in accordance with this section.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every report by the Referee on an application for the grant of a service certificate referred to him shall contain findings on the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(b)  if the Referee finds that the applicant is a person to whom this Act applies&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the service period during which the applicant served in the forces, the particular military body or bodies (being part of the forces) in which he served during each such service period, and the duration within each such period of his service in each such body, and</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2).  To delete line 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter I am not so sure about.  The section is to the effect that the Minister shall refer the application <Col N="573" /> to the referee, and the reports of the referee shall contain findings on certain matters&mdash;that is to say, whether the applicant is or is not a person to whom the Act shall apply, and if the referee finds he is a person to whom the Act applies, then the report shall find certain material, such as the period of service and the grade of rank.  These would appear to be important matters, upon which the referee would have to report.  Then comes the question whether under paragraph (3) the Minister would prescribe other matters under any of the issues.  It may be said that inasmuch as this paragraph (3) follows paragraphs (1) and (2) in the manner implied, it is ancillary to the previous paragraphs, but I am doubtful about that, and I am wondering whether this does not give the Minister power to prescribe matters upon which the referee shall report, quite apart from what is in the section.  Does it give him a free hand, or must those things which he shall prescribe be supplemental to and illustrative of the service and grade?</P>

      <P>That sub-section was put in so that when the referee's report would come up, the person reading it would have a fair indication of the things upon which the referee bases his report, favourable or unfavourable, and from that point of view there are certain other things to be considered, even apart altogether from the administrative point of view of checking up upon the referee's work&mdash;there are other reasons, and I should like to see other reports in detail; that is, from the historical point of view.  There are things that would be very costly to repeat, and it would be a good thing to have a list of these things throughout the country.  That would be a good thing upon which the referee could report.  It does not take away in any way from the applicant's rights.  The referee reports on the service periods and the grade of rank in the forces. Those are the vital things from the point of view of granting a pension, but then, in addition to that, from the point of view of administration and of history, I think it is only right that other things should be prescribed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 9.  To add at the end of the section the words: &ldquo;provided that nothing in this section or any other section of this Act or of the Act of 1924 or the Act of 1925 or the Act of 1930 shall be construed as limiting in any way the duties and powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General as defined by the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922 (No. 1 of 1922) and the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act, 1923 (No. 1 of 1923).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that in coming to the amendment to Section 9 I must refer to Section 10 and the Minister's statement just made.  Whatever may be the position of the Pensions Act of 1924, Section 10 provides that when the referee has reported that an applicant is a person to whom the Act does not apply, then the Minister shall refuse a service certificate&mdash;which is obvious. But when it appears from the report of the referee that the person to whom such report refers is a person to whom the Act applies, then he shall grant a certificate, subject to the provision in the next sub-section which gives him power to refuse to grant such a certificate if a court of competent jurisdiction has sentenced the person to imprisonment and so on.  So that, once the referee has reported in favour of the person, the Minister has no option but to grant a service certificate, and then, as I understood the recent judgment, once the service certificate is granted, the pension must follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9, which I seek to amend by an addendum, provides that the findings of the referee shall be final and conclusive and binding on all persons and tribunals whatsoever.  That is taken out of the previous Military Service <Col N="575" /> Acts, but there has been read into that a meaning which debars the Comptroller and Auditor-General from fulfilling his functions as the Auditor-General as appointed in accordance with the Constitution.  The Constitution provides for the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and requires that he shall examine every Appropriation Account on behalf of the Dáil.  It lays down that he shall be appointed and shall audit all moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.  That is a Constitutional provision and the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act follows it up by indicating and requiring that in the examination of such expenditure he shall ascertain whether it is for the purpose of such accounts that it has been intended to provide.  The findings of the referee under this section, as under the previous Act, are stated to be final and conclusive and binding on all persons and tribunals whatsoever. The question arises whether this is an amendment of the Constitution regarding the Comptroller and Auditor-General; whether it can be effective as against the constitutional provision, or whether the Minister or the Ministry&mdash;this or any future or past Ministry&mdash;has power to deprive the Comptroller and Auditor-General of the material on which he can conduct his audit.  This matter, of course, was discussed pretty fully before, and a provision of this kind was inserted in a previous Bill, but I do not think it closed the matter completely, and I am seeking to make it clear that, notwithstanding this reference to finality against any tribunal, that does not and should not debar the officer of the Dáil, who has to audit on behalf of the public the accounts of the administration, from examining the accounts and reporting upon them to the Dáil. Therefore, I am asking to put in the proviso that nothing in this section or in any other section of the Bill or in previous Acts shall be construed as limiting in any way the powers and duties of the Comptroller and Auditor-General as defined by the Constitution Act or the Comptroller and Auditor-General <Col N="576" /> Act.  If he had not those powers under these Acts then there is nothing of any importance in this.  If he had those powers that I maintain he had by constitutional authority and by practice, then these provisions could not be held to override the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I pointed out earlier how great is the power that is being conferred on the referee.  This means the expenditure over the next 30 or 40 years of anything from £10,000,000 to £12,000,000. Nobody, I think, is in a position to give the exact figure, but at any rate it is going to mean the expenditure of a very large sum of money over a very long period, and, as I have said, even the Minister is deprived of power as against the referee.  The Minister said that he will have the assistance of the members of the committee to be appointed by the Ministries.  That is true, but they have no power as against the referee.  They cannot override the referee even by a majority. The referee is the decider in this case. Further, one has to bear in mind that the tendency, the inevitable tendency, I think, of such a tribunal would be to be favourably disposed towards the pensioner or applicant.  I am not objecting to that, but I am concerned about the danger of this kind of provision coming into our legislation depriving the audit authority of the power to audit thoroughly the expenditures of the State.</P>
    <P>My amendment would apply not only to the pensions under this Bill&mdash;I make that frank avowal&mdash;but to the pensions granted under the other Acts, and if it were ever thought necessary it is intended to reinstate the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the position that he was placed in by the Constitution and by the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act.  When the departure from those Acts was made there was a certain tension, perhaps a feeling of a partisan kind, that may have caused the Ministry of the time to take the action they did.  I think that is past, and consequently it is very desirable that these reassurances should be inserted in this Bill to the effect that this provision shall not be taken as over-riding either the Constitution <Col N="577" /> or the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act.</P>
    <P>I would again point out that there are numerous Superannuation and Pension Acts which provide that the decision&mdash;in our case it would be that of the Minister for Finance, and in the period before the Free State was established it was that of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;on these matters shall be final, but notwithstanding the finality of the decision of these authorities it has always been recognised, and recognised up to date, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General in these pension and superannuation cases has the right, and is clearly allowed, to examine into the basis of the grant. It is on that precedent, as well as the Acts, that I seek that this amendment should be inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to this amendment being accepted, and I certainly have no desire to restrict or circumscribe in any way the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. There is this point that I would like to put to Senator Johnson.  Within the past few years we have had civil servants of various grades going before the High Court seeking authority to get a larger pension than that which the Minister for Finance wished to give them.  In one case that I know of the court upheld the contention of the applicant.  Does Senator Johnson wish to contend that the Comptroller and Auditor-General can reverse the opinion of the High Court on such a matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson is anxious that nothing in this Bill or in any previous Act should debar the Comptroller and Auditor-General from fulfilling his functions as auditor.  As a matter of fact this section does not debar him from doing that.  What it does is this: it prevents him from assuming, or from having imposed upon him, functions which do not properly <Col N="578" /> belong to an auditor.  Nothing in this Bill debars the Comptroller and Auditor-General from seeing the certificate and satisfying himself that the referee had, in fact, reported, first of all, in favour of the applicant, secondly, that his rank was so and so, and thirdly, that his years of service were so and so.  In my opinion the function of the auditor would be to satisfy himself on these three points: (1) that the referee had decided that the man was entitled to a pension; (2) the rank of the applicant, and (3) what was his period of service.  With the information under these three heads before him the Comptroller and Auditor-General will be able to calculate the amount of pension that the man is entitled to.  He can see that he was paid that sum and no more.  If we were to put on the Comptroller and Auditor-General the function of retrying a case that had already been tried by the referee and the Board of Assessors, then I am afraid he will want a very much increased staff.  It would mean that he would have to sit in court, as it were, and re-try every case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Dowdall has very properly pointed out, Senator Johnson would not dream of conferring on the Comptroller and Auditor-General the power to rehear a case that had been tried by the High Court.  I am afraid that, taking into account the nature of the circumstances, we will have to trust to the discretion of the referee; we will have to trust him to see that he will give a favourable award in a good case and turn down a bad one. Certain powers are being conferred on the referee to enable him to do that. He is not an absolute dictator.  He is appointed by the Executive Council, and in order to see that everything goes well certain other men will be appointed.  A board of assessors will be appointed with him and you will have a representative of the Department of Defence there.  You will have two members appointed by the Government who will be supposed to see that every applicant gets a fair crack of the whip.  The representative of the Department of Defence will be supposed to see that the Act is carried out fairly <Col N="579" /> all round and you will have a representative of the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance accounts are not being audited, neither are the two members appointed by the Government or the referee himself.  They have nothing to do with the money.  They have to do with the granting or refusing of a certificate. That is not altogether correct either, because they have to do with the making of the report and it is the Minister who grants the certificate.  If it appears to the Minister, under Section 10, that the person to whom such report relates is a person to whom the Act applies, the Minister shall grant him a certificate; and if it appears that he is not such a person, the Minister shall refuse to grant such person a certificate.  The Minister will have plenty of information as to whether the referee is acting fairly or unfairly, and once the referee makes a favourable report and that report is sanctioned by the Minister, if it is unfavourably reported on by any of the representatives of the Government, the Minister will have to go into the matter and satisfy himself that the report is carrying out the Act.  If all that is done, I think it would be imposing on the Comptroller and Auditor-General to put on him the function of retrying that whole case, and I do not think it is taking in the slightest way from his constitutional powers to prevent him even, if he so desired, from retrying the whole case.  He will have everything presented to him that will enable him to carry out his functions as auditor, but I think it would be unwise to put him in the position of an appeal judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will look up the debates in 1930 and the speeches of his predecessor he will see how closely they are in harmony with the speeches he has made to-night.  If he will read further in those debates and refer to the reports of the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts, he will see that the case I <Col N="580" /> am making here to-night is the case I have made since 1926 and in making that case I was backed up by the Minister and several of his colleagues. I think there is a complete misconception in the Minister's statement as there was in his predecessor's statement. The function of the Auditor-General is to audit the accounts on behalf of the Dáil, that is to say, the accounts of the administration, and to find out whether the administration, which means the Minister and his colleagues, through their staffs, have been carrying out the law and the requirements of the taxpayers' representatives. It is the Auditor-General, acting on behalf of the taxpayer and auditing the accounts of those people, whom the taxpayers appointed to administer their financial affairs.</P>
      <P>Senator Dowdall referred to the High Court case, and there again there was a departure from the principle which I am trying to advocate.  It was done as a result of an international agreement and there was a provision made that the decision of the High Court shall not be reviewable.  It was stated during the debates on that occasion, I believe, that the provision in that particular Act was intended to debar the Comptroller and Auditor-General from examining into the basis of the awards, but faulty as that decision was, there is this difference, that the High Court proceedings in these matters are public.  In this case the referee's proceedings will not be public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so stated in the Bill, but it will be the fact as it was under the previous Act, but public or not, the only point there is that there is a certain possibility of publicity and a slight bar against possible faulty decisions.  The Minister's only defence in this matter is that he has an official of his Department or other Departments who could report to him that the referee was acting unjustifiably and he could recall the referee or dismiss him at a particular point, but in so <Col N="581" /> far as the referee has acted up to a certain date, once he has reported in favour of an applicant, everything else follows and the tax-payers, unless they refuse to vote the sums in the following session of Parliament, have no redress whatever.  I think the Minister is ill-advised, and I think he should accept this as a matter of general public policy, as a matter of precedent, because this kind of thing is gradually being introduced into one Bill after another&mdash;limiting the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, which are very important powers indeed in regard to financial administration, and should not be lessened at all.  I am only asking that that should be understood.  These powers are not lessened by the adoption of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree altogether with Senator Johnson that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, in carrying out his duties, fulfils a very important function.  In ordinary democratic Government, he is an absolute essential if the people want to have an independent check on the Administration, but we do not call it limiting the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General when we take from him the right to retry any case upon which the court has given a decision and ordered the Minister or the Government to pay certain sums, whether by way of pension or otherwise.  If the court gives a decision, the Minister has to carry it out.  In this Bill, we are setting up, owing to the difficulty or assessing rank and years of service, a referee, assisted by a board of assessors, to find on those two points.  In the ordinary way, when a Bill has passed through the Oireachtas, if there are certain sums to be issued, they are issued by ordinary civil servants and the Comptroller and Auditor-General checks up on them, but we are not doing that in this Bill.  Instead of giving the complete administration of this Bill to the Minister for Defence, who will assign certain officials to look after all applications and to say: &ldquo;This man was a captain and this man a commandant, and they had five years and ten years' service, and we can grant them a pension on that,&rdquo; we are setting up a tribunal.  The principal <Col N="582" /> man in that tribunal is a person with the status of a judge.  I think most people will agree that that makes it a very different case from an Act that is administered by the Department.  We are not preventing the Comptroller and Auditor-General from satisfying himself that an award has been made by this tribunal or satisfying himself of the exact terms of the award.  We are putting him in a position to see that that award and no other is carried out by the Department of Defence, or by the other Department concerned.</P>

      <P>It would illustrate my point if I took a suppositious case. I will not say more than that.  A person applies for a pension and he states that the rank he held was (c).  The referee reports that the rank of the applicant was rank (a).  The difference between the pension payable to (c) and that payable to (a) rank is paid, say, for a period of 40 years.  As things stand, and as the practice of the Ministry has been, there is no power even to examine the claim made by the applicant as to whether the referee has gone far beyond what the applicant himself stated was his rank.  The position in the case of old-age pensioners is examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General when he wishes.  The position of a superannuated policeman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  From the very beginning.  He can examine the records if he wishes.  The position of the superannuated policeman is just the same and so is the position with regard to any other pensioner.  But we are now doing away with all that. We are putting into the hands of an independent person, a judge, if you like, a barrister if you like, powers which are almost absolute up to the point where the Minister is prepared to withdraw him from his appointment. I say if we are doing that without any safeguard raised against the possibility of defection, we are committing a mistake and one that may fall very grievously upon the State in the future.</P>

In the case of an application under this Bill, if the applicant claims, first of all, to have been, say, a battalion commandant with 300 men and more, he has to prove that he had these 300 men under his command.  Can the Comptroller and Auditor-General go down through the country, examine those 300 men, and say whether they were or were not under the command of the applicant?</P>
