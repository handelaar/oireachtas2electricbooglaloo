      <P>Before we begin to-day's business, I should like to consult the House as to the adjournment for the Summer Recess.  It should be possible to finish the business on to-day's Order Paper this evening, or tomorrow at latest.  The Dáil resumes again to-day, after its fortnight's holiday, and the length of time for which that House will sit before it rises for the summer is variously estimated at from a fortnight to a month.  I have consulted some Senators, and I suggest to the House that, as soon as the business of to-day's Order Paper has been disposed of, we should adjourn until Wednesday, the 22nd August.  By that date we shall have received from the Dáil whatever measures they have passed before the summer, and we should be able to deal adequately with them in a fortnight or three weeks. That is to say, we ought to be in a position to take the long adjournment early in September, and the probability is that the House will not then be called together again until November. Is that agreed?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak about this Bill but, on thinking it over I came to the conclusion that the University seats in the Dáil were one of the subjects dealt with in 1921 when the Treaty was made.  A small number of us who represented what were then known as the Unionists of Ireland were called into consultation the day after the Treaty was signed. We were asked to go to Downing Street&mdash;Lord Midleton, the Provost of Trinity College and myself&mdash;and we were then told by the British Government <Col N="1978" /> about the Treaty, which was read to us.  We were also told that the British Government could do nothing for the minority, that we had to make terms for the minority as best we could with the Irishmen who had signed the Treaty.  We acted on that information.  There were sundry meetings, to begin with, with Mr. Griffith, Mr. Collins, Mr. O'Higgins and, I think, Mr. Kennedy, who is now the Chief Justice.  Negotiations were then instituted for the establishment of the Oireachtas under which we are now governed.  We found that the signatories of the Treaty with whom we were in consultation were in favour of sundry things.  They were in favour of a Seanad and of having in it quite a strong representation of the minority.  There is no question that at that time what they had in mind was what you might call representatives of the old landowners, and of the business people of this country, who had held the view that the best thing was our association with the British Empire.  They held that those representing these classes who were prepared to take their part in the future Government of the Free State, under the new conditions, should be provided with means to enable them to state their views and to get representation here.  One of the main things they based that belief on was that they could give us that kind of representation in a Seanad in which there should be a strong representation &mdash;it would have to be by nomination &mdash;to enable our views to be put forward. We had also before us the question of University representation, and there was no doubt whatever that those who represented the Irish point of view, Mr. Griffith, Mr. Collins and Mr. O'Higgins, held the view strongly that in this country minorities should have very special means given to them to represent their views, and to have some influence in the government of the country.  There was no question whatever that all those views, as put forward and expressed to us&mdash;with which I need not say we agreed&mdash; were extremely loyally carried out by the Government of this country until the present Government came into power.  The Seanad was established <Col N="1979" /> according to the undertakings we had received, University representation was given, and the Dáil was constituted on the principles that we were told of.  That state of affairs stood until the other day.</P>
      <P>We are now face to face with a different state of affairs.  As far as I can see all the promises that were made by Mr. Griffith, Mr. Collins and Mr. O'Higgins are being swept away. I am sorry to say that I hold the view that the thing of importance to this country is not that we, ex-Unionists, are being swept out of representation&mdash;not at all&mdash;not that the Universities are being swept out of representation, but that we are face to face with a state of affairs when the Party at present in power means to dominate the whole situation and to dictate to the whole of the Free State what it is to do.  They are not merely putting out of business ex-Unionists, and the members for the Universities, but their whole effort is to put the political representatives of the people in opposition to them out of business.  On thinking the matter over, we have seen the powers of the law strained absolutely to the limit to put the representatives of the Opposition, if possible, into jail; and anyhow to use every means that a Government could possibly use to attack them and to prevent them from getting a free method of stating their case.  Let Senators think of the measures we have had here lately.  We had a Bill dealing with the constituencies, so altering them as to bring in a large number of three-member constituencies which, undoubtedly, will do away with the chances of Independent members, representing minorities, getting into the Dáil.  Then, we have a Bill at present before the House which proposes to take away representation which is also of an independent nature, University representation. Then, we had a Bill which, at the end of next year, will sweep the Seanad out of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the House just to consider what will be our situation towards the end of next year.  If the Government <Col N="1980" /> do favour the country with an opportunity of expressing its opinion and having an election&mdash;which they need not do&mdash;they will then have prepared the ground work, to give power to a solitary Party.  They will have a majority with the Labour Party or any other elements who will vote with them.  They can make any laws they please.  They can declare a Republic if they please.  They can alter the laws to suit their views and to deal with their political opponents, so as generally to establish a Party dictatorship in this country.  There is no use in our hiding these things from ourselves. This Bill about which we are now talking is only part of a great hoax.  What this country will be face to face with at the end of two years is the domination of one Party and one man at the head of that Party, with all that Party bowing in acquiescence.  There will be no man amongst them able to express his opinions unless he follows the dictatorship and the decisions arrived at by the Executive Council under the dictatorship of one individual.  What they intend to do I think the Minister for Finance clearly explained to us the other day.  I have been looking through what he said and I wonder if the members of the Seanad quite realise how far he went.</P>
    <P>Mr. MacEntee introduced something about the generations that have gone before us and the lesson we were to learn from them.  He said that &ldquo;the mass of the people are not prepared for the full acceptance of the Commonwealth.&rdquo; How generations before us could have anything to do with the Commonwealth I do not really know. The Commonwealth did not exist in their day so I think we might cut out past generations and deal with the matter ourselves.  He said that there was only one thing for all of us to do. We were &ldquo;to align ourselves with the majority of the people and stand upon the fundamental principle that our people must be free to choose for themselves what the relations with the Commonwealth are to be.&rdquo;  It never dawned upon me or upon anyone that there is any doubt at the present time about our freedom to effect any alignment we like.  When he came to talk <Col N="1981" /> about the financial condition of the country afterwards, the Minister used some extraordinary words.  This Minister for Finance of the present Government says: &ldquo;Perhaps the best way to settle it&rdquo;&mdash;that is the question as to whether we are to remain where we are to-day in our relations with Great Britain&mdash;&ldquo;is to put them&rdquo;&mdash;that is the people of this country&mdash;&ldquo;in the position of complete independence with regard to the Commonwealth and then let the people of Great Britain, on the one hand and we on the other, negotiate as to what our future relations are to be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the meaning of that sentence used by the Minister for Finance?  Does it mean that the present Government believe that the only way to end the economic war, and all the troubles under which we are suffering as a result of our quarrel with Great Britain at present, is to free ourselves from Great Britain and declare a Republic and then as a Republic sit down at a table with representatives of Great Britain to make future arrangements?  If it does not mean that, it means nothing.  If it means that, had we not better take into account the fact that this country after two years is going to be a Republic and that that is the only way that we can hope to succeed with agriculture in this country; that it means that until this is accomplished we are not going to have any effort whatever made to settle our troubles with Great Britain?  If that is so, what will be our financial position, not to mention the condition of our agriculturists, at the end of these two years?  I am coming strongly to the conclusion that the whole state of affairs, as it exists at present, is so absolutely ruinous to this country that, if we are going to have a Republic, if it be necessary for us to go through a Republican stage before the condition of this country can be settled, the sooner we get through with it and let the people really understand what a Republic means, the better.  It is sheer nonsense to talk about settling down here while we have pronouncements of that kind.</P>
    <P>We all know that it will take two years to carry any arrangement to get <Col N="1982" /> out of the Commonwealth.  Where will we be at the end of that time?  If our agricultural industry is to be handicapped as it is by present conditions for the next two years, our condition will be such that we shall not be in a position to argue our case.  Two years of the present method of carrying on our business will produce such a state of poverty as will not give us any chance of arguing.  We apparently will have no voice in this matter.  I have no doubt what the Seanad will do with regard to this University Bill.  It is only a part of the general scheme of the present Government to get sole power in this country entirely into their own hands.  They have told us that they mean to get a Republic and to get out of the Commonwealth.  Then they have the belief, which to my mind is the most extraordinary feature of the whole proceeding, that they can sit down at a table, after having flouted the whole British Commonwealth of Nations and cleared out of it, and make excellent arrangements with the head of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  If it is possible to imagine how most seriously to damage your chance of making good financial arrangements for this country, surely that is the best way of setting about it.</P>
    <P>I think Senators ought seriously consider, in the short time we have, how we can possibly in any way aid in these matters.  It looks quite evident that the present Government are not going to face the music and really carry out what they say they believe in.  They are not going to ask the country now: &ldquo;Will you go out of the Commonwealth and will you become a Republic?  Will you put us in the position which Mr. MacEntee says is the only way by which we would have a chance of settling matters satisfactorily with England?&rdquo; They are going to delay that certainly for a couple of years.  They are going on with their present policy and at the end of these two years we shall be in a wretched condition.  These are matters that I think the country should take well to heart.  We know the arguments that were put forward for the abolition of the Seanad by the President. We know what was said by those who opposed us.  We have seen the way in which the President made <Col N="1983" /> those arguments and I need say no more about that.  It is all on record and anybody can judge what weight there was in these arguments and the manner in which he was able to support what he said.</P>
    <P>This Bill before us is practically of the same nature as the other measures. It is quite evident that the Government have made up their minds as far as the Seanad is concerned, that they will not waste any time in giving any reasons for these Bills.  They have made up their minds and that is the end of it. Just listen to what was said here the other day by the Minister.  He put it quite shortly in this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government could find no reason why the Universities should get special consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister also said something about people being on double registers.  He admitted when I questioned him that he had no evidence whatever that any use was being made of that double registration.  We know a good deal about personation in this country but he repudiated the idea that University electors resorted to it.  The end of his argument was that he could see no justification for this special representation at all.  These are the main arguments which the Government bring forward for this special legislation which, going back to what I said at the beginning, is, in every single bit of it, an absolute repudiation of every promise Mr. Griffith, Mr. Collins and Mr. O'Higgins made to those who took up this matter with them at first at the request of the British Government.  If any of these three gentlemen were alive now, they would probably be as bitterly opposed to this policy as any of us could possibly be.  There is not a vestige of doubt about that.  I knew all three of the men intimately and I can say this for Mr. Griffith, that there is no man amongst us who was more desirous to let all the different people who live in this country have a voice in its management and of giving them an opportunity of being represented in our parliamentary institutions.  The whole policy of this Government, as shown in every measure that has been brought <Col N="1984" /> before us recently, is an entire repudiation of that.  I do not, as I say, object to-day as far as we ex-Unionists are concerned.  We have become so amalgamated and merged with the people of the country that nobody bothers their heads about whether we were Unionists at one time or not.</P>
    <P>We are part of the present composition of the Free State, and nobody dreams of throwing this kind of thing at our heads.  Therefore, it is not of importance as far as the ex-Unionist Party is concerned.  But it is a danger to see University and educational representation going, and it is a danger to see one Party trying to get such power into their own hands that they can disqualify from representation all independent thought in the Irish Free State.  There is also a tremendously strong inclination&mdash;I prefer to put it that way&mdash;on the part of the dominant Party to put their political opponents out of business.  That they will have the power to do that within the next two years is a point deserving of serious consideration.  I think we should make a great effort to compel the Government to tell us if it is their view that they have a better chance of making arrangements with Great Britain, and settling our future financial policy, by having a Republic and sitting down to discuss things as a Republic with Great Britain instead of as a member of the British Commonwealth. That is the vital question and one that is so important in regard to time that I think we should force the Government to come to a decision and let the country have their say.  If the country wants that condition of things, well, let them have it.  If we are to have a Republic, far better that the country should understand in this way and know that we are throwing away the opportunities that we have, and are manufacturing a dictatorship for ourselves instead.</P>

      <P>In rising to address the Seanad on this occasion, I do so because I have had a very long experience of the political struggle going on in this country.  I was on a different side from Senator Jameson during that struggle, but everyone will admit on <Col N="1985" /> reading the speech that we have heard from Senator Jameson to-day that it is one that we should all take to heart.  I have no projudice in favour of the Unionists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried, at one time, to become an undergraduate of a University. I sat for a Latin paper.  That Latin paper was Greek to me; and I came to the conclusion that the University authorities did not know a good man when they saw him and, therefore, I did not pursue my efforts to become a graduate.  But I would like to go a little into the history and conditions of our country.  It does not make very pleasant reading for any of us; there is a lot of it that we would like to forget.  Nevertheless, our Irish population is one that we should be proud of.  I am sure Senator Miss Browne would be better able to explain our origin than I am, but I believe we came from the Milesians, the Geraldines, and also, some of us, from the Danes.  At any rate we have succeeded in ingratiating ourselves with the outside world, and I think it is true to say that we are all kindly Irish of the Irish, neither Saxon nor Italian. However, it must be remembered that besides what I have mentioned there was a further addition to our population two or three hundred years ago. There was that dour, sour crowd that came along, known as a section of the Covenanters.  It was said of them that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They'd stop the children playing;</P>
      <P>They'd stop the horses neighing</P>
      <P>But not the asses braying</P>
      <P>For they lov'd the asses' braying.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, in the course of time, that temper disappeared almost entirely from our population.  If it was to be found in evidence at all, I would say it might be discovered amongst a small portion of the ex-Unionist section of our <Col N="1986" /> countrymen.  I think, perhaps, that while the Cathaoirleach had his attention distracted or, perhaps, while Senator O'Hanlon was taking his place, an interrupter came&mdash;though I am not a believer in the leprechaun&mdash;into this Chamber and made us a bit topsy turvy; for we find coming from the Irish Unionists speeches that are kindly Irish of the Irish, but from the super-Irishmen we come across instances of speeches that are un-Irish in tone and very little in keeping with Irish spirit.  We find some of them are violent without being effective and bitter without point.  I can quite imagine that if Cromwell himself were to be introduced into this Seanad his using the argument against our existence which we all heard lately used here.  We were told that there are 60 members of our body and that 45 of them are excellent reasons why that body should be abolished.  I think that is the kind of speech that should not have been made here.</P>
    <P>There has been, since I was a boy, great progress in medical science. They have discovered many new disorders that humanity is heir to.  Two such diseases have recently come into prominence.  One is the &ldquo;slave mind&rdquo; and the other is known as the &ldquo;inferiority complex.&rdquo;  The worst of these complaints is that the patient does not know he is suffering from them.  If so, the disorder is hereditary. Coming as I do from Irish plebeian stock, it is quite probable that I suffer from them myself.  I should like to explain that my grandfather was hunted out of the North 130 years ago because he was a Nationalist and a Catholic.  He came south and found refuge in Cork.  My father left school at 14 years of age to take up a lucrative job at a half-crown a week and he was glad to get it.  He never became what is known as a self-made man but he became a self-educated man.  Even among erudite people he was acknowledged to be learned.  Now, he always impressed upon me that it did not matter so much who a man was as what he was.  I am not trying to defend the Unionist Party in this House; I only find them, may I say, typical of their class.  If I tried to <Col N="1987" /> defend them they might well exclaim, &ldquo;Save us from our friends.&rdquo;  They require, in the public estimation, no defence, but I speak as I am speaking purely because of my concern for the honour of my country.  I have more than once spoken here and I think it might have been gathered from my speeches that my hope is that we should see this country prosperous. But I want her respected as she should be, and that she can only be if she honours her bond.  We have heard Senator Sam Brown saying that there were two struggles in this country; one was for self-government and the other was for the land.  For the greater part of my life I have been in that struggle and I always remember Parnell's famous statement during that struggle, that Ireland cannot spare a single man.  Good Lord, how surprised some of us would be if we were told in those days that we were Imperialists and anti-Irish! President de Valera himself stood in our ranks and he did not think he was a traitor or that he had anything to apologise for.  I would, indeed, feel that I was false to the memory of the Nationalist leaders in the struggles in those days, many of whom were my personal friends, if I countenanced a movement which aims at leaving the old Unionist Party voiceless in our popular assembly and leaving them disfranchised in our midst.  This Bill would disfranchise our Universities.  When we made a few converts in those days from the Unionist ranks how we rejoiced! Now, when they have come over in a solid mass, some of us have only taunts and jibes for them, trying to prove to the world that they are merely Englishmen camouflaged with the shamrock.  Being very indifferently educated myself I have the greatest admiration&mdash;again the slave mind I suppose&mdash;for those who are learned.</P>
    <P>In the greatest Republic that the world has ever seen&mdash;I speak of Rome &mdash;I admit they did not consider learning their greatest treasure and possession. I wonder somehow if Republicans in Ireland consider that the Constitution of the old Roman Empire would suit them.  I would like to hear <Col N="1988" /> something from them on that.  I suppose it would not because of their contempt for the Senate.  I would like to remind this House that their greatest possession, according to themselves, was the soldier.  It will be remembered that in the principal thoroughfare of Rome a great chasm or fissure was opened up.  They consulted their augurs and they were told that their greatest and most valued possession should be thrown into that chasm if it was to be closed up.  If it happened to us we would possibly send a gang of Corporation workers and they would do the work more economically than the old Romans would do it.  They decided that their greatest treasure was a soldier, and as they had to throw their greatest treasure in to close up their chasm they had consequently to sacrifice that soldier.  Personally I would consider one scholar worth a regiment of soldiers.  It may seem to some of you that I speak disrespectfully of soldiers.  Far be it from me to do so, but I consider the solid people of the country who do their work to be far more important than fighting men. Perhaps when we, too, get the Republic our soldiers will be equally appreciated and regarded as our dearest possession.</P>
    <P>I should, again, remind the House that it is not a long time ago since President de Valera said that an army was a superfluity in Ireland.  May I suggest that that was because he was not then in office?  I suggest that what Ireland wants are men of culture&mdash;not the apparent culture that goes with an Oxford accent.  The most cultured man I ever knew had a stronger Cork accent than my own.  The qualities that are associated with culture are character, knowledge and urbanity.  We have men of culture in the Dáil&mdash;if I may say so, on both sides of the House.  Some of these men do not represent universities. Surely, it cannot be suggested that we have in that assembly too many cultured persons.  I should, therefore, appeal to the Government not to perpetrate an Act which is a negation of the spirit which every genuine Irish Nationalist believed would typify a self-governing Ireland, which, in spite of all that has been said to the contrary, we have not enjoyed for two years but <Col N="1989" /> ever since the Treaty of 1922 was ratified.</P>

      <P>Coming in a little late and hearing Senator Jameson, I was somewhat puzzled as to what was exactly before the House.  It occurred to me that it was a special motion proposed by Senator Jameson dealing with the whole policy of the Government. But I was still puzzled as to what business was before the Chair and before the House.  When I sat down I asked my friend to the left what the business was and he told me that it had to do with the Universities Bill.  In the long statement that Senator Jameson made, I could find no trace&mdash;perhaps the failure was due to my density&mdash;of any reference to the business before the House.  The Senator took us back to the days of Unionism and dealt with Republics and many other things.</P>

      <P>With reference to Senator Crosbie's speech, I do not think that members of this House, or anybody outside it, care very much as to who my grandmother or grandfather was.  Consequently, I am not going to bring them into the debate but, in the very few words I propose to say, I hope I shall deal with the Bill and that I shall not be out of order.  Listening to Senator Jameson, one would think that this Bill was for the deliberate purpose of disfranchising Trinity College, when, in reality, it disfranchises&mdash;if Senators care to put it that way&mdash;the National University also.  They are both on the same plane.  I doubt if I would have interfered in this matter at all if we had not heard about the old landmarks being wiped out.  I think that it is time a great many of the old, historical landmarks were wiped out.  The representation of Trinity College and the National University is one of these. To my mind, it is a tremendous anomaly to have six representatives for about 8,000 voters.  I find that Trinity College has 3,260 voters and the National University has 4,655 voters. That is about 8,000 all told.  It would take a great deal to convince me that <Col N="1990" /> it is not an anomaly to give six representatives to 8,000 voters when, in a city like Dublin, only six representatives are given to over 100,000 voters. It would not matter so much if these University voters were genuine Free State voters.  That observation appertains more to Trinity than to the National University.  Many of those 3,000 voters of Trinity College are scattered all over the world.  They know nothing about what is going on here.  I venture to say that there are graduates who vote in the election for Trinity College who do not know who the President of the Free State is.</P>

      <P>I do not read it.  I have some friends who went through the National University and some who went through Trinity College.  At one election I received six letters.  If I had known that this Bill would be under discussion, I would have brought these letters with me.  They were to this effect:&mdash;&ldquo;Dear friend O'Neill&mdash; I understand I have a vote out of Trinity College.  Whom will I vote for?&rdquo;  That gives &ldquo;friend O'Neill&rdquo; six votes out of Trinity College.  The graduates all over the world know absolutely nothing about what is going on.  Is not that an anomaly? Is it not in accord with the march of progress to do away with such representation. To my mind, it is.  After all, if this matter be pursued to its logical conclusion, are there not teaching establishments in this country who do as much for education as and more for nationality than the Universities? Why should not those who have graduated, say, in the schools of the Christian Brothers, which are scattered all over the world, have votes?  But no&mdash;we are to leave the old, historical landmarks.  Because the Government are doing away with the anomalies which I have endeavoured to portray, they are held up in a disparaging way by Senator Jameson. I think that it is about time that these distinctions were abolished.  I congratulate the Government on the action they have taken in abolishing the franchise for University graduates who may be living in the North of <Col N="1991" /> Ireland or in England, or may be scattered all over the world.  It is absurd that these people should have a part in legislation in this country. I support the Bill and I congratulate the Government on setting their hand to the abolition of a great many anomalies that exist, of which this is one.</P>

      <P>A speech such as we have listened to is sufficient to make some of us despair.  It was an expression of text-book democracy, which reduces everything to a dead level and which, as a famous man once said, governs on the principle of counting heads, irrespective of their contents. Do let us try to bring a little commonsense and reality to bear on this problem.  I am not going to deal, except by reference, with the line that Senator Jameson, in his very able speech, adopted.  That is, that this University representation stands for a certain moral obligation as between those who brought the Treaty about and a minority in this country.  I realise that that sort of obligation cannot be stereotyped for all time. But where such an obligation represents, as it does in this case, a broad principle, which is enshrined in the government of many countries, a principle that yields something to learning and gives no substantial privilege, it should be respected.  I should rather deal with the astounding doctrine which is coming into the country&mdash;that quality does not count. Where, in any aspect of practical life, can you discount quality?  In government, in athletics, in business, in every single walk of life, the element of quality is vital.  Yet, according to some politicians who, like Senator O'Neill, claim to stand for progress, there is nothing in quality.  I wonder if Senator O'Neill wanted somebody to manage his business, would he go out on the street, take the first man he met and, because his vote was equal to that of any other man, take him in to manage his affairs.  Yet, when it comes to the affairs of the nation, no regard whatever is to be had for quality, ability, distinction, or any other qualification.  It is the <Col N="1992" /> popular will that is to choose.  We all know what the popular will is.  Go round the hustings, excite bitterness and hatred, promise things that you know cannot possibly be done; muddle the electorate with a lot of vague idealism and frothy doctrine, and then come back, after all that confusion, and say, &ldquo;We have a popular mandate to do this.&rdquo;  I cannot conceive how anybody who has any respect for his duty as a legislator or for the principle of government can stand for that.</P>
      <P>Serious statesmen never do that. What are the facts, and cannot we face facts?  Is not the popular will merely one of the elements in this thing that go to make up government?  We take the popular will as one element and one element only in this problem of government.  Any serious statesman who has any belief in parliamentary government, and who knows that business has to be done, cannot let the popular will run riot.  He may give lip service to it.  We all have to do that as politicians, but it is a different matter when a serious job has to be handled.  As politics that is all very well, of course.  But we have to get business done.  The popular will is only one of the elements which go to make up the whole problem of government.  Is there not the science of government? That is what I cannot get recognised by politicians.  You have got to harness to the science of government a certain political philosophy; certain basic rules to govern.  The aim ought to be to get the co-operation of the best men, having due regard, of course, to the fact that the majority will have the great, predominating say in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a great opportunity of bringing into counsel the product of learning.  I agree that learning is not everything by any means.  I am quite prepared to admit that you would find a peasant down the country who could give as shrewd a judgment on public affairs as the greatest scholar, but surely learning is a factor in the case, and particularly in this country which has a tradition of learning and is proud <Col N="1993" /> of it.  Here we have University representation which, in a rough and ready way, brings learning into counsel.  We are asked to sweep all that aside. Why?  Not in the interests of government but simply in the interests of power.  Because the product of learning does not give blind service to a party it is to be swept aside.  That is done for the purpose of securing a few votes, irrespective of the good of the country, the science of government or anything else.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Neill talked disparagingly of the influence, the microscopic influence, of University votes.  He referred to the voting power of our citizens across the seas.  Really it should make one blush with shame that any Irishman should be so narrow-minded and so parochial as to make a statement of that kind, especially when we claim as one of our greatest assets the heritage of the Irish race everywhere. We talk with pride of the Irish people in Australia, America and other countries, and yet we had that statement from Senator O'Neill because a mere handful of our graduates happen to be doing service across the seas. Who are the first to claim these people as being distinguished Irishmen?  Men like Senator O'Neill himself.  I am sure that he has done so on several occasions: he has spoken with pride of Irishmen who have gone across the seas and done honour to Ireland, but here because a handful of them have a voice in University representation he says it is an anomaly that should be swept away.  The Senator stands on some mathematical doctrine of text-book democracy which no country can stand up to.  For that reason I give my vote without the slightest doubt against this measure.  This House has never had a more solemn duty to perform than to stand for the representation, such as it is, of the learning that we have, for a representation which brings into the counsel of the State men who are needed above all to discount and leaven the docile following that forms the rank and file of the majority Party in the other House.</P>

      <P>I was very much impressed by the speech of Senator <Col N="1994" /> Jameson.  I hope that the Government will take a note of it.  Senator O'Neill argued that all the schools in the country had as much right to representation as the Universities.  People might be inclined to agree with him if he argued that the Academy of Music were to be given representation because its representatives might help to bring some harmony into our Assembly.  The Minister's principal argument in favour of this Bill was that University voters were on two registers and that they were enabled to vote in two constituencies.  That does not apply to the University constituencies only.  I know an agricultural labourer and his wife, and they have a vote in two constituencies. They live in a labourer's cottage, but they own a rood of ground at the other side of the road which happens to be in a different constituency to that in which they live.  There are plenty of other cases of the same kind.  These people cannot exercise the franchise in two constituencies.  As Senator Brown has pointed out, if they attempted to do so they would be leaving themselves open to a criminal prosecution.  Several statements have been made by supporters of this Bill, but the reason for its introduction is clear to anybody, I think.  Of the six University representatives in the Dáil four are opposed to the policy of the present Government.  That means a loss of two votes to the Government. It must be clear to every thinking man that that is the sole reason why this Bill has been introduced.  I ask the House to reject it on Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Senator Connolly who, with characteristic gall, attacked Trinity College has slipped away, because I had some pearls to cast before him.  This is the most tragic day in the history of all this disastrous republican government, when the island which gained a name and place for scholarship and contributed thereby to European civilisation has to be pleaded for, and when on its behalf an appeal has to be made for scholarship. This Bill is a direct outcome of the Government's narrowness, its ignorance of or disregard for the rich and honourable traditions of our <Col N="1995" /> nation.  When is this worship of mud going to end?  I do not think that it is altogether because there are a certain number of persons sure of election in the Universities (who, naturally being aware of history and even the rudiments of political economy, must be critics) that the Government wants to deny the Universities representation, wants to put out the eye of light, For it is part of the general policy of the worship of that &ldquo;Plain Man&rdquo; of which Senator Connolly is an advocate and which he alas!  so becomingly portrays, that this retrograde policy is continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new curse is come upon Ireland&mdash; one of the most sinister things that have ever happened to our country.  When this country was handed its freedom, can it not be said that the only use it could make of it was to cariacature the Irish character more than any stage Irishman cariacutured him, and to make idiotic mountebanks of the people?  This is the real curse: that Irishmen should accept as their portrait or as their image and likeness the poor specimen that the Government is only capable of creating.  To every decent Irishman there comes a crisis in his life: there comes a moment of misgiving, a moment of self-contempt, and this is what engenders it, when he is casting out from himself that unworthy impression of an Irishman to which he has been forced subconsciously to submit.  This is the fallacy which he has to set right within himself, for what we are really contending within ourselves is not Irish at all.  This explains why it is that nationality, so-called, seems for ever to be in conflict with civilisation in Ireland.  Why only in Ireland is there the apparent antithesis between patriotism and decency, not to mention prosperity?  We are all suffering from this most outrageous cariacature, from the most infernal image of stage Irishman ever invented, a monstrosity left to a republican government to nourish.  Since the outrage on Shakespeare caused by that bust in Stratford-on-Avon where you have him represented as a butcher-faced burgess, whereas he must have looked like Sir Philip Sidney, or Shelley, there has been no greater cariacature <Col N="1996" /> than this cariacature of the native so-called patriot raised up for worship by the native so-called republican government, a government that talks about liberty while it is taking away the most precious of our liberties, that of enlightened judgment in our own affairs.  This is the greatest cariacature except perhaps the Government's cariacature of a republic.</P>
    <P>Had the Minister for Education under the old Government proposed to us that education after the higher grade intermediate should cease to be vocal and that the Universities would not be represented in the country, it would be execrated as the most extraordinary outrage on our people&mdash;a blow directed against the nation's aspirations towards enlightenment and individuality.  I am told one of those tales that I am not in the position of proving, but, at any rate, the Party concerned can take the opportunity of denying it.  It is that this Bill is instigated by the Labour Party, not by Mr. de Valera, who is probably very proud that he is a graduate of the National University and prouder that he is an undergraduate of Trinity College, that it is the Labour Party who have asked that University representation should be abolished.  Now, if a gentleman from Liverpool came over under the old régime and said that &ldquo;I will make you so free that you can get on without intellect,&rdquo; he would be at once suspected.  We would have enough intelligence left to recognise his attempt as inflicting a grievance against the Irish people.  But Mr. Tom Johnson comes over from Liverpool and tells what is, presumably, a national Government that this country is to have no representation of its Universities, and nobody sees the farce of it. This is what I meant by this worship of mud: it is part and parcel of this new adulation of ignorance.  Soon stupidity will be so fashionable, so &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; that the country will be unable to see, much less to criticise; it will be blind and dumb and then it will be presented as being content. Mr. de Valera's Government could get equally the same results by a desert. We shall, presumably, have both when the bog is put before the brain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1997" /> Let us examine the character and figure of this &ldquo;patriot&rdquo; that the Government is endeavouring to erect. It is a figment of some vague indigenous idiot found in a bog like that &ldquo;old prophecy&rdquo; imagined as perpetually aggrieved, perpetually pitiable, perpetually a pauper, and what is worse, full of self-pity. It is to be understood that the moment he ceases to be a pauper he becomes a grazier, a farmer, a West Briton, or a public enemy of some sort to his country.  <i>Mar dh'eadh!</i> When he is, in reality, merely struggling to escape from despicableness, to escape from republicanism. This is the interpretation of the Irishman that is being raised up for us and which we refuse to accept, an image and likeness that is a farce, and an outrage on decency and self-respect, not to mention independence.  This is all the Government can envisage as an Irishman.  This is what the outcome of the Bill threatens to be.  The Government begins by putting out its victim's eyes and they are doing that because they dare not face any light that may shine in the darkness of the Middle Ages and desolation which they are deliberately and artificially producing in this country.  But all this has happened before in other times and places; if you do not see things <i>sub specie æternitatis</i> in a College, at any rate you are taught &ldquo;to see life steadily and see it whole.&rdquo;  Here is what the Labour Party sang in Cromwell's day:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We'll bang the Doctors out of doors</P>
    <P>And Arts, whate'er they be;</P>
    <P>We'll cry both Arts and Learning down</P>
    <P>So, hey then up go we!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yes, get rid of learning, and any form of specious prolixity will do for your dupes.  We have a specimen of it already in Senator Connolly's attack on Trinity College, where he says that he has heard newspaper men from all parts of the world&mdash;Moscow specially mentioned (his next hope) comment on the extraordinary political intelligence of the Irish people, and their grasp of public problems.  Now this is the kind of dishonest dope that will be handed out when there is nobody left to expose a fallacy.  Why should <Col N="1998" /> there be any problems for the Irish people, and is their extraordinary political intelligence to be measured by the amount of Ministries Senator Connolly wandered through in the last year?  This dodge of telling people they have intelligence when they would be put in prison for daring to exercise it if they had cannot go on for ever. Some time the Irish people will resent these mud-larkings of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Jameson asked why does the Government not declare a republic. The answer is&mdash;it would not pay them. There is no employment in the country so enjoyable as the exultation of a Minister with his income free from tax, and they will drift along like a bunch of Micawbers waiting for something to turn up, and hoping to catch a plank and come to shore on pieces of the wreck.  That is the reason they will declare nothing, not even a dividend, as long as they have their grasp of &ldquo;public problems.&rdquo;  You cannot have a nation satisfied to lose its claim to civilisation.</P>
    <P>Supposing the National University loses its vote and representation, and supposing that Trinity College loses its representation, will the privilege be handed on to the Communistic College which is still open in Eccles Street? Declaring a stage of democracy of which we know too well the meaning is part and parcel of the Communistic mind, wherein the plain man is worshipped for his plainness, it is quite easy for an ignorant dictator to take away University representation.  Can anything be put in its place?  My objection to, and my challenge to this Government are due to their utter incapacity to envisage a decent Irishman, or a comely form of life for an Irishman in his own country.  If they put their heads together they could not image a citizen with sufficient decency or education to maintain himself in any capital in Europe.  Dictatorship would be welcome if it were capable of envisaging a decent life, of giving every Irishman a chance, and respecting what is precious.  I was hauled over the coals for daring to say that the Government was making towards a tawdry dictatorship!  What else is it?  It is taking away the vote <Col N="1999" /> from the people who are capable of realising historical sequences and forming disinterested opinions.  It is all very well to say that you must merge Universities in the general franchise.  Where will anyone emerge in the commune that is coming?  This country could be run by a well-trained German town manager.  But lip service to the democracy by professional politicians has overburdened it with representatives of all kinds but the educated kind.</P>
    <P>The one detached vote that could be considered disinterested was the University vote.  In the University you do not get any slogans.  You are taught not to lose your head or to confuse emotions with arguments.  You get a chance of seeing what has occurred, in given circumstances, in human history.  When University representatives go into Parliament they are able to tell the people how such and such an issue is likely to turn out, how it fared before, and what was the result.  It would be far better for the country were there only four or six members, and if these were elected from the Universities, because the country would then be run by a tradition which would not be a parody on Irish life, but which would teach and uphold its proud history of being to Europe an undiminished light, of being an island of saints and scholars.  They would point to the fact that Ireland was the one country, when nothing was left in darkened Europe, wherein scholarship and learning were preserved. Instead of standing behind the Minister for Finance in some vague movements towards republics it would be far safer for Ireland to be represented in terms of its old historical character, and if none but University men were handling its affairs.  In any other walk of life, if judgment and technical excellence are required, you have to go through a certain course of apprenticeship.  But in deciding the destiny of a nation a barber can vote and can possibly cut the country's throat in one minute.  A doctor can use the knife only after seven years' apprenticeship.  But the people are asked from platforms to say quickly <Col N="2000" /> which is the winning card.  This is the last country in the world that should get rid of the vote in the Universities.</P>
    <P>If the intention was, as I very much fear, to reduce the country into a noncritical and ignorant electorate, naturally, this would be the first step to be taken.  The first step was to get rid of the Seanad, because it has people in it who are independent, and then to get rid of the University representatives, because they too are independent.  Then what do we get? We have nothing left but dictatorship. I do not mind dictatorship if it were wise and capable, and not a dictatorship of ignorant incompetents, such as we are threatened by, and such as we shall suffer from.  This is a most tragic day for Ireland.  Ireland is asked by a self-styled patriotic Government to hand over the gift of liberty, which it held to through centuries of blood and darkness; to hand its treasure to a so-called National Government, but which is, in reality, if you think of its members, a League of Nations, not one of them fit to be a companion of the average citizen of any nation in Europe.  They will turn, through this quest of outrageous &ldquo;liberty,&rdquo; this island into a second classical Coreyra. E Into a cesspool of undifferentiated stupidity.</P>

      <P>I think I have another argument why there should not be University representation, and it has been provided by the last speaker.  His opening and closing remarks were sufficient. I have listened carefully for some reason why Universities should get this special representation, and I have not heard it.  We were told by Senator Brown that it was quality of mind; that it was not education as such.  I drew attention to the fact that it was not education as such, and that in one University, at least, the candidates were selected on a Party political basis and that an attempt was made to do the same in the other University. Possibly if the University franchise is continued, that will be the case.  Senator Brown said it was quality of mind and not education as such that was <Col N="2001" /> to be considered.  The point really made by most of the speakers was that the minority was being disfranchised, or, at least, was not getting the representation which Senator Jameson said was promised at the time of the Treaty. At the time of the Treaty those who were Unionists were given to understand that they would get pretty strong representation in the Oireachtas.  Even if that was a written undertaking, I certainly say it was not one that was bound to be kept for all time.  In the last 10 or 11 years I think no one can deny that that particular section of the community kept one Party in power for some years.  They subscribed to their funds openly, voted for them consistently, and undoubtedly kept them in power.  I saw on one occasion, when the Government was put out on a vote in the Dáil, that they were told by their organ to demand the price to which they were entitled.  I dare say they did.  The Party with which they found such affinity of view will, I am sure, accept them in its fold, if they wish to go there.  I have heard no case made against this Bill, except we accept what the last speaker said, that all who do not represent Universities are to be treated as mud.  I think there is no case for special representation for Universities that could not be made equally well for other organisations, educational, commercial or industrial. If the time comes when a Second Chamber of that kind is to be set up, then there will be a case.  As things stand, there is no case for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there was a case at the time of the Treaty.  I quite understand, when a new Government was about to be set up, that there was a lot of anxiety on the part of ex-Unionists, that their interests would not be looked after or that they might be victimised.  I can understand that, at that time, they were anxious, and that the new Government was anxious that they should be represented. In view of what has happened in the past, that they found a Party which is quite in sympathy with them in most things, which seems to see eye <Col N="2002" /> to eye with them, there is no reason for continuing this representation.  At this particular time they pretend to have all the fears that they had at that time; that this Government is going to do something to them.  I am quite satisfied that as time goes on&mdash;and in a very short time&mdash;they will be disillusioned, as they were in the past.  Side issues have been gone into and there were references to the relative strength of University and outside registers.  I do not bother about that.  I had the figures before me.  I do not mind the figures or the numbers on the register.  They have nothing to do with representation which is fixed.  When it comes to a question of democracy I think it has been clearly demonstrated that the plain people are to be regarded, as one speaker was outspoken enough to say, as mud; certainly as not having as much intelligence as ordinary University voters. Senator Gogarty said that if we had nothing but University representation it would be best for the country.  I say: &ldquo;God help the country if it was left in the hands of people like Senator Gogarty.&rdquo;  It would be a bad thing for the country.  An atmosphere has been created, that we are doing this for the purpose of creating a dictatorship, and an ignorant dictatorship.  I do not know how people can have that idea. We were invited on a few occasions within the last 12 months to put the issue before the electors.  If we had the slightest doubt about having the confidence of the people we would not have any hesitation in going to the country at any time.  We proved that in 1933.  We had another election recently, when this Bill was before the country, and although it was not made an issue, the people knew of it, and we were returned in a majority by a conservative vote.  That is quite enough for this Government.  If it happened the other way we would not have been compelled to go to the country because, as Senators know, the Franchise Bill, passed by the other House, has been held up here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got what we might call the more conservative part of the electorate giving us a majority, and we are quite satisfied that we still hold the <Col N="2003" /> confidence of the people.  That may not be democracy to people who were quite satisfied when the vote was the other way.  We did not hear so much then about the people being mud when they saw fit to elect another Government. We heard a lot in those days about the will of the people.  They have exercised that will now to elect this Government. We are told that this is an ignorant Government, that we are only mud, and that it is only quality of mind that counts now.  I am perfectly satisfied myself to be one of the people who belong to the &ldquo;muddy&rdquo; Party.  I belong to the plain people, but I do say that I have got as much intelligence as the average Deputy, and perhaps more decency than some of the people who come from the Universities to this House.  Senator Blythe dealt with the personnel of the University representation.  I have been in the Dáil since 1927, and I have known the University representatives.  I have found them quite good representatives. I do not want to say one word against them.  I knew the three Trinity representatives, and I can say that they were quite as good as any other Deputy in the House, but I do not think they were any better.  Senator Blythe made the mistake of mentioning the name of Deputy McGilligan, because I think Deputy McGilligan is an argument against University representation.  I do not think there is anybody in the Dáil as capable of descending so low as this particular gentleman.  I would not have mentioned his name if it had not been mentioned by Senator Blythe.</P>

      <P>Perhaps so, but I am telling the truth, too, and anybody who reads the papers I think will agree that he is a very poor specimen of a University representative and a very convincing argument against University representation.  I do not think I have anything more to say on this Bill. Before concluding, I should like to refer to a suggestion made by Senator Johnson. I do not think the last speaker was here when Senator Johnson spoke, and possibly he did not go to the trouble of reading what he said.  Senator Johnson's suggestion, I think, was that University representation should not be entirely wiped out.  He suggested that in some future Electoral Bill Universities might be regarded as a constituency.  I do not think there is anything in that suggestion.  The only real case for University representation existed at the beginning of the State when these other people had a fear, which they pretend to have now also, and for which they know there are no real grounds.  They have two-and-a-half years' experience of the present Government.  I am afraid they do not like it.  We know that, but they will have to put up with it.  They say the minority are losing the representation which they had.  I have shown them the remedy.  The Bill before us is in keeping with the revision of the constituencies. We would not have produced this Bill if we had not been compelled by the Constitution to revise these constituencies.  We decided to abolish University representation when revising the constituencies, and I do not see that any case has been made out for them.</P>

      <P>Schedule 2 which this amendment proposes to delete is the one which deals with the returning officers.  This Schedule was arranged in connection with the First Schedule as it was in the original Bill.  Now that Schedule 1 is deleted, and a new Schedule substituted for it&mdash;the amendment made in Committee in this House&mdash;the Second Schedule is no longer suitable for the new First Schedule.  My amendment is to delete the Second Schedule.  What will happen if that is accepted is that the law as to the returning officers contained in the Electoral Act, 1923, will immediately take the place of the Second Schedule, and will work out exactly as it is intended to work out.</P>

      <P>During the discussion on this Bill in Committee one or two references were made by me that I do not think were made perfectly clear. As this Bill will go back to the other House with the suggested new Schedule, I should like to take the opportunity on this Stage to explain some of the things I said.  This Bill, and the one we have just discussed are inseparable.  One amends the Constitution and this, particularly, proceeds to do something&mdash;if and when the Constitution is amended&mdash;by leaving <Col N="2007" /> out University representation.  The case was put by the Minister that I disagreed with Senator Brown.  Senator Brown stated, we were told, that the spirit of the Constitution was being broken and the Minister said that I said I did not agree with Senator Brown because I admitted, as I again admit, that proportional representation in the letter is not in any way being broken by this Bill.  But what I do want to make clear and to emphasise is that I hold that by revising new constituencies you can maintain representation as provided in the Constitution, but that you cannot maintain proportional representation as effectively, as far as minority representation is concerned, as when you had the previous constituencies at the beginning of the Saorstát.</P>
      <P>I agree that the Minister is correct in stating that I did not accuse the Government of breaking the Constitution. At the same time I do agree with Senator Brown that the spirit underlying proportional representation is being broken.  But what I want to lay more emphasis on is that if the spirit of the Constitution is broken, so also is the spirit underlying the statement made, not by the head of the late Government, but by the heads of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like particularly to draw the attention of the House to the attitude of the Minister in charge of this Bill and to the attitude which has been taken up in regard to minority representation.  I have great sympathy with the Minister in having to take on a Bill which is not his own and I do not want to score any small point or anything of that sort against him.  I am dealing with the general attitude.  The Minister was very frank&mdash;and I like his frankness&mdash;when he said last week that he did not think there was anything in minorities being swallowed by the larger parties. He was a little more frank to-day when he said that a certain number of political leaders having subscribed to one of the Parties their minorities could no longer hope to have any right to minority representation.  The <Col N="2008" /> two points of view taken together show that the Minister is perfectly frank.  But compare his statement to that of the President, made on the Second Stage in the Dáil of the Bill to abolish the Senate.  The President is reported in the Official Debates, Volume 51, column 2135, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is suggested that we have some animosity against the minority. There are members on the opposite benches who have sufficiently intimate knowledge of what I have said and have done and these gentlemen know that that charge of animosity is not true.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did not make any charge of animosity on the part of the President.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They know that I stood up for proportional representation in order that all sections of the community might be properly represented.  I stood up for that even when it was known to be against our Party interests.  I stood for it at the last election and at the previous election also.  Why?  Because it gives equality of opportunity&mdash;in so far as it can be reasonably obtained by all classes&mdash;to get proper representation in this House by all classes.&rdquo;'</P>
    <P>I want to join issue with the point of view of the Minister as expressed here to-day.  That he was of opinion that while ten or 12 years ago there was a case for minority representation, now he does not see the same necessity for it at all.  My case is that with the proposed abolition of University representation&mdash;it is of course incidental to this Bill&mdash;and with the proposed abolition of the Seanad, that the necessity for giving minority representation in the Dáil is twice as great to-day as it was ten years ago.  I do not admit for a moment that we are concerned with the ex-Unionist minorities.  When the ex-Unionists were looking after their own interests I was travelling in America with the Minister's brother and was not, at that time, particularly concerned with that point of view.  But there are in this country and will be in every part of the world a certain number of persons who are likely to be in a minority sometimes; tending in one direction sometimes and sometimes <Col N="2009" /> in another.  At present the minority are mostly people who were Unionists, or were of that class.  We are trying to win over, and without force, the Six-Counties in this country which have got a majority of people who are still Unionists.  My contention is that if ever there was a time to try and keep that small representation of such people in the Dáil and I think also in the Second Chamber, although that is not an issue at the moment we should try and do so to-day.  It is up to us to show that there is no reason why the Six-Counties should not come in and join us here.  I feel that the attitude taken up by the Minister which is frank and open is fundamentally wrong. It is not easy to reconcile the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to-day with those expressed by the President in the quotation I have just read.  It is not easy to reconcile the Minister's speeches with his attitude of ten years ago, but the President's speech is easily reconcilable. If I did not challenge the Bill for not going back to the larger constituencies, it was not because I was concerned that small Parties could work the constituencies.  I was concerned for the representation of the people likely to be here for a considerable time and not likely to form themselves into particular Parties, but likely to come in some constituencies under certain representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I misrepresented Senator Douglas's point of view in thinking that there was disagreement between him and Senator Brown.  I learn now that they are agreed.  I have not got the President's speech by me, and I do not know whether he is quoted correctly or not, but I know in practice the system has been, as Senator Johnson pointed out, that in small constituencies the small Parties have been able to get representation which they failed to get in big constituencies.  There are a few big constituencies, such as Donegal and South Dublin, where the minority did get representation.  But three-member constituencies have returned representatives of the minority Party. I often wondered what the reason was. <Col N="2010" /> Senator Johnson thinks that it is because it is easier for a small Party to work it.  I am not saying that the majority Party should not have a majority in the Dáil.  I think it should. Five-member constituencies some people seem to think were ideal, but why did Senators only talk of five-member constituencies when we had as many as eight five-member constituencies?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think some Senator said five was ideal and only four were produced.  In this Schedule there is the most ridiculous proposal yet put forward in any amendment, and that is that the two counties of Waterford and Wexford, separated by 14 miles of another county, should be formed into one constituency.  I thought there might be some attempt to omit that.  I did not think the Seanad would pass a Schedule with such a ridiculous suggestion. The other is in regard to Mayo, a constituency divided into two since 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say a word in answer to the Minister that three-member constituencies would give better results for minorities than the larger constituencies had done?  That is against the whole theory and spirit of proportional representation and against actual experience.  If the Minister took the trouble to look into the history of proportional representation he would find facts that would enlighten him and save him from such absurdities as that three-member constituencies would give better results. I am sure the Minister can find in the archives of the Local Government Department a report of a Commission that was set up by the British Government to inquire into the system of proportional representation at the time when proportional representation became a matter of practical politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Commission was appointed on a non-Party basis.  It consisted of lawyers and statesmen of all political Parties and, consequently, it was free from Party interests and prejudices. That Commission reported that areas of three and four representatives were <Col N="2011" /> entirely unsuited for proportional representation, that an area of five members was the smallest to give reasonably fair returns, but that better results would be obtained by constituencies of seven or nine members.  When proportional representation was made applicable to Ireland, the officials of the British Local Government Board proceeded to define the areas and, in order to load the dice against the Nationalists of the North, they ignored the findings of the English Commission and proceded to fix areas which that Commission declared to be entirely unsuitable for the purpose of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>For example, the Union of Clogher in County Tyrone was divided into four areas of three members each and one area of four members.  By this means the Unionist Party, with a minority of votes, returned nine members against seven Nationalists.  But there is this to be said for them&mdash;that they never claimed that small areas would give better results under proportional representation. It has been left to the Minister and his colleagues of the Fianna Fáil Government to do that. It looks as if those who framed the Bill went out of their way to follow the Clogher precedent and to create three-member constituencies whenever they thought Fianna Fáil had a majority and four-member constituencies where they thought the Opposition had a majority.  That is the meaning of all the carving up and mutilation that has taken place and the pretence that the constituencies were reduced in size to &ldquo;enable Deputies to keep more in personal contact with their constituents&rdquo; is sheer humbug.  The constituencies were reduced in size and were sliced and carved up for the one purpose of obtaining Party advantage. Anyone who looks for a moment at the figures can easily see that areas returning three or four members can be made to give a result the opposite of what the electors intended.</P>
    <P>To illustrate this, let us take an area returning three members.  North-East Dublin was one of the 21 three-member areas in the original Bill.  Taking previous figures as a basis, the number of <Col N="2012" /> votes cast should be about 34,777 and the quota 8,695.  Hence, if Fianna Fáil has 17,389 and Fine Gael 17,388&mdash;or simply one of a majority for Fianna Fáil&mdash;Fianna Fáil returns two members and Fine Gael only one.  Take one quota from the votes of each and Fianna Fáil has 8,694 left and Fine Gael one, leaving 8,693.  Therefore, Fianna Fáil gets the third T.D.  Here we see that in a three-member area 51 per cent. returns two members and 49 per cent. returns only one.  In conjunction with this example, take SouthEast Dublin, which returns four members. And let us suppose that the votes in each area are in proportion to the members.  There should be about 43,470 votes and the quota should be the same, viz., 8,695.  Suppose Fianna Fáil has only 40 per cent. and Fine Gael has 60 per cent. of the votes in this area, then Fianna Fáil returns two members and Fine Gael can return only two.  For 40 per cent. of the votes in this case is 17,388 and 60 per cent. is 26,082.  Now, when two quotas are taken from Fine Gael votes, there are 8,693 left and so Fianna Fáil returns the fourth member.  Taking these two areas together, North-East Dublin and South-East Dublin, Fianna Fáil with 34,777 votes returns four members and Fine Gael with 43,470 votes can return only three.</P>
    <P>It does not matter how many votes are in each area, the argument is the same, and the results similar, viz., a bare majority&mdash;a majority of one vote in a three-member area, returns two members, and the remainder can return only one, while in a four-member area 40 per cent. will always return as many members as 60 per cent.  It is quite easy, therefore, to carve out an area where it is known through the Intelligence Department of Fianna Fáil that even a slight majority favour Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is practically doing away with it.  In these circumstances they can assign three members <Col N="2013" /> to a constituency.  If this were done in the 21 three-member areas in the Bill as introduced, the result would be 42 Fianna Fáil members against 21 Fine Gael, though the votes cast for each Party might be almost equal. Where the reports of the Fianna Fáil intelligence department show a majority against that Party, a few judicious divisions of four-member areas will equalise the members returned unless indeed the majority against be overwhelming.  Objection has been taken to calling this Bill a gerrymandering Bill.  This is surely gerrymandering, or gerrymandering up-to-date.  Yet we are told that smaller areas give better results.  Yes, better results for Fianna Fáil purposes, but the results are the opposite of proportional representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as it will leave this House, will provide for a number of large constituencies.  One of the features of the large constituency which I have heard described as very detrimental even in very recent elections, is the difficulty of electors going through a ballot paper containing from 18 to 30 names.  That is a probability in many of those areas where there are a large number of persons to be elected.  That is by the way.  I desire to speak to the question raised both by Senator MacLoughlin and Senator Douglas as to the basis of the philosophy of proportional representation.  Undoubtedly, in many people's minds, the proportional representation system makes for conservatism. That is to say, it has a <Col N="2014" /> conservative influence.  In the large constituency, I think that that is true. To the minds of other people proportional representation has a reformist influence.  It is from this point of view that I look upon it&mdash;that it gives a living minority a chance to extend.  I maintain that that is more easily possible in the smaller constituency than in the larger constituency. I agree, as I said before, that the three-member constituency does not give a fair chance to the proportional representation principle to be effective.  But, as contrasted with the eight-member and nine-member constituency, I think that the three-member constituency is very much better for a living minority&mdash; that is, a minority with an idea in the minds of its promoters, a minority that hopes to extend.  For the dying minority the larger constituency is more advantageous.  The declining numbers in that constituency can coalesce and, in some way, get representation without having to think of making converts to their idea.  For a party representing a new idea, a party which is out to make converts to its principle, I maintain that the advantage lies with the constituency which is more easily organised and taught. That is the difference between the attitude of Senator Douglas to this question and my attitude.  That is why I am in favour of the smaller rather than the larger constituency for the benefit of minorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson's argument about the smaller constituency being more advantageous to a minority than the larger constituency is utterly fallacious.  An attempt is made to support that argument by the statement that, in certain small constituencies, members who were not associated with either of the big Parties happened to get elected.  They got elected in some of these constituencies simply because there was a peculiar situation.  They would have got elected even if these small constituencies had been merged in larger areas.  The fact that the constituencies were small had nothing whatever to do with enabling small groups to get representation.  I could quote, as <Col N="2015" /> examples some of the Border constituencies, where Independent members were elected.  Size had absolutely no influence there.  Take constituencies like Wicklow and Kildare.  I should say that, owing to the situation that exists there, labour representatives could have obtained election even if these constituencies had been merged in larger electoral areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite wrong to suggest, as I think the Minister did, that it is only in the smaller constituencies minorities succeeded in securing election.  All over the country, at one time or another, minority representatives&mdash;I am referring to minority representatives as those outside the two big Parties&mdash;were elected.  They were elected in County Dublin, Dublin North and, I think, Dublin South on one occasion. Minorities also secured representation in Limerick, Carlow-Kilkenny, Wexford, Donegal, Cavan, Longford-Westmeath, West Cork and East Cork, so that there is absolutely no foundation for the suggestion that, in practice, small constituencies operate the more easily to give representation to minorities.  The argument put forward by Senator Johnson is simply that, theoretically, the big constituency favours the minority but that, for some peculiar reason, in practice, the minority cannot assert itself there. We know that, if a minority exists in an area and is not spread over the constituency, the representative of that minority can get elected practically on a local vote.  That happens often. The chances of election of a candidate whose strength is in some particular town, or area around a town, will not be modified in the slightest if that area becomes part of a large constituency. There are difficulties in working a large constituency, but a minority does not need to work a large constituency in the way that a party seeking a majority must work it.  Sometimes, even candidates going forward on a personal basis succeeded in getting in because they did not need to set up all the machinery necessary for a group seeking to bring in the last man in its favour and seeking an absolute majority in the House.  The size of the constituency <Col N="2016" /> may involve a little extra travelling, but undoubtedly the minority will gather in more votes as a result of the bigger size than will be involved in any inability to work the constituency compared to the way that the majority, or what would be the majority party, must endeavour to work it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat what I said on the Committee Stage: that in theory it ought to be as Senator Blythe has said.  From memory I have a list before me of small constituencies which shows that, in practice, it has been the other way.  Kildare, North Cork, Monaghan, Meath, Louth and Wicklow constituencies return minority representatives and Cavan also.  I admit that in the case of Monaghan and Cavan, because probably of the people living in a certain area, they were able to do that.  But in Leix-Offaly, Clare and West Cork minority representatives were returned, and these are five-member constituencies.  There is nothing in it one way or the other so far as that argument goes.  In practice it has worked out as I have said.  The other people, of whom Senator MacLoughlin spoke, were theorising. They had not the 12 years' experience of the actual working of the system that we have.</P>

    <P>My reason for putting down this is due to the fact that the demand notes for rates show an enormous increase.  They are almost double what they were last year in many cases.

Since I put down the recommendation I have been informed that it is intended to bring in a Bill dealing with this.  As the Bill will deal with the subject in much more detail, I think it would be much easier to discuss the question on it rather than on this recommendation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the discussion on the Second Stage of this Bill some statements were made by the Minister for Finance in reply to statements that I had made.  The Minister on that occasion asked us to consider his statements on the economic war.  I have considered his apology for the British Government's attitude in putting a quota on our live stock.  The more I have considered it the less justification I can see for putting on that quota. <Col N="2018" /> The members of the Minister's own Party do not agree with him as to the justification for the putting on of this quota by the British Minister for Agriculture. Senator Comyn said that there must be some justification for putting on tariffs on our live stock and agricultural produce, but that there was no justification whatever for putting on the quota.  I agree with Senator Comyn.  The Minister said that if there was no economic war, and that no matter how friendly the relations were between this country and Great Britain we would still have our live stock and agricultural produce going into Great Britain under a quota system.  In support of that he referred to the case of New Zealand, and to some other members of the British Commonwealth.  He said that their produce was going in under a quota.  Take the case of lamb from New Zealand.  There is no quota on it at present, but it is proposed to have a quota for it.  Compare the case of New Zealand lamb with our live stock.  In 1932 New Zealand was the biggest exporter of any country in the world of foodstuffs to Great Britain. Half of the total imports of mutton and lamb into Great Britain came from New Zealand as well as nearly as much frozen beef as we were exporting there in the form of live cattle.  The total exports of lamb and mutton in 1932 from New Zealand to Great Britain amounted to 195,793 tons, representing between 10,000,000 and 11,000,000 of sheep and lambs.  Our exports of sheep and lambs to Great Britain would be less than 500,000.  Our exports of fat stock to Britain would represent about 60,000 or 70,000 tons out of a total of 600,000 tons.  Britain imports between 400,000 and 500,000 tons of beef, and of that total the Argentine supplies 400 or 500 tons.  I ask is it just that only a quota of 30,000 tons should be put on the figure representing total imports while our 60,000 or 70,000 tons of beef have to bear a quota of 50 per cent.? In 1932 our imports from Britain were worth £32,000,000, and our exports £27,000,000.  In the same year the imports from Britain to the Argentine amounted to £11,000,000, while their exports to Britain were valued for about £50,000,000.  The exports to <Col N="2019" /> Britain from New Zealand were valued at about £38,000,000, and their imports from Britain amounted to only £11,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question for the Minister and for the supporters of the Government is to try and justify the attitude of the British Government in putting a quota on our live stock.  I say that it is unjust and unfair for the British Government to put a quota on our live stock considering the value of our trade with England.  I am appealing to the Minister to try and settle this question.  If he approached the British Government and put up any reasonable proposition to it, consistent with natural justice and fair play to this country: if he were to state that we would remain within the British Commonwealth of Nations and uphold the Treaty, and then came back here after making that proposal to Britain, he would have the solid support of this country behind him in demanding natural justice and fair play for this country.  Otherwise, he will not.  I want to tell the Minister what the position of our farmers is at the moment. Tariffs are worth nothing to those engaged in the production of live stock and of agricultural produce. They are producing at a loss.  Everything that they produce is being sold at less than the cost of production. They cannot continue to do that.  If we are not given a reasonable and a just deal in the British market, then the sooner we cease exporting to it the better.  We cannot continue to export to it when the cost of the tariffs is deducted from present prices.  The position is that the farmer is the only individual who is suffering as a result of the economic war.  He is bearing the whole brunt of the economic war. The consequences are falling on him without any hope of redress.  He is called upon to pay his rates, to pay his annuities and his liabilities to the banks.  Where is he to get the money? For the last three years he is producing everything at a loss, while everything he has to buy has increased in price.  Farmers cannot continue to work under these conditions.  There is absolutely no hope for them if the <Col N="2020" /> present state of affairs continues, and if there is to be no market for their produce.  In many cases farmers cannot find buyers for their produce at any price.  When this question is raised speakers on the opposite benches remind me of what occurred when the Irish Party in the British House of commons drew attention to the distress amongst farmers.  Senator Dowdall, when speaking on the Second Reading, in order to prove that farmers are well-off referred to the Cork Show, and remarked how well-dressed and prosperous-looking farmers' sons were.  In the ante-room I was reminded of an incident that occurred in the House of Commons after the family of a farmer named Cassidy had been evicted.  The Irish Party, having complainel of the cruelty of such action, Mr. T.W. Russell, who was then a Conservative, made a remark.  Mr. A.M. Sullivan summed it up in this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I saw her, I saw her, said T.W. Russell,02</P>
    <P>Cassidy's daughter wearing a bustle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently farmers have no right to turn out in a decent suit of clothes. According to the supporters of the Government, they must turn out in bawneens in order to show that they are not able to pay rates, annuities or bank debts.  If they turn out with decent clothes and are respectably dressed, it is concluded that they must be prosperous.  The whole object here is to demoralise the farmers and to reduced their standard of living.  They reduced their standard of living.  They are the only people whose standard of living is to be reduced.  I heard it said on many occasions that farmers can be seen at the races with motor cars.  Why should farmers not have motor cars? The farmer is as much entitled to have a motor car as anyone else.  If the brother  the son of a farmer takes up a profession or goes into business, after four or five years he can have a Rolls-Royce, but the farmer, who has possibly more brains than the others, must not have a Ford Car with which to do his business.  That is the talk and disparagement that is heard about farmers.  It <Col N="2021" /> is time it stopped, and it is time that the Government recognised that farmers have as good a right to turn out respectably dressed, and to have motor cars, as any other members of the community.</P>

      <P>I wish to clear up a misunderstanding that arose during the earlier part of the debate.  I had not an opportunity of doing so until I saw the Official Debates.  In connection with this dispute, I pleaded with the Government for the acceptance of the Commonwealth spirit.  The Minister, in replying, said I was dealing with a matter that was completely past and gone, that the Commonwealth idea was put aside, and that our hearts and hands were set in another direction. Would the Minister be a little more helpful?  If the Commonwealth spirit is gone, why not have done with it, seeing that we are suffering very much in consequence?  So long as we accept only the letter and do total discredit to the spirit, and do not attempt in any way to co-operate, we are only suffering in one direction and getting no benefit in the other.  If we are to get more benefit from the Republic, let us have it and be done with it.  What is to prevent that?  I understand that if the people wished it, we could have a republic to-morrow.  Does the Minister suggest that we should suffer penalties if we had the Republic?  We will suffer penalties such as the loss of British citizenship.  There is no reason, if we wish to secede, why we should suffer any punishment except the penalties involved in the loss of status. Let us know where we stand?  We are suffering now.  We are free to act under the Statute of Westminster.  No one denies that.  Those who ask for the acceptance of the Commonwealth position realise that we are free to choose.  Let us choose one thing or the other.  Freedom does not necessarily imply one choice only.  It implies an alternative.  I suggest that the Government, with no loss of dignity, are free to accept the spirit of the Commonwealth and to settle this dispute or go a long way towards settling it by doing so.</P>

      <P>When the British <Col N="2022" /> Government put special duties on our cattle going to their markets, the Government here retaliated in the usual childish way by putting duties on certain goods coming here from Great Britain, principally coal.  By doing that they thought they were twisting the lion's tail.  But the Minister for Mines, speaking in the British House of Commons this week, stated that despite the duties that had been imposed the exports of coal from Great Britain had increased by 500,000 tons. In 1932-33, the revenue derived here from duties on British coal amounted to £326,000.  There seems to have been no figures issued here since to show what revenue was got from these duties. During 1932-33 and 1933-34, the revenue derived by Great Britain from duties on Irish cattle amounted to £7,000,064. That shows what this country has gained from this tomfoolery!  The Government here thought they were going to hit Great Britain by putting duties on coal, but they do not matter a button to Great Britain as the output has increased by 500,000 tons in the first half of this year.  I wish to deal with another matter that was dragged into the debate by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who was in charge of a Bill that was recently in this House.  He said that at the recent elections the people voted for a republic.  Senator Comyn also stated that farmers, who had been hit so heavily by the economic war, had disregarded that consideration, and had voted for&mdash;I think he termed it&mdash;a republic.  That is the only concrete term to express what the Senator meant.  I will not call it freedom, because it will not be freedom, but whatever nebulous thing is in the mind of the Government, as to what position this country will reach eventually.  I want to refute that statement.  I made some inquiries, and I went to some trouble to do so after the Second Reading of the Bill.  An analysis of the votes shows that all over the Saorstát support for the Government declined by 4.2 per cent. since the general election.  The United Ireland Party was not in being at the last election, but if the decline since then was added, it would be 7 per cent.  With the <Col N="2023" /> exception of one constituency, support for the Government declined.  I am sorry to say that the exception is in Wexford, where they had a tiny increase of .2 per cent.  It must be remembered that in Wexford the Cumann na nGaedheal vote increased enormously at the last election.  It has been said that Wexford stands out on its own, and that it does things different from other counties.  It did so at the last general election, because it is the only place in which there was a very small increase of .2 per cent. in support of the Government.</P>

      <P>I am only trying to refute what the Minister's supporters said in this House.  I submit that the people gave no consideration whatever to the question of a republic when they cast their votes.  The small farmers who were held up as an example above all others, as being true-blooded patriots who would not consider economic questions at all, were offered the land of larger farmers and of land owners on a wholesale scale.  The Minister for Agriculture came to Wexford two days before the election and offered everyone free meat.  How votes cast under such circumstances or for such a purpose could be called votes for a republic I do not know.  I have seen it stated in newspapers that these votes were cast for a republic.  When he is replying, I challenge the Minister to say what kind of a republic it is going to be. The Government could have a republic to-morrow if they wished.  There is no one to stop them.  What kind of a republic is it going to be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter which I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister for Finance and also to the attention of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  That is the question of tariffs and high protection as distinct from the penal tariffs imposed in connection with the economic war.  It has been stated over and over again that the export trade in cattle has gone.  The President on one occasion of late thanked God that was so, and that the trade with England was dwindling.  Of course, that arises out of the policy of the Government with regard to the promotion of self-sufficiency, industrialism and so on.  With these aims we, who represent the farmers, fully sympathise and we should like to help in every possible way, but it has to be remembered that at present, and possibly for many years to come, three-fourths of our live stock products will have to be exported.  That is, they will have to be sold in an outside country, not in the home market. Arising out of that, it is the intention of the Government, and I suppose the intention of all of us, if we can help <Col N="2025" /> it, to bring about an increase in the population sufficient to enable it to absorb these three surplus parts of the live-stock of the country.  It is calculated by experts that it will take 50 years for the population to increase to an extent sufficient to enable the people to absorb the surplus products of the country which at present we have to export.  What I want to put to the Minister and also to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, if he would be kind enough to reply, is: what are the people to do in the meantime?  How are these surplus products of the country to be disposed of?</P>
      <P>Again, I have to point out to the Minister that the Government's policy of high tariffs and intensive protection is being imposed on the country mainly at the expense of the farmer.  It places an extreme burden on the farmer.  I do not mind what Senator Dowdall says.  I, also, have an experience of shows down the country.  I happen to be a member of the committee of one very important provincial show&mdash;Kilkenny, which is second to none in Ireland. I suggest that it is not the farmers who principally comprise the attendance at these shows.  The attendance is largely made up of people of the better class who are interested in horses and who can go there without being worried by the consideration of whether they have a good suit of clothes or not.  Again, I would point out to the Minister that on account of the stress of agricultural conditions, there is a tendency away from the land. There is a tendency to come to the towns and cities.  That I know is a common thing in many countries, but it is especially common in this country for the last two or three years.  There is a tendency amongst the people to leave the land owing to the economic stress and because of the low standards which they are forced to accept in their households, and the prices they have to pay for everything they buy as compared with the prices they receive for the produce which they sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main point is, what will the people do in the 50 years that must elapse before the population will be able to absorb the surplus products of the country?  Of course, it is a very <Col N="2026" /> pleasant thing to see industries being created.  As I say, we are prepared to support that programme.  We are prepared to support it in a reasonable way, but not at the expense of depriving the farmer of his means of livelihood.  We have threshed out these subjects on many occasions, but I do not think this particular subject of the permanency of high tariffs and protection, apart from the tariffs incidental to the economic war, has been dealt with here before.  The permanency of these tariffs will carry us further on the downward track than anything else, to my mind.  I should like to hear some reply from the Minister on these matters.  Of course, the income of the agricultural population as compared with that of the industrial and urban population is very small.  That unfavourable comparison grows every day, and explains the tendency of many people to leave the land altogether. Talking about farmers and their sons who seem, according to some people, to be so well-off, I have actually seen respectable young labouring men going around from door to door during the last three or four months.  Whether that is a sign of the times or not, I do not know, but it is the first time I have seen it.  I should like if the Minister would be good enough to deal with these matters in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which we debated this Bill I asked the Minister a certain question and he did not answer it.  The question was this: In dealing with the exports of manufactured articles in this country the Government paid, by way of bounty, all the special duties levied on these articles by Great Britain, whereas, in connection with the export of farmers' produce, the Government gave a bounty which at most was only about 25 per cent. of the special duties levied on these exports by Great Britain.  I ask the Minister what is the reason for that differentiation!  The manufacturer, whether he is making biscuits, Irish tweed or shirts, is able to get from the Government the full amount of the special duties which the British have levied on these commodities.  I <Col N="2027" /> cannot see any reason why the same practice should not be observed in connection with the export of farmers' produce. The effect of this differentiation has been a very serious matter for the farmers.  The net result of the difference between the bounties and the special duties was to reduce the value of the live stock of this country to the extent of £2 to £4 per head.  All that capital value has been lost to the farmer. I admit that some attempt has been made to meet it.  The President, speaking recently at Ennis, seemed to think that the Government did as much as it should have done, when the farmers were granted a remission of half of their annuities and the Government were providing £2,500,000 for bounties. He seemed to think that that was equal to the amount of duties collected by Great Britain.  That statement may be quite correct, but it does not take into account the loss in value of cattle sold on the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The singular position is that while everybody believes that the cost of living is greater than pre-war, the prices received for beef, mutton and other agricultural produce with the possible exception of butter in the home market is very much less than in the pre-war period.  As a matter of fact, the result of the whole system has been to make a present to town dwellers of a considerable portion of the farmers' capital.  At the same time there has been no reduction in the cost of labour.  I cannot see how the Government, which is supposed to be interested in the farmers' welfare, can overlook a matter of such importance as that of the reduction in the standard of living of the farmer and the reduction in the farmers' capital.  I will not say it is the fault of the Government. We will say it is the fault of the British.  Between the two of them, it is somebody's fault.  That particular situation was met in the case of the manufacturer by giving him the whole of the special duties levied by Great Britain whereas the farmer merely got one-fourth of these duties.  To-day I see there has been an increase of ten per cent. in the bounty on horses <Col N="2028" /> exported.  That makes a remission of about one-half of the special duties imposed on horses.  That is supposed to be a great aid to the farmers.  I contend that while the Government are doing something to help, as in the case of butter, and while they are helping by subsidies such products as beet and wheat, these concessions are not sufficient to counterbalance the big losses imposed upon farmers by the special duties.  Every farmer keeps a stock of some sort and must, therefore, face a loss both in his home trade and export trade.  It is the duty of the Government, I suggest, to recompense them for that loss as well as to compensate manufacturers.</P>

      <P>Last week I made a suggestion in this House that somebody should let us have a definition of &ldquo;farmer.&rdquo;  Since I heard Senator Dillon's speech just now, I am more than ever convinced that there is a crying need for such a definition.

I am surprised that it would not strike the Senator as a good idea to transfer some of our surplus beef to some of the respectable workers who are going round from door to door looking for food.  I gather from his remarks also that he was inclined to help industries and the various other schemes that the Government has organised.  I would ask him to give the Government whole-hearted support in this question of transferring the surplus beef to the people who need it in this country.  As a matter of fact, if we could evolve some scheme&mdash;and I believe there is some such scheme under consideration at present&mdash;to get the necessary amount of beef into the mouths of the people who need it in this country, there would be very little necessity to worry about our surplus beef.</P>

If we were to eat meat on the same scale as the people of New Zealand, the people of the Argentine, the people of the United States and various other countries we need not have any worries as far as surplus beef is concerned.  We could very comfortably consume all the beef available in this country at the present time.</P>
      <P>The trouble, as far as I can see, is if the population is continuing to increase, and everybody seems to think it will, if meat is available for the people I cannot see any difficulty. About the year 1860 cattle were imported into this country because the people had not enough of beef for food.  Conditions might arise again of that kind, but to my mind there is no necessity for people to get excited.  If we can get co-operation on the part of the people and a scheme put forward in the interests of the poor working people I do not think that you would have any difficulty in dealing with a scheme of that kind.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance, of course.  I do not know what Senator Dillon's idea is about the farmers of Kilkenny.  But since the Senator claims to represent the farmers of Ireland, I think his attitude is worse still.  As a farmer myself, I certainly resent the remarks made by Senator Dillon.  He was referring to statements made by Senator Dowdall with regard to the farmers' attendance at shows, and said the attendance was not comprised of farmers but was mostly made up of better class people.  I do not want to say I am any better than various other people, but I certainly do not accept Senator Dillon's statement that there are any better class people in the country to-day than farmers. There may be as good people as the farmers, but certainly not better. There is no more honourable occupation than that of the farmer producing the necessaries of life for the whole population.  As a matter of fact the farming community of the country is really carrying the rest of the country on its back.  I was surprised to hear Senator Dillon, coming from an agricultural constituency, referring to the farmers as an inferior body of men.</P>

He referred to those at the shows as the better class.  If that did not mean that the farmers were inferior then I do not know the meaning of words.  Before anybody should make a statement like that he should be sure of himself and not make wild statements creating the impression, amongst other things, that some people in this country were overfed. The fact remains that we have people in this country who could do very comfortably with the surplus beef that is available.  We ought to get the help and assistance of everybody to <Col N="2031" /> help the Minister for Agriculture in the scheme that he has put before the country.</P>

      <P>There is a lot that people have to listen to in connection with the farming industry of the country that is very painful.  I perhaps hold a somewhat different view from other people on this question of the conditions of the farmer.  I repeatedly said that I blamed the British Government for not accepting the President's proposal to submit this question to arbitration, under an independent chairman.  I subscribe to that. I well remember the question that was settled by arbitration when Sir William Feetham was Chairman of the Arbitration Board.  My recollection on that occasion was that there was evidence of ample partiality displayed in favour of the North of Ireland and the British view.  I said that was the greatest calamity that befell Ireland since Partition was forced on the country.  The President's offer of arbitration with an independent chairman should have been accepted in regard to the annuities. I blamed the British Government in that sense for not accepting it.  The British Government, owing to their ambition and their great Dominions on which the sun never sets, should be above the idea of insisting that a chairman could only be appointed from the Commonwealth.  The present Government in this country are opposed to the interests of the farmer.  They refuse to believe that the country is not altogether suitable for tillage, and they have ruined the staple industry of the country.  Cattle must be reared in the country if the agricultural industry is to be successful.  The present prices for our cattle are deplorable, and even these, such as they are, are steadily falling.  There are no buyers at the fairs for young cattle, and for heavy cattle there are no customers.  I saw cattle 12 cwt. sold for £10 5s., or 17/- a live cwt.  I blame the British Government, of course, in putting a tariff of £4 5s. per head on our cattle in order that they may collect the annuities.  Of course, the late Government said that the annuities <Col N="2032" /> were owed, and the present Government said that they were not owed.  But the people are suffering, and suffering very severely, and nobody knows that better than the people who have live stock.  Unless there is some change effected I do not see anything but bankruptcy for the farmers, and especially those who have to live by the cattle industry.  You cannot separate the cattle industry from ordinary farming. We grow wheat and beet and other crops, but the main industry is our live stock.  That, to my mind, is the real question.  Some people seem to think that it is a joke, but I am speaking very earnestly on the question. I blame the Government for not taking steps to meet this great emergency.  The value of our cattle at the present time is not one third of what it was in 1932.  That means a two-thirds loss.  I have seen farmers selling cattle weighing 9 cwt. at £5 8s. per beast.  They were compelled to do so.  That was all they could get and they wanted the money.   When it comes to that state of affairs it is almost impossible for people to meet their obligations.  I should be very sorry to see people refusing to pay their just debts&mdash;annuities, rates and so on.  I think, taking it generally, the Irish farmers have always been anxious to pay.  But it is impossible for them to pay when their money and source of revenue is exhausted. That is the state of affairs at present. I ask the Government to use every possible means to try to restore the position.  The outlook at the present moment is deplorable and the country was never in so bad a position as at present.</P>

      <P>I should like to get some information on the item of £15,000 to be advanced for the establishment of an Industrial Credit Company. Perhaps the Minister would tell us how this money is to be safeguarded. In the past the last Government set up what I presume was a similar credit company and all that money has been lost.  I understand&mdash;of course, I may be wrong&mdash;that that company is closed down.  A report, I believe, was issued but that report has not come before <Col N="2033" /> the shareholders so far.  In view of the amount of money lost in that venture, I think it is well that somebody should insist on methods for the safeguarding of this money.  In the past we had great business people guarding this very large sum of money.  But these great business people had allowed this money to slip away in one form of investment or another.  Knowing that, and having lost a little money in the last company, I am all the more anxious to find out what methods are being taken to safeguard this new sum of money which is to be used for this industrial company.  In the setting up of it there will be more expense if care is taken to avoid the losses incurred by the former company.  The losses of that company were more, I believe, than what they were worked out at to-day.</P>

      <P>I should like to ventilate a very serious grievance from which a most important section of the people suffer.  I refer to the school children of Dublin.  Owing to the woes of the farmer, and the conditions in the country, people are crowding into the cities.  The Government and other bodies are doing their best to supply houses in Dublin, but their best is not good enough.  The authorities concerned are trying to build schools. The school accommodation in the city is absolutely inadequate and the schools are overcrowded.  The children's health is being undermined. This is a question that concerns directly the health of the children but, indirectly, concerns the health of everybody in the city.  I am not blaming the authorities for being so slow as regards school buildings.  I know that the building of schools takes a lot of money.  There is, however, one thing to which the Government should attend.  That is, to see that the national and secondary schools in Dublin close at the same time for summer holidays.  Many thousands of parents in Dublin are in the position to send their children to the country for a month's holidays.  Many people in Dublin take cottages at the seaside for a month in summer.  Where these people have four or five children it usually happens that some of them are <Col N="2034" /> going to one school and some to another.  In one case I know of a school attended by two members of a family closes for summer vacation on the 28th June, while a school attended by two other members of the same family closes on the 20th July.  There is almost a month of an interval.  If these people desire to give their children a month's fresh air at the seaside, after spending the greater part of the year in the stuffy atmosphere of the school, how can they manage to do so?  Two of the children have to remain at school until the month of July is well advanced.  What happens is that none of the family gets a holiday.  I think that the Department of Education could easily arrange with the schools to close for vacation as near the same date as possible.  In the case I have mentioned, one school was a boys' school and the other a girls' school, and there was, as I said, a month's difference between the holiday period.  Everybody needs a holiday and it is particularly useful to children who have spent the greater part of the year in a stuffy school.</P>

      <P>Last week, when we were discussing this Bill, I asked the Minister for some information as regards the negotiations that were proceeding in London in respect of the quotas to be allotted in Britain. The Minister seemed to think that I had not studied the papers and did not know what was going on.  He stated that our High Commissioner was attending these conferences and that he hoped our representation there would be successful.  That was a week ago and these discussions are still being carried on.  I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some information, derived from the report of the High Commissioner, as to the success of our effort in that regard. There are two distinct things affected by these discussions with the British. One is the tariff placed on our exports of agricultural produce by the British to enable them to recover the amount of the annuity payments and the other is the quota of cattle which we are to be allowed to send into Britain.  Senator Wilson wanted to <Col N="2035" /> know why the Government should not give the farmers the whole of the tariff charged by the British on agricultural produce.  He said that, in the case of certain manufactures, the whole of the tariff was being given. Senator Wilson must understand perfectly well that if the Government here were to give the whole of the tariff put on by the British to recoup the loss of the annuities, it would mean practically that, instead of the farmers paying their annuities, the community would be paying.</P>

      <P>No Finance Minister could possibly afford to pay the whole of the taxation which England is collecting.  It would be absurd.  What then would be the use of keeping the annuities?  We know that the Government have cut the annuities and that they are not getting as much as they did formerly.  What has happened in regard to all these bounties is that the burden has really been shifted to the general community and the Minister for Finance has to collect the amount from the general taxpayer.  The British are getting so many millions. Instead of annuities, they are getting a certain amount mainly from tariffs on agricultural produce which we are sending in.  That does not amount to as much as they got from the annuities but they are getting a large amount of the annuities in that way. So far as bounties are paid, it is our taxpayers who are bearing the burden. The dog is eating his own tail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, the receipts from the farmers go into Miscellaneous Revenue.  All the annuities the farmers pay are accounted for under that head.  On the other side are the bounties.  That is all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The annuities were kept and the British said they would collect them in another way.  They are collecting them by tariffs upon our agricultural produce and upon the products of our factories.  Senator Wilson says that the Government are giving the whole of the tariffs back to the manufacturers, but not to the farmers. If they gave the whole amount to the farmer, they would be giving the whole of the claim of the British back to the farmer.  It is the farmer who is being bountied.  If the Government had collected from the farmers the whole of the annuities, there would not have been this trouble, because that fund would have been available.  It would have been bad bookkeeping and bad business procedure, but they would have had the money to hand back to the farmers.  They did not do that. The annuities have been hugely cut. Therefore, the asset of the Government is not anything like what the British have collected from us, and they have not got the money to pay the farmers the whole of the tariff.  They cannot tax the whole community to pay the farmers as they are paying the manufacturers.</P>

      <P>If the farmer were to be paid the whole tariff, the Minister for Finance could not put that burden on the people.  He can only put on a modified amount for bounties.  Otherwise, the Budget would take a very different shape from that which it has taken.  We must remember that all these bounties are paid by the Irish people.  The British are collecting the tariffs because of the economic quarrel, and every bounty is being paid by the inhabitants of the Irish Free State. That is why I say we are being fed on our own tail.  That is one of the reasons why our Budget is so enormous.  If we had not this quarrel with the British we would not have these huge bounties to pay.  The farmers would have been paying their £3,000,000, and I do not think that anybody who looks at the matter from a commercial point of view would deny that, in spite of all that has been said, we would be 50 times better off commercially in that event than we are at present.  I do not think there can be any question about that.  If the Minister for Finance were to pay back the whole of the tariff, which is being collected on our agricultural produce by the British, it would mean that this community would be handing back to the British the whole amount and the squabble would be about nothing.</P>

        <i>The Cathaoirleach resumed the Chair.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside that question, there is the question of the quota.  The Minister told us that the High Commissioner was taking part in these discussions. He pointed out that it would be very difficult for the Dominions&mdash;he included us amongst the Dominions in that part of his speech and seemed to think that all the Dominions were working together&mdash;to fight the British Government for as good terms as they were going to give to the Argentine.  I should like to know what report the Minister has got from our High Commissioner as to these discussions with regard to the quota.  Nothing has been published that I know of.  Presumably the Minister knows something.  I suppose <Col N="2038" /> the High Commissioner must have made some representations.  I would like to hear on what ground our High Commissioner is fighting the case of our quotas.  These quotas are quite a different thing from the quarrel about tariffs.  Apparently the Minister and our High Commissioner are willing to debate the question with the British Government as if we belonged to the Dominions.  We ought to have full information as to how our High Commissioner is getting on, and what support the Government are giving him to fight the case with the British Government for a share of the quotas. This question of the quotas is a practical commercial question.  Our representative in London is carrying on discussions with the British Government as to what quotas are going to be given under the new system of allowing beef and other things into Great Britain.  I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to give us a clear statement as to how we stand as compared with the other Dominions and how the matter is being dealt with.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I will not be able to give any of the information which Senator Jameson has asked for.  The discussions between ourselves and the Dominions generally and the representatives of the Minister for Agriculture and the Secretary for the Dominions in Great Britain are, naturally, of a confidential nature, but I can assure the Senator that we are taking the fullest possible advantage of our commercial relationships with Great Britain, of the fact that we are, I think, her second best customer and are claiming the treatment which that position entitles us to in connection with the cattle quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator, I think, in that connection will have to remember that there are two parties <Col N="2039" /> to this discussion.  The British Minister for Agriculture, in making the announcement in the British House of Commons that these discussions were going on, no more than outlined the policy which the British Government intended to pursue.  He did not state the position which had been reached in the negotiations, and did not even indicate the treatment which would be accorded to any one of the Dominions. I did not anticipate that this question would be raised here to-day.  If I did I might have been in a position to make a fuller statement with regard to it, but I would think that the negotiations up to the present have been undertaken on a confidential basis, and that if I had the information, which I have not, I would not be entitled at this stage to disclose it.</P>
      <P>On the question raised by Senator Mrs. Wyse Power about the advance of £15,000 to the Industrial Credit Corporation, that was the subject of a Supplementary Estimate in the Dáil prior to the 31st March last.  The position is that we are asking the Industrial Credit Corporation to repay the amount of the advance to us, and I hope to secure it before the close of the current financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Staines raised a question regarding the position of schools and school holidays.  I am rather sorry that the Senator did not indicate to me, as I had asked during the Second Stage of the Bill, that he intended to raise this question because I might then have been in a better position to deal with it.  I am not aware that there is any general overcrowding of schools in the City of Dublin.  I know that a considerable number of schools have recently been erected.  So far as the question of holidays is concerned&mdash;I am speaking subject to correction in regard to this&mdash;I think that it is entirely one for the managers of the schools, and that any representations which the Senator might wish to make with a view to securing uniformity of practice in that matter would have to be addressed to some person who would be in a position to convey those representations to the managers.  I may say that I do not <Col N="2040" /> think that either I or the Minister for Education would be the proper person in the case.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan returning to the attack to-day, reopened the debate which took place on the Second Reading of this Bill.  He attacked Senator Dowdall in particular because the Senator had stated that he himself had been present at the Cork Agricultural Show held three weeks or so ago and had noted the general air of prosperity which had pervaded it.  Senator Counihan rather indignantly asked why should not the farmers have good clothes and why should not the farmers have motor cars?  There is no reason whatsoever why the farmers should not have good clothes and, in fact, most of them have. There is no reason whatsoever why farmers should not have motor cars, and a good many of them have.  Any person who has attended some of these well-organised cattle sales which have taken place from time to time will have noted that one thing which was characteristic of them all was the number of farmers who could provide themselves with motor cars, but who declared that they could not pay rates.  In fact, a notable thing took place in the County Kildare. There cattle were seized from a man who declared that he could not pay his rates, and yet it is notorious that that particular gentleman was able to attend Ascot races during the whole of the following week.</P>

      <P>Now the point is this: is it not quite obvious that the people who wear good clothes and who are able to maintain motor cars should be in a position to meet their other liabilities as well?  I am not saying that it is not the farmers' right to have all these good things.  I wish that the great majority of them had them.  I wish that the people who have not got motor cars, the people who are able to pay their rates and their annuities and to meet all their other obligations, were able to afford to have them. But those who have motor cars should not proclaim that they are not in a position to pay their rates.  I think that in ordinary common decency and honesty they ought to get rid of their <Col N="2041" /> motor cars and pay their rates and meet their other obligations.</P>

      <P>If I misunderstood the Senator I apologise.  There is one thing that her speech on the Second Reading of the Bill did do.  As I listened to it she made me think of the rhyme which was current at Oxford when the late Lord Curzon was an undergraduate there:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. George Nathaniel Curzon Is a most superior person.&rdquo;</P>

Possibly posterity will have a worthier reason for remembering her when in her case, as in the case of many others, the Senator completes the circle and comes back to her early Republicanism.  I feel that if she did that often her speeches would be happier and that she herself would be pleasanter in her utterances than she has been recently.</P>

      <P>As I was saying in reply to Senator Counihan, I wish that the farmers had better clothes, I wish that they had more motor cars and, generally, more of the good things of this life.  I do not suppose that either he or I shall live to see the farmers have everything that they would desire to have, but, at any rate, they have this consolation at the present moment: that the position of the Irish farmer, however bad it may be, is no worse and may be a great deal better than the position of the agricultural producers in most other countries.  We are being told what we should do for farmers, and how badly this Government has treated them.  In Great Britain we see a Minister backed up by an united people trying to save the British agricultural industry, and how has he succeeded?  I quoted some extracts from the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> and the London <i>Times</i> on a previous occasion.  I have before me the current issue of the <i>Spectator</i> in which there is an article on &ldquo;Farming and Politics.&rdquo;  It begins with this sentence:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Walter Elliott's activity at the Ministry of Agriculture may be admired both as achievement and as example.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then the article goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But what of his achievement? He himself in the debate of last Monday was careful not to pitch its claims too high.  His caution was indeed necessitated by the facts.  If you went down to almost any farming centre to-day you would not yet find the people concerned &lsquo;on the top&rsquo; of their problem.  Neither the milk policy nor the bacon policy has as yet given complete satisfaction, whether to producer or consumer or middleman.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2043" /> Now in that passage we have two agricultural commodities singled out.  What is the position here in regard to them? Our dairy farmers are getting very much higher prices for their milk than they are getting in the Six Counties or than farmers in Great Britain are getting for milk intended to be made either into butter or cheese.  Our pig prices are higher.  Our bacon prices are higher here than in the Six Counties.  Therefore, our farmers have greater grounds for satisfaction in regard to milk and bacon than those in Great Britain have, and that must be because of the fact that the policy in Great Britain has given satisfaction to nobody, neither to the producer, the consumer nor the middleman. The position of our farmers in regard to bacon and milk must be incomparably better than it is in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. The article goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As for beef, if you survey one of the counties like Devonshire or Leicestershire or Hereford, where it is the backbone of farming, you will discover the raisers of live stock in a really terrible position.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Continuing, he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What with prices so low that every beast sold brings a heavy loss, and with drought forcing sales, because there is no prospect of keep for the animals.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We may not be very much better but, so long as that position of affairs obtains in Great Britain, we cannot be any better.  That is the root cause of our present problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, the main bulk of our exports are store cattle. So long as that is the position the price which the English farmer is able to pay for our stores very largely determines the price we can get for <Col N="2044" /> fat cattle too.  So long as that position obtains in Great Britain there is not going to be an adequate price for our cattle, whether they be yearlings, stores or fattened.  We cannot get away from that.  Let me read on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Even eggs, where the National Mark Scheme got an early start, and has had a remarkable effect in increasing production, have fallen now to prices which may well dismay the producers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At any rate, the prices which our people are getting for eggs are above world prices, and above the present prices in the British market.  We are told that Great Britain is a country with great resources.  So far as eggs are concerned, with our limited resources, we are doing better for our farmers than they have been able to do for theirs.  He goes on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The same trouble haunts the potato growers, who with 97 per cent. of the home market reserved for them find it very hard to turn round inside it without beating each other down to unremunerative prices.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Once more I believe that the price of potatoes here is higher than the price in the Six Counties or in Great Britain.  In regard to milk, bacon, eggs, potatoes and home-grown vegetables generally the position of the Irish farmer is better than the position of the British farmer.  The only element in which we have not been able to put our farmers in that happy position is in regard to the cattle industry.  We are not able to do that because of the domestic position that obtains in Great Britain. We have no control over that.  We have been able to control the home market with regard to every minor agricultural product, and we have done better for the farmers here than the British Minister for Agriculture has been able to do for British farmers. You cannot expect us to do any better.</P>

      <P>Our farmers pay annuities which are 50 per cent. of their original value, and they are buying out their land, some of which is the best in Europe, with their annuities.  The British farmers have practically no title to their land, and when leases fall in they have to compete for it against neighbours, if it happens to be good land.  That position does not exist in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Senator Wilson asked why it was that the bounties on manufactured goods were less than the bounties on agricultural products.  The reason is that industrial manufacturers, who have an export trade, have received comparatively little protection.  The farmer has had the whole of the home market reserved for him in regard to all agricultural products.  In addition to that, the economic war is being fought ultimately for the benefit of every individual agricultural producer in this country.  If it is successful it is he who will get the first and immediate benefit of that success.  He has got the greater portion of it already in the reduction of the annuities, which is a continuing reduction until such time as the annuities are paid off.  At present, that amounts to £2,000,000 per annum. In addition, farmers have benefited considerably by the recent extension of the Old Age Pensions Act of 1932.  The provisions of that Act relate mainly to farmers and to agricultural households. The cost to the Exchequer has been not less than £750,000 and, of that amount, I would not be putting it too high, if I said that the farming community get £650,000.  There is a tobacco scheme, a wheat scheme and a dairy (stabilisation of prices) scheme, under which farmers in one way or another, apart from what they get in bounties, will get between £600,000 and £700,000 from consumers.  Then you have the Cereals (Stabilisation of Prices) Act and special expenditure to <Col N="2046" /> encourage the turf industry.  On top of that you have £2,150,000 for export bounties and subsidies.  In that way what do the farmers lose by the economic war?  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped to get something like £4,000,000 from us this year by way of special duties. The reduction in the annuities is worth at least £2,000,000 to the farmers.  The export bounties and subsidies are worth £2,150,000, almost more than counterbalancing our losses owing to the special duties, and on top of that you have super-added the additional benefit by way of increased old age pensions, the tobacco scheme, the wheat scheme, the butter scheme, the cereals (stabilisation of prices) scheme, and forestry development.  The farmers may be in the front line trenches, but when you consider that the taxpayers, as a whole, are providing these benefits for the farmers, and that the general taxpayers have less to gain than the farmer by the economic war, for which they are providing the ammunition, they are certainly succouring and sustaining the farmers in the fight.  It has been said that, eventually, all comes from the farmers. It is quite true that agriculture is the biggest industry in this country, but it is not the only industry.  There are export industries carried on here which have very little contact with agriculture. You have other important industries carried on, too, which farmers do not contribute, even as consumers, except very indirectly.  Everyone of the people engaged in these industries are bearing their share in the economic war.  I do not want to underrate the part which the farmers are playing, but I am here representing the general body of taxpayers as a whole.  Everyone must realise that it is not farmers alone are engaged in the fight, even if they are bearing the brunt.  It is clear, at any rate, that other people are standing behind them and are taking a share, and that they have not been niggardly in the support they are giving farmers in the present crisis.</P>

    <P>When referring to what I said on a previous occasion, Senator Sir John Keane said that if we wanted to have <Col N="2047" /> a republic why not have a republic? The Senator said that we could have it, and that we would not suffer any penalty, except loss of status, British citizenship and privileges of that sort. The first thing about it is that we do not know whether there are going to be any penalties or not.  During the last ten years when we were in opposition, and endeavouring to persuade the majority of the people to adopt our policy, one of the deterrents most strongly relied upon by the then Government, and the present Opposition, was that if they were to infringe the Treaty, or wished to leave the Commonwealth immediately, not merely would we lose privileges, but that economic and physical sanctions would be invoked to enforce the Treaty and to retain us within the Commonwealth. That was the common argument of our opponents.  It may be that there was no foundation for that, but they indicated these things as a possibility.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that. Only one Party can clear up that matter, and they are our friends on the other side of the water.  I am not going to deny that there are attractions in free association with Australia, Canada, South Africa, and even Great Britain.  There are people of our blood in Australia and in Canada and we are proud of the achievements of our race in these countries.  I should hate to think that our future would be permanently divorced from theirs.  In Australia, the greater Ireland, as I regard it, in Canada, and even in Great Britain, there are many people of Irish birth, Irish extraction, and Irish nationality, so far as their sentiments and ideals are concerned, but if there is going to be any <Col N="2048" /> association of ourselves with these peoples, with these great nations now coming into being, it must be really free and voluntary association&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which will recognise our separate nationhood and be consistent with our complete and independent statehood.  When Senator Sir John Keane asks us to accept the Commonwealth, which he says is a completely free Commonwealth, the question arises as to whether the present association is a free and a voluntary one.  We have tried to ascertain that.  That was the purpose of the President's note.  But we have not succeeded in getting a declaration which would indicate that, in fact, the present association of all States within the Commonwealth is free and voluntary. I do not think that even South Africa has got that.  That is the issue which we raised, and which the British Government so far have evaded&mdash;a clear statement that we are free to leave the Commonwealth, that if our people decide to exercise that right, we shall be in at least no worse a position <i>vis-á-vis</i> Great Britain than is Denmark and the Argentine.  The subsequent observance of the terms of such a declaration would put the character of the present association beyond that.  I say I believe that a clarification of that position is the first essential step to the establishment of satisfactory relations between ourselves, Great Britain and the other States.  There is no doubt as far as Canada and Australia are concerned. We feel that our association with them is free and voluntary, that there is mutual recognition of the position which exists between us.  We fear there is no such recognition on the part of Great Britain.  Until there is that recognition expressed frankly and fully, I believe the present unsatisfactory position must continue.  Personally, I would deplore it.  I think there is a great place in the world for free association of that sort.  As an Irishman I think we could unite&mdash;I think we could associate proudly with <Col N="2049" /> our fellow-countrymen in other parts of the world.  I only hope that those who are responsible for dictating policy elsewhere will endeavour to bring about a practical realisation of that position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was brought before the Dáil in the first instance sub-section (2) of Section 2 did not appear in the Bill.  I was of opinion that there was no ground for granting allowances in respect of maintenance of let properties because valuations in this country make allowance for the cost of repairs and, as a general rule, these valuations are, in fact, so low in relation to the rents that I considered no injustice would be done by passing the clause as it originally stood. I was approached by an association of property owners who claimed that injustice would be done.  I invited them to put up particulars of actual cases.  They put up only two cases of let property.  One of these was a case in which the ground landlord had not compelled the lessee to carry out the repairing covenant in his lease, and I rejected that case as being one which did not call for any concession.  The other was a case in which cottages in the country were let at rents which, in effect, were uneconomic.  I decided to meet this case and I believe that it has been substantially met by sub-section (2) as it stands.  That was the position when we came to the Seanad.  Since then the interests concerned in this matter have had further ample opportunity to bring under my notice any other cases of hardship, if such cases existed, and they have not done so.  I have indicated that if such cases are brought to my notice within the next 12 months I shall be prepared to consider what legislation should be introduced to meet them.  Further than that, I am not prepared to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some mention has been made of local authorities.  Senator Johnson made a point in that connection on the last occasion.  In the time at their disposal since the last debate, the Revenue Commissioners have not been able to obtain complete information from all their inspectors but they have obtained reports from inspectors covering the City and County of <Col N="2052" /> Dublin, the City and County of Cork, the City and County of Limerick, the City and County of Waterford and the counties of Cavan, Louth, Longford, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon and Wicklow.  In all that area only one claim for a concession on the existing basis has been put forward by a local authority within the past three years.  In that case it is clear from the figures supplied that the aggregate income from let properties after deducting the cost of maintenance, is considerably in excess of the aggregate of the Schedule A assessments.  There is no justification for any allowance accordingly and none will be given.</P>
    <P>So far as the Revenue Commissioners have been able to ascertain it would appear that the concession is of no importance to local authorities and that they have nothing to gain by claiming it, because in general, where these charges exist, the money creating them has been raised by loan.  Where the loan has been a Public Works loan, and interest is payable in respect of it, that interest is allowed as a set-off against Schedule A assessments.  The same applies to bank interest.  In the result, when these set-offs have been given, it means that in many cases there is no Schedule A tax payable in respect of property let.  In other cases, as in the case of the Dublin Corporation, the Corporation deducts the tax from interest on stock issued by them for housing purposes. Where this exceeds the aggregate of the Schedule A assessments on the houses, and other sources of income which the corporation could claim as a set-off, the corporation has nothing to gain by getting the Schedule A assessments reduced, because the corporation must pay over to the State tax at least equivalent to the tax it deducts from the stockholders.  The question is, therefore, of no importance to local authorities.  The whole question of cottage property, and of the concession to which it might be entitled, is of no practical importance or interest to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have considered very carefully the question of enlarging the concession as it stands and as it is expressed in the sub-section of the Bill and I <Col N="2053" /> am satisfied that no case in equity can be made for the recommendation. As I have already indicated, if any cases of actual hardship are brought to my notice between now and the introduction of next year's Finance Bill, I shall be prepared to consider the matter in the light of such cases. The present position is that only two cases of actual alleged hardship have been brought to my notice since the present Section 2 was first drafted and became operative.  Of these two cases only one was found to have any actual merits such as would warrant a concession.  I do not know, as I have said, of any other cases.  I am prepared to meet them if they arise. All I can say to the Seanad is that since this matter was first mentioned here, a greater opportunity has been afforded people interested to bring actual cases to my notice, so that, if their merits warranted it, we might devise some means of meeting them, but no such cases have been brought to my notice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The new section to which the Minister referred provides that where the valuation is £5 and under, and where proof can be given by the owner of the property he will then only pay income tax upon his actual income.  That is the thing the Minister refers to continuously as a concession.  In his speech he told us you are only to pay income tax upon the actual income.  When he agrees to do this in the case of a total of £5 we have in his speech the cry of &ldquo;concession, concession.&rdquo;  The Minister refuses to consider this according to the question of principle. He says if cases were brought to his notice to show that in the past the total expended under this Bill is such that paying income tax on valuation would be higher than if a man paid on the actual rent received he would be prepared to consider it.  There is, of course, an association representing certain rent owners and the people reside in many different districts. When I was asked, with others, to bring this matter forward in the Seanad I brought it forward because it did seem to me that there was a <Col N="2054" /> case that might conceivably be unjust. Last week the Minister said that we should bring forward any cases we had.  Now of course it is a very difficult thing to get those cases together, and I do not pretend that I spent the whole week looking after people and asking them to give me their accounts and report about their property for last year.  I only succeeded in getting one case where the owners were told that £5 would not be adequate.  I am sure that that is by no means a single case and that there are properties which are small and where this would be a hardship. I contend there are landlords with small properties willing to keep them in repair even though their incomes therefrom would be very substantially reduced, but if such cases come along there is always the danger that you will aggravate these people and so they will say: &ldquo;I will only spend what I can and no more.&rdquo;  I can only mention one case&mdash; I cannot mention that by name and even if I did mention it by name I could not prove it&mdash;but I believe there are a number of cases.  I do not know whether the Minister would lose by setting up a valuation of £10, if there are a number of properties that would come up to £5.  My own impression is that £10 would cover all the smaller properties and that £8 possibly would cover them but £5 certainly would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a case here.  There are 30 cottages or houses with tenants.  The total valuation is £146 10/-.  The average would be £5 as mentioned by the Minister.  Seven of these cottages are over £5 and some are under, but for the average number, definitely, the figure is £5 mentioned by the Minister. But in the case of several of these cottages under the section as inserted they will not be allowed to claim assistance upon actual income, because they are above £5.  I think £8 will cover that case.  I do not know how the Revenue Commissioners will deal with this.  I presume they will find some reasonable way of making an average.  They will find a way; they will take the 23 and, probably, find the <Col N="2055" /> average of the expenditure.  My case is this.  This is all cottage property, and it should be treated in the same way for the whole 30 cottages if it adopts the same rate of expenditure in keeping the property in repair.  The figure given as total rent received is £318; the total rent due £340, but in the last couple of years only £318 was collected.  Some of the people have not been able to pay and the owners have not gone after them.  Valuation, £146 10/-; the rates borne by the owner for the whole 30 cottages is £108; £130 was spent on repairs; insurance £4 6s. 9d., and management and collection for the 30 cottages was £32.  That was not an excessive sum.  If I was agent and went round collecting these weekly rents I would like to be paid more than that for them.  That makes £274 6s. 9d. revenue whereas the actual income was £43 13s. 3d.  That man would have to pay&mdash;but for what the Minister calls a concession, but that I call ordinary justice, which was introduced on an amendment&mdash;the full income tax on £146 10/-.  Now he will have to pay, on the full valuation of seven cottages, above £5.  I do not know and cannot tell the exact valuation of these seven cottages except that they are definitely over £5.  I think if the Minister will not agree to £10 he might well at least extend it to £8.  I suggest if he follows out my information, and if there are only four or five cases no harm will be done.  The principle is right.  The Minister made reference to certain claims sent in before.  I do not profess to be an expert on income tax, but I think I am correct in stating that under the previous law it was never possible to maintain, under Schedule A, anything, but on the actual rent and that was where the valuation was not more than one-sixth of the actual rent.  That would eliminate a number of cases.  Thus, where the rent was £24, if the valuation was less than £20, you paid upon the valuation, and you could not claim adjustments.  If the valuation was more than £20 you could claim.  Now, therefore, the information which will be in the Income Tax Department as to <Col N="2056" /> these classes will, naturally, be the information they received in cases where they could have claimed.  Otherwise, if there was no right to claim there was no object in giving figures with regard to management, repairs and everything to the income tax authorities, because you could not get benefit in any way.  The Minister said he would have to go to a number of inspectors for information.  But even if he did so he would have only a limited amount of information.  I, therefore, urge him to meet us by going above £5 to £8.  Otherwise, I suggest that the Seanad should pass the amendment and show that the difficulty arose in the way that we had warned the Minister.</P>

      <P>Since the last occasion on which this matter was under discussion I have followed up some of the Minister's inquiries regarding the position of local authorities.  I think the Minister stated the position as I found it.  The fact is broadly this.  The rent is in fact interest on loans and recipients of the interest finally are charged tax on this interest instead of being paid by the local authority.  I think it might be well to inform the Minister that from my information I found that a large proportion of the local authorities' houses in the country, leaving out Dublin, are valued at over £5.  If they are comparable with cottage property held by private owners of the same character, then his figure of £5 is probably not high enough.  I think if he took the urban districts he would find probably more than one-third of the houses erected by local authorities valued at over £5.  I do not know what proportion of the cottage property held by private owners such as referred to by Senator Douglas would be comparable to the cottage property held by the local authorities.</P>

In that case we had an opportunity of examining and seeing the true position. We have had an opportunity of examining in every case mentioned.  I promised that I shall reconsider the matter if cases are brought to my notice.  We shall meet them during the course of the year.  But I did not consider that I would be justified in jumping at this figure blindly.  There may not be much in it, but we would be establishing it if we were to start by a statutory concession.  Senator Douglas challenged me because of the use of the word &ldquo;concession,&rdquo; but we embodied what is done in certain cases and we are now embodying it in the statute and on a statutory basis.  I do not think I would be justified in going further than what the actual cases presented would warrant.  For that reason, I cannot see my way to depart from the figure of £5.  I promise to consider it during the course of the year.  The amount involved may not be very large. Meanwhile I have promised to reconsider any cases brought to my notice <Col N="2058" /> in the interests of small owners in general.

      <P>I am afraid not.  The amendment of the income tax law was made operative by a resolution which was passed after the introduction of the Budget.  Between then and the preparation of the Finance Bill there was a fairly considerable period, during which I met representatives of two associations.  We have also had the advantage of the discussion in the Dáil and the discussion here last week. I have had only one case brought to my notice, and I do not think that it would be quite right to jump at a decision without examining the position more closely.</P>

      <P>This is a matter for the Minister and I do not propose to argue with him any further.  This is a recommendation and I think that we would be making a mistake in withdrawing it.  The Minister did not convince me and evidently he did not convince the two deputations who saw him.  The Minister is, of course, very eloquent, but I am sure he was equally eloquent, equally smiling and equally persuasive when he saw the deputations. If this were a question of delaying a Bill for a few months the Minister would have a very good case and I do not suppose I could resist it.  But a case has been made on a principle of justice and if there are cases affected by that principle&mdash;which, I am assured, there are&mdash;the Seanad should send forward this recommendation.  It will <Col N="2059" /> be, at all events, a guide to show that, if people have grievances, somebody did their best for them.  Those who are doing their best with property of this class will find very cold comfort in the promise that the Minister for Finance will try to do something for them next year.  If there be such cases I am anxious that there should be more than just that promise.  If we cannot do anything better I ask the House to pass this recommendation.  I am doing so, to a large extent, because I believe the reduction to one-sixth was a mistake and that this proposal is a mistake.  That is one reason why I think it should be put clearly on record that this House did not accept the proposal.</P>
      <P>Recommendation put and declared carried.</P>
