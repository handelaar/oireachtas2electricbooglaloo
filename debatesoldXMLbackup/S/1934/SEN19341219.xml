      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am taking the Second Reading of this measure.</P>
      <P>A draft Convention concerning the marking of the weight on heavy packages transported by vessels was adopted at the Twelfth Session of the International Labour Conference, held in Geneva in 1929.  This Convention was ratified by the Government on the 5th July, 1930.  It did not, however, come into force until the 9th March, 1932, that is the date on which the ratifications of two States Members of the International Labour Organisation were registered with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.  The Convention has now been ratified by Australia, Belgium, Chile, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark (conditional), Estonia, Finland, Germany, India, Irish Free State, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, South Africa (conditional), Spain, Sweden, Uruguay, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention was adopted with the view of minimising the risk of accidents to which dockers are, by reason of their work, subjected.  The Convention provides <Col N="836" /> that any package or object of one metric ton or more consigned for transport by sea or inland waterway must have its gross weight plainly and durably marked upon it on the outside before it is loaded on a ship or vessel. Where it is difficult to determine the exact weight, an approximate weight may be marked.  The obligation of seeing that this requirement is observed rests upon the Government of the country from which the package or object is consigned, and not on the Government of a country through which it passes on the way to its destination.  The obligation for having the weight marked is placed on the consignor.</P>
    <P>The Carriage by Sea (Heavy Articles) Act, 1934, has been drafted with the object of implementing this Convention. The Bill prohibits the loading into any ship, barge, or other vessel, for transport by sea or inland waterway, from a port or other place in the Saorstát, any package the gross weight of which equals or exceeds one thousand kilograms, that is, a metric ton, unless the gross weight is plainly and durably marked on the outside of such package.  If the transport by sea or inland waterway commences outside the Saorstát, it will still be illegal to export a package of a metric ton or over unless the true gross weight is plainly and durably marked on the outside. If it is not reasonably practicable to ascertain the exact weight, a statement of the approximate gross weight will be accepted.  The person who, by himself, his servant, or agent, consigns in the Saorstát any such package or object for transport by sea or inland waterway, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £10, unless the gross weight is plainly and durably marked on the outside of the package or object in question. Offences may be prosecuted by, or at the suit of, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The word &ldquo;consign&rdquo; includes making with a carrier a contract for the transport of goods.</P>
    <P>The measure of safety for dockers, provided by the Convention, will be dependent on the number of countries ratifying the Convention.  Only those <Col N="837" /> countries that ratify are bound by the provisions of the Convention.  Whereas packages or objects of a metric ton, or more, loaded in the Saorstát for transport by sea or inland waterway, must be plainly and durably marked with the gross weight, goods coming to the Saorstát from States that have not ratified need not be marked.  Dockers loading goods for transport from the Saorstát will have the protection accorded by the provisions of the Convention, but the same dockers, when unloading goods from a State that has not ratified, will not have the benefit of knowing the weight of the goods that they have to unload.  It will be observed that the Convention applies to a package or object, but does not apply to loose cargo.  Employers were not consulted as to the effect of the provisions of this Convention.  Messrs. Guinness and Messrs. Jacob will, of course, be affected, but it is understood that it is the practice of these firms to export goods in packages of standard weights which are readily ascertainable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of this Bill is to authorise the establishment in a county of two or more county health districts and to make provision for the consequences arising from the division of an existing county health district into two or more parts.  A similar power was granted by Section 9 (2) of the Local Government Act, 1925, but it lapsed on the day appointed for the operation of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate demand for this legislation <Col N="838" /> arises from the request of the Cork County Council and Cork County Board of Public Health for the division into three parts of the Cork County Health District as at present constituted, and for the setting up of a board of health for each part in lieu of the existing County Board of Public Health.  This division has become necessary owing to the inability of one board of public health to deal with the volume of work entailed in the administration of the Public Health Acts and other associated services in so large a county health district as Cork.  The division of the county is also necessary for a suitable adjustment of chargeability of expenditure incurred under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1931.  At the same time, an application has been received from the County Council to reduce their present number and to arrange that each member of the Council in future shall be a member of the board of health for the district in respect of which he has been elected to the Council.</P>
    <P>The Bill authorises the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, on the request of a county council, to make a dividing Order constituting two or more rural sanitary districts in the county, and also to alter the number of members of the council.  Provision is made for the carrying into effect of the dividing Order by the abolition of the existing rural sanitary district and board of health, the constitution and naming of new county health districts, the establishment of a sanitary authority for each such district, and the application to the new district of the provisions of the Local Government Acts.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are made for dealing with the property and liabilities of the existing board of health, the transfer of their officers to the new boards of health, the vesting of functions and duties of the existing board in the new bodies.  Certain other consequential provisions are included, which are necessary for enabling the requisite adjustment and alterations to be made to meet the changed conditions.  It is not anticipated, that apart from the question of the three county health districts in Cork County, the Minister will be called on to exercise the <Col N="839" /> powers contained in this Bill, but it is necessary that the contingency of such an application should be provided for. The provisions are of a non-contentious character, and it is desirable that the powers in regard to Cork County should be available at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;Provided that if any person sells as whole milk any article of food which contains less than the prescribed percentage (if any) of milk-fat but not less than the prescribed percentage (if any) of milk-solids other than milk-fat, it shall be a good defence in the case of a prosecution under this section for such person to prove that the article of food so sold was whole milk within the meaning of the definition contained in Section 1 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My only object in moving this amendment is to protect the honest purveyor of milk from being convicted and fined for an offence for which he is in no way responsible.  The average milk from the average cow has slightly over 87 per cent. of water content, about 3½ per cent. of butter fats, and slightly over 9 per cent. of other solids.  From many causes, it occasionally happens that the butter fat content of milk, as it comes from the cow, is very much lessened and is not up to the prescribed standards from causes over which the producer of milk has no control whatever.  It <Col N="840" /> is on very rare occasions, however, that the other solids are reduced in any way.  They are practically always up to the average standard at which milk is produced in normal times and there are no such variations as occur in the fat content of the whole milk.</P>
    <P>For that reason I contend that it is a fairly sure proof that if the other solids, apart from fat solids, are depreciated below their prescribed percentage, water has been added and a prosecution and conviction and a severe fine for such an act would be justified.  I know that Senator Johnson has said to me, previous to to-day, that this amendment of mine will make it easier for a dishonest trader to put separated or skimmed milk on to his new milk which he is selling.  The Senator has stated correctly that skimmed milk or separated milk has not depreciated in the other solids apart from butter fats; but I think the Senator is stretching the point too much when he tries to come to the conclusion that purveyors of milk are so dishonest that they are going to try to procure separated milk to add to their whole milk to sell to their customers.  The customers, as a rule, are not so simple as some people would make them out to be.  They know good milk from bad milk.  At least 99 per cent, of the people using milk would know whether it was good or bad.</P>
    <P>I agree with the statement of Senator O'Sullivan on the former Stage of the Bill that it is very much more important to have clean and pure milk than milk which would not be clean and pure and that did contain a sufficiency of solids and fat.  I hope that the Seanad will adopt this amendment. As I say, my only object is to protect the honest trader from disgrace, and I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary, or any Senator here, does not want to have any milk vendor prosecuted and convicted for an offence for which he is in no way responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the House should not pass this amendment.  I agree with Senator Counihan&mdash;and I have had a fairly considerable experience of dairy farmers&mdash;that the milk <Col N="841" /> which the very great majority of them sell is pure and unadulterated milk, untampered with as it comes from the cow.  We know, however, and the police records show clearly, that in the hands into which the milk gets subsequently, it is not as it comes from the cow.  This amendment, if passed, would permit of the admixture of 40 per cent. of separated milk to the milk produced in Limerick at the present time.  At the present time, milk in that area very often contains 5 per cent. and 6 per cent. of fat, and that milk would stand the admixture of fully 40 per cent. of separated milk, which would comply with the conditions in this amendment, inasmuch as the percentage of fat would be 3 to 3½ and that of total solids would not be reduced at all, and the specific gravity of the milk would not give an indication because, by reason of the large percentage of milk, naturally the specific gravity would be low.  That would be rectified, so to speak, by the admixture of separated milk which has a high specific gravity.  That would pass as normal milk and no analyst could say that it was other than pure milk, whereas it was really not as it came from the cow.  It happens that during the summer time the percentage of fat runs rather low.  Therefore it is only fair that the consumer of milk should get the benefit of the corresponding natural increase during the lactation periods when the milk is rich in butter fat.  This amendment would, I submit, open the door to all sorts of fraud, and I do not think the House should adopt it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is supposed that the way in which milk is adulterated is by the addition of water.  I have understood for a long time that the way in which fraud is carried on in relation to the sale of milk is by allowing it to stand some time, skimming off the cream and selling the rest of it as whole milk.  If this amendment were passed it would enable the person who adopts that age-long practice to escape unscathed.  Therefore, it would be a very dangerous thing to pass this amendment.  I am glad that Senator Dowdall, who knows so much about the subject, has opposed the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="842" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The age-long practice which my friend Senator Comyn speaks about, by which the dairyman is supposed to skim off the cream before he sells the milk, is one that exists only in the imagination of the Senator.  The reason I say that is because there is very keen competition in the sale of milk now, particularly since the other activities of the farmer have ceased to be profitable.  It was never more necessary than it is at present to have good milk for sale in order that those engaged in the trade may be able to keep in it.  The object of the amendment is to prevent an honest man from being mulcted in damages for the commission of a crime which cannot be proved.  Because the fat content in the milk may fall below a certain standard, it is assumed by the prosecuting authority that the fats have been abstracted.  It is well known, notwithstanding all the care taken by the dairyman, that it may happen in the spring months of the year particularly as regard the morning's milk, where an equal division of the time of milking is not observed, that the fat content may fall below the specified standard which we are assuming will be 3 per cent.  We cannot know what the specified standard will be until the Minister for Agriculture has fixed it.  If, for instance, the Minister for Agriculture were to say that the standard was to be lower than 3 per cent. in the month of April, then we would not have very much to say against the Bill as it stands.  It would be a very serious thing to brand an honest man with the crime of abstracting the fats from the milk he sells when you are not able to produce absolute proof of that.  About two years ago Senator O'Farrell, when addressing his constituents, referred to the unfortunate purveyors of milk, whose supplies had fallen below the standard, as harpies, as people who were robbing the poor of the city of the fats that were intended to be in the milk.  But in most of the cases which came into court it was shown that the fat content of the milk had fallen below the standard without the knowledge of these purveyors.  All these cases, when reported in the Press, assume a gravity which, in fact, is not there at all.  If <Col N="843" /> the standard is 3 per cent. and the milk contains 2.9 of fats, that is reported in the Press as representing an abstraction of the fats to the extent of 3? per cent.  If the milk contains 2.8 of fats that is reported to represent an abstraction of fats to the extent of 6 2/3rds per cent., and if the fat content is found to be 2.7, it is represented that the abstraction of fats there is 9 2/3rds. per cent.  All that is represented as robbery so far as the poor people who are using the milk are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dowdall spoke about the people in the South of Ireland where they have the creameries.  Despite all the knowledge that the Senator is supposed to have of the conditions in that area, I know something about the practice that has been in operation there. I know one case concerning a contract to a public institution in the City of Dublin.  A man got the contract for the supply of milk to it at a price which no honest dairyman in the Dublin area could undertake to supply milk at, but this particular contractor was able to take the contract at a very low price, because, living as he was in a creamery area, he was able to get the skimmed milk at ½d. a gallon.  A thing such as that could only occur in a creamery area where they have the facilities and instruments to carry out such a nefarious practice against the poor. According to the Bill, this man from County Limerick who got the contract would not be liable to any prosecution for supplying milk with this admixture of skimmed milk.  With the addition of the skimmed milk he was still able to have his 3 per cent. of butter fat in the milk.  Of course, if he put too much skimmed milk in and that the average fell below the 3 per cent., he could be mulcted in a fine of £50.  We have no sympathy for that class of person at all.  Our sympathy is with the man who has no creamery to get skimmed milk from, the man who has just the ordinary means of producing milk.  Our sympathy is with the man who is honest in his efforts to supply a good article. If a man adds water to milk then we think he should be made liable for the penalties laid down in the Bill.  If a man adds water and adulterates his <Col N="844" /> milk he will be found out, and we do not want to afford him any kind of protection at all.  We are absolutely against the adulteration of milk.  What we are anxious to do is to protect the man whose milk supply in the month of April may, for the reasons I have stated, fall below the standard laid down.  We are anxious to see that if his milk does fall below the standard that he will not lose his good name, a good name that it has cost him a lot of money to build up in the milk trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to oppose this amendment.  The statement Senator Wilson has made to-day is not in agreement with the statement he made last week when he tried to convince us that it was quite a usual thing for milk to fall below the 3 per cent. fat content. He told us about the cows on the Government farm at the Albert College and of cows on farms outside the city. He said that as a result of tests made the milk given by a number of these cows was below the 3 per cent. standard. Now we are told that cows in the County Limerick give milk with a 6 per cent. fat content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator said that a contractor from the County Limerick was able to get such rich milk from the farmers around him that he could afford to add separated milk to it&mdash; separated milk which the Senator said he was able to get at ½d. per gallon&mdash; and sell this admixture, still maintaining a 3 per cent. fat content, to a public institution in the City of Dublin.  As one representing the workers, I hope that the Minister for Agriculture will insist that milk containing at least 3 per cent. of butter fat will be made available for the poor.  I think that standard is not an unreasonable one. Whether that is the standard of the milk that comes from the cow or not, I hope it will be insisted on.  Everyone who has had experience of buying milk in the country knows that it is quite a usual thing for the purveyors of milk to sell the fore milk which is poor milk, and keep the rick milk for their own use, or churn it into butter. We all know that in the case of those who keep cows in the country it is the <Col N="845" /> invariable practice with them to keep the strippings for table use.  If a farmer wants to avoid breaking the law, and if he has cows which are very flush in milk&mdash;as a rule this is milk of poor quality&mdash;he can easily remedy that defect by using this fore milk for the feeding of calves and selling the rich milk to the people.  I do not think that the purveyors of milk are entitled to any sympathy from the public or from this House.  I am aware that at the present time in the County of Meath milk is sold in summer at 5d. a gallon, and in winter at 8d. a gallon, while the poor in the City of Dublin have to pay 2/- a gallon for that same milk.  Surely there should not be such a discrepancy in these prices.  It is only reasonable that those engaged in the trade should be made supply a good article in view of the price the public has to pay.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Wilson and Senator Counihan that everything possible should be done to protect the honest purveyor of milk, particularly if the absence of fats in the milk is due not to any fault of his. On the other hand, there is a good deal to be said for the point of view of those who oppose the amendment.  In view of the fact that milk forms such an important article of diet for infants and young children especially, it is essential in the interests of the public health that the standard of quality should be kept as high as possible.  I was very much interested in the speech which Deputy Dr. O'Sullivan made on the Second Reading of the Bill.  He dealt with the question of pasteurisation. I think I am correct in stating that he said, in effect, that pasteurisation results in diminishing the vitamin contents of the milk.  These vitamins are contained principally in the butter fats.  That being the case I would prefer, as a layman, pasteurised milk with a high butter fat content to milk which had not been pasteurised and that had a low butter fat content. The difficulty that I find myself in is that, while I believe the great majority of the purveyors of milk are honest, a minority, who may be potentially dishonest, would be enabled to pick loopholes in the Bill if this amendment <Col N="846" /> were inserted in it.  Therefore I am voting against the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment, if inserted in the Bill, would mean that the Bill would have no effect at all.  It would be a case of returning to the present position.  The present position is that it is an offence to adulterate milk, and there is a presumption that adulteration has taken place if the percentage of butter fat is below a certain level.  The Bill proposes to make it an offence to sell as whole milk, milk which has less than the prescribed percentage of butter fats even though it comes direct from the cow.  Even if the seller proves that he handed out the milk direct from the pail to the purchaser and it is below the standard, it will be an offence under this Bill.  The question of presumption will not henceforward arise. What would be the effect of the amendment? If the defendant proves to the justice that the article of food sold as whole milk was within the definition, that is to say, was milk from which none of the constituents had been abstracted, then no offence will have been committed; but how will he prove that?  He will appeal to the analyst's report, showing so much per cent. of solids and so much per cent. of butter fats.  The solids are up to the normal but the butter fats are below, and he will be in the same position with the magistrate as he is at present, that is, he will be able to prove that it was sold as it came from the cow.  The practice that has been referred to of adding skim milk or separated milk to the original whole milk would be possible and profitable under the amendment, and it would be no offence because the positive act of adulteration would in very few cases be provable. The effect of the amendment would be practically to nullify the effects of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the point of view of Senators Wilson and Counihan, but I have more sympathy still with the difficulty they have found in drafting an amendment which will achieve the object they have in view, without doing more damage than they are trying to remedy.  I think the amendment undoubtedly, would destroy <Col N="847" /> the effect of the Bill and leave things just exactly as they are.  I should say, and it is perhaps of importance to know, that according to judgments it is still an offence to sell milk which has been adulterated even though it is above the standard which has been prescribed&mdash;3 or 3½ per cent. of butter fat, or whatever the figure may be.  It is not a sufficient defence to prove that the milk is above the prescribed standard of butter fats if it can otherwise be proved that it has been adulterated. That by the way, but there is a general assumption that because milk has more than 3 per cent. of butter fats it can be mixed and treated in any way.  That, I understand, is not the law.  There is a misunderstanding that merely a good butter fat content is a sufficient proof of genuineness.</P>

I would suggest, however, that instead of the amendment, which leaves the door open to very extensive fraud, some approach should be made to the Minister so that in fixing standards he might have regard to the conditions at certain periods of the year.  That is to say, the prescribed percentage of butter fats would not be the same in April as in October.  There is something to be said for that point of view, but I can see no justification for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I oppose the amendment because I think it cuts right across the principle of the Bill. In fact, it defeats the principle underlying the Bill.  There is no question that certain cows do give a better quality of milk than others, but every dairy man and producer can easily find out the character of the milk the cow should give.  If he has a herd, the deficiency of butter fat caused by the fact that one cow may be giving a small quantity of butter fat, can be made up from the cows that are giving a larger quantity.  I have great sympathy with <Col N="848" /> the dairy trade, because they have to work under very difficult conditions, and they have to be constantly attending to their trade.  That entails a good deal of anxiety, but, at the same time, the public must be safeguarded, and the present state of the law allows a person who has been prosecuted for supplying adulterated milk to appeal to the cow. That is practically what the amendment does.</P>

      <P>Probably because a number of cases have been brought to my own notice in which prosecutions have taken place and people possessing the very highest standards of honour have been held up to public odium in the courts, I am very much inclined to support the amendment.  Personally, I have nothing but contempt for the person who adulterates milk.  I agree with the statement of Senator O'Farrell, which has been quoted, that they are harpies.  They might even be called murderers, because young children might die as a result of their efforts to make illegal money in this way.  I have nothing but contempt for them and, if I were a magistrate, I would send them to jail.  At the same time, at least half-a-dozen instances have come under my notice where people of the very highest standards of honour have been subjected to humiliation. Some of these people could not now be induced to sell milk under any circumstances, even if they knew it contained 6 per cent. of butter fat.  Of course, that is altogether an exceptional standard, but nothing would induce these people ever again to sell milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that in towns the temptation to adulterate milk may be greater than in the country.  I do not agree with Senator Duffy that the average farmer who produces milk sells the poorest of it.  That has not been my experience, and I have some experience in the matter.  I do not believe that the average farmer would stoop to that.  I do not know anything about the person into whose hands the milk may come after it leaves the farmer's hands.  I do not speak for those people.  I speak for the farmer.  He is not the type of <Col N="849" /> man who would do that kind of thing, and I think some protection, whether by way of this amendment or otherwise, should be given to the honest person. Many cases have happened in which people who would not stoop to do anything dishonest, have been held up to odium and have suffered in their characters as a result of these prosecutions. Some protection should be given to them, and for that reason I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that there are a great variety of conditions at different times of the year.  I think that it is rather going too far to say that the amendment nullifies the Bill. That entirely depends upon how, if the amendment was inserted in the Bill, these prosecutions would be carried out.  A man who is prosecuted can, under the amendment, prove that he supplied the milk as it came from the cow.  He would have to milk that cow again to show it yielded exactly that quality of milk and to show that there has been no subsequent adulteration. The answer to that may be that he should not keep such cows or feed them on such land.  That is another question, but, at any rate, it is perfectly possible to find out whether the man has a genuine defence or not in saying that it came from the cow.  If we had the Parliamentary Secretary's view, I think we would find it much easier to vote on the amendment.  I am doubtful about it, and I think a great injustice might be done in certain cases if the Bill is left as it is. Although it appears to cut across the whole principle of the Bill, I do not know that it would in practice, because, after all, supposing a man proves that his cows are giving milk that is not quite up to standard, that it is supplied exactly as it comes from the cows, what exactly is going to be done about it?  Is he going to be told &ldquo;that is all right, but you must not do it again&rdquo;, or what is going to happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the object which this amendment seeks to achieve, but I do not consider that it will succeed in its purpose.  I think it would rather open the door to the abuses which Senator Wilson has so strongly and justly condemned. The periods where there are fluctuations in the butter fat content of milk are known to all experienced dairymen.  They generally occur when there is a very rainy season time and when grass is very plentiful.  That may affect the whole herd, and an honest man may be easily penalised unjustly.  I think some provision <Col N="851" /> should be made to prevent this.  I would suggest, after hearing the debate, that the provision should take the form of providing an easy means for the experienced salesman, who, if he is an honest milkman, will know the period&mdash;and, in fact, the ordinary person's palate will tell him the difference when he drinks the milk&mdash;involving no cost to him, of ascertaining whether that milk is up to standard.  If he wants to prove his honesty he should either send a sample immediately to the Department or ask that the Department's inspector should, without any cost to himself, inspect the quality of the milk he proposes to supply to the market.</P>
      <P>If an amendment of that nature were introduced it would help considerably to meet the case.  It may be said that the inspector goes around to-day and finds the milk all right, and on the next day or in a few days' time the producer is taken up; but if it is found that the man is honestly disposed to leave his herd, and the milk produced by his herd, open to inspection&mdash;I know that it is always open to inspection and should be open to inspection&mdash;or if he calls attention to the fact that he believes that the milk he intends to supply is below the necessary fat content, the responsibility rests with the Department and not with him.  If he is summoned he has the very just defence that he has reported the matter to the Department.  I think it would be hard for an honest man to be convicted under those circumstances and if the amendment took that form I would certainly support it, but the form in which it is at present would leave the door open to the mixing of the buttermilk or skim milk with fats, to a very great extent, and I think it would be very dangerous even for an honest milkman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I question whether any milk, at any time of the year or in any county, would contain anything like an average of 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. butter fat.  I have experience of a dairy county myself and I believe I would be nearer the mark in saying that the average butter fat content would be under 4 per cent.  I think that the statement that 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. of butter fat is contained in any milk produced in any county and the suggestion that such milk could be, and is, easily adulterated is a wild and extravagant statement for any responsible man to make in this House.</P>
      <P>Another statement made by a member of the Opposition is that the strippings are very often retained by men who sell milk and especially in creamery districts.  That is an absolutely absurd and ridiculous statement and, I may say, absolutely misleading also.  Milk in the creamery districts is sold for its butter content and no farmer in his senses would retain the very article for which he is paid and send the rest to the creamery.</P>

I have known of milk being sent to a creamery and it contained less than 3 per cent. of butter fat, and I know myself, when I sent milk to a creamery, that it would be a very exceptional occasion when I would reach 4 per cent. of butter fat in any month of the year.

      <P>I am also considerably interested in this question of testing milk and I would suggest that there is one way in which the milk vendor can protect himself, and I would put it to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Of course, most of them do belong to cow-testing associations, but I suggest that it should be made obligatory.  If a milk producer belongs to a cow-testing association, he can always, at any time of the year or day, call on his supervisor to take a test of the milk which he is going to supply to the public.  He then gets a general idea of what the butter fat content is.  I think that the butter fats vary immensely, not only from the point of view of the time of the year, but also&mdash;and I do not think the point has been brought out&mdash;from the point of view of the period of lactation of a particular cow.  At this time of the year, when cows are low in milk, the butter fat content will rise to 4.5 per cent. and that same cow, in a flush of milk in May, will produce 3.2 per cent. or even just the bare minimum.  This is the time when I think the cow-testing associations could come in and I think that would sufficiently protect the vendor.  It would be a much better plan than having this amendment which definitely cuts across the idea of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The principle involved in this amendment was very fully discussed here just a week ago, and all the arguments in favour of the amendment that have been emphasised and put before the House to-day were, with equal emphasis, trotted out to us on Second Reading.  All the points in favour of this particular amendment were put very clearly before the House, and it becomes a bit tedious to have to repeat the same arguments again <Col N="854" /> and to have to meet the same line of argument which was already met and which appeared to satisfy the House, when this matter was under discussion before.  Senator Counihan, in the course of his remarks to-day, tells us that the average milk from an average cow will contain 3.5 per cent. of milk fat.  If that is so, is it unreasonable to ask this House to ensure that milk which is to be the staple food of the children of this country should reach an average standard of quality?  That is all we are asking in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I pointed out on the last day on which we were discussing this matter that practically all the causes that go to contribute to a fall in the butter fat content below 3 per cent., at any rate, can be removed without any additional expense and at very little inconvenience to the producer of milk, that is, provided he sets himself out and takes sufficient interest in the production of milk of a reasonable standard of quality, to take the necessary steps to ensure that it will reach that standard. I contend, as I contended here the last time we were discussing this, that if a farmer sets out to make a living in this particular branch of agricultural industry, and if the community is guaranteed by statute that the milk produced and sold by any particular farmer or group of farmers will reach a certain standard of nutritive value, it is up to that farmer to produce milk of that standard of purity or nutritive value.  If he finds that it is too troublesome, if he is not prepared to do that, he ought not be allowed to sell an article which purports to reach a certain standard of quality, but which does not, in fact, reach that standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether Senator Wilson would agree with me in this House, but I do know that, outside this House, when discussing this subject with him, he does agree that the big contributing factor towards a fall in butter fat content below the 3 per cent. standard in morning milk is the irregularity of the milking, and I think that most Senators who are well informed on the subject, either by reason of having made a special study of it or by reason of practical experience, will <Col N="855" /> agree that that is so.  As I said when we were discussing this matter previously, there is the individual peculiarity of individual cattle.  For no reason that I can explain, at any rate, a healthy and well-bred cow will sometimes give a low-grade milk, but if the producer of milk for sale to the public for the feeding of the children of the rising generation wishes to continue in that particular line of business, he has got to eliminate from his herd the cows that give milk of a low standard of butter content.  To my mind, the acceptance of this amendment would leave us in a worse position than if we had not touched this Bill at all.  The Senators who have argued that it cuts across the whole principle of the Bill have made that point as clearly and as emphatically as I can possibly make it.</P>
    <P>All this thing about &ldquo;straight from the cow&rdquo; is all right up to a point. There is no question that the vast majority of milk producers are honest men and nobody wants to get the honest milk producers into any conflict with the law, but I think every Senator will agree with me that there are dishonest purveyors of milk, and it is these dishonest purveyors of milk we want to get at.  Nobody for a moment suggests that it is anything like a universal practice to skim the milk and sell that skim milk for human consumption, while selling the strippings to the creamery or turning them into butter at home; but it does happen and it should not be allowed to happen, and it is in order that it will not happen in future that I want this amendment rejected. On the question of the fixing of standards, as Senators, I have no doubt, are aware, the standards of butter fat content and of solids other than fats are fixed by regulations made under the Principal Act by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>When discussing this question last week, Senator Wilson was particularly disturbed about that possibility if the Bill went through in its present form. I undertook to adopt a friendly attitude towards an amendment, to the effect that the Minister for Agriculture would lay the regulations setting out the standards before the House.  I felt <Col N="856" /> that Senator Wilson, Senator Counihan and other Senators, who were disturbed about this amendment of the Food and Drugs Acts, were satisfied with that undertaking.  We are not setting out standards under this Bill. We are providing against fraud by abolishing the defence &ldquo;straight-from-the-cow&rdquo; and laying it down that whatever the standard of fats may be, whether 2.5, 3 or 3.5 per cent., which the wisdom of this and the other House decides upon, that this standard should obtain, and that for no reason the defence &ldquo;straight-from-the-cow&rdquo; should be given in future under any circumstances as an impressive defence.  If a cow does not give milk of approved standard of quality the milk should not be sold for human consumption.  Senators should remember that it is not one cow's milk is tested but mixed milk from a herd. You would have to have the majority of the herd giving milk below the standard prescribed in order that a conviction could succeed.  There are seasonal variations.  I believe they are governed, not so much by seasonal changes as by the period of lactation. As Senator Wilson knows, the period of lactation has more effect at certain seasons than at others.  The question of feeding is not an important one at all.  No matter how certain cows are fed they will give a low standard of milk.  Feeding will not get over the difficulty, but care in milking, regularity in milking, to ensure that the cow is milked dry, and stripped properly so that no butter fat contents are left in the cow's udder when milking is completed will.  These things will have to be attended to in future by producers of milk who do not wish to become entangled in the law.  I do not wish to labour the matter further. Although the other amendment is not before the House, it is really related to this one.  I am quite prepared favourably to consider that amendment and to recommend it to the Dáil. Senators will have an opportunity then of discussing these regulations and the percentages set out.  If they can persuade the House that the standards set up by the Minister are too high, they can reject them for new <Col N="857" /> regulations with lower standards.  I think the standards should be set definitely and that any purveyor who sells milk not up to these standards should be liable to the penalties the law prescribes.</P>

He spoke about the records of the courts and how people were able to get off, as showing that there was a good deal of such practices going on. There have been prosecutions, particularly in the county from which the Senator comes, but in the majority of cases the farmers were able to prove <Col N="858" /> that the milk was sold as it came from the cows and there were no convictions. Does the Parliamentary Secretary want a farmer to be prosecuted and convicted, who sells milk that has been honestly produced, and that comes from well fed cattle?  Does the House, and particularly farmers' representatives in it, want honest farmers convicted of offences for which they are in no way responsible?  That is the question I want answered.  I am not saying that the milk is always up to standard, but it happens occasionally, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, that milk that may contain 3.5 per cent. most of the time, owing to causes which farmers cannot control, such as a wet or a frosty night, may, when tested, be below the prescribed standard.  I want to protect farmers from being disgraced on such occasions.  I appeal to the House to pass the amendment.

      <P>Such manipulation of milk could only be done at the creameries.  It could not be done by people who have to milk their cows at <Col N="859" /> 4 a.m. in order to have it in Dublin at 7 a.m.  They have to milk again in the afternoon.  That entails employing a double set of men.  Throughout the country the working day is one of nine hours, so that the cows must be milked at regular hours.  There is no use in the Parliamentary Secretary saying that farmers should not produce milk unless the milking is done at regular periods.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows perfectly well that farmers are not in the position to have two sets of workmen.  I have two sets of workmen. That is not the case generally, as the price obtained for milk would not permit it.  Even if there were two sets of workmen, the content would be upset by one wet night and a man's character would be ruined.  There is only assumption in such cases on the part of the prosecuting authority. Science cannot prove that a particular sample of milk was interfered with.  I saw a case where a cow was milked in the byre, a sample taken and the milk was not up to the average.  If cows were milked at 4 o'clock in the morning and at 4 o'clock in the evening, after a heavy night's frost, the milk would be short in butter fats.  All the lactometers invented would not save a man in such cases.  The law should be just and an honest man should not be penalised if he carries on his business properly.  They have milk regulations in Northern Ireland and in England that are in advance of the standards required here.  Why do they not bring in Bills of this character there?  They know better.  When a man brings his workmen to court in cases of this kind, to prove that the milk was not interfered with, do you think these men would perjure themselves in order to retain their job?  I know that this amendment will not be carried, but I had hoped that the House would appreciate the difficulties of the farming community, so that they should have the justice which their case demands.  On the question of eliminating certain cows, the Parliamentary Secretary must remember that a cow that gave a minimum of fats in May might be giving milk up to 4 per cent. standard in June.  If such a cow was eliminated from the herd the owner <Col N="860" /> would be no better off, and he would have to keep up supplies.  I hope the House will meet the case in some other way.  I am against lowering the standard of milk to be supplied, but the law that permits an honest man to be summoned, and his character taken, is unjust and should not be passed by this House.</P>

      <P>I desire to corroborate Senator Wilson.  On the Second Reading the Parliamentary Secretary stressed the importance of regular milking time.  If he was a practical farmer, or if he lived in the country, he would know that that is an impossibility under present conditions. Farmers find it very hard to keep one set of men.  The rule is laid down by the Labour Leader that workmen are to start at 8 o'clock in the morning and no sooner.  Any farmer who asked them to come in earlier would be described from some public platform as a tyrant or a slave driver.  The cows will be milked at 8 o'clock in the morning and again in the evening.  That will not be changed, even if the Minister made a law to do so.  Accordingly, I wish to say that as that cannot be changed the question of having cows milked at 4 o'clock in the morning and at 4 o'clock in the evening cannot be carried out in the country districts.</P>

      <P>Senator Wilson repudiated with emphasis even the possibility that farmers and dairymen would divide their milk&mdash;take the cream and sell it separately from the remainder of the milk.  Under my own direct observation, I have seen that done.  I have seen the cream abstracted from rich milk for sale as cream and the remainder sold as milk.  Senator Wilson, however, I think, gave away the bulk of his case when he instanced the possibility, which I think is generally admitted, that after a wet night or a frosty night the morning's milk might be deficient in fats.  It is those very exceptional circumstances that will cause the deficiency to the extent that is contemplated, but it must be remembered that wet nights and frosty nights are not continuous.  Wet nights may be, <Col N="861" /> but the effect of a wet night on the butter fat content of milk is not going to be continuous.  I think that Senator Wilson will agree that, as a matter of practice, in the administration of the law, it is continuous deficiencies that result in prosecutions.</P>

As a matter of practice, it is the succession of samples that have been taken and that are found to be deficient that results in a prosecution.</P>

      <P>I am not denying that he is liable to prosecution, but I say that, as a matter of practice in the cities it does not result in a prosecution. As a matter of practice, it is the succession of defective samples that are found that results in prosecutions.  I think it is important, however, to draw attention to the effect of Section 2.  Its effect is to make it an offence to sell an article, called milk, which is below a certain standard of quality.  So far <Col N="862" /> as that particular section is concerned, it is not an allegation of fraud; it is an allegation of selling an article below a certain standard.  That is to say, milk, in the future, will be an article with a certain percentage of butter fat and of solids, and it will be the offence of selling something of deficient quality that will be the subject of prosecution. Henceforward, as I see it, there will be no indication of fraud or of definite and positive adulteration.  It will be rather a minimisation of that ignominy that fraud is an immediate assumption when milk is deficient in butter fat.  The offence will be that of selling an article of a different quality from that which is demanded and it will be clearer after this Bill is passed than ever it has been before.  Hitherto, the implication has always been that there has been a deliberate fraud.  After this passes, I do not think that implication will be there to anything like the same extent. It will be an implication of selling something of inferior quality to that prescribed.</P>

      <P>There is one point to which I should like to allude.  I do not wish to prolong the debate.  I do not know how seriously the contribution from Senator Miss Browne is to be taken, but when she suggested that I had taken the stand in this debate that absolute equality of intervals in milkings was essential to safeguard against a fall below the required percentage, I do not think she was altogether fair to me in that interpretation of my remarks. However, if I did convey that impression, let me correct it now. Absolute equality of intervals is not necessary, but the nearer you can get to it the less likelihood there is of deficiencies.  It has been said by competent authorities that when the interval exceeds 13 hours the likelihood of the milk, after that interval, falling below the standard, begins to appear, and, according as the interval is prolonged beyond that, the likelihood of its falling below the standard increases. I was glad to hear from Senator Miss Browne that she knows what she is talking about.  I presume that she does, but I should be more impressed, I must confess, if somebody else told me that she knew what she was talking about.</P>

      <P>And I suggest that some of us ought to be entitled to speak once.  There is only one matter that I wanted to advert to, and that was the statement made by Senator Brown.  He said that in the beginning he had an open mind in regard to this amendment, and that later he had not such an open mind.  He said that his mind had been rather closed in regard to the amendment, and he was mainly influenced by the remark of the Parliamentary Secretary and of Senator.  The McGillycuddy, and influenced by the circumstances represented to him that it was very easy for the farmers to have frequent tests made, and that inspectors were constantly going round whose services could be easily secured.  As a farmer producing milk, and as a member of a cow-testing association, and one who has worked practically in it, I want to assure the Senator that if he bases his last decisions on any such assumption his decisions will be entirely erroneous. It is exceedingly difficult for the ordinary farmers to get tests, and it is difficult even for members of cow testing associations.  Even in the case of the latter, in most cases, a test takes place once in every six weeks; and for the ordinary farmer in out of the way places, where there are no cow testing associations, it is a very difficult and costly matter to get frequent testings of his milk.</P>

      <P>An attempt has been made to suggest that those, including myself, who are in favour of securing that the milk supply of children in the cities shall be good milk, are hostile to the interests of the farmers.  We are not hostile to the interests of the farmers, but we are hostile to people who destroy the credit of farmers by either putting water in the milk or by keeping an old cow that would give five <Col N="865" /> gallons of milk with scarcely any cream in it.  People have been talking here as though they thought we knew nothing about cows.  I would ask the Seanad to bear this in mind: that the person who is being protected here by the Parliamentary Secretary is the little child that gets a half pint of milk. If that milk is bad, if it is deficient in fat or vitamins, that little child will suffer and will suffer much more seriously than a farmer would suffer by being brought up for selling milk which is deficient in either the fats or the solids that will be required by regulations.  There is no use in wasting all your tears here and all your sympathy on the farmer with, perhaps, five gallons short, who has attempted to make it up.  We know that that sometimes happens.</P>

That is a consideration that ought to be borne in mind by Senators when they come to vote on this amendment.  I say this with some experience: that a farmer knows, almost to one-tenth per cent., the percentage of fat that each cow in his bawn yields.  One of the first instruments I ever saw was the lactometer. I do not know whether the lactometer is used now for determining the percentage of milk fats, but this I do know, and my friends on the other side know it, that the quality of the milk, coming from each cow in the bawn, is or ought to be known by every farmer who supplies milk in this country, particularly by the farmer who supplies it to be sold to the little children.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where under any provision of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts a person is guilty of having sold to the prejudice of the purchaser as whole milk any article of food which is not whole milk as defined by this Act and the Court is satisfied that the said article has been adulterated or impoverished by the admixture with it of any other substance, he shall be liable in case of a first offence to a fine not exceeding £20 or imprisonment with or without hard labour for one month; or for a second or subsequent offence to a fine of not exceeding £100 or imprisonment with or without hard labour for six months or both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present law provides that for a first offence a maximum fine of £20 may be imposed; that for a second offence a maximum fine of £50 may be imposed, and for subsequent offences <Col N="868" /> a fine not exceeding £100 may be imposed.  Imprisonment may not be imposed unless the offence is punishable by a fine over £50.  That is to say, there must be two fines before a man is liable to imprisonment.  I am not at all satisfied that the wording of this amendment does wholly what I would like to do and does only what I would like to have done, but my aim has been to make it possible to punish by imprisonment a person who has deliberately, maliciously, and fraudulently adulterated his milk whether for the first or second time, but certainly for the second time.  I want to differentiate between the person for whom Senator Wilson has been speaking, the person who has committed an offence of selling an article below standard quality, and that other person who, in order to make more money out of his trade, deliberately adulterates milk.  If a magistrate has evidence that a person has deliberately adulterated his milk, or has deliberately abstracted the fats from milk to bring it to the standard that is the minimum, then I think if the magistrate is satisfied as to the heniousness of that offence he should be empowered not merely to fine but to imprison.  I think it is not enough to say that a person may commit the offence of deliberate adulteration of milk a first and a second time without the risk even of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It was with the object of getting some alteration in the scale of penalties that I put down this amendment. I think it is important that the public should realise that the legislature feels that it is an offence punishable by imprisonment to deliberately defraud the public by adulterating milk.  That is the object of the amendment.  If the amendment is defective in drafting&mdash;I think it is, but if the House is agreeable that there should be some greater punishment than a mere fine for such offence&mdash;then any defect in drafting can be remedied.  I would trust the Minister to produce in form and drafting an amendment to carry out the object I have in view.</P>

If it is carried, I think it will have more effect in securing the purity and quality of milk than any other piece of legislation that has been produced for many a day.</P>

      <P>I oppose the amendment. All the objections put up against the amendment which I tabled could equally be urged against this amendment.  If we could have a definition by which we could be certain that water had been added to milk, nobody would have the smallest objection if the fine and imprisonment, which the Senator has set out in his amendment, were imposed on an offender, but he has not given any indication of how that could be ascertained.  I think it was clearly proved in the discussion on my amendment, and also on Second Reading, that milk may fall below the standard fixed by the Minister.  The only conclusion that a court can come to in that case is that water has been added, otherwise there would be no reason for the prosecution.  In that case, according to Senator Johnson, the man should be put into jail and fined a considerable amount for a thing for which he might be in no way responsible and which he possibly could not avoid.  If Senator Johnson would insert some drastic definition or something approaching a definition by which the court can be sure that the man prosecuted is guilty of the offence then I would agree with the amendment but, in present circumstances, I oppose it because it is not clearly set out how the man can be found to have added water or adulterated the milk.</P>

From another angle that difficulty has been emphasised by Senator Counihan.  Under this amendment the producer of the milk would be held liable for an offence that might not have been committed by his personal act.  The adulteration might take place subsequent to the milk leaving the producer's premises, perhaps by some person who was an intermediary, and the producer would be held liable for imprisonment under this amendment.</P>

      <P>My trouble is how you are going to prove the adulteration unless you saw the adulteration in process of being carried out?  Is it likely that you would have evidence of that, or that anybody who had been a witness to the adulteration, would be likely to come forward in court to prove the case?  I think the amendment is rather drastic and that the penalties already provided are a sufficient safeguard for the public. Adulteration is rather difficult to define to my mind.  It is conceivable, at any rate, that there can be additions to milk, which under this proposed amendment would be technical adulteration. Such addition might mean an improvement in the nutritive value of the milk.  For instance, if sugar were added to the milk it would be &ldquo;another substance,&rdquo; and under this amendment it would come, I am afraid, under the category of adulteration.  I do not suppose it is likely that sugar would be added to milk for the purpose of improving its nutritive qualities, but at the same time there is the possibility. We have had so much discussion on the possibility of honest producers getting <Col N="871" /> into trouble under the law that I do not think we should offer any further enticement in the law to catch these honest purveyors.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the proposed amendment, for the reason that I think the placing of severe penalties in a section has rather a deterrent effect on those who are engaged in the prosecution and a deterrent effect on the presiding justice to make an order for conviction.  The disgrace of the consequences of a conviction for anything in the nature of food adulteration has been stressed earlier in the debate.  It was pointed out that that was likely to be followed by grave injury to a man's remaining in the trade or business.  There is no necessity in my opinion, to impose upon him a penalty of so large a sum as £20 or £100 for a second conviction.  The mere fact that he was liable to such heavy penalties would probably have the result that he would not be convicted if there was any possibility of his escape.  Besides, this kind of legislation which suggests the imposition of penalties of a very severe character, should not, I think, meet with the approval of the House if the result aimed at can be brought about by other means.  I therefore oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with a fundamental food of the people.  In most working class areas it is not an unusual thing to get a fairly low grade of milk.  Because of this low grade of milk great numbers of working-class children die in their early years.  If the Seanad feels that the penalties suggested in this amendment are too drastic for the purveyors of this milk, I would ask Senators to put the lives of the children against the penalties, and say on what side the balance lies.  Remember we are legislating for the lives of the children of this State.  In my opinion, no penalty could be too drastic to prevent the starvation or malnutrition of babies or children of the working class.  It has been argued by Senator Lynch that because you have high penalties it has <Col N="872" /> an effect on those whose duty it is to administer the law.  I think that is an extraordinary statement.  I believe if we are to safeguard the lives of the children the penalties could not be too drastic to deter people who are prepared to sell low-grade milk to the children&mdash;the principal food of young children in this State.</P>

      <P>The infant mortality in the City of Dublin is attributable as to 100 per cent. to housing conditions, and the suggestion that the loss of life is due to bad milk is a fairy tale. Senator Foran speaks of low-grade milk in the poorer districts.  It is high-grade milk at a low price. Because it is sold at such a low price it is not appreciated.  The Senator knows nothing whatever about the milk which is sold in these districts, because he gets his milk delivered at the door.  There is a very considerable number of officers supervising the milk supplied in these districts.  I say, without hesitation, that the value received in the case of this particular article of food is out of all proportion to the value received in nearly every other article of food.  I should not like it to go out that low-grade milk is being supplied in these areas.  The conditions under which the milk is produced and sold are subject to the keenest inspection by the sanitary authorities, and it is, as a matter of fact, in the poorer districts sometimes that the surplus of highest grade milk is sold&mdash;Grade A milk or milk coming from tuberculin tested cows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the amendment, but the trouble is that it is too drastic.  We have heard Senator Foran and Senator Wilson talk about milk.  I am supposed to know nothing whatever about it, but I have seen milk produced and sold.  I am glad to say that I drink it and I am very fond of it.  As far as I am concerned, I do not need any test for milk.  I can pour out milk into a glass jug and I can know whether the proportion of cream on it is right <Col N="873" /> or wrong.  If one goes up to Kingsbridge and examines the cans of milk that arrive there one will find dirt in the bottom of the same can every evening.  Probably the milk in 99 cans out of 100 is clean, but you will get the same dirty can from the same farmer every evening.  That is the reason that I should like to see measures taken to remedy that state of affairs.  On the other hand, the punishment suggested is too drastic.  I should like to make it as drastic as possible, but I do not think that we shall achieve what we desire by making it too drastic.  Senator Wilson does not agree that there is a cheap grade of milk sold in Dublin.  I know there is.  I know that the best milk in Dublin is bought at about 1/8 or 1/9 per gallon&mdash;tubercle-free milk.  A lot of that is given out free, and justly so, because it is intended for children, and they should get only the best.  However, I can bring the Senator into back streets in Dublin where milk is sold at 1d. per pint.  Is that milk?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of this amendment but I think that it is too drastic for a first offender. There is one thing which I should like Senator Johnson to bring out more clearly in the amendment.  The amendment speaks of milk that has been adulterated by the admixture with it of any other substance.  If we take the analogy of cream, I believe that the producers are allowed to preserve the cream with a certain proportion of <Col N="874" /> boric acid.  It is very hard to judge the amount of preservative which has been added to cream.  Sometimes they turn the cream into a kind of fluid carrion.  There is a great deal of nonsense talked about the incidence of tuberculosis as coming directly from milk, but I think that bovine tuberculosis accounts for only about 3 per cent. of tuberculosis in children.  What does cause mortality amongst children, arising directly from housing, is summer diarrhoea.  In summer, there used to be 250 per thousand children under one year lost on account of the fermentation of milk.  With regard to the methods of pasteurising milk, I suppose the deadliest method of adding to the poisonous effect of milk is pasteurising it.  Pasteurising does not boil it, but it promotes the growth of bacteria and particularly the colon bacteria, the intestinal microbe from the cow.  That, getting into the child's intestine, causes this disease, which is very like dysentery, and kills the child.  Housing helps the milk to sour.</P>
      <P>When milk is preserved with boric acid, it means that the child merely waits for a double dose of that, plus the effect of the chemical preservation, which interferes with the child's resistance, because the preserved milk lodges in such a part of the child's intestine that the child is unable to resist it.  It is very important to bring out clearly that there will be no excuse for a dairyman to say: &ldquo;We are allowed to use it in cream and it is not adulteration of milk.&rdquo;  It is the very opposite of adulteration, but it can be more deadly and, I think, the only thing is a just punishment for the crime.  It must also be remembered that, taking all the different breeds of cows, each of them, without anything being put in the milk, may give milk which will come almost under the law in cases in which the milk is so low in solids as to be considered adulterated. The cows which give 1,800 gallons a year, or whatever the figure is, can hardly be expected to have sufficiently rich milk to escape stringent inspectorship. Water is not any harm in milk at all.  It does not kill the nutritive value of milk, provided it is clean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a dairyman once, and when one <Col N="875" /> of my children was young, the milk he supplied turned yellow on the child's bib, so I went to the chemical department at the Dublin Corporation.  They were out, and it was difficult to get an analysis, but, finally, when the analysis was got, they lost the specimen or the report.  There is not enough provision for immediate pathological reports in Dublin.  It should be an immediate thing.  The roughest test one can make is to put the milk into a long tube and see how quickly it foams.  That indicates the presence of something from the intestine of the cow and it is a deadly thing.  It is not so much a question of tuberculosis but pasteurisation which forms and attracts all the nocuous bacteria.  If the inspectorship is stringent enough, very few dairymen will be anxious to adulterate milk.  The danger lies in the transmission of the milk.  If the fellow who drives the milk car is generous, he may make up a deficiency by adding a little water, but water is not as deadly as boric acid, and boric acid is not as deadly as these conditions whereby milk is exposed to contamination, such as housing.  Bad housing means that every form of food in these houses is exposed to contamination.</P>
    <P>In supporting this amendment, I think it is only a matter of knowing what really does cover the addition of other substances, but I would suggest that it be made to read &ldquo;other substances, whether for preservation or not.&rdquo;  It is then a matter for humanity to arrange about the first offence, because heavy punishment will only drive a man completely out of business and the offence may not altogether be directly attributable to the milk farmer. I know myself of instances in which a milk farmer was mulcted when the offence was usually committed by the milkman, who thus got his master into trouble.  There is another aspect of the matter.  If everything is to be so completely chemically pure, where is human resistance to come in?  If you live in a healthy country and come in to such conditions as are provided by a city like Dublin, you will succumb at once. When Guinness's labourers came from the country, they very quickly fell a prey to tuberculosis, and that was one <Col N="876" /> of the reasons why the great brewery made special housing provisions for its staff.  In the same way, short of murderous conditions in milk, a little freedom from too much preservation and sterilisation is not any harm.  I have great pleasure in supporting anything that prevents chemical adulteration, as we will call it, in milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with penalties and not with qualities of milk or the other properties of milk. It deals with penalties for fraud.  The Minister has reminded us that the principal Act was passed in 1875.  We are a long way from 1875.  There have been 60 years of development of social consciousness, and, in 1875, we were just about the period when Mr. John Bright spoke of adulteration as merely another form of competition.  There was no very strong public opinion against adulteration&mdash;it was only just beginning to develop&mdash;and that was the period when they imposed fines for the adulteration of food and drugs.  I submit that we have advanced somewhat since 1875 in regard to our views as to the necessity for the protection of the public against fraud, particularly in regard to food and drugs.  But even in regard to the whole range of food and drugs, milk stands out as of special importance because it is of primary value to young people and because adulteration or impoverishment by artificial means cannot so easily be detected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are legislating specifically in regard to that portion of the food which is referred to in the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, known as milk, and because we are specially legislating in respect to milk, I want to make it clear that the Legislature is specially interested in preserving the quality of the milk and in punishing people who are guilty of deliberate impoverishment and deliberate adulteration of milk even more than other cases covered by the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.  A man may deliberately, and even before witnesses, water milk and he is only subject, <Col N="877" /> on the first occasion, to a fine of £20, with no possibility of being sent to jail.  He may commit the same offence a second time, it being absolutely proved that he has watered the milk, and again, he can only be fined. He cannot be imprisoned, and not until the Justice has found him guilty a third time, with the possibility of a fine exceeding £50, may he be sent to prison.  I submit that we ought to differentiate between the penalty that is attributable to deliberate adulteration of milk as distinguished from any ordinary offence, in regard, say, to the regulation of street traffic.</P>
    <P>We fine people for a minor offence. Are we prepared to say that this is still a minor offence?  I think we ought at least to provide that where there is deliberate adulteration&mdash;proved to the Justice to be deliberate&mdash;it ought to be possible for him to send the person responsible to prison and, however it may be done, whatever form the amendment of law may take, it seems to me to be very desirable so that the law may be strengthened in that respect and that the fraudulent adulterator of milk should not be let pass as being merely in the category of a minor offender which is signified by the fine.</P>

      <P>There are just two points on which I want to say a word and I will deal with Senator Gogarty's point first, as to the desirability of adding &ldquo;preservatives&rdquo; to this amendment. It is a statutory offence under the Public Health Acts at the present time to add preservatives to milk.  That is already covered by the Public Health (Saorstát Eireann) (Preservatives, etc., in Food) Regulations of 1928 and it is a statutory offence under these regulations to add preservatives of any kind to milk or cream.  I mention that for Senator Gogarty's information, and to put his mind at ease on that particular point.  It is an important point, if it had not already been covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> With regard to Senator Johnson's amendment, there is danger, I think, of grave injustice to a seller of milk under that amendment.  Where a person is guilty of having sold milk to the prejudice of the purchaser, the seller of the milk is going to be held responsible and liable to imprisonment if it is proved in court that certain things have happened regarding that milk&mdash;if it does not reach a certain standard of purity or if it has been adulterated. The seller of the milk, however, may have no knowledge of it whatever.  The dairyman or milkman who distributes the milk to the consumers may have adulterated the milk without the knowledge or consent of the man who produced the milk or the man who is technically the seller of the milk.  There is a real possibility of the honest man being caught under this amendment, and I have far more sympathy for the honest purveyor in this instance than I had in relation to the other amendment.</P>

There is a dance hall at the Depôt in which the recruits and their friends occasionally hold ceilidhthe, and it would be absurd if the Gárda Síochána, which is the enforcing authority, had to obtain licences for their own hall.

      <P>A tribunal such as the motion proposes to establish might do good.  Knowledge is always a good thing.  But it seems to me it might also do a great deal of harm.  It depends <Col N="883" /> upon what lines the inquiry is conducted. If fads and preconceived ideas as to how the fruit grading industry can be reformed are followed too fast, very easily more harm than good might be done.  I propose to explain what I mean.  First, in the matter of handling, how is that to be dealt with?  You have the age-old difficulty that if you want expert knowledge on a tribunal of that sort you get interested parties, and you might not then get the best results for the public as a whole.  You can get expert knowledge by sworn evidence, and I am inclined to think that in this kind of inquiry the personnel should be a judicial one, consisting of people with a judicial turn of mind, especially the Chairman, who would be able to weigh and sift evidence from outside.  This is one of the things in which, if there was interference, it might carry people too far.  What regulates the price of good looking fruit in the market?  I refer to fruit that is put to the front in shop windows and gets the highest price. That is foreign fruit which is not grown in this country.  Why does such fruit get the highest prices?  Because it is graded and packed free from blemish. I believe foreign fruit is free from blemish largely because the climate from which it comes makes it much easier to keep it in condition.  That does not mean that it tastes as well as even the humble apple that is grown in this country.  Another thing that counts in the production of fruit, such as I have described, is that it is grown on an immense scale and graded.  I do not know if it is possible, by better methods on the part of producers, to enter into the market that is here.  I see great difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very undesirable if, by passing a resolution of this kind, we should set going a movement that would do more harm than good.  I know that the methods which will have to be adopted if you are going to produce equally nice-looking fruit as the fruit produced in these other places are very expensive, because I have seen them in operation.  For instance, there is the question of spraying the fruit trees.  Where fruit is grown on a very large scale it would be practically impossible to spray the trees by hand, <Col N="884" /> and they are sprayed by the use of power.  Then there is also a power-driven grading belt.  The one that I saw was driven by electric machinery. The apples are brought in in boxes, and when they are picked the people bring them to the belt at one end, and at the other end each one is packed in a particular kind of box that suits its grade, and so on.  All that is very expensive.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of storage. I believe that it is perfectly possible&mdash; and it actually is done&mdash;to keep apples that were picked in the autumn in perfect eating condition as late as May, but that cannot be done without considerable expense, because you must have a house or barn which is specially suitable as regards the non-conduction of either heat or cold.  Such houses or barns are not to be found all over the place, especially in this country.  In fact, they do not exist in this country, I believe.  In the farm that I saw the temperature is kept a few degrees above freezing point, and, of course, it will be readily recognised that in order to do that you must have specially thick walls and thick roofs and other special arrangements.  I understand that this farm pays its owner very well, but he informed me that he does not consider that it is possible to work that kind of business profitably or satisfactorily with a less acreage than 70 acres of fruit, and in that case it is intensively cultivated.  That is to say that between the fruit trees there are fruit bushes and also vegetables planted, all of which represents a very considerable quantity of cultivation and involves the employment of a great many hands and a big outlay.</P>
    <P>I know that it is a very good thing to have in a country a business which employs a great many people and so on, but let us look at the market end of it. Although I know that part of this inquiry is concerned with the ascertaining of what markets are available, I can see that there will be a great many obvious difficulties.  If one is content to assume that the information I have given is more or less correct and that the kind of farm engaged in the production of high-class fruit can only be run on large farms of 70 acres, it means <Col N="885" /> that you will produce very great quantities of fruit and that you must have a very good market for them.  Such markets are very few in this country. We have very few big cities, and the sort of market you want for that kind of business is the market you will find in the great cities of England, which have large populations ready to pay high prices for fruit of this kind.  That kind of market does not exist here, and it must be remembered that the market on the other side of the Channel is not under our control and may not be available. Those are our great natural difficulties.</P>
    <P>In this country I believe that the really big thing as regards fruit growing is the small grower.  There are thousands of people who produce fruit on a very small scale as a sort of adjunct to their garden or farm, and that fruit, of course, is not graded.  It is not a very ornamental fruit, although it may be very good to eat, and it does not fetch a good price in the market. That is a thing that we would all like to see improved, but I do not know how you would remedy that sort of thing.  It seems to be a business that would naturally require high protection in this country and the high protection that would be necessary probably would not be fair to the consumer.  Anybody can see, travelling around the country, that there are a great deal more of these small producers than there used to be &mdash;they have certainly increased very much since I was a boy&mdash;but their production is on a small scale.  However, I consider that it is a very good thing to have these small producers.  It is mostly apples that are produced, and the people who produce them will eat some of them themselves, naturally, and that is a very good thing for their health&mdash;&ldquo;An apple a day keeps the doctor away,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) (i) of this motion requires producers to grade, pack and mark their fruit and vegetables in a manner to be prescribed by law.  It does not make any differentiation, however, as regards the different kinds of producers.  It only requires them to grade, pack and mark the fruit in a manner to be prescribed by law.  I suggest that that is entirely impracticable <Col N="886" /> in the case of the kind of producer to which I have referred, and I believe that that kind of producer is the natural type of producer in this country.  I think that if that requirement is enforced it will make the position of the small producers worse than it is now, and I consider that that would be a calamity.  It would mean that even the small remuneration that is got out of it at present would dwindle to nothing at all.  They would go out of the market altogether and there would be nothing left for them to do but to cut down the trees.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether a tribunal of this kind is really going to be productive of much practical results.  As far as I can see, it will lead to the mere ascertaining of information, but if that is all it is to lead to I think it would be better that no inquiry should take place.  I am doubtful as to whether or not to vote for this motion, but I will be guided by whatever information is produced in the course of the debate.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. At least, there is one good point in it, and that is that it proposes to ask the tribunal, when making their representations, to see that the producer will get an equitable return for his labour.  I think that the motion will have very little opposition, but I should like to ask the Minister to explain why he is tackling only two of the least important branches of agricultural industry. First, he is tackling fruit and vegetables, which mean only thousands to this country, and he is neglecting the marketing of the more important branches, such as the live-stock market.</P>

      <P>At all events, I can say that a tribunal was set up some five <Col N="887" /> or six years ago to inquire into the marketing of live stock.  It was known as the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, and the principal cause of its setting up was the transport and other charges by carrying companies and the management of the ports.  The tribunal visited every port in Ireland, and took evidence at most of the important places. It even went to the important centres in England and Scotland, and, I believe, to the Continent also.  It spent considerable time in collecting all the information and taking evidence.  The cattle trade was invited to give evidence before it, and we went to considerable expense in instructing counsel to give evidence.  An exhaustive report was made, and that report is still lying on the shelves of the Ministry for Industry and Commerce.  We are asked here to set up another tribunal to inquire into a much less important branch of the industry, and we do not know whether, after going to all the expense of having this tribunal set up and taking evidence, it is going to meet the same fate as the Ports and Harbours Tribunal.  Why is not some notice taken of the report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal and some legislative effect given to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several other products of the agricultural industry which would require enquiring into.  For instance, there are the charges of the markets. The Dublin Market, and most city and town authorities, think that the farmers are there to produce cheap food for the urban and city dwellers, and at the same time to provide sources of remuneration through the market charges.  The Dublin Market used to produce £17,000 a year of a profit for the Dublin Corporation. Time and time again we have tried to get these charges reduced, without any effect.  The Minister for Agriculture has not given us very much help in it, but the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is dead against us.  In pre-war days the charge was 3d. per beast.  During the war the tolls were raised to a 1/- for a short time, and then dropped to 9d., and they are still at 9d., although cattle are making so little at the <Col N="888" /> present time.  As well as that, there is a charge of £1 per pen per year. Every salesman who is allotted a pen is charged £1, as well as the 9d. in tolls for every animal he has there.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the marketing of other classes of agricultural produce.  I have known cases of hay being brought into the Dublin market and the charges were so high that the producer was brought into debt to the factor.  All those classes of agricultural produce are just as important as fruit and vegetables and I should like some assurance from the Minister that something would be done with regard to these other classes which are quite as important as fruit and vegetables.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give this motion general approval.  I think that it is very likely to bring about a great deal of good.  A great amount of vegetables and fruit is going to waste throughout the country that could be much better utilised if the thing was properly organised.  There is one thing about this that strikes me as being very curious.  It is well known that transport is the most important thing with regard to the marketing of vegetables and fruit, especially the handling and speedy marketing and the cheapness.  These, to my mind, are probably the most important things of all in connection with the production and marketing of fruit and vegetables. That being so, it is curious that there is no mention at all about transport in the terms of reference of this proposed tribunal.  I think it would be a great mistake to allow the motion to pass without including in it a proposal with regard to the transport, collection and so on, of fruit and vegetables, which require such careful handling, so as to ensure speedy transmission to the market.  I think that that would be a suitable thing to include.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion asks the tribunal to consider &ldquo;what steps, if any, should be taken to require producers to grade, pack and mark their fruit and vegetables in a manner to be prescribed by law.&rdquo;  It seems to me that that is a rather drastic proposal to ask this <Col N="889" /> House to adopt when we take into consideration that nothing is said at all about the means of transport&mdash;requiring the tribunal to inquire into the cheapness and speed of transport at the disposal of fruit farms and so on.  It seems to me to be a rather vital omission to leave out all mention of the question of transport in the terms of reference to the tribunal.  I believe that it would be a valuable thing to put the production and the marketing of fruit and vegetables in an economic condition, but I also believe that that cannot be done without the co-operation of transport and without some Government regulation dealing with it. If there is to be any regulation of transport, I think that both rail and road ought to be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in this motion provision is made for an inquiry into transport facilities, because paragraph (e) of the motion speaks of providing &ldquo;marketing facilities which will secure to the producer an equitable return for fruit and vegetables,&rdquo; etc. From that it appears to me that an inquiry would be had into all the facilities necessary for bringing the vegetable from where it grows to where it is sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">

      <P>&ldquo;Either by regulation of existing markets or by the provision and subsequent regulation of new markets or by a system of direct dealing between producers and consumers, whether individually or collectively.&rdquo;  I understood that paragraph to mean that this tribunal would have power to inquire into everything connected with the fruit from the time it is plucked from the tree until it is sold.  However, if it does not cover that, I agree with Senator Dillon that such an inquiry ought to be within the power of the tribunal.  If it does not, of course, the Minister will tell us.  What I am concerned with chiefly is the speech made by my friend Senator Counihan, who seems to think that the trade in fruit and vegetables is a small one.  On the contrary, it is a tremendous business. It is continually growing, and growing <Col N="890" /> very rapidly.  In this matter I think that our soil and climate are eminently suitable for the growing of fruit, particularly of apples and stone fruit of various kinds.  We have a splendid soil and a suitable climate for producing the best fruit, not merely for home consumption but for export also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is supporting it in a sort of left-handed way that seems to indicate that his right hand is for the bullock all the time.  I am also in favour of fat cattle, but I think it is necessary that the people should begin to learn that there is plenty of employment and great profits to be derived from the production and sale of fruit.  We should not forget that the consumption of fruit in all countries is increasing very rapidly. I am sorry to say that our farmers are very ignorant in the matter of growing and grading fruit.  I went to a fruiterer's shop the other day and saw some foreign apples there.  They were beautifully marketed.  There was no blemish on them.  Then I looked at a barrel of apples.  I asked: &ldquo;What about the apples in the barrel?&rdquo; and was told &ldquo;They are the same kind of apples; in fact they are better apples. They are Irish apples and we are selling them at one-third of the price of the imported apples.&rdquo;  Why?  Because instead of being carefully picked and carefully packed they were shaken off the tree and thrown into a barrel, and they were full of scabs and dinges. The result was that an apple of better quality, better size and better shape coming from a more suitable soil and a more suitable climate was selling at one-third of the price of the imported apple, and all because proper attention had not been paid to the marketing of the apple and because the farmer&mdash;I include myself amongst the farmers&mdash; had not the knowledge of the foreign producer.  He had not his knowledge or skill and was not required to exercise the same amount of knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great change coming over the world and the sooner that change is realised the better.  The sooner our <Col N="891" /> farmers realise that if they have anything to sell they should have it in the most perfect condition the better it will be for us.  This is a great and a growing trade.  There are areas in this country that are now almost barren winterages.  Senator Counihan knows what these are.  There are in some places 2,000 acres of them.  They would provide the most magnificent ground in the world for the growing of apples and fruit.  Now that we have a growing population we must begin to think of matters of that kind, and the only way that we can go into this market, or any market, is by having our commodity as perfect as care and attention and grading can make it.  For that reason I congratulate the Minister in having introduced this motion.  I hope that he will proceed with the setting up of this tribunal.  I am glad that he is devoting his attention to it.  In the terrible position in which he is, he must be a very busy man.  I am sure my friend Senator Counihan will agree with that, but as I was saying I am very glad that, even in the circumstances in which he is placed, the Minister is devoting his attention to this question of the growing and marketing of fruit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak for a part of the country that would be more interested in this motion than, perhaps, any other part of Ireland with the exception, perhaps, of the County Armagh, which does not come under our jurisdiction.  The southern part of the County Wexford has always&mdash;when I say always I mean for centuries&mdash; been devoted to fruit growing and gardening.  Numerous writers have said that that is due to our foreign extraction.  However, I am not going to go into that matter now.  I cannot agree with Senator Comyn that fruit growers are ignorant.  In part of South Wexford we have given the greatest attention to the growing and marketing of apples.  The old Department of Agriculture did an enormous lot to encourage the planting of orchards and gardens, with the result that practically every farm has an orchard though none of them may be very large.  I was much <Col N="892" /> impressed by the speech that Senator Bagwell made.  I think it was the best we heard.  One of the reasons why it is difficult to market Irish apples is that, as compared with foreign apples, 90 per cent. of them are of the cooking varieties.  They are easier to grow. They are harder than the dessert varieties.  The foreign apples are sweet and more palatable than Irish apples, and, as Senator Bagwell has very well said, they come from countries where they can be properly ripened.</P>
      <P>My own experience has taught me that when we have cold, wet summers our apples do not ripen at all.  They remain hard and sour.  No matter how long you keep them they never get sweet.  These belong to the large cooking varieties which we grow.  Taking an average orchard, I would say that eight or ten out of every dozen trees in it would be Bramley seedlings, and those of the large cooking varieties. These grow better in our climate than the other varieties.  If you keep them they do not become eatable until January or February.  They never become very sweet and will not sell as well as dessert apples.  That is one difficulty, that we do not produce to any great extent dessert apples or apples which are palatable to the taste. My own experience is that the others keep better, and I have been growing apples every year.  There is then difficulty, when you do produce apples, of finding a market for them, due largely to the distance that most growers live from a large centre of population like Dublin.  There is very little demand for fruit in the small country towns&mdash;not to any extent any way.  Take this last season.  The best price offered for very large, well coloured developed apples was 6/- per long hundred.  That would not encourage anyone to grow apples or to market them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take into account the trouble of grading them and of bringing them into the market, of taking them around from door to door to sell, the Senator will agree that the price is very poor.  I welcome <Col N="893" /> the motion because I know that numbers of people will be delighted if anything can be done to improve the market for Irish apples.  I am not finding fault with what is proposed.  I am merely pointing out the difficulties that growers have to contend with.  Senator Dillon spoke on the question of transport. I imagine that the charge for sending apples over a distance of, say, 100 miles to the City of Dublin would be absolutely prohibitive.  The great difficulty is that unless we can improve matters we have not, for reasons due largely to climatic conditions, the quality of apples to enable us to compete with the foreign apples.  The tribunal may be able to discover some better quality of apples, and, if so, people should be encouraged to grow them.  As it is, we have an over production of apples of the cooking varieties.  I think it is ludicrous to compare such a small thing as the growing of fruit, as Senator Comyn did, with our great agricultural industry.  At best it is only a little side-show.</P>

      <P>I am very doubtful about this motion.  It may do a certain amount of good, but it may do a great deal more harm.  I take it that what the Minister is proposing is to set up an inquiry with statutory powers under an Act of Parliament such as the Food Prices Tribunal, of which I myself was chairman some years ago.  A tribunal of that kind would have power to call witnesses, to insist on seeing accounts. In fact, it would have the power of the High Court and could commit for contempt of court.  The Act under which such tribunals are set up makes them practically a court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal; of which I was chairman <Col N="894" /> and which made a very elaborate report, sat for about 18 months.  The great difficulty we had was the getting of evidence that was of any use.  We were able to get it under our compulsory powers, by choosing a certain number of shopkeepers in each of the towns in which we sat and compelling them to come before us and produce their books.  That is not the kind of evidence that will be procurable for the tribunal which is contemplated in this motion.  I should like the Minister to say where he expects to get evidence and what kind of evidence he expects to get on matters that are mentioned as the terms of reference for this tribunal.  There are no producers of fruit in this country really in the ordinary sense, that is to say, men who make the production of fruit their business.  There are one or two perhaps in the northern counties where fruit is generally grown.  Armagh is one of these counties.  I know Armagh very intimately.  I spent a good deal of my younger days there and I was at school there.  I know it very thoroughly and I know that fruit growing there is only a by-product of farming and a very small by-product at that.</P>
    <P>Some farms had to grow fruit compulsorily because under the old leases made before the Land Acts, the English companies who owned lands in Armagh, Derry and other counties insisted on a certain number of orchards being attached to the farms.  I know that in County Armagh except in the case of one or two orchards that are carried on in connection with jam factories, fruit growing has never been a paying proposition.  They have one good year out of three, one middling year and one bad year.  That is in the case of apples and strawberries.  Down here, except in the case of County Kerry which Senator The McGillicuddy knows better than I do, I do not know of any place where fruit is grown on any considerable scale and I do not think you will find anything in the way of large orchards down there.</P>
    <P>Where are you going to get evidence for this tribunal in the Free State? What will the people be able to tell <Col N="895" /> you?  What will the people be able to suggest?  I should like very much if the Minister could inform us because I should be very glad indeed if a profitable fruit growing industry could be started in this country.</P>
    <P>May I mention just one other matter?  There was one remarkable exception to the absolute absence of successful marketing of fruit in the southern towns which we visited and that was the City of Limerick.  The fruit and vegetables supplied to the City of Limerick do not come from farms.  They come from the gardens of the people who live around Limerick and who have large gardens.  They have set up a market of their own where they have an auctioneer.  Three times a week they bring in their stuff to that market and grade it.  We saw them do it.  That stuff is not sold to a dealer.  They will not take a bid from a dealer.  It is sold direct to the customer and the market is a magnificent success.  If you can get a marketing system of that kind established in other towns you might do some good. It is my experience, having gone round the country, that this tribunal will have considerable difficulty in getting evidence.  As to the marking of fruit in the City of Dublin, it is anything but what it should be.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Comyn's description of his experience in buying Irish apples instead of foreign apples led us on to speak of apples and nothing else under this motion, but this motion covers every type of vegetable and fruit that can be grown in this country.  It covers tomatoes, mushrooms, lettuce and so on, all of which can be grown with the greatest of ease.  I agree to a certain extent with the remarks about apples.  The types of apples grown by farmers in this country are generally cookers&mdash;Bramleys and others&mdash;principally on account of the fact that they take the least trouble to grow.  The farmer does not consider spraying or doing anything to improve the quality. He does not even shake down the tree. He gets a dealer to come along who buys the produce of the whole orchard at so much and who agrees to take it <Col N="896" /> away with the least trouble to the farmer, I admit that, by giving them adequate attention, apples as good as are grown anywhere else can be grown in this country and I think a great deal could be done by developing the production of apples.  Of course, according to the policy of the Government, it can only be done in combination with a quota and tariff system.  I am not going to elaborate on that point now.  I think that certain fruits and vegetables can be grown in this country with very considerable success&mdash;vegetables such as tomatoes and lettuce.  I do not think you will get farmers and ordinary growers to take up the production of apples unless they have in some way a guaranteed price.  They will not go to the trouble of producing suitable boxes and packing materials unless they get a reasonable price for them.  With this guaranteed price you will find the farmer growing apples and certainly tomatoes, which they can pack very easily and which are very much in demand in the southern parts of the country at any rate.  I think some good can be done by this tribunal if they inquire into this question seriously.</P>

In certain years, the price paid is a good one but then there are years, such as the present one, when a man finds, after bringing his vegetables to the market and paying his market dues, that he is in debt to the auctioneer.  That is happening at the present time in connection with loads of cabbage brought to Dublin. This time last year there was a great price for cabbage, as much as £3 or £4 per load.  At the present time the best Savoy cabbage is being sold at 4/- per load.  The point I want to bring out is that if you had a tribunal to inquire into these matters and to devise some means by which the market could be made more regular, there would be a possibility of making some <Col N="897" /> profit by growing vegetables.  Of course there is a wide field for the growth of green peas and stuff of that nature.  I understand that in Limerick, Matterson's are packing peas grown by themselves.  In County Dublin there is a fruit farm which is run on a very extensive scale and the products of that farm are being utilised in jam making.  It is giving a lot of employment and is a great acquisition to the county.  It is an undoubted success, but a similar farm which was operated in another area was a failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tendency in the vicinity of Dublin to go in for producing vegetables and fruit under glass and that is all to the good.  Inquiry into matters of that sort is essential, so that the farmers engaged in this work may have a reasonable chance of success.  I am not so very much concerned about Wexford, because as things are now going, the advantage of proximity to the city is being dissipated by motor haulage, and our high valuations and the taxes which we have to pay in consequence have handicapped us against these outsiders&mdash;foreigners as I call them.  I think we should get protection. There is, however, a very big business in growing cabbage following early potatoes.  The usual course is to plant early potatoes which are marketed immediately in June.  They are followed by cabbage, which is also marketed immediately, and that is followed by wheat.  That is intensive farming and it is the proper method. Of course the seasons have a lot to do with the success of these crops.  Sometimes cabbage will not grow, but that is probably the best year, because it means that there will not be many plants, and the man who has taken care of his plants and watered them when necessary, will get a good profit. Unfortunately there has been such a lot of rain this year that the market is now glutted.  There are acres of cabbage which it is not worth while to take out of the ground.  I do not know what the prices are in the shops, but certainly the farmer is getting less than nothing. He has to pay the factor; he has to pay the man's wages, and he has to be out at 2 o'clock in the morning, otherwise <Col N="898" /> he would be at the end of string of carts getting into the market.  An inquiry into that matter is badly needed.  I am not going to touch on the marketing of hay, but there is a grievance undoubtedly there.  I think it lies with the Corporation.  They charge 1d. per cwt., a price which is associated with war times.  A charge of 2/6 for weighing 30 cwt. of hay is scandalous, but we have no redress.  The Corporation will not reduce it, but I do not think the Minister will be inclined to enter on a subject of that kind.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise a point that Senator Brown touched upon regarding the matter of procedure.  I think it is important that we should realise, when a motion of this kind is introduced by the phrase &ldquo;that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into certain definite matters of urgent public importance,&rdquo; that that means that the tribunal is to be established with very wide powers.  It is not merely a commission of inquiry. It is, in effect, a court with limited jurisdiction.  I wonder whether it is a good practice, to follow as is done in this motion, the procedure which was originally established for really urgent affairs?  I am not quarrelling with it in this case, but let us bear in mind that the tribunal which is to be established has very great powers.  As Senator Brown has pointed out, it has power to compel witnesses to attend, to compel the production of documents and, if necessary, to commit persons for contempt. Perhaps the Minister will give us some intimation, before we pass this motion, as to what is intended regarding the composition of a court with such powers.  I think the fact that it is obligatory under the Act which will set up this tribunal, that a resolution such as this shall be passed by both Houses before the Ministry has power to set up such a tribunal, indicates how important it was thought to be when the Act was passed, and we should at least advert to the fact that it is no ordinary commission of inquiry.  It is a tribunal with very extensive powers, <Col N="899" /> and when the Legislature is asked to approve of the establishment of such a tribunal, it should be aware of the powers that have been given to the tribunal.</P>

      <P>May I say a few words? I have spoken once and I do not wish to open a new issue, but I said that I would be guided in my vote by what arose out of the debate.  It seems to be a certainty that this motion will be voted for by a majority of the House. For reasons which I have given, I should like paragraph (e) (i) to be altered.  It reads:</P>
      <P>to require producers to grade, pack and mark their fruit and vegetables in a manner to be prescribed by law.</P>
      <P>I look upon that as absolutely impracticable or if it is done, as gross tyranny and productive of the worst results, and that in the wide manner which is suggested here, because there is no limitation to it.  I would ask the Minister to consider an alteration of it, because if he would alter it as I suggest, I should vote for it; while if it is not altered, I shall feel bound to vote against it, and if I can get sufficient supporters, I shall call for a division on it.  I suggest that it be altered to read:</P>
      <P>to encourage producers to grade, pack and mark their fruit and vegetables to a standard to be prescribed.</P>

      <P>The manner in which this matter arose, as any Senator might guess, was that the producers alleged certain things against the markets and against the salesmen and so on, and the retailers, wholesalers, salesmen and consumers alleged certain things against the producers.  It is very difficult, certainly for me, to adjudicate between them and also, I am afraid, it would be almost impossible for any officer of my Department to do it, because it is a matter in which one is very likely to be prejudiced on one side or the other.  There is no doubt, <Col N="900" /> and I think everybody admits, that we can grow very good fruit and very good vegetables in this country.  In fact, if we go to any of our fruit or vegetable shows, we will see there displayed fruit and vegetables as attractive in appearance as any that are imported.  They are there in half-dozens, well graded and splendid in appearance and much better in flavour than the foreign fruit.  We can grow fruit and vegetables, but most fruit and vegetable growers complain that they cannot make it pay.  Most consumers complain that they are paying too much for their fruit and vegetables. I had some small experience myself, and I am sure that others here who live near the City of Dublin have had the same experience, of bringing vegetables into the Dublin market and selling them for about 10 per cent. of what the consumer pays afterwards and no more.  There must be something wrong there.  It may be as the wholesalers, the salesmasters, and the retailers hold, that they must have a very big margin of profit in order to cover their losses, to cover waste and a certain amount of the vegetables and fruit that go bad.  Probably, they must have a very big percentage, but it is hard to believe that they must have 90 per cent. and that the grower is to get only 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are matters that could be inquired into by the tribunal.  We are asking this tribunal, first of all, to get evidence and to report on whether they think it is true that our fruit and vegetables are not graded properly and not packed properly and&mdash;the marking, of course, includes other things&mdash;whether they are marked according to sample or not.  It is alleged, for instance, that sometimes one gets a barrel of Irish apples and the top of the barrel is very good, but as you go down, the apples are not so good.  I do not know if these allegations are true but the tribunal could report on that.  The tribunal could also inquire into whether our marketing facilities are adequate and sufficient to deal with the fruit and vegetables that come along. Under (c), the suggestion, I take it, is that if it is proved to the tribunal that the present marketing facilities, say, in <Col N="901" /> the City of Dublin are not good and that it would be much better to have a system such as that in the City of Limerick, which has been mentioned by Senator Brown.  The tribunal would be quite free to report in that way and to say that, in their opinion, marketing facilities ought to be provided in all the cities on the same lines as those in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) is plain and scarcely requires any explanation.  It is alleged, for instance, that foreign tomatoes are sometimes sold as Irish.  That, of course, can be dealt with under existing legislation, but it is no great burden to put on the tribunal to ask them to inquire into this matter also, as they will be dealing with fruit and vegetables, of whether there is an abuse or grave abuse in that direction. If so, they might, perhaps, suggest a remedy.  The tribunal will be set up under the Tribunal of Evidence Act of 1921.  It is different from a commission. It will have very great powers, as was explained by Senator Brown, and can compel a witness to give evidence and to produce documents and, in fact, have a person committed for contempt of court if that evidence or that production of documents is refused.  No doubt, this tribunal would have very great powers, but I think that in a case like this, where you want, I believe, more the judicial mind than the expert mind, a tribunal is more suitable than a commission and it was on that account that this form of inquiry was selected.</P>
    <P>We have had, at least, two tribunals under this Act already.  One of them inquired into the maize-meal mixture in, I think, 1931, and rejected the proposals at that time to have home-grown grain mixed with maize-meal.  Again, a tribunal was set up under this Act to inquire into the bacon and pig trade. They issued a certain report on which a Bill is being prepared and will, I hope, be ready for circulation within the next three weeks or so.  In both those cases, the members of the Tariff Commission were asked to act on the tribunal and the same procedure will be adopted this time.  I have no reason to doubt that they <Col N="902" /> will act this time also, and, if they do, the chairman who acted on both previous occasions will be chairman this time.  I think Senators need not have any apprehension about witnesses being pursued unnecessarily with regard to evidence or asked to disclose information that it would not perhaps be fair to ask a witness to disclose, but may rest assured that he will go as far as is necessary for the purpose of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Bagwell that this is a case for a judicial tribunal and that any expert knowledge that is required should be tendered in the form of evidence.  There will, of course, be at the disposal of this tribunal any expert evidence they may wish to call from the horticultural inspectors of the Department and, I am quite sure, the horticultural experts attached to the universities will give any evidence required of them. There was some doubt expressed here by Senator Brown as to whether it would be possible to get evidence from the other interests&mdash;the growers.  There is in this country a fruit growers' association.  But it does not by any means include all the fruit growers of the country but they are, at any rate, active, and they have assured me that so far as they are concerned, they will give all the help they possibly can in the way of submitting evidence on behalf of the growers and that they will make the allegations, to which I have already referred, to the tribunal which they have often made to me, that they are not treated fairly and try to prove their case as best they can.  I have no doubt that the salesmen, wholesalers and retailers will come forward to rebut that evidence and the Tribunal will then be in a position to judge for itself.</P>
    <P>There are not, it is true, very many fruit growers in this country, who live entirely by fruit growing, but there are a few, apart from those farms which have been mentioned and which are connected with jam factories.  There are a few I know personally who have no other business but fruit growing and they will naturally be very interested <Col N="903" /> in this inquiry and will take the opportunity of producing the best evidence they possibly can.  Some Senators appear to be somewhat afraid of paragraph (e) (i) with regard to grading, packing and marking.  The terms of reference only ask the tribunal to report on the steps, if any, which should be taken.  It is quite possible that the tribunal may report that it is inadvisable to require producers to do this and I think it is very probable that if they do require producers to grade, pack and mark, they will make exceptions.  They will scarcely compel every single person who goes in for the marketing of cabbage to grade, pack and mark that cabbage.  They may require it for a city like Dublin or they may not, but I think they will make exceptions and will not bring in any sweeping recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I do not believe they will bring in any sweeping recommendation in that respect, but if they do, it will only be a report.  If I am inclined to act on the report and if I bring a Bill along and get the Dáil to agree to it, the Seanad is here to object at that stage, even though the tribunal has recommended it and I think it is unlikely that the tribunal would recommend such a provision in a very sweeping way.  I do not think there is any need for Senators to object at this stage to that particular paragraph. I do not think it is right for Senator Counihan to say that this is the first item we have tackled in regard to the fixing of prices.  It is almost the last.  There are only a few left which we have to tackle in regard to the fixation of prices or proper marketing. As I have already said, a Bill with regard to pigs and bacon is in draft and will be circulated within a few weeks and I hope to be able to do something on these lines with regard to horses in the very near future.  I think that will finish practically everything in agriculture with a few very minor exceptions, which we will deal with later perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> Transport is certainly a big item in the marketing of fruit, but I do not think the tribunal could possibly report on (c): whether conditions under which fruit and vegetables are prepared for marketing and are subsequently marketed are such as to affect adversely the returns obtained by the producers of those commodities.  They must necessarily trace the vegetables or fruit from the time they leave the producer until they reach the consumer and they cannot avoid taking notice of the transport costs and, naturally, they will report on the transport costs if they think attention should be drawn to that part of the business.  I am not a lawyer, but I am told that the shorter you make the terms of reference the wider they are generally; that if you make them very long you narrow them all the more. The terms of reference here are short, but the tribunal will have very wide powers to inquire into anything that affects the marketing of fruit and vegetables.  The tribunal could even inquire into the point raised by Senator Miss Browne, whether we should not grow more dessert apples if we are increasing the area under apples. Naturally, if it is found that there is a better market for dessert apples than in an expansion of the market for other apples they would have to draw attention to that, and would probably recommend that in any further extension of the area under apples, the growing of dessert apples should be considered.  I agree with Senator Wilson that one of the biggest questions the tribunal will have to consider is the supply of vegetables to the Dublin market.  That is probably the biggest item in the fruit and vegetable markets we have and, as a matter of fact, is also the principal cause for the setting up of the tribunal.  We do not hear so many complaints from any class as from the producers of vegetables for the Dublin market.  It is as well to give them an opportunity of making a case before the tribunal, to see if they have a good case, and to show what can be done to remedy complaints.  As to Senator Johnson's point, whether it is right that <Col N="905" /> this motion should be invoked or not, and the matter dealt with as one of urgent public importance, there is no doubt that it is a matter of public importance and urgent.  It was urgent for the last ten or 12 years.  I think a good case can be made for claiming that it is a question of urgent public importance.  Even if we could not make such a case, I say that these words must be used, in order to bring the matter before the Seanad and the Dáil.</P>
