      <P>The House will not meet again until after Christmas, and before we begin the business on the Order Paper I should like a decision to be taken as to the date to which we shall adjourn.  I assume that we shall finish all the stages of the Bills which appear on to-day's Order Paper.  The Bills which will fall to be dealt with at the first meeting after the holidays, are the Citizenship Bill (Second Stage), the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill (Second Stage) and the Shannon Fisheries Bill in Committee. It will seriously inconvenience the county councils if there is any undue delay over the passage of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill.  I have been in touch with the Minister for Local Government in regard to this question and he is agreed that if this Bill is taken on the 16th January it will be suitable to him, but the date fixed ought not to be later than that, for the reason I have mentioned.  I accordingly suggest to the House that we fix Wednesday, 16th January, as the first day of meeting after the Christmas Recess.  Is the House agreed?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, Orders made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, unless confirmed within eight months from the date of the making thereof by an Act of the Oireachtas, lapse.  The purpose of the Bill is to confirm a number of Orders which were made under the Act, the validity of which, in the normal course, would lapse by the 28th February next.  In addition to these Orders, the opportunity has also been taken in this Bill to confirm a number of other Emergency Orders, the validity of which, unless confirmed, would expire upon dates which would not make it opportune to bring in a separate confirming Bill or to confirm them in the principal Finance Act of the year.  The Orders covered by the Bill are set out in the Schedule and I do not know whether it is necessary for me to do more than enumerate the articles and commodities to which the various Orders apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Orders Nos. 32 to 41 inclusive relate to boot and other laces, elastic, buttons, tape and tape holders, electric wires and cables, vegetable oils and fats, safety razor blades, agricultural forks, automatic machines and statuettes.  Orders Nos. 42 and 43 are designed to prevent abuses which grew up in connection with certain agricultural and industrial products whereby commodities on which export bounties were paid had some of their parts cut off after export, the articles being subsequently reimported free of duty into the Saorstát.  Under this <Col N="909" /> procedure a position could quite easily have grown up whereby a bounty would have been paid on articles exported, such articles being afterwards reimported free of duty and sold here at the ordinary price, the manufacturer or purveyor in either case getting the export bounty.  The practice did not develop to any extent, but one or two instances were noted and Orders Nos. 42 and 43 have been made to stop the practice.  Orders Nos. 44 to 50 cover tanks for domestic purposes, cisterns, drums, yarns, partly of wool or worsted, rope, cord, twine, and dead rabbits.</P>
    <P>Order No. 51 relates to the emergency duties imposed upon sugar on the 12th October last.  With reference to that Order, it might be desirable that I should say something in regard to the sugar duty.  On the Second Stage of the Sugar Manufacture Bill in July last, in discussing the protection which would have to be afforded to the new beet sugar company, I emphasised that, as the company would be in a position to supply the major portion of the country's requirements, it would be essential, in estimating the measure of protection which might be necessary in order to maintain the new industry, to have regard to the fact that sugar constitutes an important source of revenue. I indicated then that an Excise duty on home-manufactured beet sugar would have to be imposed and the Customs duty on imported sugar increased so as to maintain both the protection which the home-manufactured article required and the revenue which was essential to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In my forecast of the additional duties which would have to be imposed to meet the requirements of the Exchequer, I indicated that it would possibly be necessary to increase the price of sugar by ½d. or ¾d. per lb.  In order to counter the dumping of foreign sugar, the Executive Council, by Order, under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, imposed an additional duty of 4/- per cwt. on imported sugar, bringing the Customs duty up to 16/4 per cwt.  A subsequent examination of the position before the <Col N="910" /> opening of the new factories disclosed the fact that a protective tariff of at least 16/4 per cwt. would be required in this year in order to enable the new industry to establish itself.  Every effort was made to reduce this figure, but, owing to the fact that the new factories will not operate to their highest efficiency during their first seasons, protection to the amount I have indicated was unavoidable. Furthermore, in order to enable the new factories to dispose of all their products between now and the opening of the next campaign, a Quota Order was made restricting imports of sugar to a very small fraction of what had hitherto been the normal quantity during this period.  By the operation of this Quota Order, the normal inflow of revenue from the Customs duty was reduced to an insignificant amount and, accordingly, it became necessary to consider immediately the amount of Excise duty which the sugar from the new factories, which were about to come into operation, and which did, in fact, come into operation in November, would have to bear as from that date.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out, I indicated in July, 1933, that the erection of the new factories might involve an increase of as much as 3/4d. per lb. in the cost of sugar to the consumer. The protection which had previously been offered to Carlow sugar, as a result of the imposition of the Emergency Order of February last had resulted in an increase of ½d. per lb. in the price of sugar to the consumer. Accordingly, an additional Excise duty of ¼d. per lb. was imposed on Irish manufactured sugar and I should like to emphasise here that this is the only duty which Irish manufactured sugar at the present time has to bear.  In order to preserve the minimum margin of protection, a corresponding increase of ¼d. per lb. in the Customs duty had to be made.  Owing, however, to the operation of the Quota Order, to which I have already referred, our revenue from that Customs duty will be infinitesimal and, in fact, as a result of the rearrangements which I have outlined, the Exchequer in the current year will receive £85,000 less from <Col N="911" /> sugar duties than was originally estimated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like&mdash;I think I might use the phrase&mdash;to protest against the method which is being adopted by the present Government in the imposition of tariffs.  I am not objecting to any of the specific tariffs introduced here.  A few of them I know something about but of most of them I have no direct knowledge.  It seems to me, however, that the method now being adopted is anything but a democratic one.  The Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, under which these Orders were made, was intended to give the Government adequate powers to deal with a specific situation arising out of what is commonly called the economic war.  It has now become the method by which practically all import duties are imposed and they are produced then to the Oireachtas in a form in which they cannot be amended except by a defeat of the Government. One cannot in fact propose any adjustment, any exemption or any improvement in any of these Orders.  One must take the Order or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method which was adopted by the late Government, and by this Government until comparatively recently was, to my mind, more democratic and much better from the point of view of the public generally.  Import duties were then either introduced in the General Finance Act or by Special Customs Duties Bills, of which there were generally three or four in the year.  It was possible, in connection with these Bills, either to move the rejection of or an increase in the particular duty, or to move the exemption of an article which was found to have been tariffed inadvertently, and generally to criticise the details in a helpful way.  With this particular method, all one can do&mdash;and I think it is all that was done in the Dáil&mdash;is to move the deletion of a particular Order which means that you are opposed completely to any tariff on the goods concerned.  I think that is not really a desirable way.  I am not objecting to tariffs being put on before they <Col N="912" /> come before the Oireachtas because I recognise that you cannot put tariffs on in any other way, but after they had been put on, the function of the Oireachtas is to criticise them and to express the opinions that come to those of us who are members and generally, to see whether improvements, particularly in detail, cannot be made. This method cuts that out and I think that even if you are to have these Emergency Orders, it would be better if the details of the specific duties were embodied in the Bill so that they could be amended or suggestions made in Committee which, I gather, is impossible on a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill before us, there are one or two questions I should like to ask the Minister.  I should like him to tell us how many of the commodities included here are not yet being made in this country and when they are likely to be made.  I think that applies to boot-laces&mdash;I am not quite sure about elastic&mdash;and it applies to a large extent to buttons, and it also applies to one article which is included, but which I think was not read out by the Minister and with which I am most concerned&mdash;cotton thread.  I think it comes under Order No. 48, and I think the Minister referred only to rope, twine, etc.  The most important part of that Order is the inclusion of cotton thread, which is not yet being manufactured in this country and which is the raw material of a very large number of our manufacturers.  These manufacturers are entitled to get and, so far as I know, are getting, licences to import, but I think that if the Minister was managing an Irish manufacturing concern he would appreciate the delay &mdash;inevitable and not the fault of the officials&mdash;the aggravation and the extra expense, in having repeatedly to apply for licences for things which you cannot get here and which are not made even in any quantity in this country.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the idea is to prevent any quantity of forestalling, and if that were done for a period of two or three months before the goods were likely to be available, I could understand it, but it seems to me that an error has been made in the case of cotton thread by <Col N="913" /> putting the duty on far too soon.  I know that the Federation of Irish Industries, which is interested in this from the point of view of Irish industrial development, has had a great many complaints from its members&mdash;not complaints that they are not being properly treated when they apply for licences.  Some might have grounds for complaint, but very often it is their own fault, but it does seem to me that this is a commodity on which it is very doubtful if it was wise to put a 40 per cent. tariff so soon.</P>
    <P>To some extent, the same remarks would apply to buttons and boot-laces. In the case of boot-laces, this particular order provides, I think, for a duty of 100 per cent.  It also provides a prohibitive duty on laces imported with the boots and shoes.  If these laces were manufactured in this country, I could appreciate the 6d per pair being placed on laces imported with boots and shoes. They are not, however, being manufactured here.  All that is happening is that the outside manufacturer of boots and shoes gains by not having to include the value of the laces.  They cannot be included now.  They have to be bought, and the price has to be paid by somebody.  If there was a gain in that, if they were being made here, I could understand it; but why impose that portion of the duty when they are not being made here?</P>
    <P>You cannot forestall to any serious extent by importing one pair with your boots or shoes.  You might forestall and damage the ultimate manufacture if you were to bring in large quantities; but the one pair that comes in the boots or shoes, and which is included in the price by many manufacturers, seems to me to make it impossible to forestall to any extent and to affect persons ultimately going to make laces here.  That, to my mind, is quite an unnecessary thing, trifling as it is, though the sum total comes to a fair amount of the cost to the public who have to buy boots and shoes.  It is admitted that it is not possible to obtain more than from 45 to 55 per cent. of the boots and shoes in this country. Therefore, they must be imported. <Col N="914" /> Why not let the laces come in with them until such time as they are made here?  Then I would be in favour of the prohibitive duty.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister would let us know when boot-laces will be made here; when elastic will be made in quantity; and when buttons that are dutiable will be made, sufficient to meet, at any rate, the demand of the manufacturers.  I should also like to know the position with regard to electric lamps which, I believe, are going to be made here, and are not yet being made; and, particularly, how soon the cotton thread&mdash;which is a very serious matter for a very large number of manufacturers, particularly manufacturers in the making-up trade which has grown up in the last few years, and who are being definitely handicapped by that order&mdash;will be made.</P>
    <P>When I am speaking on the subject generally, although this does not deal with quotas&mdash;the Minister, however, referred to possible quotas on sugar&mdash; perhaps I may not be out of order in referring to quotas which are kindred to the Orders here.  In the case of the Boot and Shoe Quota Order, with which I do not quarrel in principle or object to, there is a very considerable amount of dissatisfaction at the fact that the Order is made for three months instead of a longer period.  I imagine this is largely a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce but, as he is not here, I hope the Minister will convey it to him.  In what I am stating now, I am speaking on behalf of certainly 75, if not 80, per cent. of the persons who have to import boots and shoes.  They wanted the quota Order made for six months instead of three, and the reason was not solely because it would save them trouble in only having to apply once instead of twice, but because of very practical reasons.</P>
    <P>The first reason is that when the quota Order is short&mdash;and I would remind the House that you only receive your licence for the quota a day or two before, possibly only the day before, and possibly only on the day on which the quota period commences&mdash;it is not possible <Col N="915" /> within that short period to order goods and obtain delivery in time from the best manufacturers; with the result, in my opinion, that there will be an increased amount of purchasing from factors, which means, in the long run, that the public will get less value. The second reason is that many people who import boots and shoes import, say, during the first three months of the year a comparatively small quantity compared with what they would import in the next three months.  If you have a six months period it is possible to place your orders in bulk and to adjust them according as trade develops or can be reasonably anticipated.  If your quota Order is for three months, you have either to do without supplies which you cannot get here, or you have to get in during the first three months more than you need, which means that capital is being wasted and there is a loss in profit.  I think that if the Ministry, after a quota Order is made and the preliminary period has elapsed, would then take into consultation a number of persons who have to import, and find out what the difficulties are, some of these aggravations would be avoided.</P>
    <P>In his speech on the Bill under which these quota Orders are made, the Minister for Industry and Commerce promised that he would have consultations.  The manufacturers, of course, are consulted, and properly consulted, before a quota Order is made, because that is essential. I do not suggest that the distributors could be consulted wisely before the Order is made, but I say that, after it is made and has come into operation, and before the second period, it would be easy to get some representative persons and consult them and that some of these difficulties would be avoided.  I would say&mdash;and I believe it applies to most quota Orders&mdash;that the longer the period can be made the better and that it should not be less than six months if the public are not, to some extent, to lose through buying not being done as well.</P>
    <P>There is one other point.  I think it will be quite obvious that if Irish <Col N="916" /> importers are to buy in the best market, it is desirable that they should place as large orders as possible.  When the quota Order period is short and you do not know what your licence will be for the next period, you cannot place a large order. With a six months period you can place a much better order, with delivery spaced over the period.  With three months you can only give half or less than half that order&mdash;certainly not more than half.  When orders are small, the public generally cannot buy from as good houses and as good manufacturers as they could if giving large orders.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, urge on the Government to consider whether a six months period would not meet their requirements under the quota Orders.  What I am saying now is derived partly from my own experience, but it has been put to me by a large number of persons and has nothing to do with party politics.  I do not know a single person who is affected who does not hold the views I have expressed with regard to the length of the quota Order, and I urge the Government to consider that carefully on the next occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two small points to which I wish to refer.  The Minister has given some information as to the estimated effect of the change in the sugar duties on the anticipated revenue.  Could he give us an estimate of the effect of the whole range of these duties on the revenue?  There is another small point.  I refer to Order No. 47 and read it through, but I cannot tell what it refers to unless I go back to the Customs Duty (No. 4) Act, 1932.  It would be comparatively easy for me to do that, but I suggest to the Minister that it would be very valuable and certainly very helpful if some indication were given on the face of these Orders as to their effect or purpose.  In this Order No. 47 the First Schedule of the Act of 1932 is to be amended at Reference No. 1 as follows: by the insertion in the second column of the said reference number of the words &ldquo;or partly&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;wholly&rdquo; where that word occurs in the second column of the said <Col N="917" /> reference number and by the deletion of the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; where that word secondly occurs in the said column of the said reference number.</P>
      <P>We may read that Order 25 times and not know to what it refers.  Orders by reference are even worse than legislation by reference, and I would express a hope that the Minister would somehow devise a method by which these Orders themselves would be explanatory of their purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>On one point in connection with the cotton thread item I happen to have more or less personal experience, inasmuch as when that proposal about the cotton thread was made I was in contact with those who proposed to manufacture thread in this country.  I am now in a position to state that the proposal to manufacture this thread is so far advanced that the Articles of Association of the company have been drawn up, the capital subscribed, and the building erected. Everything is ready except the getting in of the machinery.  Those who propose to undertake the manufacturer of cotton thread here have as competitors the Coates people in Scotland.  I suppose they are the greatest manufacturers of cotton thread in the world and they are in a position, unless protection is available, to swamp any cotton thread industry or any proposal to establish a cotton thread industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would cost Coates very little to dump sufficient cotton thread in here so as to leave any factory that may be opened in such a way that it would be unable to get any sales for its thread for two or three years.  Obviously, those people who are engaging in this industry were not going to sink their money in putting up a factory if they were not guaranteed some protection. That is the position with regard to cotton thread.  When the 50 per cent. duty was put on thread, all the facts were before the Government and they were satisfied that this factory was to go ahead.  They were satisfied that not only was it to go ahead but that in all probability the article manufactured here would be as good as any used <Col N="918" /> up to the present, and that in all probability it would be sold at as low a price, if not lower, than the present price because we are paying 15 per cent. more here than the price at which Messrs. Coates are selling their thread throughout Great Britain.  I believe that will not operate here in the future. This factory is being set up in Westport, almost in the heart of the Gaeltacht.  It will give employment to from 250 to 500 people when it is in full working order.  Under those circumstances, I think, the Government are perfectly justified in taking the steps they are taking to protect those engaged in this industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, on the question of the Quota Order to which Senator Douglas has referred, I should like to say that I understand that Resolutions confirming these Quota Orders are necessary.  It would, possibly, be better if the Senator would raise the point during the discussion on these Resolutions.  However, I shall convey to the Minister for Industry and Commerce the substance of what Senator Douglas has said and I am sure he will, if possible, give sympathetic consideration to the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much obliged.  I raised the matter now because I knew that three or four months would elapse before these Resolutions came before us and then the harm would be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Johnson is not one on which I am competent to speak because on this matter the lawyers have their own phraseology.  Again, I have only to say that I will draw the attention of the draftsman to it and shall request that the article to which the Order refers shall be stated on the face of the Orders.  On the point raised as to what is made in the Saorstát, I have to say that the following are some of the articles:&mdash; buttons, advertising tape, electric wire and vegetable oil.  These are all made possibly to the fullest extent. Other articles the manufacture of which is about being started are razor <Col N="919" /> blades, yarns, rope, twine.  Cotton thread, as Senator MacEllin has informed us, will be available in a few months.  As to boot laces a firm is at present installing machinery in Ennis for their manufacture.</P>
      <P>On the general criticism made by Senator Douglas on this procedure, I should like to point out that this is under democratic machinery.  In point of fact all these Orders come to the Dáil and Seanad and have to be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas. It is quite true that there are difficulties in the way of amending Emergency Orders, but there is nothing to prevent the Executive Council from amending these Orders.  In discussing Emergency Orders in another place the line taken by Senator Douglas to-day has not up to this been followed.  We have not had the Orders discussed in point of detail in the other House.  The general validity of the Orders has been challenged there and the wisdom of adopting this industrialisation policy which the Government is following has been criticised.  But no attention has been paid to the items covered by the Orders.  No attempt has been made to have any Order in its general terms modified in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that the Rules of the House, I think, preclude an amendment being put down to amend an Order but I have not any doubt whatsoever, if there were a reasoned discussion as to the advantages and disadvantages of applying the Order to any particular variety of commodity, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have given very serious consideration to the points put forward.  Unfortunately, however, the discussion hitherto on these matters has not taken this line.  If a good case were made for the exemption of a particular variety of commodity I have no doubt that the Emergency Order could be altered in any detail if found advisable.  Again, I think the Senator is wrong when he thinks there is more chance of an amending proposal being brought forward in the principal Finance Act of the year than there is <Col N="920" /> in amending the terms of one of those Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Senator will find that it has been done on any considerable scale.  The proposals that have been brought before the Oireachtas in the Finance Act as a rule are a fundamental part of the Government's policy for the year.  In the main, they are proposals in which the revenue element is a very big consideration.  The amendment of them in any vital part would mean the recasting of that particular motion and the resignation of the Government. These conditions do not apply in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main, I think it does apply.  There were four Financial Resolutions before the Dáil last week and they will come before the Seanad in due course.  In connection with every one of them revenue was the vital consideration.  Now, in connection with the Orders covered by this Bill, revenue considerations do not enter into the question at all, because most of the duties are designed to prevent the inflow of revenue into the Exchequer.  With the exception of the sugar duties to which I have already drawn attention, they are purely protective in their purpose.  If, on the Committee Stage, the House desire any further information in relation to the various proposals, I should be prepared to give it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Schedule, I should like to say, with regard to what has been stated by Senator MacEllin, that I was not attacking the protection of the cotton thread trade.  What I hoped was to get some statement such as he made, though I should like his statement to be a little clearer as to date.  Many Irish manufacturers are most anxious to help other manufacturers but that is extremely difficult for them without some idea of when they can get Irish supplies.  If they knew that, it would be much easier to make arrangements.  One reason I raised this matter was that I believed that if statements which could be relied upon were issued as to the time in which supplies would be available, cooperation on the part of a great many other manufacturers would be obtained.  I hope the Press will give as much publicity to the Senator's statement as if the Minister had made it.  It was in the hope that the Minister would make a statement that I raised the question, because I think there should be publicity in respect of these matters.</P>

It submits to the Seanad for consideration a matter that is primarily the concern of the Dublin Corporation and has no more to do with the work of this House than it has to the lighting of the streets in Ballyjamesduff. I suggest than an elementary sense of proportion or conception of what the duties and powers of this House are, would cause this motion to be ruled out of order.  I suggest to Senator Moore, himself, if the motion is not ruled out of order, that he should, from a sense of the responsibility and dignity of the House not bring forward a motion of this kind, the passing or rejection of which would make no difference whatever.</P>

      <P>I see no reason why I should not.  This motion has been on the Order paper for a good many months but did not come up for discussion for various reasons.  One was that there was a printing strike which delayed it for some time.  Then the Seanad sometimes was not sitting, so it was put off from time to time.  The motion can be shortly described as a recommendation to the Government to take whatever steps may be necessary to open the public squares in Dublin, so that they may be made available as playgrounds for children, and, afford fresh air for the public generally. Some of these squares were railed in about 130 years ago, others at a date of which I am not sure, but more or less about that time.  They were railed in not to please the public, or for hygienic purposes but for the convenience of those people who had houses round these squares.  These reasons have fallen through as time went on.  The people for whom these squares were laid out have moved away from these places in recent years to the suburbs and the country, and the seashore in search of still more hygienic places.  The result is that these squares have been to a certain extent neglected.  As a matter of fact, they are almost entirely deserted at the present time.  If any curious person were to visit one of these squares to-day and peep through the bushes, he might expect to see people amusing themselves in them, but he would see nothing of that sort.  The most that would be seen would be a nursery maid wheeling a perambulator.  I doubt that two would be seen.  Outside these squares would be seen mothers with their poor children sitting with their backs to the railings and hoping that their children would not rush into the roadway and get run over by passing <Col N="925" /> traffic.  These mothers would be seen sitting like the Peri at the gates of Paradise, unable to get in and unable to get anywhere else while the squares themselves are empty and used for no purpose whatever.</P>
      <P>In the old days children were able to use the streets a great deal for play, because there was no such thing as omnibuses.  There were horse-drawn vehicles, cars and carriages, moving at a rate of seven or eight miles an hour at the outset, and of little or no danger to children, who could easily avoid them.  Now the condition of affairs is entirely different.  We have buses travelling at 40 and 50 miles an hour through the streets and motor cars trying to pass them at a high rate of speed, with the result that children are run over.  There may be other ways of helping, but I think it is a good thing to have children in places where they can play in safety and get rest.</P>
      <P>Senator Brown mentioned to me some places like these squares that are under better control and open to children, with the result that hundreds of people can use them and enjoy themselves. That is what I would like to see those squares used for.  In my young days, people occupying houses round these squares used the squares. Now there are very few such people living there.  Some of the houses are occupied by the poorest of the poor and have become slums.  Are we to allow these few squares&mdash;and there are not half enough of them&mdash;to be squandered, as it were, or to be used for one nursery maid and three or four persons instead of the whole population of Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole population will benefit through the opening of these squares. I think we ought to do something to achieve that purpose.  Long ago in all countries the people did not think much of hygienic matters, but now they have come to recognise the importance of hygiene and they value open spaces. The more open spaces that can be availed of in our cities, the better. In all the suburbs of London they have huge open spaces.  There are very few <Col N="926" /> Londoners, except those living in the heart of the city, who have not places near at hand to move about in.  The more fresh air the people get the healthier they are.  England has got thoroughly mechanised and many of the people live for a great part of their time in the factories.  The result is that large numbers of the English people have become a C 3 people, dwarfed and sickly.  Open spaces would be invaluable to those people.  At one time it was my duty to inspect volunteers and I observed the great difference in the physique of the volunteers in Belfast and the volunteers in Connaught and Munster.  We ought to see that the best use is made of the city squares.  I believe that plans for the carrying out of big improvements in Dublin have been drawn up.  I hope that this proposal and the discussion on it will induce the Government to take the matter up and carry into effect this very desirable improvement, and I am sure the citizens will be very glad to take advantage of it.</P>

      <P>Ag aontú leis an rún, ba mhaidh liom a rádh go bhfuil gádh mór leis na cearnóga d'oscailt do sna páistíbh óga ach tá eagla orm nach ró-fhuiriste é do dhéanamh, dá mhór é an gádh.  I desire to second Senator Colonel Moore's motion.  I wish to say that it is very necessary and desirable to open these squares.  They should be thrown open at the earliest moment for the children in the more populous areas throughout the city.  This is chiefly a question for Dublin City.  There are four squares in the city to which this resolution would apply.  These squares are Fitzwilliam Square, Merrion Square, Rutland Square and Mountjoy Square.  So far as Fitzwilliam Square is concerned, it is largely a residential area and possibly the necessity for throwing it open is not as great as it would be if it were a square converging on a populous, congested area.  Merrion Square is convenient to a very populous district.  Down Holles Street and on down to the Liffey it is a congested area.  It would be very nice if <Col N="927" /> Merrion Square could be opened for the children living around that area.  I suppose you are all aware that it is contemplated to utilise that square in the near future as a site for a Catholic cathedral.  I understand the lease of the square will expire in 1938, so that four years hence it may possibly be turned over to other hands.  In the meantime, it would be a very good thing if the square were thrown open for the use of the children, who may be seen sitting around gazing into its open spaces but who, at the moment, have no right to breathe God's pure air or get God's sunshine inside its railings.</P>
      <P>Now we come to Parnell Square. That is also converging on a very populous area.  You have Dominick Street, Dorset Street and Parnell Street and other areas around where there are large numbers of children.  It is sad to see them shut out from these open spaces.  There is a rather serious matter in connection with the Parnell Square site.  I understand that the charter of the hospital forbids the hospital authorities to utilise the space for the purpose mentioned in Senator Moore's motion.  If my information is correct, I believe that Parnell Square is shortly going to be used in a manner which possibly will have to be dealt with in another place.  I understand it is contemplated that a laundry is to be erected on the west side of Parnell Square and in connection with that laundry there is going to be a very large and unsightly chimney constructed. I have seen the plans of it. Further, I understand there is to be another building in front of the Art Gallery on the north side and a building also on the Cavendish Row side. This will mean the shutting in of the whole square and it certainly will not add in any way to the amenities of the locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to Mountjoy Square, which is possibly in the most populous district of all.  Most of the people in the city are aware of the very large numbers of tenement dwellers in the vicinity of Mountjoy Square.  Unfortunately, the square itself is fast developing into a tenement area.  The <Col N="928" /> municipal council have been negotiating with the Commissioners of Mountjoy Square in connection with the opening of it.  I happened to be a member of a sub-committee requested to deal with the matter and we recommended the taking over of the whole square, but the Commissioners did not wish to throw open the whole square.  However, I think it will be possible to negotiate with them for the opening of half the square, and I think it will be opened in the near future.  We know the necessity for opening those squares is great.  Those of us who live in the confines of the city, know the desperate dangers of the streets, know the desperate speed of motor cars.  In years gone by, if a hackney car driver drove his horse at an unreasonable pace in the city he was brought into court for reckless or furious driving, driving to the danger of the public.  We do not hear of many of those cases being brought into court now in connection with either the furious or reckless driving of motor cars.  The streets are in a very dangerous condition for young children, and I think that most people will admit that it is hardly in keeping with modern democratic ideas to have these squares railed in and to have both the young and the old gazing in through the railings.</P>
    <P>As one of the municipal representatives, I feel very thankful to Senator Colonel Moore for his interest in this matter.  I may add, before concluding, that in the municipal housing schemes provision is being made for playgrounds for children in all those schemes and that in the flat-dwellings scheme there is a courtyard provided also where children can play.  I wish to inform the House, and particularly Senator Colonel Moore, that the local authority is not at all neglecting its duty in this desirable direction.  I sincerely hope that this motion will not be looked upon as a Party issue, but as one that should appeal to all commonsense members in this House, and that something may materialise from it in the desired direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Senator Colonel Moore did not adopt the suggestion made to him by Senator <Col N="929" /> O'Farrell and decided to persist with this motion.  I agree with Senator O'Farrell that this is not a matter for this House.  It is a matter in which the initiative ought to have been taken, if at all, by the Corporation, and not by this House.  I am prepared, however, to take this motion on its merits, and as if it really had merits.  I take it that Senator Colonel Moore's motion only means the squares in the old City of Dublin and not the squares in the suburbs, such as Kenilworth Square, Belgrave Square, and so on, which are situated in neighbourhoods where the children for whom Senator Colonel Moore wants open-air playgrounds do not live.  Assuming that this motion is confined to the squares in the city, there are only two squares in this city to which the motion really does apply. Those are Fitzwilliam Square and Mountjoy Square.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the present legal position of Merrion Square.  The present lease to the Commissioners will expire, I think, in five years&mdash;about 1939&mdash;and the persons who are interested in the erection of the great cathedral, that we all hope to see in this city, have got what is practically a legal contract for the purchase, in perpetuity, of that square.  There was a time when it was hoped that that square would be turned into a public park as a war memorial.  As a matter of fact, the trustees of the war memorial fund actually got leave from the Courts&mdash; they had to get it&mdash;to expend the very large sum which they had collected for turning that square into a public park. They would have had to apply for a private Act of Parliament for that purpose.  However, there were objections made to it on behalf of the Government which could not be very well contested, and that project fell through.  The present position of Merrion Square, however, makes the provisions of this motion inapplicable to it.  If it is made the site of the cathedral, which we all hope it will, I have no doubt that it will be made open to the public, but one can hardly imagine it as a playground in such circumstances. At all events, it will be open to the public.  For practical purposes, therefore, Merrion Square is out <Col N="930" /> of the picture so far as this motion is concerned.</P>
    <P>Fitzwilliam Square is a comparatively small square.  There is room for four tennis courts in it with a very beautiful sod of grass.  I was Commissioner there for nearly a quarter of a century, so I should know all about it.  If that square were to be made a public playground for poor children, it would absolutely ruin the amenities of the square and of the neighbouring streets, the residents of which pay a small sum of two guineas a year for its use.  If it were necessary to throw it open in order to give a playground to poor children, I would say: &ldquo;sacrifice even that&rdquo;; but it is not necessary.  The poor children who would be likely to use Fitzwilliam Square are, every one of them, within easy distance of that magnificent garden, St. Stephen's Green&mdash;one of the finest and most beautiful gardens that I know of in any city, and I know plenty of them. They are within 100 yards of the gate of St. Stephen's Green and the area in which they live is not a very slum area.  Accordingly, so far as Fitzwilliam Square is concerned, I think that it is absolutely unnecessary that it should be opened.  It would be very little good to open it.  It would hold very few of these children, as it is a small square, and if they were there it would mean the ruin of the surrounding property.  When I went there first you could almost get a present of a house, but now you would pay between £2,000 and £3,000 for a house there, because it is one of the last places in Dublin where there is absolute peace and quiet and where lawyers and doctors, and people like that who can still afford to pay, would like to go.</P>
    <P>Now, we come to the north side of the city, and perhaps I should say first that there is one very fine playground on the north side, and one that supplies a playground for one of the very poorest slum districts in the city; and that is the King's Inns garden. Unlike St. Stephen's Green, it is not a very beautiful garden.  It never was. It is confined to grass and trees.  It is large, although not nearly as large as St. Stephen's Green.  About 25 years ago, when we were thinking of spending <Col N="931" /> some money on beautifying it and keeping it as the private garden of the Benchers of the King's Inns&mdash;it belongs to them&mdash;we came to the conclusion that, situated where it was, and Henrietta Street having decayed into one of the worst slums in Dublin, the best thing to do was to let the children into it, and for 25 years they have been there.  It is open all day from dawn until sunset and if you go into it on a fine summer's day you will see between 1,500 and 2,000 children there with their fathers and their mothers, and sometimes their grandfathers and their grandmothers.</P>
    <P>Then take the case of Rutland Square, or Parnell Square, as it is now called.  That square belongs to the hospital and they may want to extend the hospital.  In any case, the children who would be likely to use that square are near enough to King's Inns garden.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this motion is confined to Mountjoy Square.  I should be delighted to see that square opened up&mdash; that place that, in my young days, was as fashionable as Merrion Square became in later days.  I remember as a young man going around it and wondering would I ever be able to live there just like the judges and other prominent men who were living there. I should be glad to see that square opened to the public, but I say again that this is not a matter for the Government. It is not worth the Government's while.  This old city is practically as well supplied with playgrounds and open spaces as any city I know of, and you will not improve the matter by this motion.  There is nothing that you can do, in reason or legally, that will really help the matter. That is why I think that Senator Colonel Moore would have been well advised not to move the motion.</P>

      <P>In order to remove any misapprehensions that may have arisen <Col N="932" /> in the minds of some Senators with regard to the speech made by Senator O'Farrell, I would like to make his point quite clear.  Senator O'Farrell did not mean to suggest that the Labour Party and himself were not in favour of the idea underlying this motion.  What he did say was that he thought that this was a job for the Dublin Corporation.  With that view, I am in entire agreement.  I can say from experience that the Labour Party in the Dublin Corporation have been pressing for a great many years for the turning of these squares into playgrounds for the children.  I think that no harm will be done by the House passing this motion.  In fact, it may be opportune to do so, so that when a town plan is being prepared for the City of Dublin and its suburbs the question of providing open spaces and squares will be included in it.  There are, I know, a number of difficulties in the way&mdash;when I was a member of the Corporation we found then that there were tremendous difficulties&mdash;of getting these squares opened as playgrounds for children.  I think that if Senator Colonel Moore follows the matter up he will find that that is so. In the first place, if a square is taken over and opened up as a public playground it must be under some control. There must be officers appointed who will be responsible to the body that takes over control of the square so as to ensure that there will be no accidents to children.  If the Government, for instance, were to take over these squares, then I imagine they will be placed under the control of the Board of Works as in the case of St. Stephen's Green and Phoenix Park.  If the squares are placed under the control of the Corporation, the Corporation will have to appoint a staff for their maintenance, upkeep and preservation as public squares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, we found in the Corporation innumerable difficulties in the way with regard to the various squares that have been referred to by Senator Healy.  He is a member of the Dublin Corporation and is aware of the difficulties. Like Senator Brown, he has narrowed this down to the question of Mountjoy Square.  Senator Healy has <Col N="933" /> told us that negotiations are going on through the Corporation for the purchase of Mountjoy Square.  Every member of the House who knows Dublin is aware that it would be a blessing from God if Mountjoy Square were opened to the poor children of that area.  There has been a terrible toll of child life around there, and all because of the want of playgrounds for the poor children.  Indeed, there has been an appalling loss of life amongst the children of that area.  If Senator Colonel Moore succeeds by the putting down of this motion in hurrying up the Corporation to take over that square, then I would say that he has done a good day's work by raising the matter here.  I am in entire sympathy with the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that if it be true that the initiative in the matter of taking steps to give effect to the terms of the motion lies with the Dublin Corporation, it is at the same time by no means undesirable that this motion should have been put on the Order Paper of this House.  I have no sympathy with the Senator who said he was afraid that the dignity of this Assembly was likely to be hurt by a motion such as this appearing on the Order Paper.  It has been said that &ldquo;the tongues of dying men enforce attention like deep harmony,&rdquo; and perhaps this motion from the Seanad, before its demise at an early date, may be successful in focussing attention upon this very desirable object of providing suitable recreation grounds for the young children of this city.  I think that this motion is in keeping with the spirit of the report of the Greater Dublin Commission which sat in 1926. That report in a paragraph dealing with town planning, stated that the proper object of town planning</P>
      <P>&ldquo;does not aim at mere beautification; it aims at creating first, a good city rather than an ornate city.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is highly desirable that for the preservation of life and particularly of child life, proper recreation grounds should be made available for the young children of the city.  Therefore, I think it is very desirable that this <Col N="934" /> motion should be given effect to.  Personally, I should prefer if the motion were wider in its terms, because outside of Dublin there are many cities and towns that suffer from the lack of proper recreation grounds for the children that live in them.  I should have been more pleased if we had an addendum to the motion to the effect that the provisions of, I think, Section 32 of the Land Act of 1933 were more fully availed of by the local authorities throughout the country and also by the educational authorities&mdash;the managers of the primary and secondary schools and the committees in charge of vocational education schools.  The section of the Land Act to which I have referred enables the Land Commission, when acquiring land, to make provision for parks, recreation grounds and sports grounds in towns and villages, as well as playgrounds for school children.  I think that an addendum giving expression to that view might very well be made to the motion.  I am afraid that many of our local authorities or, at all events, some of them, do not fully appreciate the tremendous advantages, physical and otherwise, that would accrue from the provision of suitable recreation grounds for the children in their areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with practically everything that has been said in support of the motion.  I am in through agreement with Senator O'Farrell and Senator Brown that this is a matter entirely for the Dublin Corporation. In saying that, I do not for a moment close my eyes to the fact that it was the cause of humanity that suggested itself to Senator Colonel Moore when he put down this motion.  As an old member of the Corporation, I can assure him it will be thankful not alone to the Seanad but for what Senator O'Farrell has said about Ballyjamesduff in giving this proposal a back push so far as these squares are concerned. It might appear from the debate that the Corporation of Dublin have done nothing in this matter, but I can assure the House that this has been a very vexed question with the Corporation since I joined it well over 30 years ago.  Negotiations took place <Col N="935" /> in reference to them, but we found, as Senator Farren said, that we were faced with many difficulties.  We were faced with Acts of Parliament, vested rights, and all the legal obstacles possible.  As my friend and colleague, Senator Healy, has pointed out, there are negotiations going on at present in reference to Mountjoy Square.  In fact, I think they are almost on the point of being settled, and that half the square will be given to the children of that district as a playground.  As many members of the House know, that is a district in the city where there is an urgent need for a playground for the children.  Let us look at it from another angle.  If Mountjoy Square was opened it would certainly satisfy many people.  But in order to be fair we must look a little further afield. There are three or four tennis courts there which give keen enjoyment to the business boys and girls of the city, and I would not like that they should be deprived of a little enjoyment in the evenings after their hard day's work.  It would meet the case if the area available were halved.  I am not finding fault with Senator Moore's proposal.  On behalf of the Corporation I desire sincerely to thank him for bringing it forward.  This discussion will focus attention on the question, and any little help, from any quarter, will be very acceptable in order to make these squares available for the people.</P>

      <P>I should like someone to tell the House how much further the case to provide open spaces for children is going to be advanced by passing this motion.  I do not see that anyone is entitled to any credit in connection with this matter, because it has been agitating the minds of local authorities, especially in the City of Dublin, for many years.  Many attempts have been made to have these squares opened.  Motions like this will not further the claims of the children one bit.  We have read of organisations to provide bird sanctuaries.  It is time that local authorities arranged for child sanctuaries.  We can cut out any reference to parks and squares, seeing <Col N="936" /> that there are any amount of vacant spaces where ball-alleys and playgrounds could be provided.  In my opinion such places would lessen the number of fatal accidents to children that have occurred in the streets. Local authorities should concentrate on that aspect of the case.  When I was on the Continent I was very much impressed with the provision made in small spaces to shut off the children from the dangers of modern transport arrangements and fast motor cars. Instead of trying to make a case for the throwing open of the parks, the provision of open spaces would be less costly.  I wonder how Senator Moore would regard a suggestion that Leinster Lawn should be thrown open to children.  There is no reason why it should not.</P>

      <P>I can go back as far as Senator Farren.  I remember that there was a very useful playground in a very congested neighbourhood near New Row where some foreign organisation provided swing-boats and merry-go-rounds. It is not there now. I do not know what happened the playground in Pimlico.  Apparently that aspect of the matter has been lost sight of, while people are talking of opening up the parks as playgrounds.  There are vacant spaces in every slum district and if these were available for the children in these areas it would do a lot more good than concentrating on the opening of the parks, because it would help to lessen the dangers in congested areas.</P>

      <P>I wish to make it plain that I referred to squares which were largely residential, and that the necessity for opening the others was not as great as having open spaces in congested areas.</P>

      <P>I am not conversant with the rules of the House.  I do not know if I got copies of the Standing Orders. With regard to the point made, that it is the duty of local authorities to deal with the matter, I made it clear that local authorities were doing their duty. It must be remembered that local authorities cannot frame laws for the City of Dublin.  If the Corporation proceeded to seek legislation it would be a fairly extensive job.  This motion may have the effect of getting the Government to move in the matter.</P>

      <P>Some Senators have pointed out that nothing would be gained by passing this motion, unless other means were taken to induce the Corporation to take the necessary steps.  The matter has been going on for years and years and nothing has been done.  It is a good thing to give even a little push to the movement and this motion is merely a recommendation to the Government.  It cannot effect anything of itself.  I took an interest in the matter two or three years ago and I went to the Trustees of Merrion Square to see what could be done. Having discussed the matter with the secretary a meeting of the trustees was called and they unanimously approved of Merrion Square being opened to the public.  The people concerned at the time told me that they had tried to hand over the square but that nobody would take it.  They said the Corporation would not take it; that they had tried everyone who would be likely to take it and no one would do so.  It was pointed out that the trustees had no money to keep the square in order, or to maintain the railings around it. They said they would be only delighted if the Corporation would take it over as they knew that this question would arise later.  I was not content to let the matter rest here.  I went to the Lord Mayor and I informed him of what had happened.  He was delighted with the information and said it was one of the things nearest to his heart to have the square handed over.  He <Col N="938" /> promised, on behalf of the Corporation, to have the matter taken up so that Merrion Square might be kept in the same perfect order that St. Stephen's Green is now kept, and he mentioned that two or three workmen would be employed there.  There were further discussions at the time and the matter then dropped.  That being the case, as I am not very much concerned about these matters, I thought if a motion was passed by this House it might induce the Government to take action.  There is a regular plan for the replanning of the city, which will probably come on in another year.  I remember attending meetings twenty years ago at which the question of town planning was discussed.  I hoped that this motion would meet with universal approval and that the difficulties of opening some of the squares would not arise now.  What we are asking the Government to do is to take the matter into consideration and to see what can be done to bring about what everybody here is anxious should be done.  I hope that Senators will not throw this matter over, and that further efforts will be made to see that all the squares are made available for children and poor people in the city.</P>
