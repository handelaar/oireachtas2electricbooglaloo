      <P>At the request of the Minister for Agriculture, the House will be asked to vary the order in which the Bills appear on the printed Order Paper.  He desires that Numbers 2, 3 and 6 be taken in that order immediately after No. 1, and that the remaining Bills for which he is responsible, Nos. 4, 5 and 7 be deferred until after the other Bills on the Order Paper are disposed of.  Does the House agree to that?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>As regards the Electricity Bill, I, unfortunately, was not able to be present at the last meeting when it was discussed; but I do feel that an important Bill of this kind, being brought in at the very tail end of the Session, is a very serious encroachment on our powers and I would ask if it would be possible to postpone this Bill until the opening of the next Session.</P>

I do not know enough about <Col N="306" /> the implications of the Bill to say if it would be practicable to postpone it, but I will have a message sent to the Minister now and see if it is possible to do so.

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;body&rdquo; in line 32 to insert the words &ldquo;or person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister will remember that on the Second Reading of this Bill I raised the question of whether an individual should be eligible to obtain a debenture over co-operative societies.  Under the Bill as proposed, such eligible lender must have the approval of the Minister, so that there is a very complete safeguard against any wrongdoing and, in the same way, any debenture in favour of an individual must be approved in the ordinary way under the rules by general meeting of the shareholders. The Minister said that there was an objection in principle to an individual obtaining a debenture, even under those safeguards.  I have not got his exact words, but I think I am stating them correctly when I say that he said that such a practice would be against the whole principle of co-operation. It would be against the principle of co-operation to allow an individual to obtain control of a society, and he went on to say that there had been cases where guarantors had attempted to obtain control and the Government refused to grant a licence for the working of any creamery over which a guarantor obtains control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be partly my fault that a misconception&mdash;and I suggest that there is a serious misconception&mdash;has arisen.  In the first place, a guarantor is not the only form of creditor that a society might create.  Anybody could <Col N="308" /> come in&mdash;an individual if he so minded&mdash;and finance a society and in due course might say: &ldquo;If I cannot get some better form of security I must put the society into liquidation,&rdquo; and if the society think fit, surely they should have the right to grant that individual a debenture, especially under the safeguards.  Furthermore, the Minister, I think, misunderstood the position when he suggested that a debenture carried control.  A debenture does not carry control, in the ordinary sense of the word at all.  A debenture is a debt and as long as the interest is paid, a debenture holder, unless under the exceptional terms of his deed, has no power.  It may be an irredeemable debenture and he certainly has no power at all if the interest is paid. If it is a redeemable debenture, he is just under contract like any other creditor, so that it is a complete misconception to say that a debenture holder has control.</P>
    <P>Now, what is the position that may arise?  An individual, either as a guarantor or simply as a direct lender, may find that a debenture is going to be created in front of him or he may become anxious about his security.  He has always got his remedy at law.  What is that remedy? That remedy is to put the society into liquidation.  The shareholders might then say: &ldquo;Sooner than have the society put into liquidation, we consider that it would be in our interest to sway this creditor to hold his hand.&rdquo;  It is an ordinary business transaction&mdash;a free contract between the parties.  Surely it is very unfair that any individual, whether a guarantor or simply a creditor, should be debarred from obtaining this form of security over a society? I have consulted a gentleman&mdash;the Minister knows who he is&mdash;who largely assisted the Minister in the preparation of this Bill and he sees no objection.  I hope the Minister, on reconsideration, will not raise any objection either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I find it hard to put up very good arguments against Senator Sir John Keane on this <Col N="309" /> point, but I cannot imagine that the amendment would ever become effective because both my predecessor, Mr. Hogan, and I have carried out an identical policy with regard to creamery development as far as the co-operative movement is concerned. We have tried to make all the creameries in the country co-operative and every attempt by a proprietor to get any foothold, or any hold whatever, on a co-operative society has been resisted as far as we could do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane has, I think, explained my attitude very fairly.  I did point out on the last occasion that if the Minister were to sanction an individual taking a debenture, it is a different matter from what is going on at present where an individual does, perhaps, become the creditor of a creamery with power to foreclose or to close down a creamery unless a debt is paid.  If the Minister were to agree positively by sanctioning an individual as holder of a debenture, I feel that I would be departing somewhat, at any rate, from the spirit in which we have been administering the creamery business up to the present.  If the amendment were accepted, I do feel that I would never be in a position in which I would think it advisable to sanction an individual as a debenture holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I admit, very difficult to argue the case and to point out what is the difference between one of these corporate bodies we have mentioned here and an individual, but I feel that those corporate bodies have no interest whatever in lending money to a creamery for the purpose of getting hold of the creamery in order to work it.  We know, however, from experience that individuals have come in and become creditors of creameries in the hope that they would some time be able to take over a creamery and work it as a proprietary concern.  For the past six or seven years, the previous Minister and I always refused to issue a licence to such an individual to work a creamery. We have always given the reply that no licence will be given except to a co-operative body, and the only way out which an individual would have would be to get some co-operative society to <Col N="310" /> take over the creamery, so that he might get what is due to him out of it. We would not, however, issue a licence to an individual.  I do not want to resist the amendment further than that. I would like, however, if Senator Sir John Keane is particularly anxious to press this amendment, to assure him that so far as I am concerned, I will, as far as possible, see that it does not become effective in the administration of the Act.  I may be wrong, of course; there may be cases I do not foresee in which an individual would be sanctioned as a debenture holder, but, at the moment I cannot see any case in which this amendment would become effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that a limited liability company is more likely to be the kind of organisation which could lend money for the ultimate purpose of taking over the business, so that everything depends I think, on the approval by the Minister, whether it is a corporate body or a person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not attach a very great deal of importance to the amendment but in view of what the Minister has said, I should like to point out to him that a refusal to accept this amendment will be simply restricting the avenues through which a co-operative creamery may borrow money.  I have in mind a case in which a man was interested in the district from which he came, and I know as a fact that he gave financial accommodation to the co-operative creamery there which, since then, has become very successful indeed, on terms which no banker or corporate body working for profit would give.  Considering that the amendment is restricted by the wording of the sub-section, by which a body or person must be approved by the Minister, and is further restricted by clause 13 of the Creamery Act, I cannot see any force whatever in refusing this.  It cannot possibly do <Col N="311" /> any harm because the Minister has discretion. Otherwise it may keep away from a society very valuable help at a critical time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I must press the Committee to a vote on this amendment.  I feel that the Minister was candid when he said it was a difficult thing on which to argue.  Indeed, I felt sorry for him in trying to oppose such a reasonable amendment as this. After what the Minister said, he must realise that though, in the first place, he may have a personal objection to this provision and that he may never contemplate sanctioning an individual as a debenture holder, he may&mdash;I do not care to put it that way&mdash;not be always there.  The Minister says he cannot foresee any occasion in which such a demand by an individual might be reasonable.  I would point out to the Minister that the matter has become practically an issue under this Bill.  Hitherto such societies were unable to raise debentures at all.  And now that they are in a position to issue debentures, the case might be contemplated in which an individual lender might say to the society: &ldquo;If you do so I will put the society into liquidation.&rdquo;  There is nothing to stop him doing so.  In such a case the Minister may decide that it would be better to allow the society to issue debentures to an individual than to break up the society.  In their own interest the societies as autonomous bodies should have this power.  If I were unreasonable I would object to giving the Minister power to sanction or to refuse sanction in the matter of a society which is an autonomous body.  But we have moved a long way from that economic principle at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4.  To add at the end of <Col N="312" /> the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(6)  No issue of debentures shall be made by an agricultural co-operative society under this section unless and until a resolution approving the issue of such debentures shall have been passed by a special meeting of the shareholders of such society convened for the purpose of passing such resolution.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I will have to trouble the House at some length with this amendment, because the matter was considered very carefully in the Dáil.  The whole thing really centres on the amendment that was made in the Dáil where the Minister got the Dáil to cut out of the Bill, as originally drafted, a clause which is really the clause which I wish to have inserted.  I would like the House to consider carefully Section 4, which is a terribly drastic section, not only for the societies that are being dealt with at present but for the fact that it may establish, and probably will establish, a precedent which if it were carried, dealing with the articles of association of other companies outside this Bill, would be a tremendous interference with the possibilities of carrying on companies in this country. Sub-section (1) of the section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  An agricultural co-operative society which is authorised by its rules to borrow money may at any time, with such consent of the Minister as is mentioned in this Act and whether the issue of debentures is or is not authorised, or is or is not forbidden by the rules of such society, issue debentures to any authorised lender for the purpose of securing to such lender the repayment, with or without interest, of any capital sum of money lent by such lender to such society before the issue of such debentures (whether before or after the passing of this Act) or intended to be so lent at or after such issue, or partly so lent and partly so intended to be lent.</P>
    <P>That sub-section rides over articles of association of every type.  There is no mention in it of the shareholders of the society having anything whatever to do with the issue of debentures <Col N="313" /> by the societies.  In the Bill as it originally came before the Dáil there were these words added in a little clause dealing with the Agricultural Credit Corporation: &ldquo;If and when such charge can lawfully be made.&rdquo; The Minister got the Dáil to cut those words out.  The Bill comes to this House without these words in it, and there is not in the Bill as it is before us anything to protect the shareholders of any of these associations except the consent of the Minister.  There are various reasons why the Minister is rather a doubtful party in this case.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the latter part of the Bill we must remember that this Corporation for whose benefit he has taken out that clause, is a Corporation in which the larger shareholders are, I believe, the Government themselves. The banks also have capital in that company.  The strange thing is that we have a Government in power who are large shareholders in a Corporation in whose behalf they are now trying to strain the law so as to give them illegal leave to do certain things.  I have read all through what the Minister said in the Dáil and I cannot find in any of his arguments any justification for the taking out that clause or any justification which would satisfy anyone that he was taking care of the rights of the shareholders.  The Minister states quite plainly why he wants to get this power.  It is because this Corporation found out themselves that if the Bill were left with that clause as it originally stood, they could not get this charge put on without the consent of the shareholders. The Minister cut out the clause to suit this particular Corporation who had lent money&mdash;a Corporation in which the Government hold a large amount of the capital. I do not think the House ought to let such a thing go through.</P>
    <P>If we are to establish a principle that the directors can play ducks and drakes with the articles of association of a company, regardless of the interests of the shareholders, then we are establishing a principle which is far and away above and beyond this Bill.  To talk more specifically, this Bill and what the Minister wants to <Col N="314" /> get is not really demanded by the needs of the situation.  If this company, having lent the money, want to get it back, the Government, as a matter of fact, ought to bring in a Private Bill and not do what they want to do in a Bill of this kind.  If the Minister would bring in a Private Bill here the rights and the wrongs of the business could be looked into by the two Houses and the members of the Oireachtas could say what they thought fit about it.  It should not be done in the way in which the Government is doing it in this Bill&mdash; asking the Oireachtas to over-ride the rights of the ordinary shareholders and establishing a principle that the shareholders should have no right to vote on such a matter.  I have been making investigations about it and I find that none of the societies has put forward the demand that in effect is being made under this Bill.</P>
    <P>As far as I can make out, none of the societies put forward a demand that it should be able to issue debentures without the consent of its shareholders.  The banks outside this Corporation have lent a large amount of money to various societies, but I have not heard that any bank put forward the claim that it should be given the right to claim debentures or that the society should grant them, irrespective of the wishes of their ordinary shareholders.  The Minister is doing this, as he admitted himself, simply to meet the pledge which his predecessor gave to that bank when it gave out the money.  The money was given out in 1929&mdash;five years ago.  They were given to believe that within seven years the Corporation would get their debts paid off.  Five years of those seven have passed but we have no information that they have got any of this money.  If the societies had met their obligations up to date, all but two-sevenths of the money should be repaid by now.  If that were the case, I do not believe that the Minister would have brought in this Bill. Therefore, I take it for granted that the Corporation have not been able to secure the fulfilment of the terms of the agreement.  They have not got back five-sevenths of their money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> What we should probably be asked, if the Bill came before us in the ordinary way, would be to sanction an arrangement whereby the shareholders would be burdened with the payment of the uncalled capital and the repayment of these loans to the Corporation, probably to the full amount.  Yet, they are not to have a word to say to it.  This is not a good time for agriculturists in the country. It is not a time when the Oireachtas or anybody else should be piling burdens on them.  I wonder very much at the Minister not adopting some other course of settling this matter. It is very loyal on his part to carry out the arrangement made by his predecessors, but I doubt very much if he has weighed fully what it means for the Oireachtas to pass such a clause as Section 4 without some protection behind it for the ordinary shareholders.  I have looked carefully through what the Minister told us the other day about it and I find that he did not tell us about the clause that had been deleted from the Bill, which made the Bill a reasonable one to bring into the Dáil.  Without that clause, or a clause leaving the shareholders the right to say whether or not the societies should issue these debentures, I think the Bill is a very dangerous one indeed.  I am, therefore, proposing as an amendment at the end of Section 4, the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>No issue of debentures shall be made by an agricultural co-operative society under this section unless and until a resolution approving the issue of such debentures shall have been passed by a special meeting of the shareholders of such society convened for the purpose of passing such resolution.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, what the societies want is leave to issue debentures.  They want the Oireachtas to give them leave by an Act to issue these debentures, but they never asked that their shareholders should not have a voice in it. Neither did the banks outside ever ask such a thing.  There being no demand from anybody outside this Corporation, with which the Government is closely associated, I do not think that the <Col N="316" /> Minister should ask the House to pass a section of this kind.  I have really not much more to say in regard to the matter.  We shall come later to the question of the Corporation itself and the understanding which Senator Comyn and Senator Johnson referred to in the last debate.  The point of the whole matter is that if we do not insert an amendment such as I am suggesting, we are passing a Bill of an extremely dangerous kind, containing a principle which, if applied to other companies, would wreck a tremendous mass of business.</P>
    <P>Senators might consider what would happen, say, in the case of insurance companies.  I dare say a number of Senators hold shares in insurance companies. You will find insurance companies with shares on each of which only 5/- has been paid up, but these shares carry liabilities running practically to the whole of the debts of the insurance company.  If you applied such a clause as we are debating here to such companies, you would create a state of affairs that would destroy the whole insurance business of the country.  Yet, if you once pass this clause, what is there to prevent the Government's coming in here, saying that they are bound up with a certain insurance company in some way or other, and asking us that a clause such as this should be passed and applied to insurance companies?  I have no brief for insurance companies, but I am a shareholder in an insurance company, and I can say that if such a clause were passed giving power to the company to issue debentures without my consent or the consent of other shareholders it would ruin us.  For all we know, if we let this section through without giving the shareholders some means of protecting themselves, we may be passing a Bill which will ruin individual shareholders in these concerns amongst the agricultural community.  I do not think we should do so.  I have explained to the House why we should protect the ordinary shareholders of the societies and I think this amendment will do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Jameson is not correct in saying that the amendment which I moved in the <Col N="317" /> Dáil had anything whatever to do with this clause.  The amendment I moved in the Dáil, that the words &ldquo;if and when such charge can lawfully be made&rdquo; be deleted, had only to do with those particular societies that owed money to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  This particular clause has nothing to do with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It has to do with debentures for any co-operative society.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation does not propose to take debentures from the societies with which it is dealing, and Section 7, to which Senator Jameson refers, deals with the Agricultural Credit Corporation only.  Therefore the words that were removed by the Dáil only dealt with the Agricultural Credit Corporation. This clause, dealing with the issue of debentures by agricultural co-operative societies, has nothing to do with the Agricultural Credit Corporation. If you like, these matters might have been dealt with in two Bills&mdash;one a Bill dealing with the ordinary powers we give to co-operative societies to issue debentures and a separate Bill dealing with the Agricultural Credit Corporation and their problem.  The words that were removed by the Dáil, however, had nothing to do with the issue that we are discussing in this section at all. Even if they were left in without amendment they would in no way safeguard the position in the direction in which Senator Jameson wants to safeguard it.  When we come to Section 7 we might deal with the reasons why these words were removed.  There were very good reasons for removing them.  I may have been wrong in my statement of the position on the Second Stage with regard to the safeguards that ordinary members have in a co-operative society.  I think I stated here that the ordinary members would be acquainted of the fact, because the society could not issue debentures unless a general meeting were called.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I was wrong in that. The reason why the words &ldquo;whether the issue of debentures is or is not <Col N="318" /> authorised or is or is not forbidden by the rules of such society&rdquo; are used is that when the rules were being framed, at any time up to this, no solicitor or barrister would have provided for power to the society to issue debentures. He would not have given these powers, because there was no legal way by which they could be used.  Whether or not they have that power at present, this clause now gives them the power. The clause is necessary because, otherwise, they would have to go through the formality of changing their rules before they could do anything.  These words are not so serious as they appear.  A society may or may not give power to its committee to borrow. Some societies have given power to their committees to borrow; others have not.  In the same way, some companies have given power to their boards of directors to borrow and some have not.  If a society has not given power to its committee to borrow, then the committee will have to go to the society, irrespective of this Bill.  On the other hand, if a society has given its committee power to borrow, then the committee can issue debentures without consulting the members.</P>

      <P>If Senator Jameson accepts what I say, that this has nothing to do with the Credit Corporation, I should prefer to deal with the other points when we come to Section 7.  If he accepts what I say, then we can deal with this question of debentures solely.  The position is that the amendment proposed by Senator Jameson would only be necessary where a society has given power to its committee to borrow.  If it has not given that power, there will have to be a general meeting, in any event.  I cannot say in what percentage of cases committees have power to borrow, but I know that there are such cases.  If this Bill goes through, as drafted, these committees will be able to issue debentures without consulting their members.  That may appear to be rather unfair to the members. On the other hand, some of the societies which have asked for this Bill are in rather a precarious position.  So <Col N="319" /> far as I have been advised as to the figures&mdash;I myself have not had time to go through them&mdash;the societies are quite solvent, if they get the chance to issue debentures.  If they do not get that chance, they may go down. These is a danger that if these societies have to go through the formality of calling a meeting of members, they may find it rather difficult to get through.  They will require some time to consult their members.  They will have to explain the full position to them, and then they must go to their creditors and try to arrange with them about debentures.  In some cases they will have to try to arrange with one creditor to take over the other debts and hold the debentures.  These negotiations will take a long time, and I think that these societies should get a chance of doing that without coming before the public.  It is a dangerous thing to force these societies to show their hands before the negotiations are finished.  One creditor may jump in and say: &ldquo;We are going to get our money now; we cannot allow the thing to go further.&rdquo;  The publicity of the meeting may ruin some of these societies.  If the Senator had suggested some sort of confirmation of the deal when it was through, his suggestion could be considered.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw attention to a point implied in what Senator Jameson has said, as it appears to me to be more important in a certain particular than the question raised by the Senator.  The section reads &ldquo;whether the issue of debentures is or is not authorised or is or is not forbidden by the rules of such society...&rdquo; That means that there was agreement entered into between the members or shareholders and the society concerned.  If we pass this section as it stands, or even if we amend it as proposed by Senator Jameson, we shall be coming between the society and its members in a way that is not desirable.  The amendment would not meet what, I think, is the fault in the section.  I think that the section should be amended in this way&mdash;that there should be authorisation by shareholders in the case of a society whose rules forbid the issue of debentures by the committee.  That, I think, would meet what I regard as a point of criticism inasmuch as the section is interposing the law as between the shareholder and the society.  The shareholder has, presumably, become a member of the society knowing that the committee could not enter into this compact with a money lender&mdash;that it was specifically forbidden to do so.  I take the view that if the Legislature is coming in with a Bill to deal with such a case, at any rate where the rules forbid a society from issuing debentures, then in such a case the shareholders should first be consulted.</P>

      <P>This amendment seems to me to be a most reasonable one.  I <Col N="321" /> would have thought that the Minister would have been able to offer stronger reasons than he has for refusing to accept it.  With regard to these co-operative societies, I would like to know if the position is this: that two or three recalcitrant members are in a position to be able to hold up the issue of debentures?  I would have thought that you would require a majority of the shareholders to do that.  If we pass this Bill as it stands and as the Minister wants us to do, might not a majority of the shareholders who were opposed to the issuing of these debentures feel very strongly against us for enabling the committee to do what they did not want done with their property?  That is the big point, I think, that Senators should consider. In my view the Minister's attitude is unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">

      <P>As far as I can understand, the Minister has no objection to negotiations taking place for the issuing of debentures.  His position is that he does not wish the shareholders of a society to be consulted on that matter until all the negotiations in connection with the issue have been completed. But when the negotiations are completed, is the Minister prepared to recommend that a society should then meet and have the power to veto any arrangements which had been made by its committee?  I can quite understand the Minister's position when he says that it would be objectionable to have a general meeting of a society at the beginning of negotiations because of the fact that it might be in difficulties, and that if that were advertised it might lead to people coming in and result in putting the society into liquidation, while on the other hand if the debenture issue was arranged the society could be kept going.  There is, however, one other point on which I am anxious to have information, because the Minister did not refer to it when he was speaking.  The point is this: when the negotiations have been completed, privately if you like, and the result is submitted to the shareholders will they have the right and title to reject any arrangements that have been made by the Committee?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the suggestion that has been made by Senator Counihan.  This is a very complicated subject and one really which could be far better discussed by a Special Committee of the House.  As Senators can only speak once on the next stage of the Bill, I think that those who are interested in the matter should take this opportunity of stating their views for the consideration of the Minister.  I did not gather that Senator Jameson and the Minister were entirely agreed on this.  Indeed there are certain aspects of the matter which have not been mentioned at all.  The Minister said, in effect, that a society might be quite solvent and yet need power to issue debentures.  I do not understand what that means.  If a society is quite solvent it is quite solvent, and the power to issue debentures has nothing to do with it.  A society might protect itself.  It might have a potential solvency which the issue of debentures would safeguard, but only safeguard by placing one class of lender in preference over another. Apparently the Minister accepts the view that a society that at present has borrowing powers can quite safely be allowed to add to its borrowing powers and issue debentures.  I do not think that is reasonable because a society will then have the power to give one class of creditors a preference over another.  I do not think that is at all just to an ordinary trade creditor who may wake up one morning to find that debenture holders have been slipped in unknown to him.  The only alternative for such a trade creditor would be to grin and bear it or put the society into liquidation. That, in my view, is a very serious objection to what is proposed <Col N="323" /> here.  I agree that that position does not apply only to what we are dealing with here.  It applies, to a certain extent, in the case of all companies. There is the great danger in it that trade creditors may begin to issue writs and engage in a scramble to put the society into liquidation.  That is a risk that we should be careful to guard against.  I want to make this point: that to give the committee of the society simple borrowing powers such as they have at present, without any reference to the shareholders, is a totally different thing from giving a committee borrowing powers to create debentures, also without reference to the shareholders.  The Minister should bear that in mind in any amendment that he may be prepared to accept on a later stage of the Bill.</P>

    <P>(a) that money is owing to the said Corporation by a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, in respect of a loan made by the said Corporation to such society before the passing of this Act ....</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;by&rdquo; in line 12 to insert the words &ldquo;one of the societies named in the Schedule to this Act, being&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the amendment that the House was discussing a short time ago were accepted it would, of course, also apply to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. On the Report Stage of the Bill in the Dáil the Minister moved, and his amendment was agreed to, to delete from sub-section (1) of this section the words: &ldquo;if and when such charge could lawfully be made&rdquo;.  The Minister, in moving the amendment, said that the legal adviser to the Agricultural Credit Corporation considered that if these words were allowed to remain in the Bill there might be the possibility of the Corporation's right to loans granted by it being disputed.  What that really meant was that the law agent to the Corporation was of opinion that they could not lawfully compel the companies concerned to issue these debentures.  Apparently the Minister then agreed to take the words out at the wish of this Corporation. That is why I said that I thought all matters connected with this banking company, and its relations with societies to which it lent money, should not come up in a big public Bill like this, but should be dealt with in a Private Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In taking out the words the Minister said he relied on the opinion of the Parliamentary draftsman, who told him he did not see why they should not be taken out.  The Parliamentary draftsman is an excellent lawyer and <Col N="325" /> an excellent draftsman, but he is not the law adviser of the Government. If asked the object of the Bill, to give the Corporation power to get a grip on the uncalled capital of the shareholders, he would agree to take the clause out, but that the Oireachtas or the Minister should act on the opinion of the draftsman is no reason for asking us to do such a thing.  The Corporation should not be allowed to ride over everybody else in this matter. The main reason why I brought forward an amendment was in consequence of something Senator Johnson said when the Bill was last before the House.  The Senator said that he believed the whole trouble in regard to the Corporation was the advances made to a small number of societies. I took the trouble to find out the reason given in the Dáil, and I believe the societies mentioned in my amendment are the principal societies to which the Corporation had lent money in consequence of representations made at the time, by the then Minister for Agriculture, that if they lent the money he would take care that a Bill would be passed to complete the charge.  That Bill never came forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now trying to fulfil the pledge that was given to the Corporation. If he had been debating the matter at that time, I do not think the Oireachtas would have agreed to back up the Minister's pledge.  I wonder if any Minister has a right to say to such a society: &ldquo;You lend the money and I will bring in a Bill which will take care that you get your money back.&rdquo;  Really that is the state of affairs, as well as I can make out what was said.  Undoubtedly the Corporation lent the money, and if Senators look at the amendment proposing to insert a schedule after Section 14, they will see that these creameries were started in parts of the country which were not accustomed to creamery work.  Kildare and Leix are agricultural counties, but, as far as I know, not accustomed to creamery work.  Edenderry is an agricultural country.  Perhaps some Senator can tell me where Imokelly is.  I understand it is in Wexford.  The societies in these places are not in creamery <Col N="326" /> districts, but I think this was an effort on the part of the Minister to establish creameries where they were not accustomed to such work.  But we must consider the shareholders.  We have not been told whether they are going to be allowed to have a say in the matter.  If we pass the section without any alteration we are going to burden the ordinary shareholders of these five creameries&mdash;the number may be more&mdash;with an undoubted liability to pay the full amount due on the uncalled capital.  I cannot say if many farmers or agriculturists would be able to submit to such a charge now.  As the Corporation had five years to collect the debts, this is a wrong time to compel these societies to hand over to the Corporation the right to go to the ordinary shareholders for whatever balance remained due on the uncalled capital.  That is the reason I am putting forward the amendment as I believe it would be far better to take such a provision out of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The affairs of this Corporation in regard to these societies should be explained plainly and clearly, to let us see what amount of liability the Oireachtas would be willing to put on the ordinary shareholders of these five or six societies.  The Minister will probably explain more about it.  Outside of that I can see no reason for giving a preferential position to one amongst many banking corporations and companies.  I know of no case in the banking community, except this Corporation, where any bank has put forward to the Minister a request of this nature, and I know of no case where creamery societies have said that they did not want to appeal to their shareholders.  There must be something quite abnormal in this question, and I doubt very much if it is a position the Seanad should allow to be made part of a Bill of this nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the words to which Senator Jameson referred, which were deleted in the Dáil, I think it is fairly obvious that if they remained in the section would have no effect.  What the Senator meant was that if this Bill is necessary the charge could not be lawfully made <Col N="327" /> at that particular time.  If it could, and if there was any doubt about it, this Bill would not be necessary at all. I do not know what reference the Senator has made about the draftsman. I did not say in the Dáil that I took the draftsman's advice, but I probably said that I consulted him on the effect of having these words removed, and that he agreed that the section was all right without them. That is the question I wished to consult him about.  Senator Jameson says that I said the Corporation found out that they could not get this charge unless these words were removed.  That is true.  When the Bill was published the Corporation, like many others interested, got a copy of it and on going through it they objected to these words and asked me to have them removed.  I am not giving the Credit Corporation any particular favours, and when Senator Jameson says that the Oireachtas probably would not have done this in 1929, I must point out that Senators would probably have done so then, I can only suggest that they did not use the microscope as well then as now, because in the Creamery Act, 1928, they did exactly what I am doing here.  But, as the Creamery Act was brought in by another Government, I take it that the Seanad did not examine it as minutely as this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Creamery Act of 1928 confirmed an agreement made between the Dairy Disposals Board and certain creameries, and confirmed agreements made between one society and another. That was done at the time on the promise of the Minister that the business would be legalised.  The Minister carried out the promise between the creameries and the Dairy Disposals Board, which was a Government-owned institution, and brought his Bill to the Dáil and to the Seanad, and I do not think he had any great trouble in getting it through the Seanad at the time.  When I come along to fulfil a further pledge of that Minister there is a microscope used on every line of my Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The pledge which he gave to the other societies or to the Dairy Disposals Board, which was formed in 1928, was not communicated to either House until the Bill came before them.  The business had been done before that.  The Minister had told these people in 1927 that he would make them right, and they went ahead on the promise of the Minister.  The Minister came before the Dáil and the Seanad to make them right and I suggest that neither the Dáil nor the Seanad gave the Minister any great trouble about carrying out his promise. I suggest that the Seanad at the time did not examine his Bill in the same critical spirit that they have examined this Bill.  I am only carrying out part of the pledge that the Minister gave at that time.  The Minister gave a pledge to the Agricultural Credit Corporation at the time&mdash;that is admitted by my officials&mdash;that if they lent money to these particular creameries which were built in 1929, at the first available opportunity he would have that confirmed by a Bill.  Since then the Agricultural Credit Corporation were waiting until some Bill was introduced amending the Agricultural Credit Corporation Act or some such Bill as this. This is the first opportunity that we had to confirm that legally.</P>
      <P>I do not see why there should be any great anxiety about the shareholders or the members in this case.  First of all, sub-section 1 (b) says &ldquo;that when such loan was so made there was an arrangement or understanding between the said Corporation and such Society.&rdquo; I mean to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage to change the words &ldquo;arrangement or understanding&rdquo; to &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; to meet the objections made here on the Second Stage, so that it will read, if that is accepted, &ldquo;that when such loan was so made there was an agreement between the said Corporation and such Society&rdquo; about the loan.  Secondly, paragraph (c) reads: &ldquo;that when such loan was made the rules of such Society authorised the charging (whether generally or in favour of said Corporation) of the uncalled capital of such Society.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> That was a very peculiar rule for any society to have&mdash;that they authorised the charging of the uncalled capital.  As a matter of fact, no other society except those particular societies that owe money to the Agricultural Credit Corporation has that rule, and they put in that rule specially to meet the case.  Correspondence can be produced by the Agricultural Credit Corporation to show that before issuing the loan at the time they compelled each society to change its rules to authorise the charging of the uncalled capital. Legally, however, the Agricultural Credit Corporation could not take such a charge until this Bill is passed. As far as the societies are concerned, they altered their rules specially to allow the Agricultural Credit Corporation to have a charge on the uncalled capital.  They signed an agreement that as the capital was called in it could go to the Corporation in paying off the loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about that.  I want to go back to the position at the time.  These societies were going to form creameries and the Agricultural Credit Corporation said: &ldquo;If each shareholder puts down 2/6 per £1 share the Corporation will advance the remainder of the capital.&rdquo;  That is, they were advancing 17/6 for every 2/6 put down by the members at the time.  It was a very big advance for any lender to give; but it was on the understanding, of course, that it would be paid back at the rate of 2/6 per year over seven years.  The societies, I need not say, were delighted to accept that arrangement. The shareholders or members could not possibly be consulted about this now.  Could we really be so unjust to the Agricultural Credit Corporation as to say: &ldquo;If these members object now to paying you, you cannot <Col N="330" /> be paid?&rdquo;  Surely we could not give them that power?  Surely they must be bound to pay whether they object or not?  They agreed at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>What evidence have we that they did agree?  I have not heard of any evidence, except some statement.  We have not got before the House any evidence that the shareholders of any one of these societies gave their consent at a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, on the Report Stage I propose to bring in an amendment to make it read &ldquo;that when such loan was so made there was an agreement between the said Corporation and such society&rdquo;; also, as it is fairly obvious that they did it for one purpose, that the rules must provide that they can charge the uncalled capital. These two points ought to be quite sufficient to show that they knew what they were doing at the time.  Of course, they all knew what they were doing.  The point is, however, that some of these societies have not paid over the capital as it was called in, because they got to know that the Agricultural Credit Corporation could not collect it legally.  This is to give the Corporation power to enforce that and have the money collected.  That is what the section is for.  I think, in all justice, that the Corporation should be allowed to collect that money and that the members should not have any power whatever, by resolution or otherwise, to prevent the payment of that money.  I think it would be very unjust if they got that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment of Senator Jameson, instead of the Agricultural Credit Corporation applying to the Minister for Agriculture showing that these conditions have been fulfilled and asking for an order from the Minister that this money should be payable to them, Senator Jameson suggests a schedule.  As far as I have been able to find out since I received these amendments, I think Senator Jameson has named the only societies concerned.  It might not be altogether fair to the societies to have their names actually published in an Act.  It might injure their credit somewhat.  I have <Col N="331" /> no very strong objection to it.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation say, as far as they are concerned, that it does not matter to them.  The societies, however, might object to having their names published.  I think it would be better if Senator Jameson were satisfied with the amendment which I intend to bring in on the Report Stage to have the words &ldquo;arrangement or understanding&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;agreement.&rdquo; That ought to make the thing fairly water-tight.</P>

I suggested to the Minister that instead of the words &ldquo;arrangement or understanding&rdquo; he should put in the word &ldquo;agreement.&rdquo;  If the Minister on the Report Stage inserts the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; in paragraph (b), I think he will have answered every objection made by Senator Jameson.  I think it is the better way of dealing with the points raised by Senator Jameson and that it does justice between the parties. Having regard to the fact that the Minister has promised on the Report Stage to insert the word &ldquo;agreement,&rdquo; I think Senator Jameson ought not to press his amendment.  Of course, I would point out to the Minister that if he does insert the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; it will be construed as a legal agreement.  I would suggest to the House that what the Minister has now promised meets the situation.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Minister has said about those agreements come to, I think we have nothing to do but to honour the pledge given by the Minister.  But, as Senator Sir John Keane has pointed out, at this stage it would be rather a hardship on some of the other creditors.  It would seem to some of us to be doing what, in the ordinary way, would be regarded as giving a preference to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but, all the same, I think we have nothing to do now but to honour the pledge given by the Minister.  I suggest to the Minister that instead of having the Bill general in its application it should be confined to the societies that made those agreements with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>

I ask the Committee to confine the Bill to certain societies specified.  It would be a very bad Bill if it worked so that it could be applied to any or to an unlimited number of societies.  But if it is made certain that it is to be applied only to a specified lot of societies I <Col N="333" /> think the Minister has a right to get it after he has met these points on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that this Bill should be limited in its application to any particular number of societies such as have been mentioned.  There must be a great number of co-operative societies in the country that would be relieved by such a Bill as this.  I know some myself.  I think the whole intention of the Bill would be destroyed if its operation was limited to a few co-operative societies.  I have no great doubts about the shareholders being consulted as to the issuing of debentures such as these.  I cannot believe there will be any difficulty about the matter.  As far as I know, the shareholders can be easily consulted and debentures can be issued with their approval.  I think it is a perfectly fair thing that the great number of shareholders in the various societies should be relieved by such a measure as this by getting permission to issue debentures under agreement with their shareholders and also under agreement with the lenders so that they can pay off those old debts if possible.</P>

      <P>I very much hope the House will insist upon limiting the Bill to those societies already named. There has already been publicity given in connection with the matter and everyone knows which are the societies intended.  I gather from the Minister that these societies cover the ground. I am puzzled in regard to some of the proposals in the Bill and that is the reason why I suggested that the whole thing should be investigated by a committee. I know of cases where money has been advanced to societies, not by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but by societies working on the same principle.  Creameries were built and were financed from funds by the Government and there was some understanding that the uncalled capital should be available.  In the case of one kind of uncalled capital where it is not specially earmarked for the liquidation <Col N="334" /> of the debt, whether the lender is the Government or otherwise, they would have to take their chance.  Another point is: is this claim on uncalled capital confined to capital created when the loan was made?  In the case of the older societies there is an older capital created years ago.  Is that earlier capital capital under this clause?  I think it is most desirable to limit it.  We have it now that in the case of the four societies named earlier, capital does not exist.  I hope the Minister will consider that and that it will not only be by agreement but by agreement embodied in the society's rules.  I do not challenge Senator Comyn upon the meaning of the word agreement or what agreement there must be.  So far as we can see, any agreement that satisfies the Minister will be good.  Who will challenge such an agreement when the whole interpretation of it is in the hands of the Minister?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister clear this up: whether the societies mentioned in the proposed schedule were, in fact, started in the form and understanding that they were to be capitalised, as to a great part of their capital, by the Agricultural Credit Corporation?  The whole proceedings were on the understanding that the capital would be provided by that Corporation.  If any of these societies are to look for new money the shareholders were taken into consultation and the whole proceedings were conducted when the society was formed on the understanding that that would be the method of financing.</P>

      <P>Section 8, sub-section (2).  To delete the sub-section.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to delete sub-section (2).  I raised the point on the Second Reading that it provided for punishment of every member of the committee of a society which contravened the section.  I pointed out the possibility that a minority of the committee might be overborne by the majority, but that notwithstanding the minority protest the minority would also be liable to the £25 penalty.  I thought that was unjust to the minority.  I should like if the Minister could agree to make a proviso somewhat to this effect; that where a member of such committee proves, from the records of the minutes of the meetings of the committee at which the decision was taken, that he had opposed the resolution by his vote, such a penalty would not apply to such a person.  That would meet my point in the matter, if it could be done.</P>

If he stands by, aiding and abetting it by his silence, I should say that he ought to be subjected to the penalty as well as the persons who actively do what is wrong.</P>

I might almost say that I do not mind very much whether Senator Johnson's amendment is carried or not, but I am afraid that the penalties on the members of the committee would be even more drastic if that sub-section were removed, because with the sub-section in the maximum penalty would appear to be £25, whereas without it they could be taken up for the misappropriation of funds which might render them liable for any amount.</P>

      <P>Section 2.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  This Act shall remain in force until the 30th day of September, 1935, and shall then expire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his Second Reading speech, stated that this Bill was a temporary measure and that it would remain in force only for a specific time for the specific purpose for which he was introducing it.  In view of that statement, I do not think there will be any objection by the Minister to accept this amendment.  It is giving sufficient time to experiment on the Bill, and if the purpose for which it was introduced has not then arrived, he can bring in an amending Bill or pass a resolution continuing this Act.  We have passed in this House a good many Acts within the last 12 months, and before that time had expired, the Minister thought it necessary to bring in amending Bills. <Col N="338" /> I am sure that he will have the experience that within less than 12 months of the working of this Bill, he will find it necessary to amend it in several very important clauses.</P>
    <P>I opposed this Bill on the Second Reading.  I opposed it because I thought it was an unworkable and a revolutionary measure.  But the Seanad evidently thought differently. At all events, they disagreed with me and passed the Second Reading which was approving of the principle of the Bill.  I have looked over the Bill in order to see what amendments could be made to it and I find that if the Minister wants to carry out the Bill in order to try out his plan, that it cannot be very well amended to give the Minister full power to try out his plan for the 12 months.  Any amendments which I have put down are amendments which will not interfere with the working of the Bill, although it was rather difficult to resist putting in some amendments to the very drastic clauses which I consider the Bill contains.  The Minister's acceptance of this amendment will possibly make the House agreeable to pass the Final Stage of the measure if its rejection is moved.  At all events, none of the amendments I have put in interferes in any way with the Minister in trying his plan to the fullest extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  The Minister will realise that many Senators are very uneasy about passing this Bill and do not at all like to be involved in responsibility for a Bill which embodies such principles as this, but they are voting for the Bill because they recognise that there is a real difficulty which has got to be dealt with somehow and that this is the Government's scheme for alleviating the sufferings of those people who are most affected by that difficulty.  I think that the fact that they are passing the Bill for that reason, and not at all because they approve of the principles in a great deal of it, is a justification for asking the Minister to accept an amendment of this kind, because, after all, there is nothing compulsory about it.  Another Bill can be brought in if the Government consider it necessary to <Col N="339" /> carry on the scheme.  On the other hand, if it fails, it can be dropped and before a Bill of such kind is passed in such circumstances, I think it reasonable to fix some time limit.</P>

Anybody knows that a Bill which calls for so many arrangements as this measure does could not possibly be in operation until very nearly the date by which Senator Counihan proposes it should expire.  I think if he has any sense, or if he wants the people of the country to believe that he has any sense at all left, he should withdraw the amendment.</P>

It is looked upon as a very dangerous Bill and as one which, I am afraid, will have far reaching effects on agriculturists in the country. Being a Bill of that class, the shorter the period of its operation, the better.  Twelve months will, I think, give the people sufficient time to see the effects of the Bill and will also give the Government time for their experiment.  If they think it is necessary, they can try to bring in an amending Bill at the end of the period. I hope that Senator Counihan will insist on his amendment because this is a Bill which, as I say, will have far reaching effects on the agricultural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was forced to introduce this measure by reason of events which have happened in the last two or three years.  We all agree that it is necessary that the price of cattle consumed in the Free State should be brought up to a level which is fair and reasonable and that the artificial reduction in the price of cattle created by the tariffs should be remedied as much as possible, so far, at least, as it relates to cattle consumed by the inhabitants of this country&mdash;the people in the towns.  We all agree that it was a necessary measure and if it was a necessary measure, why not give it a reasonable chance of success?  It will be a difficult measure to administer but it will be rendered infinitely more difficult by the fact that you have a time limit of 12 months.  Everything to be done under the Bill, in the offices and elsewhere, will be done under the shadow of that 12 months and the result, in the practical working out of the measure, will be that the Minister and his officials will be paralysed by this time limit of twelve months.</P>
      <P>It is said that this Bill will need amendment.  I am sure it will need amendment.  A measure so difficult as this, in all human probability, will require to be amended in some particulars. If Solomon himself were to draw this Bill, I should say that 12 months' working of it would show that here and there amendments would be necessary.  If an amendment becomes necessary, you can have an amending Bill, but do not throw over the Minister this shadow of the axe at the end of 12 months.  It will prevent him carrying out his work effectually.  As I said before, this is a courageous attempt to deal with the situation. You have, by approving the Second Reading of the Bill and by passing the principle of it, decided to give him fair play and a limitation of this measure to 12 months is not giving him fair play.  For that reason, I think this amendment ought not to be pressed.</P>

The object of the Bill is to counteract the effects of the quota instituted by the British and the Bill ought to remain in force until the British take away the quota, if that ever occurs.

There is no question about it that a new situation has arisen and the Bill will have to be drastically amended. The best way to deal with such a situation at the end of 12 months is to go line by line through the measure, drop the part that has not been found useful and to insert things that would make it very much more valuable to the community than is this measure as it stands.  I think therefore that 12 months is quite enough to give the Minister in which to carry out this measure.  We hope the measure will be a success.</P>

To my mind 12 months is a reasonable time in which to try the experiment.  There are a number of things in the Bill temporary and experimental. <Col N="342" /> One is the fixing of prices.

I think the whole Bill will lead to confusion. Indeed there is a universal opinion amongst the people to whom the Bill will apply that it is bound to be a failure and to lead to confusion.  These people will be glad to have it ended within 12 months.  The proposal in the amendment is quite a justifiable one.

There is no reason why it should not be dropped when the dispute is settled with England.  The whole necessity for the Bill can only be during the period of the dispute with England.  I am sorry that Senators Comyn and Johnson and, I am afraid, Senator Wilson, judging from the tone of their speeches, do not believe that this dispute is to be settled within 12 months, or even to be settled at all.

I know that when the Minister in England says something that is against the Government here, he is telling the truth, but that when he says something that agrees with what the Government here is saying he is not telling the truth.  A good many of these arguments here have arisen from the statement made by Senator Jameson on the Second Reading that the introduction of this Bill was a confession by the Government that their policy was a failure.  It has nothing to do with the policy of the Government.  This Bill is dealing with the quota, and it has nothing to do with the economic dispute in any shape or form.</P>

I might admit that I find some difficulty in understanding Senator Quirke's Tipperary speech, but I could gather that his only argument was that Senator Counihan would make himself less ridiculous if he did not propose this amendment.</P>
      <P>Personally, I think the time limit of one year is sufficiently long time to experiment with the Bill and this would give the Government time to do what they can in the way of negotiations on the question of the quota, not the economic war at all. We have our legislature here and we are standing in a position as regards England where we can negotiate.  If the Government policy is one of self-sufficiency&mdash;and they say it is&mdash;they could use these powers and I think that one year would give sufficient time for the operations of the Bill and for an opportunity to put in force these powers.</P>

      <P>I rise to speak again on this particular amendment because I think it is most undesirable that this debate should go on with any Senators here agreeing that the quota is an entirely separate question from the economic war.  I for one do not believe anything of the kind.  I am quite prepared to argue with anyone who says the quota is separate from the economic war, but I am afraid it would be waste of time.  I firmly believe that had the Government of this country managed their business as they should have done they would not have got the country into the mess into which they have got it and there would not have been the necessity for this Bill, for the quota or for any quota at all.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Senator the McGillycuddy of the Reeks finds it difficult to follow my Tipperary tongue.  I am not bothering about that.  Anyone will recognise me far <Col N="345" /> better as a Tipperary man than Senator The McGillycuddy of the Reeks as a Kerryman.  I would point out to Senator Bagwell, another Tipperaryman, that this quota system is not the result of the economic war and that it is quite separate from the economic war.  I would ask Senators who think it is, to account for the fact that every country in the world is turning towards the quota system at present.  We trade with Germany on a quota system and we have no quarrel with Germany.  Canada is trading with England on the quota system and so is the Argentine and so are various other countries.  The fact that there has been what is called the economic war going on, is made an excuse for everything, but that is one argument that will not hold as far as the quotas are concerned.  I believe that if the economic war were finished in the morning the quota would still exist.</P>

There is not the slightest doubt that if this Government had not gone out of its way to bring about this situation&mdash;they have done it deliberately; they have gone out of their way to throw every possible difficulty in the way of the country&mdash;the quota would not be what it is.  If they had dealt with the British in a reasonable and honourable way the quota would be quite reasonable, and entirely different to what it is to-day.</P>

      <P>Might we return to our muttons?  There is no question but that what the House is anxious about is that it is asked to pass a measure dealing with many things in regard to which we have extreme doubts.  The Minister has told us quite plainly that he is not at the present moment able to say how exactly this Bill will work out.  I think everybody has come to the same conclusion. The House is evidently anxious about the fact that if we pass this Bill without imposing some time limit, or having some arrangement by which some review of its operations can be made, we may commit ourselves to <Col N="346" /> something that may prove a very costly experiment.  I would like to point out that there have been various statements as to the amount of money which will be expended under this Bill, but I have seen no figures from the Minister. I thought that, before this stage of the Bill would have arrived, we would have had a statement from the Minister showing what this Bill is going to cost the country.  He may produce it later, and I should be very glad to see it, because it would clear the air considerably. At present, however, we have not got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all afraid that we may land the country into all sorts of troubles about which we know nothing at the present moment.  We therefore want a period fixed at the end of which a report will be made to the House setting forth what has happened, the expenditure incurred, and how the Bill has worked generally.  If we were dealing with the matter in an ordinary business way, say through the manager of a bank, we would ask that a report be furnished at the end of 12 months as to how the scheme had worked out.  I think there is a good deal in what Senator Comyn says, that when you hit hard the thing must expire before that time.  Long before that, however, the Minister will be in a position to arrange for that review, but he may be up against difficulties which Senators who have put forward this proposal are not taking fully into consideration.  I think the Minister, however, could get over the difficulty if he would undertake to bring forward a full report at the end of, say, a year showing how the Bill had been operated, what its cost had been, what difficulties he had to meet and how he surmounted them.  Of what avail would this amendment be if it were passed?  If we pass it the Bill will go back to the Dáil and the amendment will be chucked at our heads so that we get nowhere.  It would be far better if we could arrive at an agreement with the Minister under which he would undertake to make a report at a certain date.  I think it would be far more advantageous if we got an undertaking from the Minister to tell us at the end of the year what had happened, <Col N="347" /> than to pass an amendment limiting the operation of the Bill to a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion made by Senator Jameson could hardly be effective unless we introduce something in the nature of a time-limit.  The promise of the Minister to review the situation, say this day twelve months, would, I think, be a somewhat precarious undertaking to give, because it is quite possible&mdash;I think, and hope, it is certain&mdash; that the present Government will be out of existence by that time and the Minister would be unable to fulfil his undertaking.  Perhaps it would meet the situation if the amendment were amended to read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This Act shall remain in force until the 30th day of September, 1935, and, if not renewed, shall then expire.</P>
      <P>The necessity for reproducing the Bill or appealing to the House for its renewal, would necessitate such a review of the situation as Senator Jameson suggests, but merely to leave it to the good-will and discretion of the Minister to make such a review of the situation is, I think, a very unreliable and unsatisfactory way of meeting the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Jameson, as he always is, is very reasonable, and I think the House ought to adopt the suggestion which he has made.  We ought, of course, at the end of twelve months or eighteen months, to get some sort of account as to how the Bill is working.  I would say that when the Appropriation Bill comes on, we would probably get most of these particulars, but what Senator Jameson has said cannot be contradicted, that if you limit the operation of this Bill to twelve months you may as well have no Bill at all.  If there is to be any limitation I think it should be for a reasonable time, such time as the Minister would say would be sufficient to enable him to do his work efficiently. It is said that by making this Bill a permanent measure we are adding fuel to the economic war or the quota war. We do nothing of the kind, but if we limit it to twelve months our opponents <Col N="348" /> will say: &ldquo;You had better settle with us now, you have only twelve months to settle in any case.&rdquo; I think we should support our own Government in these matters as far as we reasonably may, and that if you are to have any time limit it will be such a time limit as will allow twelve months, eighteen months or two years effectual work. I do not know whether the Minister would agree to any time limit, but if he does, I am sure that the House ought to agree with him and not make this Bill like other Bills, a bone of contention between the two Houses, because if we say that the measure should expire in twelve months it is perfectly obvious that the Dáil will not accept that amendment.</P>

      <P>Senators seem to forget that at the end of 12 months the Seanad, perhaps, will not be here at all.  We shall have passed away.  We shall not be in a position to discuss this measure which, I believe, is a very bad measure and one that will have far-reaching effects on the country.  It has been represented here that the Bill is brought forward to meet the quota.  I do not agree at all that it is brought forward to meet the quota because the trouble was there before the quota was imposed and it is the trouble that has caused the quota.  Why have the exports of Canada not been limited under the quota?  As far as I know Canada has increased her supplies to the English market.  I do not see any reason, apart from the trouble, why Ireland should not have held at least her former supplies to the English market.  The price fixed for beef under this Bill we are told is going to be 25/- and some people seem to think that that will mean a temporary improvement in the cattle trade. Some of the fattening counties seem to be very enthusiastic over the Bill, but I can assure you that counties like Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan are not so very enthusiastic about this Bill.  We, in these counties, feel that this Bill will be very injurious to us. Even in the Belfast market yesterday the price paid for cattle was 40/6 per cwt.  It is thought a great thing to fix a price here of 25/-.  If the <Col N="349" /> Seanad gives its consent to a Bill which, it believes, is a bad Bill for the country, it is a bad principle on which to act and we should limit the duration of the operation of the Bill to 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill involves the voting by the Dáil of large sums of money.  That will involve discussion on the procedure under the Bill, in the first instance about March, when the Vote on Account is asked for, and, later, on the Estimates.  If Senator Toal says that there will be no Seanad in existence then, the Dáil will, at least, have power to prevent the further operation of the Bill by refusing to vote the necessary moneys. It is clearly contemplated that there will be delay in bringing into effect the different Parts of this Bill.  The Minister pointed out on Second Reading that the price-fixing part might be brought into effect and that it might be found unnecessary to bring any other Part of the Bill into effect. I do not think that that is likely to happen but that is how the Bill is drafted.  It is, however, contemplated that there will be delays between the bringing into effect of one Part of the Bill and the bringing into effect of another Part of the Bill.  Taking these facts into account, to talk about the expiry of the Bill in 12 months is to attempt to nullify the effects of the Second Reading vote.  From what has been said here to-day, I take it that the statement last week by the Minister, as to the purpose of the Bill, has had no effect.  The Minister made very clear here and in the Dáil that the Bill was designed to meet the situation created by the quota. Senator Toal and others would evidently prefer that there should be no such Bill.  Assuming that 25/-, which was indicated as the possible price, be the price under this Bill, then Senator Toal and others would prefer that the price should not be 25/- but should be, as at present, 18/-, 19/- or 20/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Senator would prefer but, as it happens, the absence of this Bill would not bring Northern Ireland prices and the presence of this Bill will ensure the difference between the present price of 18/- and the prospective price of 25/- or 26/-.  That is the position in which Senators are asking the Seanad to place the farmers&mdash;that they should be without the Bill, because the limit of 12 months is in effect a nullification of the Second Reading approval.  That is the position Senators are asking the House to agree to, a nullification of last week's vote. The operation of some portions of this Bill will certainly be delayed for some months.  In the intervening time, between the bringing in of the final Part of the Bill and the end of September, Senators are asking the Minister to give a full and complete report of the effects of the test and experiment. Nobody seriously concerned with the carrying out of such an experiment could give a fair report at the end of that time.  Consequently, I take it that the intention of this amendment is to recover from the shock of having given Second Reading support to this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw the amendment put down by Senator Counihan, I regarded it as an absolutely frivolous amendment.  I thought that Senator Counihan was only trying to undo what the Seanad had done in passing the Second Reading.  I could not imagine any sensible Senator thinking that anything could be done, even in the way of giving the Bill a trial, within 12 months.  Evidently, some Senators were afraid there might be some good in the Bill and, therefore, did not like to take the risk of voting against Second Reading, but, on the other hand, they want to give as much trouble as possible by making the Bill practically ineffective, because it could not be effective over a 12 months' period.  I thought we had got a number of Senators to see that the quota was a different thing from the economic war measures but, evidently, the fact that other Dominions have to <Col N="351" /> suffer quotas, same as ourselves, has no effect on certain Senators here.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that I ever said this was a temporary measure, although Senator Counihan based his argument on that.  Neither, I hope, is my position so temporary that I may not be here 12 months hence.  I think that I am much more likely to be available 12 months hence than the Senator is.  It was pointed out that, as we had brought in amendments to this Bill here, we had not drafted the Bill very well.  The reason that we brought in amendments here was that a number of matters, raised on Committee Stage in the Dáil, had to be dealt with.  On account of the time table at the end of the session, the Committee Stage and Report Stage of the Bill in the Dáil were taken on the same day and it was agreed that I should take amendments which I accepted in here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did explain the cost of the Bill twice&mdash;in opening the debate and in closing it.  I gave all the figures, so far as they could be forecast.  If Senator Jameson looks up the debate on Second Reading he will see that I gave the figures.  Senator Counihan said here the other day that he approved of that part of the Bill which refers to the disposal of old cows. Does Senator Counihan, or even a more sensible Senator than he on his side of the House, think that any company is going to put £20,000 into a meat-meal factory which is to work only until next September?  It is ridiculous to think that it would do such a thing and Senator Counihan knows that it is ridiculous.  Senator Counihan is much more concerned with making this Bill a failure than with any report which may be made at the end of 12 months.  However, Senator Wilson dealt with him sufficiently in that regard.  Senator Counihan also approves of the tinning factory, which is going to cost more than £20,000 in all probability.  We can give the tinning factory very good protection under this Bill but neither the company interested in the tinning factory nor the company interested in the meat-meal factory, which will take <Col N="352" /> six months to build, is going to commence operation next April or May to conclude in September.  They are not going to sink capital to the extent of £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000, as the case may be, in an undertaking subject to those conditions.</P>
    <P>This amendment could have no other effect than to nullify the Bill.  Even if the amendment is passed, that does not say that the Bill is not going to continue but the amendment gives a suggestion of uncertainty and instability with regard to it.</P>
    <P>I was asked about a report at the end of 12 months.  There can be practically nothing done under this Bill without an order so that, in effect, we shall be reporting to the Seanad practically every week.  When the time comes to fix a price, we have to make an order, which will be laid on the Table and respecting which any Senator can raise a question.  Any time we bring in the provision regarding the marking of cattle into operation, we must make an order and any Senator can draw attention to the matter.  Everything done under this Bill is done by order, which must be laid on the Table of both Houses, so that there is a report, not at the end of 12 months but very frequently, with regard to every provision of the Bill.  So far as the Government trading provisions are concerned, it is provided that the auditor's report must be laid before both Houses at the end of the year.  The position is that we must make a report of Government trading at the end of the year.  That is provided for in the Bill.  In fact everything done under the Bill must be done by order.  Nothing can be done without first coming to both Houses. If there is any matter that Senators wish to raise they can do so when these orders are laid before them.  I find it very hard to understand Senator Toal's objection to the Bill.  If the people in Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal object to the Bill I do not know what their objection can be because, as Senator Johnson put it very clearly, we hope to increase prices under it.  We cannot depress prices, but we hope to increase them, and surely it is to the advantage of the people in Monaghan, Cavan and <Col N="353" /> Donegal that prices should be increased.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that I am in agreement with the setting up of the two factories named in the Bill, the tinning factory and the meat-meal factory.  I cannot see what these two factories have to do with this Bill.  Why should they not be set up independently of this Bill?  I will certainly object to their establishment if it means that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will have to be continued in force in order to preserve their existence.  I am sure that those who will be concerned in the establishment of these two factories will have some agreement with the Government, and that the Seanad believes that, so far as they are concerned, whatever Government comes into power, if the present Government goes out, it will continue to honour the bond given by this Government.  Senator Comyn and Senator Wilson said that this Bill could not be tried out in 12 months.  I would point out to them that we have several Acts on the statute book which are only continued from year to year under the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Act.  Why not include this measure in the annual Expiring Laws (Continuance) Act?  To limit the operation of this Bill to a period of 12 months does not mean that the Bill, when it becomes an Act, should cease to be operative after that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to refer to the economic war, but Senator Johnson and Senator Robinson have stated that the quota has been responsible for this Bill.  I agree, but these Senators have tried to make the House and the country believe that if there was a settlement of the economic dispute <Col N="354" /> to-morrow the quota would still continue to operate.  Is there any sensible man in this House or in the country who believes that?  If there was a settlement of it I believe that the quota would go.  I do not propose to press this amendment to a division but rather to ask the House to leave it over for Report.  In the meantime I will consult with the Minister with a view to submitting an amendment which would meet with his approval fixing some time limit for the Bill, because I think the House should not allow the Bill to pass without putting some limit on its duration.</P>

      <P>The register, as defined, might possibly include knackers because they would probably be slaughtering diseased or injured cattle for meat meal.  We do not want to include such people.  There is also the factory that I mentioned on another occasion which would deal with old cows for making meal.

      <P>I do not want to oppose this amendment, but I should like to point out that if it is passed it will cause great hardship to many farmers.  It has been a common practice for farmers to kill sheep and to sell portion of the carcases to their workmen or to neighbours.  Many people kill their own sheep, and if they are not able to use the meat in their own households they would have to sell or to give some of it away.  Farmers cannot afford to give anything away at present.  They would be prohibited from slaughtering sheep unless the section is amended, by providing for licences or something of that kind.  If the section is passed as it stands, the loss inflicted on farmers will be a serious one.  From the Minister's point of view I can realise that in the working of the Bill a provision giving permission to slaughter should be restricted in its scope, but some amendment could be devised by which farmers, under licence, could slaughter one or two sheep weekly.  I wish to call the Minister's attention to another matter, with a view to having this section amended on the Report Stage. Mental hospitals and other institutions kill sheep and cattle for use by the inmates.  They also supply the attendants with meat.  They will not be able to supply the attendants if the section passes in its present form, and as a result there would be a certain amount of hardship inflicted on the attendants in these institutions.  The meat killed in these places is not sold to the public.</P>

      <P>I wish to stress the views expressed regarding this section, which will be a great hardship on many farmers who, since the present difficulty regarding the sale of cattle arose, have been in the habit of slaughtering a heifer or one or two sheep occasionally. The poor people and workmen benefited by that arrangement. I do not see any occasion for smiles at that statement on the Labour Benches. It is much better and more honourable that a man should be able to work and <Col N="359" /> earn the price of meat than that he should be made a beggar, or put on the level of a pauper by being given meat free for purposes that we know perfectly well are not meant to be genuinely charitable at all.  I hope an amendment will be brought in, either by the Minister or by some Senator, so that exemptions can be made in the case of farmers who find it impossible to dispose of their cattle and who kill them and sell them very cheaply. These would be exceptional cases and could not be classed with butchers.</P>

      <P>There appears to be a certain inconsistency between the proposed new section and Section 25. In the proposed new section there is a prohibition of slaughter in other than registered premises of any animals for human consumption.  In Section 25 there is a prohibition, but only for the slaughter for sale for human consumption. These two sections are, to a certain extent, in conflict.  The proposed section places a greater restriction on slaughter for any purpose, as against Section 25, which restricts slaughter for sale.  That brings me to the point Senator Counihan made.  Under this section a farmer could not slaughter sheep for consumption in his own household. Surely that is not intended?  If it is intended, like a lot of other Acts on the Statute Book, it simply will not be enforced or will not be observed.  I think we ought to have in legislation <Col N="360" /> due respect for the law and for the power to enforce the law.  It is astonishing the number of provisions on the Statute Book which are not enforced.  It seems a great hardship that the present practice of slaughtering a sheep for a family or for neighbours shall not be allowed to continue. One of the earliest recollections of my youth was how families used to slaughter a sheep every week or so and divide it.  When you come to tie all this up with regulations, it either makes life impossible or the regulations are not observed.  I wish the Minister would show some hope of reconsidering the matter and allowing the latitude which at present exists with regard to sharing between friends to continue.  There is no object in disguising the fact that money does pass, but it passes between a little circle of friends and relations. I think it would be intolerable if that were stopped by the heavy hand of regulation.</P>

      <P>If what Senator Sir John Keane anticipates were to happen, I think a good deal could be said against this amendment.  From my reading of Section 10 (1) I think that it relates only to the business of slaughter and not to the slaughter of cattle and sheep by a farmer for consumption by his family and workmen; or slaughter by a gentleman down the country at Christmas of a bullock or a sheep for the purpose of distribution amongst neighbours.  I think that that could not be regarded as the business of slaughtering.  I think the operative word in the proposed section is &ldquo;business&rdquo;. The Minister I am sure will be able to explain the matter more fully than I can.</P>

      <P>Of course, the governing section is the section quoted by Senator Sir John Keane.  The intention of the Bill is obvious.  It says that it shall not be lawful for any cattle or sheep to be slaughtered for sale for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann other than in registered premises.  That was the Bill as it stood before this amendment was brought in.  I shall deal with the amendment in a minute.  The Bill deals with slaughtering for sale for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann.  That is that they are to be slaughtered for sale and to be consumed in Saorstát Eireann; so that these institutions that slaughter cattle and sheep for their inmates were exempt.  As to the amendment, we consider that &ldquo;the business of slaughtering cattle for human consumption&rdquo; was really the phrase to be relied upon. I am quite prepared, however, if the Seanad wishes, to have it made clear and to put in the words &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; and make it read &ldquo;the business of slaughtering cattle for sale for human consumption.&rdquo;  That would go this far, at any rate, that where a farmer wants to kill a sheep for his own use or an institution wants to kill cattle or sheep for the use of the inmates they are exempt.  It does not, however, exempt the farmer who kills either a beast or a sheep for sale amongst his neighbours. There is nothing whatever to prevent his coming under the Bill, because we have avoided taking any discretion with regard to registration.  If any person applies to the Minister for registration he must register him unless the local authorities prevent it under some public health provision. Apart from that, if a farmer or anybody else applies to the Minister to be registered in the register of slaughtering premises, the Minister must register him.  So that a farmer who kills a beast or three or four sheep every week or every month is automatically <Col N="362" /> registered and comes under the Bill if he applies for admission to the register. He has no complaint therefore.  I think that if the words &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; were put in there they should meet the difficulty.</P>

      <P>The point is that for various reasons some of these institutions do sell to their employees. Between this and the Report Stage the Minister ought to consider that in order to safeguard the position in that respect.  Possibly they would not apply for a licence for sale because they do not sell for profit.  It is a matter of convenience to the employees. Take the Portrane Mental Hospital, where there is a population of 2,000 people within the institution and where a large number of employees have houses within the precincts of the institution.  For convenience sake, the public authority sells to its employees, not for profit but for convenience. Between this and the Report Stage the Minister ought to go into the matter and have a suitable amendment drafted to deal with it, as it is of importance.</P>

But if a farmer came to slaughter, would that mean the business of slaughtering?  Neither paragraph (a) Section 9, nor the new section would apply if my reading is correct.  It does not refer to the actual killing.  That is dealt with in Section 25 which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for any cattle or sheep to be slaughtered for sale for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann in any premises or place whatsoever other than registered slaughtering premises.</P>

      <P>I wonder if when the Minister was drafting this Bill he realised its possible repercussions?  A man is registered first of all and has to pay the registration fee.  If he kills one sheep he has to pay 5/-.  No one has a right to say that he is working on equal rights with the butcher.  The farmer who kills one sheep may only sell one forequarter to his workers.  The payment of the 5/- may be avoided by certain farmers but you may find a busy policeman or a labourer who does not like a particular farmer reporting him for not having registered.  I think the way out of this difficulty would be to add a new section, with a separate definition of the business, and which would exclude killing for agricultural or domestic purposes connected with the farmer's holding.  I think that would cover the ground.</P>

The word &ldquo;business&rdquo; has a clear meaning <Col N="365" />&mdash;everyone understands it.  In my opinion, the killing of a sheep by a farmer for use in his own household, and for sale to his workmen, is not carrying on the business of slaughtering cattle or sheep.  I am also of opinion&mdash;but I do not put it forward as of any greater worth than the opinion of any other Senator&mdash;that the killing of a sheep by a farmer and the selling of a quarter to his workmen is not killing for sale.  It is much better to leave the meaning as it is without attempting all these little amendments, which would only make it worse.  The Bill is all right as it stands.  No one can say to the farmer that the killing of a sheep for his own use and the selling of a quarter of it could be regarded as killing for sale.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would give the committee some idea of what was in his mind with reference to sub-section (3) of Section 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) The Minister shall not register any premises in a register kept in pursuance of this Act unless and until he is satisfied that such premises comply with all (if any) relevant regulations and bye-laws made by the local sanitary authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complying with the regulations and bye-laws made by the local sanitary authority, on the face of it, would be pretty reasonable.  There is no doubt that there are quite a number of premises in existence now which are <Col N="366" /> not up to the standard of the regulations and bye-laws made by local authorities.  It is quite conceivable that for years past there may have been premises in which work was being done which did not strictly comply with all the relevant regulations.  It will be a great hardship now if the Minister comes along, in combination with the sanitary authorities, and says: &ldquo;We are going to use this Act as a means to prevent you from registering or bringing your premises up to date.&rdquo; I hold that the sanitary authorities should be independent of this Act.  If the premises are not right the sanitary authorities should be allowed to proceed as they always did in the past. Do not mix up the two authorities.  Let the sanitary authority be quite independent. It will be a great injustice to take people summarily and unaware, so to speak.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, how is this going to apply to those who casually slaughter? I mean such people as Senator Miss Browne and other Senators have referred to already.  We all know that the premises in which farmers casually slaughter animals do not comply in any way with the sanitary conditions of the local sanitary authorities.  So long as it is not a business, it does not matter. I think we ought to have some information as to how the Minister proposes to proceed under that sub-section and, if necessary, to safeguard the existing practice in so far as it can be safeguarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no intention whatsoever of objecting to any premises being registered where the sanitary authority did not object.  I had no intention of administering this sub-section in a positive way but only in a negative way, so to speak.  That is, if the sanitary authority objects, then we take the premises off the register.  If they offer no objection, however, then we register automatically.  It is necessary in some form at any rate, because it might appear a bit ridiculous if the sanitary authority actually had told a person to close down and if at the same time he came along and compelled me to register him and went on <Col N="367" /> for some little time carrying on where the sanitary authority had condemned him.  It is only where the sanitary authorities would request that the name be not admitted that we would disallow.  It may be that the wording is not satisfactory to the Senator, but I can assure him that that is the intention.</P>

      <P>I think it is very desirable that when the local authority object the Minister should not grant a licence, because it is important in the largely populated areas that every person should not be at liberty to get a licence to erect a slaughter house.  As a matter of fact, in the City of Dublin for quite a large number of years this has been a most important matter, and the local authority have been considering as far as possible closing down slaughter houses instead of granting additional licences.  It is most important, at least in the largely populated centres, that where the local authority have by-laws and regulations <Col N="368" /> with regard to the granting of licences, they should be the authority on this particular matter, and that where they refuse a licence the Minister should not be empowered to grant a licence in such a case.</P>

      <P>I really am not convinced by the arguments of Senator Farren.  It is possible that we may have the same purpose in view, but I cannot see why the two authorities should be in any way mixed up one with the other.  If the sanitary authority have power to prevent this being done, then let them proceed independently, but do not let it go on the Statute Book that the premises must be under all relevant regulations and by-laws made by the sanitary authority, and that the Minister also has power to act.  I can picture an inspector going out and saying: &ldquo;Look here.  Here are all those regulations&mdash;concrete floor, certain amount of fresh air and so on. The sanitary authority have not refused you, but we will not register you.&rdquo;  I hold that the effect of this is to make the Minister an additional sanitary authority.</P>

The words: &ldquo;until he is satisfied that such premises comply,&rdquo; etc., etc., mean that the Minister has to make an inquiry into the whole situation. Would it not meet the situation if, before he registered those premises, he informed the sanitary authority that he intended to register them?

      <P>That is what we would prefer, if the sanitary authority did not take too long to answer our letters; but that is one of the difficulties.  What I wanted under this Bill was to get away from the provisions of the Fresh Meat Act, where the Minister's inspectors must act as inspectors from the sanitary <Col N="369" /> point of view.  We tried to avoid it here by leaving it to the sanitary authorities to decide.  If they decide that it is all right, then we register; but we do not examine for that purpose at all.  As I say, the wording may not be satisfactory to some of the Senators.

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>(1) The Minister may at any time alter or cancel the registration of any premises under this Part of this Act upon the application in writing in the prescribed form and manner of the registered proprietor or, in the case of an individual, the personal representative, or in the case of a body corporate, the liquidator of the registered proprietor of such premises.</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister may at any time, without any such application as aforesaid, alter the registration of any premises under this Part of this Act in any respect in which such registration appears to him to be erroneous or misleading.</P>
      <P>(3) The Minister may at any time, without any such application as aforesaid, cancel the registration of any premises under this Part of this Act if he is satisfied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) that the registration of such premises was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation, whether fraudulent or innocent, or</P>
      <P>(b) that the business in respect of which such premises are registered has ceased to be carried on in such premises or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) that the registered proprietor of such premises, if an individual, has died or, if a body corporate has been dissolved and, in <Col N="370" /> either case, no other person has within one month after such death or dissolution been registered as proprietor of such premises in place of the registered proprietor so dead or dissolved, or</P>
    <P>(d) that the registered proprietor of such premises has been adjudicated a bankrupt, or</P>
    <P>(e) that the registered proprietor of such premises has been convicted of an offence under any section of this Act.</P>
    <P>(4) Before altering or cancelling (otherwise than in accordance with an application in that behalf made under this section) the registration of any premises under this Part of this Act, the Minister shall give at least one month's notice in writing of his intention so to cancel or alter such registration to the registered proprietor of such premises or his personal representative (if any) or its liquidator (as the case may be) and shall consider any representations made within seven days after the service of such notice by such registered proprietor or personal representative or liquidator (as the case may be) or by any such registered licensee and may, if he thinks fit, cause an inquiry to be held in relation to the matter.</P>
    <P>(5) A notice of the Minister's intention to cancel or alter the registration of premises under this Part of this Act may be served by delivering it to the person to whom it is addressed or by leaving it for him with a person over sixteen years of age on the premises to which it relates or by sending it by post to the person to whom it is addressed at his last known place of abode.</P>
    <P>(6) Where the Minister has cancelled under this section the registration of any premises, the Minister may at any time thereafter refuse, subject to the provisions of this Act, to register such premises in any register kept in pursuance of this Part of this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> Section 12, sub-section (3).  To delete in lines 12-13 the words &ldquo;cancel the registration of any premises under this Part of this Act if he is satisfied&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;apply to the Circuit Court of the circuit in which any premises are registered under this Part of this Act for an order cancelling the registration of such premises, and the court, after hearing the registered proprietor, may make an order cancelling such registration if it is satisfied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to say that if the decision was left solely to the Minister, I do not believe he would do anything very drastic or unreasonable.  Let us consider, however, the position that will occur when those inspectors go round.  If the inspectors were permanent officials of the Department of Agriculture there might be something to be said for it, but we are appointing here hundreds of inspectors&mdash;temporary men&mdash;and it is difficult to know what sort of men they will be.  They would be, I suppose, of all shades of political opinion, and it is terrible to put into the hands of temporary inspectors the power of cancelling the registration of a man's premises and the power of depriving such a man of his livelihood, because that is what it means.  If all the regulations which are in this Bill are not complied with, the Minister takes power to cancel the slaughtering or selling licence of a butcher.  We all know that the Minister, or any Minister in those cases, understands very little about the reports which come to him and that in nearly nine cases out of ten he just signs his name or his name is signed to the order.  The report is made by the inspector.  It goes through the officials.  There is no possibility, up to the time the decision is given, of the proprietor having an opportunity of stating his case.  I think the House will agree that the proper place for arriving at a decision as to whether a man has committed an offence or not is the court, where the accuser will be confronted by the accused and where it will be possible to cross-examine him as to whether the offence was <Col N="372" /> committed or not.  An impartial decision will be given by the judge, who will not be influenced by the reports of any inspector, but who will judge the case solely on its merits.</P>
    <P>One provision in this clause is that a man may lose his licence by reason of not being able to meet his debts and claiming the protection of the court. There are cases of people who, through no fault of their own, are not able to meet their liabilities and become bankrupts. To become a bankrupt, as was said in the Dáil, is not a crime, and to become a bankrupt in any other walk of life except the victualling business up to the present did not prevent a man from continuing in his business if he was able to make a satisfactory settlement with his creditors.  In this case, I think the Minister for his own sake should let it go to the court, because if a decision is taken by the Minister, cancelling a licence, he will have all sorts of political intrigues by members of his own Party and by Senators and T.D.'s of every Party, with a view to getting back the licence, and the decision he will have to give cannot but be to some extent prejudiced.  For that reason, I ask the Minister and the House to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Counihan is under a complete misapprehension with regard to this particular section because it says that the Minister may at any time without any such application&mdash;that refers to the previous two sub-sections&mdash; cancel the registration of any premises under this Part of this Act if he is satisfied (a) that the registration of such premises was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation and (b) that the business in respect of which such premises are registered has ceased to be carried on.  It does not say that an inspector can report some person on a frivolous point, for political motives, and that the Minister will cancel the registration.  There is no provision in the section for that.  The Minister, if he is satisfied that certain definite things mentioned in this particular section take place, has then power to cancel the registration.  As far as I read the section, there does not appear to be any reason why the authority <Col N="373" /> which granted the licence under certain specified conditions will not have power to revoke the licence without having to go through the procedure of applying to the Circuit Court.  If a licensee does not comply with certain well-defined regulations, surely it is not necessary to go to the Circuit Court.</P>

I do not imagine that any Minister, no matter what Party he belongs to, would take advantage of a section of an Act to prevent a man continuing to earn his livelihood.  If the Minister is satisfied that the Act has not been complied with in certain respects, he has power to revoke the licence, but not on the whim of an inspector.  Therefore, I think the Senator is needlessly alarmed with regard to the whole procedure.</P>

      <P>I think there would be great practical difficulty in carrying out what Senator Counihan suggests in this amendment, because the Circuit Court does not sit continuously.  It certainly does not sit continuously in the same town, and a man who has obtained registration by fraud would be allowed to carry on for three months in despite of the Minister.  I think there is very little also in the point made by Senator Counihan, that bankruptcy in itself should not be a reason for withdrawing registration.  If a man becomes bankrupt, his premises vest in the assignee.  There is another difficulty, that a bankrupt cannot lawfully enter into a contract imposing on him an obligation exceeding £20.</P>

      <P>Supposing a law was passed giving the Minister power to sentence a man to a fine of £100 or even to imprisonment, what would the Senator say?  That is the principle that is absolutely enshrined in this Bill&mdash;power to cancel the registration of a premises.  What is a more grievous punishment of a man than to be deprived of his licence?  Surely, it is a principle of all justice that a man should not be deprived of his licence without due process of law.  To deprive a man of his licence should involve the skilled interpretation of law and the examination of witnesses. Here is the Minister taking the power of a judge to decide the relevancy and the weight of evidence where in ordinary cases you would have counsel on both sides and learned judges&mdash;all men well versed in the law.  I think the Minister should welcome any machinery which would take that responsibility out of his hands.  You talk here of fraud and misrepresentation. Well, fraud and misrepresentation are very much a matter of evidence and the interpretation of the law.  Senator Comyn appears to think that any layman could judge of fraud. The little knowledge that I have of the law shows me that cases have gone to court after court on the question as to whether certain acts constituted misrepresentation or not.  The Minister should not be given power to ruin a man simply on his own judgment, no doubt interpreted honestly, without the protection that the ordinary machinery of the law gives to other citizens.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that all these arguments mean that you are to refuse to give the Minister power that is already possessed with regard to these particular matters by local authorities all over the country.  Senator Sir John Keane talked about a layman interpreting the law.  It is a notorious fact that every day in the week under their by-laws the municipal authorities are making orders closing premises <Col N="376" /> and refusing licences for premises. In such cases there is no appeal to the circuit courts because the by-laws are well defined.  I tell Senator Sir John Keane what is a fact &mdash;that in Dublin every day, in the public health department, they are issuing closing orders against particular premises.</P>

Is not that putting men out of business just as much as doing it under this section to which objection is taken?  There is a whole lot of talk about depriving a man of his licence but at present, under certain well-defined conditions, where a man does not comply with these conditions his licence will be taken away.  That is doing no more than the public health authorities in every town in the country are doing already under their by-laws.</P>

      <P>Senator Farren must remember that we may have to endure the evils that are there.  But why should this Bill, that is to confer so many blessings on the country, impose new penalties on the people?  Are there not plenty of penalties on the people already?  Here you are putting on new penalties under this Bill.  And the question of sanitation that has been referred to has nothing to do with it.  There are clauses about bankruptcy; clauses about misrepresentation and clauses about other things like that.  I do not think that Senator Farren's statement that the sanitary authorities can disqualify premises under the sanitary laws has anything to do with what we are talking about. These things are there already and they are law, but the penalties under this Bill are not law yet.</P>

      <P>The point I wanted to make is in reference to the statement about putting a man out of business. <Col N="377" /> All over the country to-day orders are made by the sanitary authorities and from these orders there is no appeal to the Circuit Court.  Senator Jameson may shake his head at that but I say it is a fact&mdash;that under the by-laws of the public health authorities all over the country the local authorities are entitled, through their sanitary officers, to make orders closing premises and refusing licences for opening premises for certain businesses. From these orders there is no appeal to the Circuit Courts and you are going to refuse the Minister power to make an order revoking a licence under certain well-defined conditions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the difference?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole point. This is a question of the Minister exercising judicial functions; that is the <Col N="378" /> whole point of it.  We say that the Minister should not be put in the position of being a judge in a matter where he himself is interested.  We say that where the individual is going to be deprived of the right of using his premises that that should not be done without the protection of the Circuit Judge being given him.  The man should not be left at the Minister's mercy.  The ordinary citizen is entitled to have such cases tried before a court and not have them decided by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 10 it is laid down that the application shall be in writing in the prescribed form.  We do not know what the prescribed form is to be, or what the Minister will require to have stated on the application. The Minister then issues a certificate. Under sub-section (3) of this section, if the Minister finds that the business in respect of which the premises are registered has ceased to be carried on, he may cancel the registration. Surely that can be done without an appeal to the Circuit Court. Under paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) of Section 12, if the person has died there will be no need to go to the Circuit Court in order to cancel the registration.  Then take (e) of sub-section (3)&mdash;&ldquo;that the registered proprietor .... has been convicted of an offence under any section of this Act.&rdquo;  That is not by the judgment of the Minister.  The conviction is there. Surely there is no need to go to the Circuit Court.  That is obvious.  Then under (a) and (b) of sub-section (3), if there has been fraud or misrepresentation, presumably, there has been a conviction. I think it is not enough to say that the Minister should be satisfied <Col N="379" /> that there has been fraud.  I think there ought to be a conviction there as there has been in the case of (e) of (3). Certainly, if there has been fraud, there should be a conviction before the Minister would have power to revoke the licence on that ground.</P>
      <P>Then there comes the question of a representation, whether fraudulent or innocent.  I think if the representation has induced the Minister to issue a licence, and that he is satisfied that there has been misrepresentation, that is a good reason for the Minister to cancel the licence.  But I would give the registered person an appeal in such a case as that, because once a place has been registered, there is more or less a valuable interest in it and the mere act of the Minister should not, I think, be sufficient to revoke registration on such grounds. Then, as to the question of bankruptcy, I do not know what the purpose there is except it is to protect the farming community from the risk that producers will not be paid for the cattle by the registered proprietor. The fact that a man is registered gives him a certain standing and he would claim: &ldquo;Well, I am registered by the Minister as proprietor of the premises.&rdquo; Whether that be a justification or not, there would be a presumption that the Minister was satisfied as to his integrity.  There may be justification there for cancellation at the Minister's discretion.  I am not so sure on that point, but I think I would not be inclined to make it a penal offence for a man to be adjudicated a bankrupt.  If Senator Comyn's contention be correct there may be no point in this, but I think the fact of being adjudicated a bankrupt should not involve, on the face of it, the further penalty of depriving a man of his business rights.  I would ask the Minister to explain the justification for paragraphs (a) and (d).</P>

      <P>Senator Johnson has analysed the reasons for which this registration can be cancelled.  I think no Senator could object to paragraphs (b) and (c).  It is quite obvious that (b) and (c) are cases where the Minister <Col N="380" /> should have power without any further trouble.  With regard to fraud or misrepresentation, I cannot see where any fraud or misrepresentation could be used in looking for registration under this Bill except in one instance, and that is where applicants represent to me that they are approved by the sanitary authority and that I find afterwards they are not so approved.  That is the only reason for which I could refuse them registration.  I could not refuse them for any other reason.  If I cannot refuse them for any reason except that the sanitary authority does not want them, there cannot be misrepresentation or fraud except on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to bankruptcy, there is the point that Senator Johnson made, that the fact that a person is included in the register kept by the Minister may be used by that person to prove to innocent people that he is all right.  In cases where we have men going out buying produce from farmers we have to be careful that they will not deceive the farmer in that way. Senator Counihan says that the Minister cannot attend to these cases personally. There are Senators here, such as Senators Sir John Keane and Jameson, who, one would imagine, were the greatest champions of freedom who ever sat in any Parliament. Yet these Senators allowed three Acts of Parliament to pass through this House containing similar provisions when they were introduced by the former Government.  They were not such champions of freedom when the Eggs Act, the Fresh Meat Act, or the Dairy Produce Act were going through this House.  Take the fresh meat factory. Senator Sir John Keane knows that people might have thousands of pounds sunk in that factory and yet the Minister, by a stroke of his pen, could remove them from the register. Senator Jameson or Senator Sir John Keane did not use the microscope when these Acts were going through. They were not so active then in the cause of freedom.  There was no question raised then.  The Minister and the Government then were free to treat people as they liked.  It is quite different now, however.  The Minister <Col N="381" /> may not now remove the name of any person from this register.  They are not going to allow it.  Experience has taught us that men become more conservative as they get older, but it would appear that in the case of these particular Senators, they are getting much more concerned about the freedom of the individual as they get older.</P>

      <P>That is quite true.  My grievance is that these Senators did not do their duty as they should have done it at that time.  They trusted anything that came before them.  They will not trust anything now.  That is the point.  I have been administering these Acts since I came into office, although I am sure Senator Jameson and Senator Sir John Keane would not depend on me to administer these Acts as impartially as my predecessor.  But I have not removed the names of men lightly from the register.  First of all the cases have to be reported by the Department's inspector.  I have never known a man to be removed from the register for one offence only.  There are usually many offences.  Before the case comes to me, there has been invariably a threat by the Department that they will report to the Minister. Before it comes to me, there is a first and perhaps, a second offence.  Then if I decide to take action, as Senator Counihan knows, T.D.'s of all shades of opinion and Senators of all shades of opinion, come to me and say that this man has committed the offence for some reason over which he had no control at all and that he is really guilty of no offence.  He is then usually allowed off until the inspector starts reporting again and then perhaps his name is struck off the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an appeal under this Bill as sub-section (4) provides that the Minister must give a month's notice and the person affected may appeal for <Col N="382" /> an inquiry within seven days.  At that inquiry, he can be represented in person, by a solicitor or by counsel. This inquiry is held by an officer appointed by the Minister who will be an independent person, a person who had nothing whatever to do with the inspection of that person's premises or who had nothing to do with the reports that came from that area.  That independent person will hold the inquiry before the appellant's name is removed from the register.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I should go a little further than the powers given under this Bill.  Paragraph (e) merely provides that cancellation shall take place after the registered proprietor has been convicted of an offence under any section of the Act.  In the case of all the other Acts to which I referred &mdash;the Eggs Act, the Dairy Produce Act and the Fresh Meat Act&mdash;the Ministry were not so lenient.  Yet the Senators who were here allowed these Acts to go through.  In these cases paragraph (e) read that cancellation was to take place where the Minister was satisfied that the person was guilty of a breach of any of the regulations under the Acts.  The judge had not to convict at all.  The Minister might convict him and then remove his name.  As a matter of fact when this Bill came forward I looked up that point and I said to the draftsman: &ldquo;Why do you not make that provision the same as in the other Acts.&rdquo;  He said to me that he thought that I might not look for such drastic powers, being a more reasonable man. I said that I would look for such provisions and that I would have an amendment ready for the Report Stage putting this provision on a par with the clause in the other Acts.  However, judging by the attitude of Senators here, I do not know that they will accept that amendment.  I do not know why there should be such partiality, why they should accept from my predecessor a clause giving him such full powers and why they will not give me the right to rule over an ordinary butcher's shop.  That is what this amounts to.  I do not think that Senators can evade the issue that there is prejudice in this case.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what the Minister contemplates in the way of record-keeping under this section.  Some of these victuallers are very simple, small and primitive people, who have no large supplies of stationery.  It would be very difficult for a butcher in a small country town to keep elaborate records.  Will there have to be a record of the quantity of meat brought in and details of sale? There are references here to invoices and consignment notes.  These terms are all right as applied to big shops but in the ordinary small butcher's shop a person walks in and buys a bit of meat and walks out again.  Are these sales to be itemised?  I think that we should have some general indication of what is in the mind of the Minister and his advisers as regards record keeping by these small people.</P>

      <P>The records will be as simple as possible.  In the case of a large abattoir we may want rather minute details, but in the case of the ordinary person slaughtering cattle in a small town for his own purposes or for those of two or three others, a record will be required of the people from whom he bought, the price he paid, and the weight&mdash;perhaps live weight and dead weight but, at all events, dead weight.  We shall also require to know the retail shop to which the meat was consigned.  Those particulars would probably be kept in any case.  The victualler would be required to keep a record of where he got the meat&mdash;if from his own cattle he would state so&mdash;and an ordinary ledger showing the amount of sales.  I do not think that we shall even ask the price at which he sells.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, there are one or two questions which I want to ask the Minister.  The section provides that the registered proprietor of every registered slaughtering premises shall pay to the Minister a levy at the prescribed rate on all cattle and sheep slaughtered. The levy is to be £1 for each beast slaughtered, and 5/- for each sheep. It is not to be less or more in any town.  I want to get some information from the Minister in regard to that as it will have a considerable bearing on the cost.  I would also like to have some information from the Minister as regards the levy.  The <Col N="390" /> Minister, in his reply on the Second Reading debate, spoke so rapidly that one did not quite understand a number of the things he dealt with.  I would like to know what the Minister thinks the cost of this Bill is going to be.  Speaking last week he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The levy was talked about by Senator The McGillycuddy of the Reeks, but that is really the other side of the balance sheet.  A levy of £1 a head on 180,000 beasts and 5/- a head on 500,000 sheep will produce £305,000.  That comes off the £400,000 and it leaves the remainder to be paid by the taxpayer.  As to the total cost, we have £400,000 for free meat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is calculated that 40,000 cattle will be required for the free meat scheme.  I cannot really follow that argument.  Even though the butcher is in a separate class he is a consumer and a taxpayer the same as everybody else, and as far as I can gather he is being singled out for a tax on his consumption and a further tax for carrying on his business. Finally, of course, he is going to get all that back from the general consumer and the taxpayer.  If I am right, and if the taxpayer is going to carry the burden of the cost of this Bill, then he will have to provide the £600,000 mentioned by the Minister, plus the £305,000 which it is expected the levy will realise.  In the end all that is going to be borne by the taxpayer or the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator The McGillycuddy said that he found some difficulty in following my argument.  I find myself in an equally difficult position in trying to follow his reasoning.  Take it that we try to draw up a balance sheet.  The cost of this Bill will appear on one side of it, but surely the amount realised by the levy will appear on the other side. That seems to me to be plain reasoning. You cannot, as the Senator would seem to suggest, put everything down as the cost.  With regard to the rates, for the purposes of calculation the rates suggested were £1 on cattle and 5/- in the case of sheep.  I did <Col N="391" /> not deal in the Seanad with the point as to how we would regulate the rates. The rate of £1 per head on cattle may seem high but it is suggested until we see how things go.  As regards sheep the rate will vary.  If sheep are very dear&mdash;they are getting dear now&mdash;then we will have to lower the levy and not raise it.  The butcher will buy sheep at whatever the export price is.  The export price will regulate the price that the butcher will pay for the sheep required for home consumption.  He cannot pay 5/- of a levy on sheep and in addition pass all that on to the consumers if sheep are getting very dear because obviously the price of mutton would become too high.  Therefore, if sheep get very dear we will have to lower the levy. On the other hand, if the price of sheep comes down we can raise the levy because the consumer can still afford to pay a little more for his mutton and the butcher a little more for the sheep.  The position, therefore, will be that if sheep are cheap we can have a big levy because it is the consumer who will pay for the sheep and the levy combined, but if sheep are dear we cannot keep the levy high.</P>

The 1st September comes and there is nobody to buy the beast.  The grass <Col N="394" /> is slackening and he is losing condition and perhaps quality.  What is going to happen?  Is there going to be a guarantee that on the date for which the beast is marked it will be taken by a butcher at the minimum price?  That is very important, because if it cannot be taken there will be a loss.  It would appear to me that the owner of the beast has at least a moral claim for compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no guarantee, of course.  There will, however, be at least a better chance of the person selling, because we intend to mark roughly the number of cattle that will be required&mdash;that is to have the supply equal to the demand as far as possible. We could not possibly operate it to such an extent that there might not be perhaps two or three cattle left over for which no butcher would be looking for three or four days or three or four weeks.  I do not see that the owner would be in any worse position than he is at present.

    <P>23.  When any fat cattle have been marked or any unmarked cattle <Col N="396" /> or sheep are prohibited from being sold by an order or regulation made by the Minister under this Act, no decree or warrant of any court shall be executed for the recovery of any debt due by the owner of such cattle or sheep until after the expiration of the date before which such cattle or sheep are prohibited from being sold.</P>
    <P>Anyone can see the reasonableness of this amendment.  If a farmer is prohibited from selling his cattle, by order or regulation of the Minister, no one should be allowed to take them from him.  No one has a right to take any other part of his property for the recovery of that debt because the only means he would have of realising money to meet his obligations would be by selling his cattle. If he is prohibited from selling his cattle by order or by marking, then I say that no decree or warrant of the court should be operative until after the expiration of the time during which the farmer is prohibited from selling.  I am sure the Minister will realise the justice of that amendment. I would like to hear what he has to say upon the matter before the Seanad wastes time in discussing it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>Section 23, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) fixing the maximum price for the sale by retail of various grades of beef and mutton.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to give the Minister power to fix maximum prices by retail.  I must confess I do not like restrictions of this kind, but then I do not like the whole Bill, and in trying to urge a reconstruction you must try and make it more or less <Col N="398" /> logical and straight.  It would appear that you are going to put great temptation in the way of the retailer to profit by the whole of the machinery under this Bill.  It may quite possibly happen that there will be considerable objection to undercutting of the contract prices for beef to the Minister for distribution relief.  Then the butcher will have to make his profit and that will be made out of the ordinary purchaser as far as the ordinary purchaser will buy.  If the ordinary purchaser does not buy, it will have to go back again to the various recipients and the Minister will have to get rid of the glut by bringing in other classes of people like old age pensioners.  If the butcher cannot sell, and charges too much, more than the public will stand, the Minister will have to go further afield for people willing to eat it on getting it free.  I think the consumer deserves certain protection.  There will always be consumers that will have meat whatever they have to pay for it.  The Minister on Second Reading said that this was unnecessary as there was the machinery of the Prices Tribunal.  The Minister has talked about people joking.  I feel that the Minister was joking when he said that.  The Prices Tribunal has been sitting for over two years, and they have brought forth nothing.  I cannot see a body of that kind, with all its delays, ever dealing effectively with the position that may arise under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  I think, as the Minister is engaged in framing a number of regulations, this amendment might be necessary in the last resort for the protection of the consumer, as I suggest the present machinery is totally inadequate for that purpose.</P>

      <P>If Senator Sir John Keane knew the effect of the activities <Col N="399" /> of the Prices Commission he would not say what he has said.  But that is by the way.  I am very much interested in this amendment proposed by Senator Sir John Keane.  He has criticised the provisions of the Bill because of the number of inspectors required and the powers given to the Minister.  This is a very simple amendment, but it would give power to the Minister far exceeding anything in the Bill.  It is giving the Minister power to fix the prices retail of the various grades of beef and mutton, by order, on his own initiative, not necessarily following an inquiry or any examination.  As to the number of inspectors that would be required, well, the unemployment problem would be solved very rapidly if we could employ all the inspectors that would be required to give effect to this provision in this manner.  According to the section, the Minister may by order make regulations to do certain things &mdash;fix the minimum price at which cattle and sheep may be bought and so on&mdash; but then, at the instigation of Senator Sir John Keane, he is to be given power to fix by order the maximum price for the sale by retail of various grades of beef and mutton.  It would be interesting to know how many butchers there are in the City of Dublin and to add to these the number of butchers in Cork, Limerick and in Waterford, not to speak of all the butchers' shops throughout the country and all the people that would be buying beef or mutton by retail.  The evidence that would be required to prove the fact that this provision had been disobeyed would require a tremendous machine to administer, but Senator Sir John Keane does not mind that.  I do not know whether, in view of the £600,000 which caused some Senators to throw up their hands in abhorrence, they would be prepared to support the necessary increase in the staffs that would be required.  It would be well to hear from Senator Sir John Keane whether he is prepared to make any estimate of the possible cost of administering this provision.</P>

      <P>I think that something might be said for Senator Sir John Keane's amendment, but I should like <Col N="400" /> to remind him that he should come to the conclusion that the Minister has put enough impossible jobs on himself without taking on another impossible job.  It is all right to put this clause into the Bill, but the carrying out of it would be a different matter, and I think that it could not be carried out. I think that the Senator would be well advised to withdraw his amendment. I should like to ask the Minister a question with regard to fixing of minimum prices for cattle.  Would the Minister give the House some indication of what sort of minimum prices the butcher would be compelled to pay for cattle?  I think that he mentioned something around 25/- a cwt. in the Dáil.  That price, at the present time, in comparison with what we are getting, would be certainly an increase of 3/- or 4/- a cwt., but 25/- is not an economic price, and if the Minister wants to give the farmer an economic price and give him an opportunity to live, he ought to consider a higher price than 25/-.  Another point that I should like the Minister to consider, when he is fixing minimum prices during the stall-fed season, is the fixing of minimum prices and having a grading scale; that is to say, if he would give 25/- in December and then have a grading scale going on up till it comes to May or June, because any practical farmer should be well aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was going to say that while Senator Counihan objected to the load we are trying to put on the Minister in this amendment, he is evidently piling other things on to the Minister.  Really, however, the only individual in the whole country at the present time who would be able to tell us what the maximum price ought to be, is the Minister.  He is going to buy this enormous number of cattle and he is going to settle the minimum price and the price for all the meat that is going to be given away.  There is nobody else in the country who could settle, when a butcher is going to give away meat at a certain price, what that price ought to be.  The only individual in the country who could do that is the Minister.  He will know at what price the balance of that meat should be sold.  The Minister might or might not be able to do the job but he is the only individual in the Free State who could do the job.  There is no doubt of that.  As to trusting to the Food Prices Commission individually, I have not met any case where we have a ruling of the Food Prices Commission on such a matter.  If my butcher asks me a certain price for meat that he is sending to me, there is no use appealing to the Food Prices Commission, but the Minister would know whether the butcher is charging me too much or not.  If people thought that they were being charged exorbitant prices by the butcher I think that it would be a very good thing if they were able to make complaints to the Minister.  I think it would be a very valuable thing and would show to the Minister a lot of what was going on.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Minister ought to interfere with the freedom of contract more than is necessary.  I should say that the consumer, in the past three or four years, has had nothing to complain of.  He <Col N="402" /> has been getting his beef £6 a beast too cheap and he did not ask that the price of the farmer's fat beast should be raised by £6.  Now, when there is a prospect of his being put into the position that he will have a free contract Senator Sir John Keane complains. I am surprised that Senator Jameson complains, because he is a producer of fat cattle.  I oppose the amendment on principle.  Whether it could be enforced or not, I object to fixing a maximum price which the consumer has to pay.  That will depend on the consumer's desire to get the meat and on the supply of meat which is there for him.</P>

      <P>Senator Counihan, I think, was speaking on his own amendment and we can leave that over for the moment.  With regard to this amendment in Senator Sir John Keane's name, personally I think that the Prices Commission should deal with this matter.  We tried to divide those duties between the different Departments.  It is really a duty for the Department of Industry and Commerce to look after the consumers.  As far as the Minister for Agriculture is concerned, he is supposed to do the best he can for agriculture and let the consumers look after themselves. As Senator Johnson pointed out, this is giving very wide powers, because Senator Sir John Keane has not asked for an enquiry as would be the case with the Prices Commission.  Personally, I do not mind whether the amendment is carried or not because it may be useful to have the powers, but I really think that the Seanad should not give those wide powers to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I merely put down the amendment to show the inconsistency in the whole Act, and that was shown up by Senator Comyn, his attitude being: &ldquo;I like freedom of contract where it suits my case and I do not like it where it does not suit my case.&rdquo;  That is human, and I do not blame him.  I see the difficulty, of course.  I can see the difficulty of the whole Act and I thought that the Minister might like to have the thing a balanced structure.  He does not <Col N="403" /> mind very much how prices go and I must say that he has a callous disregard of the whole economics of the matter, as long as he, as a war politician, can say: &ldquo;I can force up the price for the farmer and let somebody else look after the consumer.&rdquo; That is, of course, what is going on all along the line, and that in time will come home to roost.  I am surprised at the Labour Party.  Perhaps they are working on the argument that most of those they represent are indigent, but there are a certain number of those who have to buy their meat and I should have thought that Senator Johnson would have had at least some regard for them.  I am not going to press the amendment, but I still wait hopefully for something substantial from the Food Prices Commission.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 23, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;In fixing the minimum price at which cattle or sheep may be bought, the Minister shall take into consideration the cost of production <Col N="404" /> of such cattle or sheep, as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was referring on Sir John Keane's amendment to the fixing of a minimum price for cattle bought</P>
    <P>by a registered proprietor of registered premises, including the fixing of different such minimum prices for different grades of cattle and for different areas or districts.</P>
    <P>That proposal is all right, but what I want to impress on the Minister is the necessity for taking into consideration the cost of production and particularly the cost of production of stall-fed cattle.  The production of stall-fed cattle costs very much more than the production of grass-fed cattle, and when the Minister speaks of fixing a minimum price at which butchers may buy beef at around 25/- a cwt., I want to press on him that that is not an economic price.  Stall-fed cattle cannot be produced at 25/- a cwt.  It is all very well to say&mdash;but it is no argument&mdash;that we are getting very much less at present and we got much less last year.  It does not follow at all that we are getting the amount of the cost of production, and if the Minister wants to have stall-fed cattle produced, he will have to give a reasonable price and will have to take into consideration the cost of production in the different months of the year.  He will have to realise that stall-fed cattle cannot be produced in April and May at the same cost or the same price per cwt. as that at which they could be sold in November, December or the early weeks of January. The amendment is more or less only a pious hope and I cannot really hope that the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister's minimum price will follow the raising or lowering of the export price and that in the periods of the year when beef is scarce and hard to produce, the export price will be raised and the minimum price will naturally follow that export price.  The Minister's object is not to give a minimum price to the farmer at all.  His object is simply to bring the price of cattle up to such a level as would operate if we had no quota, and, in fact, what <Col N="405" /> will happen is that the minimum price will vary as the price in England varies, and naturally, as the price in England becomes higher in December, Senator Counihan for his stall-fed cattle will get a higher minimum price at that particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wilson has explained this, I think, very clearly.  We must follow the real value of cattle for export.  We would not take what cattle are getting now for export, if we were making an order under this particular Part of the Bill to-morrow, because they are not getting what they should get.  Cattle are selling, say, for 24/- a cwt., which may really be worth nearly 30/- a cwt.  The exporter would have sufficient profit by paying 30/- instead of 24/-, and we will, therefore, fix the price at that level&mdash;at whatever he could pay while leaving himself the sufficient profit which he had before the quota came in and when there was fair competition. It we fix it higher we stop export, and then we will have too many cattle; and if we fix it lower, we give the trader bigger profits than he is entitled to, so that we really have to follow what the cattle would be worth if exported.  As I said on Second Reading, I think Senator Counihan cannot get what he wants here.  I know what he wants all right. At 28/- or 30/- they are uneconomic and the farmer cannot produce them at that price, but the only remedy for that is to increase the bounty.  We cannot remedy it under this Bill because this must follow the export price, and there is no way out of it.</P>

      <P>There is a point in this matter which I cannot understand. The Minister has stated clearly that the minimum price he intends to fix will be regulated by the export prices.

Exporters here, as we know them, will not pay more than 16- to 21/- and I believe that if they could make a profit at a higher price, there would not be a beast left in the country, if they could get licences to export them.  I cannot understand how the price can go to 25/- a cwt. if it is to be regulated by the export price, and I altogether disagree with Senator Wilson and the Minister, from my own experience, that the price cannot go past the export price if shippers cannot pay a higher price than they are paying at present.</P>

We cannot continue doing the same thing two or three years in succession.  We did it last year, and what did we get for our stall-fed cattle?  The Minister said that we got the British market price, but we got the British market price minus £4 10/- of tariffs.  It is an impossible proposition to produce stall-fed cattle and keep them until the month of April and pay £4 10/- in tariffs together with ordinary expenses, but the Minister says he will give us that price at home, and Senator Wilson throws his hat up and says: &ldquo;The Minister is a great man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister has given a bounty to men engaged in the manufacture of tweeds, shirts, collars, and so on.  The Minister knows what that is costing.  Why not give a little back to the people who are stall-feeding cattle and are giving as much employment as are the manufacturers? I would ask the Minister again to consider whether he would give some hope to the farmers who have a great deal of tillage and who stall-feed their cattle.  These are the men for whom he professes to have a great deal of consideration.  Unless the Minister does that there will be no stall-fed cattle looking for export licences in March, April and May.</P>

      <P>That is not a matter that can be done under this Bill.  It admittedly does not arise.  With regard to the point that Senator Dillon has raised, we do not intend to fix the export prices on what are the export prices now.  If we did that the Bill would not be necessary.  We would be satisfied to leave things as they are. Senator Dillon asks how are we to do it.  We could go back from 1928 to 1932 before there was any tariff or bounty at all and take the prices in Manchester, Liverpool and Dublin and see what was a fair margin on which traders are working.  Then we could fix the prices.  There is no great trouble in fixing the price on a fair level and giving the producer the same profit as that with which he was satisfied when there was competition.</P>

      <P>The assumption is that the butchers must be making an exorbitant profit.  The statement has been made and not contradicted that the butchers are making from £2 to £5 per head profit.  Speaking as a man who sold fat cattle for a great number <Col N="408" /> of years, as a matter of fact I believe that I could give proof of where cattle were sold at £9, say 16/- to 17/- per cwt.  I have good reason for saying that I made a loss at that figure.  If the Minister fixes the home price at 25/-, the position will be that under present conditions the export price cannot be raised as high as 25/-.</P>

      <P>On the section I asked the Minister a question, on the last day.  That was what will be the price to the consumer of 180,000 cattle slaughtered at home at the fixed price.  The Minister said on the last day that he was not able to answer that question.  I have given him a week now.  I have also given myself a week to arrive at some of the figures concerned as to the cost to the consumer.  So far as I can see it the Government in their policy of national reconstruction have created a certain position.  I am not quarrelling with it. But they have created a position which has depreciated the price of cattle to a point where the Government, in order to readjust matters and provide some sort of a price for the producer, have had to increase the minimum price for cattle slaughtered at home for home consumption.  Take my figures.  They can be tested afterwards.  The export price is 25/- a cwt.  The price paid down the country is 15/- a cwt.  There is a difference of 10/- a cwt.  It may be a little less than that.  A figure of 10/- a cwt. on 180,000 cattle weighing say 10 cwt. each would make about £900,000.  The Minister gave some figures showing the cost to be £600,000.  He admitted to Senator <Col N="409" /> Jameson that the consumer and the taxpayer were going to pay for the benefits conferred on the farmers £305,000.  I submit to the House that the actual effect of this section which we are discussing now is in the region of 10/- a cwt.  I put it to the House that the cost of this particular section of the minimum price is going to be somewhere between £600,000 and £700,000 more than the Minister originally budgeted for, plus the £305,000 which he admitted himself. We would be very glad to hear an explanation of that.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister show me the fallacy in this?  There are 180,000 cattle estimated to come under the purview of this Bill.  The Minister is going to raise the price of these cattle by £5 per head, that is £900,000. Then there are 180,000 cattle at £1 a head.  That will work out at over £1,000,000.  I suggest that that £1,000,000 is going to be the hidden tax on the consumer, assuming of course that he has not already got a big margin of fat up his sleeve.  The Minister's argument is that the butcher is already profiteering and that he will not be able to pass on that to the consumer. On the face of it I cannot help feeling that if the butcher is going to pay £5 and £1 per head more that the bulk of £1,000,000 is going to be passed on to the consumer in some form or other.</P>

We are not arguing about what we would like or would not like. What we would like to know is what the total cost on the citizens of the Free State will be?  I think I might say without consulting anybody that part of the increase, at <Col N="410" /> any rate, will come out of the butchers' present prices.  That is all.  The Minister himself admits that there is to be this charge, but he thinks he is going to get it back out of the profits of the butchers who will drop their prices, the very thing that Senator Keane was debating in the course of his last amendment&mdash;the maximum prices which consumers are going to pay.

Similarly in regard to wheat, similarly in regard to butter and every other item of agricultural produce.  Where are we getting?  On another occasion we shall be told by the same Senators that agriculture is the basis of this country's economic activities.  So we are getting to the stage when agriculture, the basis of the economic activities of the State, is to be carried on at a price which is not higher than the consumer, if he has any income, can buy in the cheapest market in the world.  We, at any rate, in the Labour <Col N="411" /> Party are favourable to a fair return for people in agriculture, as we are to a fair return for those people who are engaged in industry, because we realise that unless there is productive activity in the country, there will be no town population.

      <P>This is a new section which is also taken from the previous Acts, to which I referred to-day.  It is not, of course, taken out of them word for word but there is a similar section in the other Acts.  If we remove the name of a person from the register, there is nothing in the Bill as it stands which would make it illegal for a victualler to get that particular person to kill cattle for him.  That would lead to a rather ridiculous position&mdash;that it would be an offence for a person to slaughter cattle on his own account and not an offence for other people to take cattle from him.  This is put in for the purpose of making it illegal for any person to take cattle from a person whose name has been removed from the register.</P>

On consideration, I think that it would be impossible to carry out that proposal.  It would be very difficult to put in writing exactly what every person was to do.  There might be a refusal to move a chair from one side of a room to the other.  It would be difficult to administer the Act if we had to define in writing everybody's duty.

      <P>We are not bound, under the Bill, to publish these agreements. If we are engaging in the business ourselves we have, at the end of the year, to publish a full statement of the trading.  I do not think that we could possibly avoid stating what the agreements are because in every one of those cases they will have to get the cattle at a lower price than the fixed price.  There would have to be some sort of subsidy and that means a Supplementary Estimate, which means that everything would have to be disclosed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite a big matter and surely the citizens ought to know something about it.  It is a very dangerous thing to give a Government power to establish a company and make unknown conditions with that company as to the price they are to pay for cattle, the price they are to sell their products at and so forth.  Surely, the citizens ought to get some information as to what is going on.  Of course, this is an extremely honest country and nobody ever heard of graft in it.  But if you were to make such a regulation in sundry countries which we know, I should like to be in one of those companies which could go to the Government officials and make an arrangement <Col N="419" /> as to what they should pay for their raw material and charge for the finished product.  That would be quite nice.  In this, as in everything else, our people are absolutely above suspicion. Here, we never suggest that anybody we are dealing with is capable of such a thing.  The conditions, however, under which these factories are established cannot be limited to a year, as proposed in the case of the Bill.  The Minister must have power to make a long agreement with the company which is putting its capital into this sort of business.  Other people may, eventually, be dealing with these companies under the conditions under which they are brought in.  It would be advisable that some information should be given to the public as to the conditions under which any of these companies is licensed by agreement with the Government. The Minister of the day&mdash; whoever he may be&mdash;should give information about the agreement and everything connected with it to the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>This question was raised in the Dáil.  Deputies said that the Minister for Agriculture, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, might vary an agreement that had been made, and suggested that it was very unfair for the Minister to have that power.  Obviously, we meant to take power to vary &ldquo;by agreement,&rdquo; because having once made an agreement a Government is in a rather difficult position as regards varying an agreement unless it actually takes power to do so.  An ordinary person in business can, of course, vary an agreement, but in the case of a Government there may be trouble about it unless the other party is agreeable to the variation.

      <P>On the section, would the Minister say why it is necessary to take the special powers laid down in the section.  Ordinarily, the Trade Loans Act and the Government's credit schemes deal with matters of this kind.  For anybody who wants to engage in business there is State credit. There is regular machinery for dealing with matters of that kind.  There is an Advisory Committee in existence; inquiries are made, and so on.  Why should not that standard method apply in this case?  Why should this be taken in a totally different manner without any preliminary inquiry and left entirely to the two Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Trades Loan Committee will not, of course, recommend a loan unless there is a good prospect of the business concerned succeeding. The members of that committee have to see that all the conditions under which a business is working are possible of fulfilment and so on. Suppose, for instance, that a tinning factory is in question and that those connected with it put up a proposition for a loan, they would have to show that they required to get their cattle at less than the market price.  If such a proposition as that were put up to the Trades Loan Committee they would turn it down at once on the ground that the business could not succeed.  In the case of the Minister for Agriculture he could say: &ldquo;There is a surplus of cattle in the country and for the purpose of keeping up prices, where, say, the ordinary price would be 25/- or 28/-, it would pay very well to give these people cattle at 20/- per cwt. in order to get rid of the surplus.&rdquo;  He could say to them that he would guarantee to give them the cattle at that price for a period of four years.  I think I am the only person who could give them a loan in these circumstances if they wanted a loan. If the matter were to go before the Advisory Committee, the members of it would say that they did not know how long the Minister for Agriculture was going to continue to give them cattle at that price, and that consequently they could not give them a loan.  In such a case as that, I think <Col N="422" /> the Minister for Agriculture would have to see the whole thing through, both with regard to the lending of the money and the supplying of the cattle.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's remarks, I am not at all satisfied that there is any justification for this exceptional treatment.  The Trades Loan Guarantee Committee is composed of perfectly competent business men who are quite able to appraise and estimate any facts laid before them by the Minister.  They, naturally, are vigilant and even a little bit suspicious when it comes to the handing out of public money.  We know that a lot of public money has been lost in connection with a number of these loans.  At this stage I want to protest against the method that is being followed in this section of giving the Minister these exceptional powers.  The Trades Loan Committee would be quite competent to deal with all applications that came in. I do not see any difference between a factory for manufacturing edible products and a factory for the production of manufactured articles.  I cannot see any justification for taking this out of the ordinary procedure laid down by Parliament in connection with State loans and giving the Minister these exceptional powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because what I have already said with regard to the Trades Loan Committee would apply to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see that the Minister much prefers the Minister for Finance to the Corporation because, in cases of this kind, money of the State is going to be put into business, and lent to companies to start business, and the Minister tells them that they will have to buy at a value <Col N="424" /> under the market price, in order to be able to make any money. If we had a watchdog, as Ministers who were at the head of the Exchequer were, we might say it was all right.  Unfortunately, in the present state of affairs in this country, the Minister for Finance is himself promoting businesses and assisting them with lent money. That did not happen to-day. It is going on for some time, and a very considerable amount of money has already gone west by such an arrangement.  We now want to put some control on an arrangement which has already sent a great deal of our money where it will never come back.  Senator Sir John Keane is perfectly right in thinking that the Minister for Finance has not sufficient control over a Minister who is left to make arrangements of this kind with companies, or who lends our money to companies.  If some restrictions were put on or if those appointed to look into such matters did so, it would be far better. The wish is undoubtedly there to establish a company, with no financial authority really to look into the question to see whether we are ever to get the money back or not. If this section is passed as it is, we are going to see a good deal more of our money than £600,000 going away.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure Senator Jameson is right in saying that the wish to establish the company exists. But it is not for the sake of the company it exists.  The object is to get rid of the old cows and the surplus stock.  The company that will manufacture old cows into meal, and that will get rid of the surplus stock by tinning it, may have only a short life, because the time will come, in three or four years probably, when all the surplus cows will have been converted into meal.  Although the company will probably be a successful one as long as it continues its operations, I do not see that its life can be a very long one.  The object of the Minister is a very laudable one. What he desires to have done is very <Col N="425" /> necessary, but, if you subject him to all the limitations that are imposed by boards which advance moneys for businesses which are intended to be permanent, you will probably get no company at all to deal with the old cows and the surplus cattle.</P>

It is common knowledge that his predecessor and the officials of the Department of Agriculture went most carefully into the question of using up these old cows in a certain form, either as meat-meal or something like that, and found that it was entirely uneconomic and dropped the project.  This is a temporary palliative to get rid of old cows.  As regards the canning of this meat, any industry which starts here will have to compete with established canning factories elsewhere that could undersell it.  There is the prospect of a very considerable loss on the whole project. What is going to happen to the factory after one or two years?  It is just going to stand there.  It may be used for some other industry or, like most things in this country that have been failures, it may become derelict. There is going to be a very considerable loss on the project.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the alternative to the Minister carryon business.  Some Senator expressed <Col N="426" /> the hope that the Minister would do this job by means of a concession to a company, and the Minister expressed a preference for that.  If the Minister is going to hand this business to a company, and going to provide the company with at least some of the capital, if not all of it, it strikes me that he should have bigger control over the company's proceedings than the section provides.  There is nothing in it to indicate that there is to be any report from the Comptroller and Auditor-General to the Oireachtas, as there would be if the Minister was carrying on the business.  There is nothing to limit the profits of the company. So far as the Bill goes, the kind of company the Minister is going to provide capital for is too free, whatever agreements and regulations may be come to.  I ask the Minister when discussing the question that was raised at an earlier stage by Sir John Keane, as to the disclosure of agreements, to consider whether such agreement should not apply to any company set up under this section and financed by the Minister.  The amount of control that this section gives over the conduct of the affairs of the company is certainly not very secure.</P>

      <P>May I point out that we are talking as if this part of the Bill is confined solely to the slaughter of old cows.  We know that companies take very wide powers in their articles of association, and that a company that makes boots may also sell railways.  Here there is provision for the purchase and sale of cattle and sheep and the sale of the carcases outside Saorstát Eireann.  We cannot take a limited view of it.  I am sure if Senator Comyn was advising professionally on the point he would see that it is a choice if the Minister does not like to go into trade, or does not lend other people money.  I expect if he contracted with someone to take these cows that it would be better, and to let the Government get out of it.  I think this proposal is most dangerous and I propose on the Report Stage to ask the House to take out this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 38.  To add at the end of the section the words &ldquo;but it shall not be lawful for the Minister or his agents or servants to export any live cattle or sheep to Great Britain or Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A good deal of the discussion that has taken place on Section 37 would be in favour of this amendment.  It is very objectionable at any time to have a Minister or a Department of State going into competition in trade against ordinary citizens.  My amendment does not debar the Minister from going into trade in this country or going into any class of trade for the export of dead meat to any country.  We do certainly object to the Minister, however, going into the trade of exporting live cattle and sheep to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is the legitimate right of the people in that trade, who have been exporting live cattle all their lives, to be left their means of livelihood and the Minister should be precluded from going into that branch of the business.  The only restriction put on the Minister by the amendment is that it will not be lawful for him to go into the export trade of live cattle or sheep.</P>
      <P>As Senator Sir John Keane pointed out, he is taking power under this Bill to do everything which everybody can do, whether a farmer, a cattle exporter, a butcher, a feeder, or anything else.  Section 32 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall be lawful for the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance to engage in and carry on all or any of the following businesses, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the purchase, keeping, and slaughter of cattle and sheep;</P>
      <P>(b)  the sale of cattle and sheep, either in or outside Saorstát Eireann;</P>
      <P>(c)  the sale, either in or outside Saorstát Eireann, of the carcases, offals, and other parts, edible or inedible, of slaughtered cattle and sheep;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> I do not want to refer to the experiments carried on by the Minister in the export of live cattle and sheep. He can still continue these experiments if they are for the purpose of trying to secure new markets; but I think the Seanad will agree that he should not go into the business and knock out the legitimate live stock exporter to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this amendment very strongly as it is most reasonable.  It is bad enough, as Senator Counihan said, that the Minister should go into competition with traders within the State; but it is much worse that he should compete in exporting.  It is common knowledge that he has already engaged in a sort of subterranean trade of smuggling or exporting the seized cattle over the Border.  That may have been done <i>sub rosa</i>, but it is common knowledge that it has been done.  We do not want him now coming into the open and competing with the exporters of cattle.</P>

I also said that it is common knowledge that the Minister or the Government is engaged in trade across the Border with the cattle that have been seized and sold at auctions at which prices amounting to the debts have not been realised.  I said that that was being done <i>sub rosa</i>, but that now he might come into the open and do it with cattle in the ordinary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to oppose the amendment.  Although I oppose it, I am very glad that Senator Counihan brought it forward, because in his remarks he gave expression to an idea that we have heard more than once around the country: that nobody has <Col N="429" /> the right to export cattle except Senator Counihan and a few other people&mdash;the chosen few, I suppose they would like to call themselves.  I should like to ask Senator Counihan if the export of cattle and agricultural produce is to stop when the present number of people forming that ring happen to pass out, for one reason or another? I believe it is absolutely necessary that the Minister should have this power if for no other reason than to deal with the situation suggested by Senator Miss Browne.  It may arise at any time that the Minister may find a better market than the present market for seized cattle.  If he can find such a market, I believe it would be a very useful thing, and that Senator Miss Browne or anybody else interested in farming should welcome such a move by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan should at least be ashamed to pass any remarks about the Minister's previous attempts to find an alternative market.  Time and again we have had Senator Counihan ridiculing the attempt to find a market in a certain country and he now comes along and makes similar remarks, notwithstanding the fact that several of us here know perfectly well that Senator Counihan is first in the rush to sell a few cattle for export to this particular market.  I believe that there are very few people, except Senator Miss Browne, in sympathy with Senator Counihan in this amendment and I ask the Seanad not to support him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably Senator Counihan is rather mistaken as to the object of this portion of the Bill.  I cannot conceive it possible that any Government would embark on the export of cattle.  Senator Quirke talks about a ring being formed by the cattle exporters, but I may point out to him that all these exporters are risking their own money and I believe firmly that a tremendous number of these exporters have not always been successful.  They have not always made a profit on the cattle they export.  We know perfectly well that these exporters have on more than one occasion lost, and lost heavily.  Who <Col N="430" /> has borne that loss but the exporters? When it comes to the Government exporting cattle the profits will, of course, go into the coffers of the State, but who is going to bear the loss?  For instance, it is common knowledge that the Government bought butter extensively about this time last year.  It would have been sold, I am assured, for about 10d. per lb. in October last. The Government held up that butter and eventually sold it at 5d. per lb. Who is going to bear the loss?</P>

      <P>Whenever, under a scheme whereby compensation is payable out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas for cattle slaughtered or surrendered for slaughter in pursuance of such scheme, the Minister becomes possessed of any cattle (whether alive or dead), it shall be lawful for the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to dispose of such cattle in whatever manner he shall think proper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> That is to be an addendum to Section 38.  The Minister gets cattle into his own hands by a scheme legislated for under this Bill, but he is not to be at liberty to dispose of them.  What has that got to do with seizures or the sending of cattle across the Border? Nothing whatever.  Suppose we pass Senator Counihan's amendment that it shall not be lawful for the Minister or his agents to export cattle.  If it is not lawful for him to export cattle, can he not sell them to some person here to export them?  The section says that it is only cattle that he finds on his hands as a result of the carrying out of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us deal with one section at a time.  We are now dealing with Section 38, which contemplates that cattle will be left on the Minister's hands as a result of the scheme promulgated in this measure.  The Minister asks for power to sell these cattle that might remain in his hands.  He can sell them to a jobber.  I do not see why he should be prohibited by statute from exporting them himself if he considers that the proper method of dealing with them.  If a ring of jobbers will not buy from him, why should he not deal with them as he thinks best.  The jobbers of cattle have a monopoly in this country. A good deal is said about what they lose.  Senator Crosbie said that they might suffer loss.  I think their gains have been greater than their losses, and I think they have gained up to £5 or £6 a head on licences that Senator Jameson could not get.  I think they have been doing rather well, and I do not think they should be granted the privilege of a monopoly giving them power to prevent the Minister from doing what is just and reasonable in regard to surplus cattle on his hands. As to what Senator Miss Browne said, I do not like to answer her at all when <Col N="432" /> she becomes irrelevant; but what this section has to do with the seizure of cattle is more than I can comprehend.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Comyn when he referred to Section 38, that the amendment does not seem relevant to what one would naturally suppose would arise under Section 38.  But the contention is made that it would be permissible for the Minister to go into the cattle jobbing trade and export to Great Britain, and compete with a legitimate and necessary body of traders in this country.  I do not think that is a desirable thing.  I do not think that the cattle traders in this country have a monopoly and can make a successful ring for themselves such as some people imagine. The fact is that this body of traders have built up a great industry which was very prosperous and I hope will be prosperous again.  It does not seem to me fair or, in the long run, desirable to permit the Minister for Agriculture, with the resources of the State behind him, to go into this business and, possibly, affect the whole business in ways that we cannot foresee. I do not think it is fair or reasonable, and I do not think, in the long run, it is desirable.  The cattle trade is not a monopoly.  Anybody who likes can come into it, and new recruits have come into that trade from time to time.  I do not think there is any necessity for this section. The effects might be most undesirable and I do not think it is at all reasonable or fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with cattle for slaughter for which compensation is paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  That clearly applies to old or diseased cattle.  Some of the remarks made would suggest that the section makes it possible for the Minister to engage in the purchase and sale and export of any other cattle but those for which the money has been provided under this section.  If the animals are bought for slaughter are these old cattle; and if by chance the factory that is contemplated <Col N="433" /> to be set up to deal with this class of cattle were not working, what does the Minister do with the cattle?  Presumably, under the restriction, it is essential that the Minister should sell them or put them out on grass, but he cannot export them.  He must, therefore, sell them to a dealer who will export them or kill them at home.  To my mind, unless the Minister has power to find his market, he is putting himself entirely in the hands of those particular dealers who want to deal in this class of cattle; and this is merely a section giving the Minister the outlet which any Minister entering into the business would require to have.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan wants to go back to Section 32, but the amendment, if adopted, would have no relation whatever to Section 32.  It would only have to deal with cattle surrendered for slaughter or for which compensation was paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, which would be clearly for a particular class of cattle. Accordingly, Senator Counihan would have to do it by some other means and not by this section.</P>

      <P>The Minister complained on a measure earlier to-day that his predecessor was permitted to do certain things and that when he wanted to do something comparable there was a great deal of objection. I certainly agree that the Minister has a legitimate ground for complaint in this matter.  This is a measure to deal with a condition of affairs that has been forced on the Minister by reason of the quotas being imposed by the country to which the majority of our cattle were exported.  Other considerations come into it also, which we all know and which I need not refer to here. The result of the quota system has been a surplus of cattle here and under this measure the Minister wants to deal with that, but in carrying it out he is now to be prevented from shipping a certain number of cattle if conditions are such that that would be the most favourable way of disposing of them.  That is what the amendment means.  The Minister's <Col N="434" /> predecessor came along, at a time when no such emergency was forcing him, to take over a very considerable section of the butter trade in his Creamery Bill.  No objection was raised to that and I think, therefore, that the Minister has reason to complain that he is not getting such a fair show in this House as his predecessor got.</P>

      <P>In connection with what Senator Guinness has said, it is quite true that the House has already given permission.  This particular suggestion that has emanated from Senator Counihan and Senator Miss Browne obviously has not been put forward with the full and sincere desire of taking the powers from the Minister but has been put forward merely to gain a political point. <Col N="435" /> Senator Crosbie, of course, supported it.  I do not know that Senator Crosbie ever stood in a fair in his life. I do not believe he did, but still he talks about the shippers' losses. Everybody knows that the shipper gains in every way.  The feeder who feeds cattle for five or six months knows that the shipper can always buy against a dropping market and can come down here to the City of Dublin although he is not a farmer at all and has never fed cattle in his life.  Everybody knows that, since the quotas came into being, there is more criticism of the present Minister for Agriculture on that particular item alone than we have heard during the whole of the last ten years.  Why? For the simple reason that anybody who can get hold of licences gets the profit and the people who get the licences are the recognised shippers and they get the licences according to the number of cattle they shipped last year.</P>
      <P>They are actually buying cattle at the present time at as low a price as the bounty they receive.  They are buying fat battle in the West of Ireland for 5/- or 10/- over the amount of the bounty they get.  Then they have a licence and get 35/- a cwt. on the other side.  Then we hear talk about their losses.  It is all &ldquo;bunk.&rdquo;  The net result of it all is that what is already confined to them they want confined to them still further.  Somebody must step in, and it would be far better for the Minister for Agriculture to come forward, keep all the licences and export the cattle himself, giving a guaranteed price per cwt. for beef, than to continue on the present system.  If there were a referendum taken by the farming community to-day I know where the shippers would be.  That is the plain fact. That is what every man down the country is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the face of all this, we have Senator Crosbie coming along here from the City of Cork to support this proposal.  Senator Crosbie never in his life stood in a fair on a snowy morning, as I did often, waiting for a <Col N="436" /> few buyers to come down&mdash;men living on the fat of the land who never worked a farm in their lives.  That is what is amounts to.  That ring should have been smashed long ago.  This present Bill will smash it, and the sooner it is smashed the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that this particular section will not smash that ring.  I should like to make a correction in what Senator Guinness indicated. I think he is wrong in saying that the Minister will have powers under Section 32 to do what he seeks powers to do under this section, because the moneys that will be provided for the particular purpose would have to be spent for that purpose unless this permission were given in the section.  That is to say, if the money were provided for the purpose of slaughtering, unless there was special provision there in the Act that cattle coming into his possession could be disposed of otherwise than by slaughter, Section 32 would not give him the power to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>A good many of us had grave doubts about this Bill, but after the speech of Senator MacEllin, I think we have cause for far greater alarm than we had before.  Now we are beginning to see that, in one Senator's opinion at least, this Bill is going to give the Government power to enter into the cattle trade and, as he stated definitely, to smash one of our established systems of doing business in cattle at present.  I wonder if that is the view of the Minister.  If I thought it was his view, I would honestly get up and propose that the Seanad should not pass this Bill.  It cannot be possible that the Minister will stand over the statement we have just heard from Senator MacEllin, and if it is a fact, there is no question whatever that Senator Counihan's amendment, altered to suit the situation, should be passed by the Seanad.  I cannot follow Senator Johnson when he says that Section 38 deals only with old cattle and the compensation payable for them and I cannot find the clause which states that compensation is to be applied, and that it applies only to cattle that <Col N="437" /> are not to be killed for human consumption. The section says: &ldquo;Cattle slaughtered or surrendered for slaughter in pursuance of such scheme.&rdquo;  There is nothing that I can find in the Bill which confines that to old cows and cattle unfit for human consumption.</P>
      <P>If it could be proved that that is all Section 38 deals with I would agree with Senator Johnson, so far as these old cows are concerned, the schemes connected with the payment of compensation for them, and their use as food of some sort or another, that Senator Counihan's amendment would not be required.  I think the Minister could quite easily on Report Stage deal with that part of the matter and make it perfectly clear that he is only going to sell in some way, either by export or in the country, such surplus cattle as come under the scheme.  If he could give us that assurance and if the clause were drawn so that there would be no doubt about it, Section 38 would not require amendment and we would have to consider only what happens under Section 32, but there is nothing before the House at present to give that assurance.</P>

      <P>The reason I put that amendment into Section 38 is that that section also dealt with the export of cattle, and by having it in Section 38 &mdash;and I thought it was a fairly definitely worded amendment&mdash;Sections 32, 33 and any other section which prevented the Minister from exporting any live cattle or sheep to Great Britain or Northern Ireland would be included.  If that is definitely stated in the Bill, it will apply, in my view, to all the sections in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator MacEllin and Senator Quirke wanted to start a discussion on the economic war, but I am not going to follow them.  It is not so long ago that we had a very different tune when I stood up to talk about the difference in the price we were getting for fat cattle in this country and the price they were getting in Great Britain.  Both Senator Quirke and Senator MacEllin quoted <i>The Farmer and Stockbreeder</i> and all the prices that the cattle were making in England, but Senator MacEllin comes here to-day and, thumping the desk, says that the jobbers and dealers are robbing the country.  That is his statement.  A man cannot blow hot and cold within a week or a month.  He ought to be some way consistent.  I am not here to defend the cattle trader or cattle <Col N="439" /> exporter.  I represent them and I am not ashamed to stand up and say that I was, and am still, a cattle trader and exporter.  I have not, however, traded in any way in export for the last ten years except in the export of my own produce.  I always recognised, and I recognise still, that if there is no producer, no cattle exporter or trader will be wanted and the most important man in any section of the community is the farmer who produces fat cattle and fat sheep, and the only man who produces any wealth which the country has.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot of talk about exporters and I will give a little instance of their position.  They are exporting at great risk, although Senator Quirke and Senator MacEllin may sneer.  I know cases where out of 25 cattle exported, 12 were confiscated, or rather, they were not confiscated, but a fine of £4 per head imposed.  If an exporter sends cattle which the British inspectors may regard as beef, the exporter is fined £4 a head and the beasts are slaughtered.  The exporter gets what they return as beef but he is fined £4 and charged a duty of £6. That is not a very rosy prospect, and the man who takes such risks will want to get some profit or some compensation, because no one will take very big risks without a certain prospect of big profits.</P>

      <P>Those are the people Senator MacEllin denounces.  I want to know what the Minister is going to do when he controls all the fat cattle in this country.  As soon as this Bill becomes law, if it does become law, he may take all the licences himself, appoint a number of agents or exporters throughout the country and export all the cattle to Great Britain. I think it would be a very serious matter if the Minister appointed a number of exporters to export all the cattle to fill the quota.  The idea of my amendment is to prevent that. The Minister may have no such intention in his mind, but he has taken <Col N="440" /> power in the Bill to do it by Section 32.  As Senator Comyn says this will not fix Section 32 or deprive the Minister of these powers, I withdraw the amendment at this stage.  I will put in an amendment to Section 32 on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>No.  With regard to Senator Jameson's question on Section 38, that section is drafted so as to provide for a scheme being brought before the Dáil for a Supplementary Estimate.  The old cow scheme is the one we have in mind.  There might also be cattle suffering from tuberculosis, and under such a scheme, if it were brought forward, compensation would have to be paid.  There may be a need for other schemes later.  At any rate, the procedure under this section would be that we would inaugurate a scheme and then seek money for compensation, going before the Dáil with it.

      <P>I want some information from the Minister as to what he has in mind when he is taking power to give free meat to &ldquo;necessitous persons,&rdquo; other than those referred to as recipients of unemployment assistance and home assistance.  Has the Minister this in mind, that if there is a glut of meat the recipients under Section 1 of the Bill may not be sufficient and that he could then call in additional classes such as old age pensioners so as to help to dispose of the surplus meat?  Is that the idea?  What I am concerned about is this&mdash;there is a moral obligation on the Minister to have those cattle slaughtered when matured.  It would be very unjust to create a situation whereby the cattle cannot be slaughtered when they are matured, either because the consumers will not buy or that there are not enough recipients of the free meat to take all that is available.</P>

      <P>It is true that the clause could be used in the terms which Senator Sir John Keane has suggested, but it was not what was in my mind in the drafting of (2) and having it inserted in the Bill.  It was rather that some class of people might arise who could justly come under the Bill.  I was looking at the matter more from the point of view of the recipients than from the point of view of surplus cattle. We have only two classes mentioned&mdash; people in receipt of home assistance and people in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I do not know how these may grade in the future.  Home assistance might be divided into two classes and unemployment assistance might also be divided into two classes. It is well to have the power here in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider this point?  It is very hard to know how this new class of legislation is going to work and one is <Col N="444" /> rather suspicious.  I can see these contractors putting in very low prices to the Minister in the hope that afterwards they would be able to recoup themselves from the general consumer. I feel that the Minister in this matter has a dual obligation, he has to protect the taxpayer and also to protect the consumer.  Would not the Minister consider that he should have power to pay a fair price for the meat and not necessarily to accept the lowest tender?  Because the effect of price cutting on the contract in the case of free meat will naturally mean that the ordinary consumer will have to pay it.  I think the balance should be held between these two.  I do not know whether the Minister will have tenders in every case or whether he will make a general offer to the contractors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is right.  What I stated in the Dáil was that they would be compelled to supply beef from good quality cattle, but we did not specify what parts.  With regard to contracts, <Col N="445" /> in the ordinary way I would be bound to accept the lowest tender unless there were any good reasons against that.  I must say that it never struck me that prospective contractors would tender too low and try to make up the loss on the price charged to the ordinary customer.  I think the trouble will be the other way, that they will try to get a good price from the Government and sell as low as possible to the ordinary customer.  If the other danger arises, that they quote a price which is far too low for the contract and charge an exorbitant price to the consumer, that would be a good reason for refusing to accept the lowest tender.  I do not expect, however, that we shall be up against that danger.</P>
