      <P>I second the motion.  I am privileged to do so because King Albert lost his life mountaineering, which is my favourite sport.  Apart from public admiration for a celebrated man, I think it is fitting that we should pass this resolution, because King Albert was one of the finest examples of public men in our time.  He was a patriot King, one who shared the tribulations of his people.  He was adored by his own country, not because he put himself at the head of any movement of national ambition or anything of that kind, but because he always put duty first, with all the unpretentiousness of true greatness.</P>

      <P>It would be a pity to allow this rare occasion, when we have the resignation of a Senator, to pass without an expression of regret.  I understand that the reason Senator Vincent has been unable to attend here for a considerable time is due to reasons of ill-health.  During his short time in the Seanad he was an active member and I believe promised to be a very useful Senator.  I very much regret that he is unable to remain a member.  It is hardly necessary to make reference to his gift to the nation, which has been suitably expressed previously.  At the same time it is an additional reason why we regret the severance of his connection with this House.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the amount provided by the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1931, which may be advanced to the Electricity Supply Board, by £1,160,000.  For the information of the House I should say that the present financial position of the Electricity Supply Board, so far as advances are concerned, is as follows:&mdash;Under Section 12 (2) of the Electricity Act of 1927, £156,000 was provided, and under another section £2,500,000 was provided. Of these two sums authority was sought to expend the whole of the first, and £1,903,688 of the second.  The Act of 1931 provided an additional £2,000,000, of which authority for expenditure has been sought for £1,808,688.  The Electricity Supply Act of 1932 provided an additional £365,000, of which authority for the expenditure of £314,517 has been given.  The total amount provided under all these Acts was £5,021,000.  There is to be deducted under sub-section (6) of Section 39 of the Act of 1927, £756,118, leaving a net figure of £4,264,882, out of which authority for expenditure was sought for £4,182,893, leaving the balance available at the end of January of the present year of £81,989.  This Bill proposes to provide the amount estimated by the Board to be required for capital expenditure for the three years 1933-34, 1934-35 and 1935-36.  The balance available from previous advances on the 1st April, 1933, was £276,100, which is the amount taken into account in calculating advances under this Bill.  At the end of January of this year the Electricity Supply Board had estimated capital requirements of £1,436,600, and deducting from these figures the balance available at the beginning of <Col N="392" /> the period, £276,100, the net figures of £1,160,500 are reached.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for £1,160,000. The purposes for which that sum is required arise out of the normal growth of the system.  No part of it arises in any sense in consequence of any exceptional or abnormal development, and no part is required for the purpose of increasing the generating capacity of the Board's stations.  There is in every year a normal increase in the demand for electricity which involves consequential capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>It will, perhaps, be more convenient if I mention in detail the matters for which it is proposed to engage in capital expenditure during the three years.  The first item is an expenditure estimated at £50,000 in the present year and £28,000 next year, on the deepening of the River Shannon at Killaloe. As Senators are aware, the partial development stage of the Shannon scheme has been passed. Under the Act, 1932, authority was given for the capital expenditure involved in the installation of a fourth turbine at Ardnacrusha.  The installation of the turbine necessitates the deepening of the River Shannon, which was always contemplated, but which did not become necessary until the partial development stage had been passed.  That work will not involve any consequential revenue expenditure. It will have some effect in improving the efficiency of the existing installation. There is a smaller sum of £1,500 to be expended in the present year upon various minor improvements at Ardnacrusha, mainly expenditure to improve the reliability of the cooling system there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £64,400 is provided in the present year and £5,000 in next year for various improvements at the Pigeon House.  The present circulating water supply from the Pigeon House harbour will be inadequate to meet the needs of the increased capacity of the station.  Expenditure is necessary in order to provide an adequate circulating water channel and the necessary pumping stations.  Because of the increased capacity of the station, a larger consumption of coal is anticipated. <Col N="393" /> The existing Pigeon House harbour is only capable of accommodating boats carrying 500 tons, and only five such boats can be dealt with in a week.  Consequently, the amount of coal that can be taken in in a week at the Pigeon House is 2,500 tons.  It is necessary that that accommodation should be increased, and consequently it is proposed to extend the wharf and to deepen the harbour by dredging.  It is also necessary to provide coal storage and coal handling equipment, so that adequate supplies of coal will always be in stock to meet any demands that may be made on the station.</P>
    <P>There are various sums estimated to meet the cost of extending the transmission system.  That is, of course, an ordinary development of the system, and although it is not possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy the amount that will be required under that head, the amounts which are set out in the table before me in that connection are what are regarded as the normal amounts.  A separate item covers the provision that is being made for contingency expenditure.  Sums are also provided for expenditure on an extension of the distribution system, for the hire of apparatus, for the provision of public lighting and the like.  A sum of £3,100 in the present year, £4,500 next year and £4,700 the following year is provided to meet the cost of changing over consumers' apparatus and meters to the alternating current system.  A sum of £80,000 is provided in each year to meet capital expenditure arising out of the development of new areas.  The provision of £3,500 is made in each year to finance work in connection with the projection of future development and the cost of an inquiry into the use of the River Liffey for power purposes.</P>
    <P>The Board has found that its existing office accommodation has become unsuitable to house the activities of its headquarters staff. Consequently, it is proposed to provide the capital necessary to erect new office buildings.  An expenditure of £60,000 under that heading is expected to arise next year, and a similar sum the following year.  The contingencies <Col N="394" /> item, to which I have referred, is being covered by the provision of £30,000 in each year.  That sum of £30,000 is provided in the ordinary way to meet capital expenditure of a kind that cannot be foreseen.  There is a further contingencies item estimated at £25,000 in the present year, £50,000 next year and £35,000 the following year to meet expenditure of a kind that cannot be well foreseen upon the transmission and distribution systems.  For example, a heavy industrial load may call at any time for a substantial outlay on these systems, and the Board must have the finances available to enable it to undertake the expenditure involved if such a load should offer.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the Seanad is in every sense a routine measure.  Presumably, every three years or at somewhat similar intervals, a Bill of this kind will be submitted to the Oireachtas providing for the advances that may be made to the Board to provide capital for an extension of its activities during the ensuing period.  Any abnormal capital expenditure that may arise will be provided for in separate measures. It is contemplated that we will bring before the Oireachtas in the present year a Bill to provide the capital necessary to undertake the provision of additional storage on the Shannon, and to make certain changes in the law affecting the Electricity Supply Board. That Bill might have been part and parcel of this measure, but for the desirability of having the amount which this deals with provided without delay, and the fact that the other Bill will take some time to draft because of complicated legal points that are involved.</P>
    <P>The Seanad may be interested to know the present position of the scheme and of the Electricity Supply Board's finances.  The report of the Board for the year 1932-33 was circulated to all members of the Oireachtas two or three weeks ago, and presumably has been noted by them.  The Board closed its accounts for the year, showing a small surplus after making no provision for depreciation, but otherwise meeting all its working costs and paying interest on advances made to date.  The repayment <Col N="395" /> of advances has not yet begun. Since 31st March, the last date covered by that report, the revenue of the Board has increased by £75,000.  That covers the period from 1st April to 31st January. The number of units generated increased by 15,000,000, and the number of additional consumers connected was 6,560.  A number of new areas were connected up during the period, and when the money asked for under this Bill is provided it is intended to wire up a large number of additional towns. The position of the Electricity Supply Board is improving, as the accounts show, and as the figures which I have just mentioned indicate, but it cannot yet be said to be in the satisfactory position that we would all like to see it in.  It is making progress towards that position, and I am sure we all trust that that progress will be continued.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I must speak entirely from memory on this Bill.  The Minister has stated that a sum of over five million pounds has been advanced in connection with the Shannon scheme.  I know that my memory is faulty sometimes, but I have the feeling that in all the sum of about ten million pounds was advanced by the State for the purposes of this scheme.</P>

      <P>The amount advanced to the Board for the purpose of financing the Board's activities, as distinct from the advances made for the construction of the Shannon scheme, was, as I have stated, £5,021,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>When this scheme first came before the House we were told that the cost of it was going to be about £5,200,000: that under it all the principal towns and villages in the Free State were going to be supplied with electricity for that sum.  As time went on we were asked for more money.  At one period we were asked for £1,000,000, and at another period for £2,000,000, and so on.  I have lost count of all the advances that were made, but I am certain the statement was made frequently that in all between £9,000,000 and £10,0000,000 had been put into the Shannon scheme.  Now we are told by the Minister that we are to have Bills like this every three years: <Col N="396" /> that more money is to be advanced from time to time.  I think that is a very serious matter.  An extension of expenditure from £5,200,000 to £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 is certainly very great.  I am certain that the scheme would never have been approved of if we had been told at the start that it was going to cost this huge sum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I want my remarks on this Bill to be taken in a purely non-Party spirit.  In anything that I have to say I am not blaming the present Minister or his predecessor: this administration or the last administration. Anything I have to say will be directed entirely to the Electricity Supply Board.  With the best intentions in the world, I want to see the Shannon scheme a success.  I want to tell the Electricity Supply Board that the original intention, in starting the Shannon scheme, was that instead of having to import coal to make electricity here we proposed to make it from the Irish water flowing to waste all over the country. We are not confined to the River Shannon.  In saying that I do not want to boost any other scheme.  I am not an engineer and I do not know which scheme would be the better one, but I imagine that if you were to harness all the rivers in the country to produce electricity it would probably be the best scheme.  In the report issued by the Electricity Supply Board, to which the Minister has referred, we find that instead of doing away with the need for imported coal the Pigeon House has been working quite a lot during the year ending 31st March, 1933.  Owing to the fact that last year was a very dry year, I think the installation there was working practically throughout the whole year.  The result is that it is burning coal.  It does not matter to the people whose money is going out of the country for this coal whether it is English or German coal.  All that matters to them is that their money is going out for coal. I think that the Electricity Supply Board instead of re-opening the Pigeon House to burn imported coal, should have made greater use of the Galway <Col N="397" /> Electricity Supply Works which they took over.  When that scheme was in operation, current was supplied to the people of Galway at a very cheap rate.  The Board had the river at hand for any further development that they desired to carry out there. As to the amount of current&mdash;I am not an engineer and I am speaking subject to correction&mdash;there is as much power, in my opinion, in the Corrib as would supply the whole of Connaught with electricity.  Before going to this expense and sending money out of the country for the import of coal, I think they should turn their attention to that aspect of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told also when the scheme was started&mdash;and that was the intention of those who supported it&mdash;that we would have cheap electricity in every farmer's house in the country. We were told we would have light and power for everybody in the rural areas.  We know to-day how much electricity they are getting there. They are getting simply none.  The Pigeon House system was built up by the consumers of electricity in Dublin. The last year that scheme was working, under the Corporation, there was £87,000 profit which was able to be devoted to the relief of rates.  The electricity scheme at the Pigeon House in Dublin was the citizens' business and the profits went to the relief of rates.  The working of the Electricity Supply Board for the whole country has produced a profit of £5,814 and yet these people are clapped on the back for their achievement.  I do not want to criticise them unduly but I want to say this that on the last day, when an item was on the agenda for two millions for the Electricity Supply Board it occupied seventh place but it was taken first and, because I was one minute late, that sum was passed without one word of protest.  The Electricity Supply Board should understand that their job is to produce electricity or &ldquo;juice&rdquo; as it is called in the trade, and to produce that at a cheap rate. Their duty is not in selling lampshades or even in the wiring of houses. These things can be done much better <Col N="398" /> by people in the trade all their lives and who have devoted themselves specially to that branch of the business. Instead of taking over the Shannon scheme and giving cheap electricity to consumers the Electricity Supply Board have concentrated more upon acquiring showrooms all over the country.  I would like to know the nature of the bargain they made in connection with the house they bought in Kilkenny and houses they bought elsewhere for showrooms.  They have since had to pull in their horns, and sell these houses and I would like to know what they got for them.  Considering the nature of these transactions I am simply horrified at the statement the Minister made to-day that the Electricity Supply Board want to expend £60,000 upon new buildings in the City of Dublin. I say if their present accommodation in Mount Street and Stephen's Green is not good enough for the business, they are doing, then let them close down Stephen's Green showrooms and convert them into proper offices for their staffs instead of spending £60,000 in the provision of new offices.  They should close their showrooms all over the place and let the ordinary traders in the city and in the country sell lamps, and lampshades, and fittings, for which they are much better qualified than the Electricity Supply Board.  These ordinary traders by the sale of lamps and lampshades, and such things, will make a little profit for themselves and they will be able to pay their employees better than the Electricity Supply Board are paying their employees.  The same applies to the work of installation.  There were firms here in Dublin, and in other parts of Ireland, installing electricity long before the Electricity Supply Board had come to do any installing work, and these firms are doing better work in that direction to-day than the Electricity Supply Board are doing.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party know the wages the Electricity Supply Board are paying their tradesmen and they know the wages that the old electrical firms in Dublin were paying, and <Col N="399" /> they can compare the two.  When the Electricity Supply Board send men to the country they pay no country money, as it is called, but when private firms in Dublin send their men to the country to do work they pay them country money or lodging allowances.  I am not blaming the Minister at all in this matter, but I think he might pass a quiet hint to the Electricity Supply Board that they would be well advised to close down their showrooms and leave to ordinary business people, who are qualified to do so, the work, the carrying out such operations.  If they did that they would save a lot of expenditure.  The job of the Electricity Supply Board is to produce current&mdash;to produce &ldquo;juice.&rdquo; I do not object to the demonstrators. Demonstrators can do a great deal of good going around showing people how to use electric ovens and cookers and so on, and they can promote trade in that way.  They have got to try, as the Corporation did, to encourage people to use power during the day time and thereby increase the day load and then they would be able to supply power during the day at a much cheaper price.  The machinery is there and the more power that can be used on the day load the better. It is different with regard to the night load.  They are not able to produce much more than they are selling at night.</P>
    <P>If the Board are to continue coming to the Oireachtas year after year and saying we want another million and another million I do not know where the thing is going to end.  Let them come down to business and confine themselves to their proper operations. Take, for instance, their showrooms. Some of the lampshades exhibited there are very expensive.  You see a silk-shaded lamp in St. Stephen's Green which would cost £25.  What is that worth after standing there for a number of years?  It is practically not worth three-halfpence.  Their accounts do not say anything about that.  In paragraph 28 of the Annual Report and Accounts, 1932-33, it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sale of appliances and <Col N="400" /> apparatus for which credit has been taken amounted to £35,603 16s. 8d., on which the rate of gross profit was 18.6 per cent.  Having charged a proper proportion of general overhead expenses the merchandised trading account shows a nett profit of £484 15s. 11d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I really doubt that there is even that profit, but if there was it was a very small amount of profit on that turnover of £35,000.  They are taking away the trade from the hardware merchants in the country while at the same time they come here and ask these same hardware people, amongst others, to pay their way in the shape of taxation. In the next paragraph in the Report they say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The policy of the Board of retaining showrooms only in the most densely populated areas or at central points except during the initial development of an area, has been justified in a substantial reduction in expenditure.  The sales recorded through the permanent showrooms at Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Dundalk and Athlone show an increase over the previous year although there is a decrease of £6,288 2s. 1d. in total sales owing to the reduction in the number of showrooms.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary I should state, like my friend Senator Staines, that I approach this matter not from any Party point of view.  That, perhaps, may be expected from the fact that fortunately I have not attained sufficient eminence in any Party in this country.  I am not opposing this Bill.  I can fully understand the difficulty that the present Minister is placed in in connection with it.  He is shouldering, in my opinion in connection with this matter, a tremendous job.  I am quite satisfied that he is not at all pleased in having to bring forward this Bill.  I leave it at that. There was one statement he made which to a certain extent will be a source of great satisfaction to the citizens.  He pointed out something in connection with the Pigeon House which goes to prove that the Pigeon House was not, after all, the white <Col N="401" /> elephant it was pointed out to be when the Shannon scheme was first before us.  I am not going to say that Senator Staines has a bee in his bonnet in connection with this matter. But there is one thing in connection with this electricity supply question in regard to which I confess I have a bee in my bonnet and that bee stings very severely and to my great annoyance very frequently.  I respectfully take this opportunity of suggesting to the Minister the propriety of considering restitution to the citizens of Dublin in connection with the electricity supply system in this city. The unfortunate ratepayers of Dublin and the consumers spent between one and two million pounds&mdash;I have not the actual figures by me&mdash;on the erection of an electricity supply for Dublin.  During the last year of the working of that supply in Dublin there was a clear profit of £87,000. The citizens of Dublin did not get one penny compensation for the handing over of their system which produced that profit, although the citizens of Cork and Galway, and other places whose systems were taken over, were compensated.  Why, in the name of Heaven, Dublin was left out of consideration in such an instance I cannot understand.  The Minister is a Dublin man; he represents a Dublin constituency.  I do not want the Minister to give me an answer right off now, but I think in fairness to the citizens he should give this matter of some restitution to the citizens of Dublin for the handing over of their scheme his serious consideration; and if he makes amends in this matter it will be a great feather in his cap at the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>When we proceed to make comparisons I think they should be fair comparisons, and I contend that the production and distribution of electricity for a city like Dublin is quite a different proposition to producing and distributing electricity to the country as a whole.  The cost of distribution in Dublin City would be at the very minimum as compared with the number of consumers, while in the small urban and rural districts the cost of distribution would be very high in <Col N="402" /> proportion to the amount of current sold.  So, it proves nothing to say that the Dublin Electricity Station made a certain profit whilst the Electricity Supply Board, so far, has failed to show any profit worth mentioning.  I think, however, that it is appropriate here for the Minister to give some information regarding the finances of the Board.  It is quite clear that there has been a deficit in the estimate of revenue as made out by the Board late in 1931.  In this respect, it is interesting to refer to a speech made by the Minister's predecessor here in this House on the 17th December, 1931, which is reported in columns 317 and 318 of the Official Debates.  Mr. McGilligan said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They (the Board) believe that now they can get in an ordinary year about £1,232,000 per annum as revenue.  Against that they must set interest and sinking fund payments to the extent of £713,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was talking then of this year, 1933-34.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The division of that sum would be: £543,000 interest, and £170,000 sinking fund.  Operation costs, fuel, oil, maintenance and repairs amount to about £150,000 a year, general charges and management to £184,000, and the liabilities of the acquired undertakings to about £90,000 a year.  These figures give a total of £1,137,000 as against an income of £1,232,000&mdash;a carry over of £95,000.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>That was the estimate of the Board, after very careful investigation as to what the income would be in this year, 1933-34, and, according to the estimates of costs of generation, distribution, and so on, they would be able to make contributions to the sinking fund of £170,000 a year, and put £95,000 to reserve.  In order to get this income, a pretty substantial increase in the cost of current was imposed, ranging from about 10 per cent. to 25 per cent. That was supposed to bring in an increased revenue of at least £80,000 per annum, and certain economies were to be put into operation which would involve a fairly considerable saving. Quite obviously, the expectations of the Board have not been realised.  The <Col N="403" /> revenue for 1932-33 was only £1,044,000. The Minister tells us that in the ten months of the year 1933-34 that have elapsed there is an increase of £75,000. That would bring the revenue for the ten months, say, up to £1,119,000 and, if we allow for the two months that have yet to elapse we would find that the revenue is at least £100,000 short of the estimate made by the Board in December, 1931.  In any case, the sum of £1,232,000, even if it were now available, would not be sufficient to enable the Board to contribute towards the sinking fund and towards reserves because the generation and operation expenses, which were estimated to cost £150,000, have gone up to approximately £200,000, whilst the overhead expenses, general charges, and so on, are about a quarter of a million pounds as against the estimate of £184,000.</P>
    <P>The present Minister, speaking in the Dáil on the 15th of this month, as reported in columns 1550-1551 of the Official Debates, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Board is meeting at present its interest charges.  It has not, however, commenced to repay nor has it been asked to commence to repay, nor would it be able to commence repaying, the capital advanced.  It is not making provision for the depreciation of its plant and no reserve fund of the kind mentioned has been or is being built up as yet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that there must have been some error in the estimates made.  One would like to know what has been the result of the increased cost of current to the consumer.  It was estimated to bring in £80,000 per annum.  I wonder if that has been the case or whether, on the contrary, there has not been a fall in consumption and a fall in revenue as a result of it.  The increase in consumers, for the whole country, for last year was 4,500, which seems rather poor considering the large number of new houses that are being built, practically all of which are being wired.  In quite a number of towns there was actually a reduction in the number of consumers and one can only attribute that, in part at any rate, to the increased cost of current, because any householder, once he gets in the <Col N="404" /> electric fittings, is not likely to turn to some other form of lighting if he can possibly get electricity at a reasonable price.  It seems to me that the best policy would be to try to spread the network far and wide at the earliest possible date.  I think the real object of the scheme was, as Senator Staines said, to provide light, heat and power at the lowest possible price to the whole community.  There has been a very considerable slowing down in the spreading of the network and the distribution system.  In 1930 there were about 600 electricians employed by the Board.  By December, 1931, the number had fallen to 200, and, according to the present report, only 162 are now employed.  Even these are not being given the same conditions of service as the workers employed by private firms, so that any deficit that has occurred in the revenue, as estimated by the Board, is certainly not due to any decent labour conditions they are giving to their employees.</P>
    <P>I think it is desirable that the Board should have a definite plan.  I do not care whether it is for a year, or for five years or ten years, but they should have some plan to work to and a real estimate as to the time when they will be able to be self-supporting without imposing unfair conditions on the consumers of electricity. Personally, I fancy that that period will be considerably shortened in proportion to the speed at which the distribution of the network is carried out. That will not take place if we reach a sort of stalemate now and develop no further but just rest on our oars and make no enthusiastic and determined effort to spread this scheme to a great number of citizens.  Senator Staines objected to the showrooms set up by the Board.  I do not know if that is the best form of publicity, but I do certainly strongly favour as much publicity as possible on the part of the Board.  The private vendors of electrical fittings, with very few exceptions, have done nothing at all of a practical character to popularise electricity. There are very few windows worth looking into by anybody who would like to study electrical fittings, such as lamp shades and so on except those set up by the Electricity Supply <Col N="405" /> Board, and until private retailers come forward and do more to popularise electricity than they have done up to the present I hardly think there is any real justification for denouncing the Electricity Supply Board for themselves trying to do what the private retailers so far have failed to do.</P>
    <P>In regard to the work done by the Board in the matter of wiring, one can only judge them as you find them, and I have to say that as far as I have had any experience with them in the matter of wiring private houses, their employees certainly have done first-class work and have done it in the minimum of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow up one point made by Senator O'Farrell, and that is in regard to the consumption of current by private domestic consumers.  I have gone through this report, and though I have not made close comparison, or very little comparison at all, with the previous year's report, I fail to find any indication of the effect of the increased prices upon the consumption in domestic houses of current whether for lighting, heating or cooking.  We have in this report indications of the increase in the units consumed for public lighting and of the increase in the total units produced.  The increase in the number of consumers is shown, and the increase in the industrial horsepower that is produced, but there is no indication of the increase or decrease in the number of units consumed by domestic consumers. I think that is an important omission and that it ought to be remedied.  If there are going to be comparisons given in these reports of one year with another, as I think there ought to be, I think it ought to cover all the different kinds and classifications of consumers.  I should be interested to know whether there has been any considerable decline in any areas in the consumption of power for cooking, let us say, or for domestic heating.  Perhaps the Minister has that information available, but if it is not available with him at present I hope that when a new report is being issued real comparative figures will be given of all the classes of consumption, not merely public lighting or <Col N="406" /> industrial power or Dublin tramways or anything of that kind, but particularly the domestic consumer, because, in the main, it is the domestic consumption for heating and cooking that will probably tell most in the ultimate, because the sale of industrial motive power would probably be at low prices, and I am not quite sure whether the economy from the point of view purely of the purchaser of that power would be so great as to justify a policy which concentrated upon the sale of industrial power as distinct from domestic heat.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of general welfare, I should like to see the policy of this Board directed towards making the consumption of electricity in houses as cheap as possible, so that there will be a real inducement to the domestic consumer to consume electricity.  If the poor person can have a cleaner house, without any considerable increase in the cost of heating, then there will be a very great social advantage obtained. That is of more importance, I think, than the turning over of, say, the Dublin Tramways Company from the production of their own power to the consumption of Shannon power, without any public advantage.  There would be a real public advantage if that amount of consumption by the Tramways Company had been obtained from an increase in consumption by the ordinary, domestic householder.  I should hope that the policy of the Board would be to take into account the social advantages that would accrue if they could supply domestic consumers with heat as well as light, but more particularly with heat, at so cheap a rate as would justify them in turning over from either gas or coal and give them the advantage of a clean house. I am sorry that the report before us does not give the figures for 1932 as compared with 1933, but I hope that relative figures will be available in the future.</P>

      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would tell us in his reply whether the temporary increase of 25 per cent. is likely to become permanent. I agree, generally, with what Senator Johnson has said, but I am inclined to think that, with the 25 per cent. <Col N="407" /> increase on the present rates for heating, it is not practical politics to talk about heating houses by electricity. A number of people who, through enthusiasm, have tried it are sorry they did so, because they have found that, even with the most careful calculations, and even allowing for a contemplated increase in cost as compared with other forms of heating, the actual cost worked out more than they had dreamed of.  I have come to the conclusion that any charge over ½d. per unit for heating is not practical politics.  I am not prepared to say that at ½d. per unit the cost would be cheaper than it would be by using coal, but, for many people, heating by electricity at ½d. a unit, in view of the other advantages which attend the use of electric power, would be practical politics.  But 1¼d. per unit, plus a charge on the valuation, is not practical politics for any but the few people who can afford to pay that price for occasional convenience.  I do not know much about the cost of cooking, but I think 1¼d. per unit for cooking is too high.  I was in the North of England about 12 months ago.  I found that a friend with whom I was staying had his whole house heated with electricity and that the cooking was done by electricity.  I expressed a certain amount of surprise at this, and I found that in that English town they paid ½d. per unit for heating and 1d. per unit for lighting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a valuation charge which was, I think, half of our charge.  That charge was decidedly more favourable than ours, and there was a charge of ½d. per unit.  I went into our own cost when I came home and I came to the conclusion that they were paying in that English town rather less than half of what we are paying.  I am not taking up the attitude that a scheme of this kind should not be undertaken because we are not able to quote the same rates as certain towns in England, but I think it is going to be extremely difficult to popularise the use of electricity all over the country on the present charges.  The <Col N="408" /> position we had dreamed of, in which every cottage and house would have electricity and in which there would be a very considerable use of electricity for heat and smaller power, apart from industrial power, is not being reached. I doubt if the policy of the Board at present is likely to achieve our aim. I do not know anything about special rates that may be quoted.  For large industrial power, special rates will, no doubt, be quoted, but for smaller power a charge of 2d. is not practical politics, except on rare occasions.  If you put in a power meter in the city you pay 2d.  I do not know what is paid in the country.  That is not practical politics except for occasional convenience.</P>
      <P>If there was any hope that the increase of 25 per cent. would be really temporary one might be tempted to extend one's commitments in regard to electricity.  I, myself, in dealing with a concern in which I am interested, decided that that increase was likely to be permanent and made arrangements for another type of heating, though, if I had any hope that in the near future there would be a reduction in the rates, I should certainly have gone in for electric heating.  I know that in some cases quite large houses have found electric tubular heating a great success, with enormous advantages over other types of heating, but not at the rates which we have to pay here.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw your attention, a Chathaoirligh, under Standing Order 26, to a matter which would appear directly to concern the privileges of the Seanad.  This afternoon, I brought in two friends, for whom I had obtained tickets of admission to the Visitors' Gallery, to the gate at Kildare Street&mdash;but they were refused admission by the military, who stated that they were acting under orders.  They were kept out by force. I can only assume that the reason the visitors were not admitted is that they were wearing a certain dress&mdash;blue shirts&mdash;against which there is no law whatever.

      <P>Senator Staines suggested in certain remarks that the Minister had no control over the Electricity Supply Board.  I do not think that that is correct.  He has not power of detailed interference, but he has power of general control over the officials and the Board.  I do think that the Minister should take notice of and, if another opportunity occurs, give the House some explanation of the very wide discrepancy between the promises of his predecessor, as quoted by Senator O'Farrell, and the actual figures as revealed by the accounts. I should not for a moment suggest that it is possible to give close estimates in advance, but I feel that if a commercial manager showed in his estimates the wide divergence that is shown here, he would have to make a very convincing explanation to his board if he wished to hold his position. In this case, I think that the Minister is rather in the position of a supreme authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like another Senator I was puzzled by the capital-figures given by the <Col N="410" /> Minister.  The accounts show that there has been somewhere in the region of £1,000,000 capital issued for the Shannon works and subsequent development.  The Minister mentioned a figure of £5,000,000.  I cannot reconcile that figure with any definite group in the published accounts.  With regard to the items for which this further capital is required, I ask the Minister to consider them seriously and to convey to the Board his views with regard to the expenditure of £60,000 on new buildings.  That does seem unnecessary extravagance.  We all like to make a show in bricks and mortar, but experience has shown that people with any commercial understanding are now getting rather suspicious of people who make a show in bricks and mortar.  They rather lean to those who work in poky offices, which would suggest that their business is being economically managed and that they have something put away for the rainy day.  I suggest that this is not the time to engage in expenditure on swagger offices on, I understand, the Maple Hotel site.  Before that is done, depreciation on the capital assets of the undertaking, at least, should be provided.  It is well known that, in ordinary business undertakings, you have to provide for obsolescence and, in connection with this undertaking, there must be depreciation of a capital nature on the transmission system.  Until reserves of that kind have been provided for, it is not, I suggest, sound finance to expend a sum of £100,000 or more on offices when the work is being done&mdash;no doubt at a little inconvenience, because of the scattered buildings&mdash;at present with quite reasonable efficiency.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that coal has at last come out of politics and that it has been judged on its merits.  Where coal is cheapest it is, I understand, to be used.  I always held that coal would prove the cheapest and I gather that that is what is happening, in view of the fact that extensions are being made at the coal harbour and that facilities are being provided for the handling of imported coal.  I felt my usual sorrow when I heard Senator Staines talking of money going out. <Col N="411" /> He would, no doubt, like to see money coming in, but it would be difficult to have money coming in if you had not money going out.  Trade is reciprocal. If you like one side, you must like the other side or you will have no trade at all.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider one matter which, I think, is fundamental. Senator Douglas talked about the cost of the all-electric house.  It is not only a question of cost, it is a question of physical ability to have an all-electric house.  I am wired in the country on the Shannon and, however much I should desire an all-electric house, I cannot have it.  The distribution system is such that I am allowed only a certain strength of fuse for power purposes.  I can use only one-third of the power-wiring I have put in&mdash;and put in largely in the belief that it was desirable that people should use as much electricity as possible. I am told that heavier wiring on the distribution system will be necessary before I can use the power wiring I have installed.  I suggest to the Minister that he should at least consider whether it is wise to expend money on what must be unprofitable extension from now on.  These extensions in the smaller villages, however desirable they may be from the point of view of social betterment, must, undoubtedly, become less and less productive. I suggest that it would be more productive to enable those who are not getting a complete service at present to get a complete service. That not only applies to some of the smaller villages but I think it applies to some of the areas quite near Dublin which have their power supplies controlled by fuses or some such means. That is a matter which, I think, the Minister should confer with the Board about&mdash;whether it is better to consolidate existing services than to extend and to what extent to do one or the other.</P>
    <P>As one who has always been a critic of this electricity supply finance, I am glad to say that things have turned out much better than I, at one time, expected.  Of course, Senator O'Neill supplied the answer, that when the <Col N="412" /> scheme was originally under discussion it was never contemplated that the whole of the Dublin distribution system would be collared, and taken over for nothing, or that a very profitable source of revenue in the City of Dublin should go into the general profits of the Board.  In the early days it was only contemplated, I understand, that the Shannon scheme, as it was then called, would sell electricity in bulk to various municipal and other undertakings.  However, that is all past policy, and we have to face things as we see them to-day.  It is because the assets of the Dublin ratepayers have been taken for nothing that the scheme has been so profitable.  If it had to carry compensation to the Dublin ratepayers and consumers it would, of course, show a very substantial loss to-day.  I am afraid if restitution had to be made it could only be made either at big expense to the taxpayers or increased charges to consumers.  Considering everything, I think that progress has been made, but not as great as the estimate foreshadowed.  The Board is to be complimented on the manner in which the accounts are set out, and. I think, the accountant deserves special thanks for the manner in which they have been issued.  I support Senator Johnson's demand, that we should have comparative figures from the first years, say from 1931 onwards, as to the consumption of current and under various other headings, to enable the progress or otherwise to be accurately examined.</P>

I will endeavour to cover the ground as fully as I can, and to provide all the information in my possession, or to indicate the source from which Senators can get the information desired by them.  I should start by saying that I must refuse to take any responsibility whatsoever for any estimates given by my predecessor or for any statement of the prospects of the undertaking for which he may be responsible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to Senator O'Farrell's remarks when I made that statement.  Senator Colonel Moore spoke first, and I am taking the speakers in order.  Referring to the estimates as to the total capital cost of the scheme, and the total capital required by the Electricity Supply Board, all of which appear to have proved to be totally inadequate, I am not responsible for these estimates.  I am concerned with the fact that there is in existence an Electricity Supply Board, controlling a generating and distribution system, and it is my concern to see that the Board carries out its special functions as efficiently as possible. The estimates which may have been given by my predecessor in this connection, like other estimates given by him, and like most of the estimates given by his political associates, were usually inaccurate.  At the present time not merely is this concern but other concerns are suffering public criticism, because of the fact that public expectations were aroused which could not possibly be fulfilled.  The original cost of the Shannon scheme was fixed at a certain figure.  That figure had to be increased.  I can clear up the difficulties which Senators have concerning the total capital liability of the Electricity Supply Board by referring to the fact that roughly half the capital liability was transferred to the Board with the Shannon works.  These works were constructed by the Government, and transferred to the Electricity Supply Board with a capital liability attaching.  In addition, direct cash advances were made to the Electricity Supply Board to enable it to finance its own activities.  These activities were associated with the construction and enlargement of the distribution system, the financing of hire purchase, sales of electrical equipment, the provision of public lighting, and other activities too numerous to mention.  An original sum of £2,500,000 was provided for that purpose.  The Act of 1927 provided that that sum should be advanced to the Board on demand by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> Senators are aware of the position that arose in 1931, when it was alleged by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the Board had exceeded without his knowledge the limit of expenditure contemplated by the Act of 1927.  There was a discussion as to whether a certain sum of £700,000 was properly available for the Board, or was earmarked for the purpose of being set off against liabilities acquired by the Board when stations of local authorities were taken over.  In any event, although the Act of 1931 increased the amount available for the Board by £2,000,000, it also provided that that amount should only be advanced when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was satisfied that it was reasonably and properly required by the Board. From the date of the passing of that Act, the Minister for Industry and Commerce acquired a control over the Electricity Supply Board which he had not previously.  His control however is limited to this, that he must be satisfied, before any capital advance is made, that the money is properly required by the Board for the purpose of exercising its functions.  In practice it boils down to an inquiry as to whether the expenditure of the money is likely to prove remunerative or not.  That brings me down to the point raised by Senator O'Farrell and also by Senator Sir John Keane, namely to the development of the system.  Senator O'Farrell said that the proper policy is to spread the distribution and the net work far and wide, and that that will mean a saving. On the other hand, Senator Sir John Keane suggests a more conservative policy, a more intensive utilisation of the existing system before extending it.  I may say that I am quite prepared to sanction and would very much like to see a widespread distribution of the system, if it is going to pay.  The more propositions the Board puts up to my Department for an extension of the system into new towns and districts, the better I will be pleased, if the Board can show that the revenue to be derived from the linking up of new consumers is going to meet capital <Col N="415" /> charges arising out of the extensions.</P>
    <P>It is possible that in the early days schemes of extension of that kind were undertaken which did not pay, and which never can pay, and the charges arising in consequence of these extensions have got to be met by the more remunerative parts of the system.  It is obviously wise policy to utilise the existing system as much as possible to the extent that the Board may get for the existing system increased consumers or link up new consumers in areas fully wired, the better for the Board.  I can assure the Seanad that there will be no limitation whatever placed on any proposal put forward by the Electricity Supply Board for an extension of the system, subject to their being able to show that the extension will be remunerative.  I do not know whether we can improve the financial position of the Board by decreasing the rates of charge.  It is probably true that by decreasing charges greater consumption could be secured, but whether that would improve the financial position of the Board is another matter which would require very careful consideration.  Let me say that I am not going to defend here either the original rates fixed by the Board or the decision to increase these rates in 1931.  Whether the original rates were too high or too low, or whether the increase in the rates was in any sense a breach of contract is a matter which has been fairly fully discussed in public.  No doubt everyone has his own views on it.  I am concerned with the fact that the Board is charged by the Act of 1927 with the responsibility of fixing rates of charges so as to provide sufficient revenue to meet working expenses, to provide provision for depreciation, interest charges, capital repayment charges, and to meet an obligation to provide a reserve fund for certain purposes.  The Board at present is not meeting its working expenses if you include depreciation. It is meeting working expenses exclusive of depreciation.  It is paying interest charges, but is not repaying capital and is not putting by any reserves.  It is in relation to these responsibilities that the question of a <Col N="416" /> reduction in the rates of charges has to be considered.  I have no function in that matter, apart from seeing that the Board meets its obligations, or, at any rate, keeps these obligations before it, so that they will not be able to forget them.</P>
    <P>If a question arose as to whether I should exercise whatever influence I have with the Board&mdash;arising out of the fact that it was appointed by the Government&mdash;in order to procure a reduction in the rates, I should have to consider if I could properly do that, having regard to the fact that the revenue from existing rates is far short of meeting the obligations imposed upon the Board by the Act of 1927.  The position of the Board is improving; it is improving slowly, but not as rapidly as we would like to see it.  It will be a number of years before its financial position, so far as we can see, will be as thoroughly satisfactory as we would like to see it.  That does not say that there will not be a decrease in charges for a number of years, because of course there is always the possibility that the revenue position would be improved by a decrease in charges.  The charges are, in fact, being decreased.  The report which Senators have before them shows that the charges for cooking were reduced from 1½d. to 1d. per unit during the year, and that other reductions had taken place since. There has, however, been no general reduction in charges, and the increases decided in 1931 are still maintained. I would very much like to see the price of current reduced, but I certainly could not use pressure to effect that reduction until I was satisfied that the net result would improve and not disimprove the financial position of the Board.</P>

      <P>Senator Staines referred to the fact that the Pigeon House was extensively used for the generation of current in 1932-33, and was even more extensively used last year.  The figures in the report show that out of a total of 166,000,000 units generated in 1931 and 1932, 143,000,000 units were generated at Ardnacrusha and 22,000,000 units at the Pigeon House. <Col N="417" /> These figures make it quite clear that by far the greater part of the current was generated at Ardnacrusha.  The extensions to the Pigeon House might very well, instead of resulting in a greater number of units being generated there, result in a lesser number of units being generated there, because the more stand-by capacity the Board has the more water it can use in the working of the Ardnacrusha station.  If the Board's stand-by capacity was limited it would always have to keep in the Shannon a water reserve so that it could meet at any time the demands made upon it.  The Board call that reserve its iron ration of water.  The more its stand-by capacity is increased the less concern it need have about its iron ration of water.  It can eat into its reserve in the Shannon with more ease of mind than would be possible if the stand-by capacity was less.  Consequently, the effect of extending and improving the generating capacity of the Pigeon House is to permit of a higher proportion of the total current generated being generated at Ardnacrusha.</P>
      <P>Last year, however, was an abnormal year.  The Pigeon House station was working from either the end of April or the beginning of May.  I think the Board had considerable foresight in bringing the Pigeon House plant into full working so early in the year.  If, in fact, they had failed to do so, if they had been using water more extensively during those months, a very serious situation might have arisen towards the end of the year.  Senators are aware that the last six months have been the driest months on record.  This country has never had experience of an equally dry period.  However, I think it would be unfair to criticise the Shannon scheme or any hydro-electric scheme upon the experience of last year, which was in every sense an abnormal one from the point of view of rainfall.  I would suggest to those who deplore the importation of coal for the purpose of generating electricity to add their prayers to ours that rain may come soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Staines also complained that the people were told that very cheap electricity was going to be available for <Col N="418" /> farmers.  I have no doubt that the people were told that, and quite a number of other things that were equally misleading.  The fact, however, is that electricity is reasonably cheap here.  It is true that in a number of towns in Great Britain and in other countries electricity is cheaper than it is here. Industrial users of current can get power in Dublin a lot cheaper than they could have got it from the Corporation station, and in many parts of the country electricity is cheaper than it ever was before.  There is every reason to believe that the price of current must, in any event, tend downwards. It is quite easy to work out to what extent it is possible to effect a reduction in price as consumption increases, although increased consumption involves a necessary increase in capital expenditure, and, therefore, increased charges on revenue.  Nevertheless, a reasonable increase in consumption over a number of years would permit of a steady reduction in the average price per unit required by the Board in order to meet its charges. The Board is prohibited by statute from making profits in the ordinary sense. Its prices must be fixed so as to meet the charges on it and no more.  In so far as increased revenue is secured by increased sales, not entirely offset by increased capital charges, the price of current should come down.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Neill assumed that I was not pleased to bring in this Bill.  That is a misleading statement.  I am quite pleased to bring in this Bill, and I would like to bring in a Bill for a larger amount if that larger amount were required to finance a more rapid development of the system during the three years.  There is the Electricity Supply Board with all its equipment.  This money is required by the Board to extend its system because of an increased demand for current.  I am glad to bring in a Bill for that purpose, and would like to be bringing in a Bill for a larger sum if it were required for that purpose. I would like, at the same time, to see the accounts of the Board look a little bit healthier.</P>

      <P>The Senator also talked about restitution to the citizens of Dublin.  I am not quite sure, however, what the Senator meant by restitution: whether we should hand back the Pigeon House generating station or the price of it.  If the Senator wants the cost of it handed back to the citizens of Dublin, I am not quite sure who, in his opinion, should pay it.  I do not think it is possible to get it from the electricity consumers, or that it would be fair, and I do not think it would be altogether reasonable to ask the taxpayers to pay that amount.  That is a matter upon which Senator O'Neill might let me have his views: how the restitution is to be made, and by whom.</P>

      <P>That is another question. Senator O'Farrell and Senator Sir John Keane both referred to the discrepancies disclosed between the figures in the published reports and those given in 1931, both as to the revenue that would result from the increased charges and the expenditure of the Board.  The increase in the charges did increase the revenue of the Board, but it may not have increased it to the full amount anticipated in the year 1931.  The increase in the charges made have had the effect alleged in certain quarters: a slowing down of an increase in consumption.  It is hard to say that.  The increase in consumption has not been as rapid as I would like to have seen it, but other causes may have operated to hinder that.  These are matters upon which various opinions are available and on which various opinions have been received. It is quite clear that one must try to form one's own conclusions from the facts available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was anticipated in 1931 that in this year the Board would be able to commence repaying capital advances. It is now clear that it will not be able to do that.  Neither will it be able to make provision for a reserve fund on the scale anticipated.  That is due partly to the fact that revenue anticipations were not realised, and to a larger extent to the fact that certain economies in expenditure which were <Col N="420" /> anticipated were not achieved.  I think that the Board in 1931 were far too optimistic as regards the reductions in expenditure which they thought they could accomplish.  Certainly they could not accomplish them to anything like the extent which they indicated themselves. In addition, of course, the Board's expenditure has increased, due to abnormal causes, in a manner that was not anticipated, notably arising out of the fact that both 1932 and 1933 were very dry years, which necessitated the utilisation of the Pigeon House, and consequently the purchase of coal to a much greater extent than was expected. I may say, however, to Senator O'Farrell that there is no desire whatever on my part to slow down an extension of the system.  I do not think the Board have at any time complained of the manner in which the powers conferred by the 1931 Act are exercised as restricting them in any sense except in so far as they are required to satisfy the officers of my Department that the revenue to be secured, as a result of any expenditure proposed, will bear a known relationship to the capital expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>At the present time it is true that certain extensions which are projected are being delayed because of the fact that this Bill has got to go through. The Board had expended all the money available at the date on which the Bill was introduced, and it is awaiting its passage through the Oireachtas to draw upon the Exchequer to the amount indicated to undertake the opening up of certain new areas which it has in contemplation.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing which I think I should say arising out of a remark made by Senator Staines, a casual remark which might be capable of being misunderstood.  He referred to the people having to pay in taxation the amount required by the Board for the purposes which I indicated this money is being provided for.  This money, of course, is not being provided out of taxation.  It is being advanced to the Electricity Supply Board at interest, the Board being under an obligation to pay interest annually and ultimately to <Col N="421" /> repay the advances made.  In the main, the expenditure which will arise following the passage of this Bill will be of a kind which will produce revenue.  All the expenditure incurred by the Board upon its distribution and transmission systems and upon the works, the nature of which I have indicated, will produce revenue to the Board.  It will, in fact, produce revenue not merely capable of meeting the charges arising from the expenditure but will also improve the financial position of the Board in respect of past expenditure.  Some of these sums that I have mentioned will not have that effect.  The expenditure upon the Pigeon House and the expenditure upon the deepening of the River Shannon at Killaloe and the like has to be added to the capital liability of the Board, and will not in itself produce revenue to meet the charges arising from that expenditure.  Those charges will have to be met by increased revenue resulting from other expenditure.  The same applies in respect of the proposed new head office buildings.  To some extent the capital expenditure upon those buildings will be off-set by economies effected resulting from the more satisfactory arrangements that can be made when they are available as compared with the arrangements necessitated by the existing structures.  In the main, however, that capital will have to be remunerated by revenue derived from expenditure upon other assets of the Board.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree that the present is not a suitable time to undertake this capital expenditure.  The offices arc required.  They will add to the efficiency of the Board's headquarters and they will effect certain economies.  It is much more desirable that that expenditure should be undertaken now than at some other period, having regard to other considerations.  The Board will be able to meet the charges that will arise from the expenditure which, of course, will not become due until the expenditure has taken place. On that account I felt quite justified in sanctioning the proposal to provide the £120,000 estimated for that purpose.  I consider that at the present <Col N="422" /> time capital expenditure of that kind is to be encouraged rather than discouraged.</P>
    <P>These, I think, cover most of the points that were raised by the Senators.  The Bill will be before the Seanad again, and if I have omitted to deal with any point that was referred to to-day by Senators, or if Senators desire to get additional information, then I will endeavour to provide it for them.  I desire to stress, however, that I have no responsibility for a number of actions of the Board. The members of it are given independence by law.  They are charged with certain functions and they are given independence in the discharge of them. My power in relation to the Board is very limited.  It is quite true that the Board works in very close co-operation with my Department and myself, and I have no difficulty in procuring from them any information that I desire, but I have been at pains to preserve to them their independence.  In matters in which they themselves have the responsibility any decision made will be their decision which they will have to justify.  The power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is really very limited and really arises from the fact that membership of the Board is limited in time.  If the Minister is displeased with the way in which any member of it has discharged its functions he can be removed by the procedure set up by the Act of 1927, if the circumstances justify it.  I think we can be satisfied that the Board will exercise all reasonable care in embarking upon expenditure and that checking by the Department is not necessary now.  Whether it was necessary at any time is a matter on which I do not propose to express an opinion.  That is under consideration.  I said that no action upon these lines would take place this year, but I think at the same time we must contemplate putting the Board back into the position it was in previously by removing the measure of control that exists at the moment with regard to expenditure. It is probable that at a later stage the Board will get power to raise its own capital.  While the Board has not this <Col N="423" /> power Bills will have to come up in the ordinary way for raising capital as in the case of the telephone system.  They are routine measures and necessary as measures for financing the scheme, as decided upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really a very minor Bill.  It is introduced to remove certain doubts which have arisen as to the correct interpretation of other Acts.  I think I can best convey the nature of this Bill to the Seanad by giving the history of the case which has resulted in the introduction of this Bill.  Early in the year 1932, or the close of 1931, an application under the Trade Loans Act, 1924, was made for the guarantee of a loan proposed to be raised for the purpose of financing a large-scale housing scheme. At the time that application was made the Minister for Industry and Commerce was advised that the power to guarantee a loan for that purpose was conferred by the Act of 1924 and that so far as legal matters were concerned there was no difficulty.  I considered the proposal from the point of view of policy, and I consulted the Executive Council.  Finally, it was decided that the provisions of the Trade Loan Guarantees Act should be utilised only for the purpose of putting a guarantee behind a loan raised for housing purposes where large scale development was contemplated and only large scale development.  In practice that decision meant that only schemes involving not less than 200 houses would be considered.  The application on which these questions were raised was not proceeded with. Some time after, another application of the same kind was made by a company called Irish Homes, Ltd.  They applied for a guarantee for a loan to <Col N="424" /> be raised for a certain large-scale housing scheme upon which they proposed to embark.  The application was referred to the Advisory Committee and it was favourably recommended by the Advisory Committee.  It was approved by myself and, also, by the Minister for Finance, and, according to the ordinary procedure, a letter was issued to the applicants informing them that the Government were prepared to give a guarantee and they were advised to proceed forthwith with the negotiation of the loan.  The applicants proceeded to carry out various works and to make various contracts, to take options upon property and so forth.  The final step was the preparation of the debenture deed, and for this purpose certain lawyers outside were brought into consultation. Between them a difference of opinion arose as to whether there was, in fact, power to guarantee a loan for a housing scheme.  The particular point referred to was the sub-section of Section 1 of the 1924 Act, which deals with working capital.  Some of the lawyers consulted advised that there was full power under the 1924 Act to guarantee a loan for this purpose and some advised that there was not.  Under these circumstances, I consulted the Attorney-General who recommended that the safest course was to remove all doubts by the introduction of the Bill.  Although the application was under the Act of 1924 it was felt that the safest way was to amend the definition of &ldquo;manufacturing undertaking&rdquo; and extend the term manufacturing undertaking in the Act of 1933 so as to make sure that it included the matter of the erection of houses.  This Bill is made retrospective.  That is necessary because it would cause particular complication if the Bill did not have retrospective effect.  I mentioned that the people concerned had made various contracts and engagements and would have been involved in serious loss if the difficulty could not be solved.  Eventually, temporary arrangements were made to tide over the period that this Bill was passing through the Oireachtas.  It is clear, therefore, it is desirable to find the simplest way out <Col N="425" /> of the difficulty.  If the Bill were not retrospective a new application would have to be formulated and follow the usual procedure.  The Bill is, therefore, to remove doubts which were raised and which will be removed by the enactment of this measure.</P>

      <P>The Minister is working the administration of this Bill by advisory committees who consider the applications.  If he chooses he can override and upset these recommendations. Is it too much to invite the Minister to give us some indication of his policy in that direction and to tell us to what extent he has felt obliged to override his Advisory Committees? I am not speaking with any knowledge, but I think the Minister should not, in what I might call overwhelming instances, override the committee which has direct responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <P>I would like if the Minister could see his way to amplify his statement somewhat.  From the terms of the Bill many people will undoubtedly be led to believe that it is possible now to raise loans with a Government guarantee for the ordinary purpose of building houses even in a small way.  So far as the law would go there would be nothing to limit the number of houses to 200.  With reference to the term &ldquo;manufacturing undertaking,&rdquo; is it going to apply in all respects to every industry other than house building on a large scale?  The question would undoubtedly arise as to why the rate of interest charged in small manufacturing undertakings, not house building, but in regard to other commodities, would be lower than the rate at which they could be raised under the Local Loans Bill.  It would save a great deal of misconception and perhaps controversy and communications that lead to no results if the Minister would make clear at this stage what would be the position.  I am thinking now of avoiding newspaper controversy and controversy of another kind which might be anticipated if the matter could be clarified at this stage.</P>

      <P>To the question asked by Senator Sir John Keane I might <Col N="426" /> say that the usual practice is to agree with the Committee when their recommendation is the rejection of an application, and to examine their recommendation carefully when it is favourable. They can take three courses. They can recommend against; they can recommend for, and they can make no recommendation at all.  The procedure up to quite recently was that where they positively recommended against an application this recommendation was accepted and the applicants were advised accordingly, although, occasionally, we got them into the office and gave them advice how they might promote a new application.  If the Committee recommends in favour the Department may decide against the applicants, having regard to considerations that may nut concern the advisory committee at all.</P>
      <P>For example, an application might be made to me for a loan to be raised for an industry already fully catered for in the Free State.  Although a particular application might be made and there might be every prospect of success, and so on, and the Committee might be of opinion that there was no reason why this guarantee should not be given, since it was fully secured and the applicant knew his business and was likely to make a success of it, we would have to see whether it was advisable that a State guarantee should be given to a person entering into a business that was already overcrowded. In such a case, although the Committee might recommend it, we might not accept their recommendation.  As I have already said, we have appointed new Committees recently and they are particularly cautious Committees.  In the case of these Committees the procedure may be reversed.  The number of cases they will recommend will be so few that we might be inclined to pass them automatically, and those they would reject will be so multitudinous probably, that we would be inclined to send some of them back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson asked questions concerning this Bill, and I should like to say that if the Bill is passed it is, of course, quite clear that a State <Col N="427" /> guarantee may be given for a loan raised for the purpose of financing a building scheme of any kind or size. That is quite true.  I merely stated that Government policy under present circumstances would be not to utilise that power except for schemes of a particular type.  The reason for that is that adequate facilities for other housing schemes are being provided by other measures, and through a number of schemes already in operation to encourage the speculative builder to get into building activity.  The proposal would be only to use these powers where very special circumstances existed to justify their being used.  I do not think that every scheme would get a trade loan.  In fact, I think it is unlikely.  There is, however, no reason why the power to do so should not exist.  We have power to give industrial loans at the moment, but the power is not always used, because circumstances in particular cases would not justify its use.  It is advisable, however, to have the power there in case a change in circumstances would justify a change in policy.</P>
    <P>Under present circumstances the rate of interest guaranteed is 2½ per cent.  Of course, every Senator, when he hears that, may think of raising a loan at once, but in fact he would have to pay more than that; if arrears of interest accumulate and a guarantee is called upon, payment on foot of the guarantee is only made at the rate of 2½ per cent.  That is due to an arrangement, but there is power in the Bill to guarantee any rate of interest.  In fact, the rate of interest the borrower pays is the rate of interest at which he can raise a loan, having regard to the fact that he has the State behind him. Ordinarily, that varies with the bank rate.  The position under the Local Loans Fund is, of course, different.  I do not think the rate of interest, having regard to all the circumstances, is appreciably higher, but of course the loan is for a much longer period than that for which trade loans are usually got.  In any event, having regard to facilities available through the Local Loans Fund, we would not be in favour of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act regulating the allotment of land for this purpose at present in force is the Act of 1926.  That Act was passed to enable local authorities to take over land and to let it out in plots for this purpose.  Under that Act an allotment was defined as not more than a quarter of an acre, which was to be cultivated by a person mainly for the supply of vegetables for himself and his family.  Under that Act also the local authority, in taking over land, had to be satisfied that the costs would be recouped by the rents and other moneys received when the allotments were let.  As far as that Act goes, it has not worked to any great extent outside Dublin and a few other centres, one reason being, perhaps, that land is very dear around the cities, and the local authority, in taking it over and letting it out in plots, has to charge rather a high rent for working people.  The plots average about one-eighth of an acre and for that the rents average in different towns from 10/- up to about 23/-.  They have reached that figure in some of the centres.  The person working the plot has also the expense of supplying seeds, manures, and the implements or tools necessary for working the plot. We are anxious now to see that plots <Col N="429" /> can be let to the unemployed, but we realise that the unemployed could not possibly pay those rents, and neither could they provide themselves with the seeds and manures necessary.  Under the law, as I have explained it, the local authority cannot let the land at a lower rent to the unemployed and the question is, even if we gave them the powers, would they be willing to do it?</P>
      <P>In this Bill we have set out to amend the 1926 Act.  In the first place we are giving the local authority power to take over land without being satisfied that they will recoup themselves by rent or other moneys received.  Secondly, we are giving power to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to recoup local authorities for their losses in letting those plots to the unemployed at nominal rents.  In the third place, we are giving power to the Minister for Agriculture to supply these plotholders with seeds, manures, implements and spraying materials&mdash; that is, of course, in case they are let to the unemployed.  The law, as far as allotments are concerned, will remain as it is where the plots are let to people in employment.  There is no change in that respect.  The only change is concerned with plots being let to the unemployed.  If they are let to the unemployed the effect of this Bill will be that the unemployed person can get a plot for a nominal rent of, say, a shilling a year, and he will get free seeds, manures, implements and spraying materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that allotments for the unemployed is a very desirable policy, because the person who takes a plot under this arrangement has a personal interest in making the most he can possibly out of it.  It keeps him in good health and in good form.  We often hear complaints that when a person is unemployed for some time he gets out of the way of working. In fact, he is not able to work hard for some time after getting a position. If he has a plot where he is out in the open air and keeping himself fit, he is much better able to undertake employment.  In addition to that, in a position like this he is not debarred from looking for employment because his time is his own.  He can work his <Col N="430" /> plot on days when the quest for work is not necessary and, if he thinks there is a good chance of getting a job on a particular day, it is quite easy for him to knock off from work on his plot for a few hours.  Accordingly, he is not tied to his plot and he can go out and look for a job.  He is also in the position of being able to produce good, healthy food for himself and his family, which is sometimes very badly needed by the unemployed.</P>
    <P>We have had some little experience of this system already.  Last year, we got a small amount of money from the relief grant and we gave a small grant to the Dublin Plotholders' Society here.  They undertook to let 160 plots&mdash;I think that was the number &mdash;to the unemployed, and those plots were worked very well.  They were let at quite a nominal rent and the unemployed who took them over got free seeds and manures and free advice from one of our inspectors.  In the case of Cootehill also the local people got some land from a local contractor to make what use they could of it. We gave them a grant out of the relief fund to provide those people with seeds, and so on, and they also put the unemployed on these plots.  Our inspector, in charge of this particular scheme, in submitting his report at the end of last year, said that he had inspected all the plots and that they were admirably kept.  He said there was only one out of the whole number, amounting to somewhere about 160, that was neglected.  I do not think this is a Bill about which I need give further details except to answer any questions that may arise.  I would mention, however, that I undertook at a late stage of the Bill in the Dáil to have an amendment inserted in the Seanad to the effect that any regulations made under the Bill would be laid on the Table of both Houses in accordance with the usual procedure of laying regulations on the Table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this Bill for various reasons, many of which have been covered by the Minister in his recommendation of the Bill to the House.  I think, however, <Col N="431" /> that the Minister overlooked one very important aspect of the case, and it is this, that I believe that one of the greatest arguments possible in favour of this Bill is from the point of view of the education of the children of the workers in the towns and everywhere that allotments are made available. It is particularly desirable in view of the fact that there is a general back-to-the-land movement in the country at the present time.  The people everywhere are doing their best to get back to the land and anybody who is in touch with affairs in the country generally will be well aware of the fact that many applicants for land are seriously handicapped because of the fact that they have not been brought up close enough to the soil and have not the necessary knowledge to work the land if and when they are able to get holdings of their own.  It is not unusual at the present time to find the children of workers brought up even in small towns in the country in great ignorance of the ways of tilling the soil and producing the various crops.  When this Bill is passed and when it is made possible for the workers to get these allotments in the various towns it will be possible for the workers to bring their children out on the plots in the summer time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the various advantages in the way of health to the man who will be working on the plot, and apart from the amount of food produced, to the benefit of the State, and made available for the family of the allottee, I believe that appreciable educational advantages will accrue from the Bill. The children will naturally go out on the plot with their father, either to help him in the various little jobs he will have to do or to watch the work going on.  In either event, their health will benefit and they will come into close contact with the soil.  They will get to know how crops are grown and, as they grow up, they will be fitted to take their part under the policy which must be the policy, not alone of the present Government but of any future Government, to get the people back on the land in increasing numbers. When these children grow up, <Col N="432" /> with the knowledge which they cannot avoid acquiring on the allotments, they will be better fitted to go back on the land to work or to take up land as independent farmers.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out, the scheme will keep the unemployed in a fit condition for work.  If a man has nothing to do, his muscles and his mind get, more or less, out of order. There is a natural desire in every man to be doing something.  When the means are available, he will keep himself constantly employed on the land.  Apart from that, I believe that the Bill is necessary because, as a result of it, a considerable amount of extra land will be brought under cultivation which, in the ordinary course, would not be tilled at all.  It is also a commendable measure from the point of view of giving a fair chance to every individual in the country to provide for himself.  Heretofore, workmen in towns were in a very peculiar position.  Their families were dependent for food on their earnings. If anything happened by which the father was not able to provide for the family, if he were, for instance, disemployed, a serious situation arose. When this Bill is in force and when allotments are at the disposal of workers, they will feel themselves far more independent.  The worker will feel that he is able to provide a considerable portion of the food necessary for himself and his family and he will know that that food is good, wholesome food.</P>
    <P>In many towns and cities it may be possible for workers from their wages to purchase a certain amount of vegetables but, as we are all aware, the market is so regulated that the really fresh and valuable vegetables go to people other than those whom this Bill is intended to serve.  I dare say we are all aware that it is absolutely necessary for the youth of the country to be supplied with fresh vegetables. The children of well-to-do people are sure to be looked after in that regard because the income of their parents is such as to enable them to buy the best vegetables in the market.  The workman, if he buys vegetables at all, is generally thrown back on the <Col N="433" /> inferior type or on vegetables left over from the previous day.  My experience down the country is that the workman in the small town rarely, if ever, buys vegetables.  He may buy potatoes but he does not buy green vegetables.  Green vegetables are an absolute necessity.  I have been reading up some medical books lately and I find that various diseases prevalent in this country are caused, to a great extent, by lack of green vegetables. That state of affairs will no longer continue if this Bill is passed.  I am glad to see that provision is also made for the supply of seeds and manures. The Bill passed the other House without opposition.  I am glad to be associated with it and I have great pleasure in recommending it to the House.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Senator Quirke has spoken so fully on this measure.  It is a measure which shows that the Minister has a clear conception of the realities of the situation. He does not seek to make a profit out of the land.  So far as the land is concerned, he contemplates that there may be a loss.  He also realises that for the poor man out of employment to find seeds and manures is an impossibility. The Bill makes due provision to secure that unemployed people, particularly near the towns and, indeed, in the country districts also, will have a chance of work which will be remunerative to themselves and their families.  That will be the best class of employment&mdash;employment on the land.  It would be a great mistake to expect too much from this Bill. Looking at the framework of the measure, I gather that the Minister does not expect a revolution from it. The necessity of the time is to find employment.  This Bill will go a long way towards finding employment where employment is most needed and also producing, as a result of that employment, healthy food for the poor.  I think that Senator Quirke expects too much when he hopes that the son of a plotholder, who goes out to look at his father sowing cabbages, will be able to take on the management of a farm.  Senator Quirke is himself a <Col N="434" /> farmer, and he ought to know that it is an occupation that needs great skill and great experience.  We should not hope for too much, but the Bill will give us a considerable amount of relief so far as the unemployed are concerned. Of course, it is only one of a series of measures which I hope will be brought forward by this Minister and every other Minister to deal with the problem of employment.  I rise simply in order that it should not be said that a measure of the importance of this measure passed through this House in silence as if it were a measure of little consequence.  I think it is a measure of considerable consequence and of great potentiality&mdash;that it is a measure which will probably lead to others of wider scope.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is really a necessary complement of the Act of 1926, which itself was consequent on a Bill introduced in the Dáil for the same purpose in 1923 or 1924. That Bill was not accepted.  The Bill generally fits in with the Unemployment Assistance Act, and should have good effects in and around the small towns and, perhaps, also in Dublin if the local authorities rise to the occasion.  There is one point on which I should like to be reassured.  The Unemployment Assistance Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act are mentioned here as affecting the definition of &ldquo;unemployed persons.&rdquo;  It is quite possible that a successful plotholder might produce a considerable quantity of foodstuffs on his plot for the benefit of himself and his family. I want to be assured that the value of that produce will not be taken into account in assessing the income of the unemployed person for the purpose of the Unemployed Assistance Act.  I raised the matter in another way on an earlier Bill, but it may be more appropriate here.  If it is not clear that the money value of the produce from the plot is not to be taken into account in assessing the income of the plotholder, then the Act ought to be amended to ensure that that will not be done.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. Everyone knows from experience how <Col N="435" /> valuable it is to have vegetables produced on these plots.  The Bill might go further by applying in some small way to those living in towns the advantages enjoyed by cottiers in country districts.  The conditions under which allotments can be secured seem rather exacting in the Bill, because a man might be in employment when he secures an allotment but might lose that employment in a few months. Provision should be made to deal with cases of that kind.  It would appear that only those unemployed can secure allotments.  There will be some difficulty in selecting applicants.  The scope of the Bill should be extended to include people employed in small industries in country towns, especially where the hours of employment are short.  In the case of one new industry, I am aware that the hours have been curtailed to six daily.  Because people are employed in that industry they cannot avail of the advantages of this Bill. Many people of that class would be glad to have allotments on which they could work in their spare time.  I believe that this is a valuable Bill and that it will be widely availed of by the unemployed.  While I believe it will have all the advantages the Minister mentioned, I suggest that its scope should be extended in the direction I indicated.</P>

      <P>In view of some remarks made by Senators, I would like to make it plain that I regard this as more of a social one than an Agricultural Bill.  I do not think it will do a lot for agriculture, but I hope it will be useful from the social point of view. The question raised by Senator Johnson has, as a matter of fact, been under discussion between the Departments concerned, as to the value that should be assessed on the plots.  Some value will certainly be assessed, but, as Senators are aware, if the value is not as high as 2/- a week it would not matter; it will matter if the value is over 2/- weekly.</P>

      <P>The question is under discussion, and I would like to have a <Col N="436" /> little more time to discuss it with other Departments.  Senator Cummins raised the point concerning people who would only be employed for a short time.  I do not think we could go so far as to include people in regular employment, but with short hours of work.  As Senators will notice, Section 2 (1) (c) says</P>
      <P>Any other person who for the time being complies with the prescribed conditions.</P>
      <P>We must prescribe regulations. Senators realise that it would be impossible for the Bill to apply to persons who become unemployed in May or June, because the plots would have to be let in January or February or maybe earlier if they were to be properly worked.  It may happen that a person anxious to get a plot has casual employment, which he knew he would lose in a couple of weeks, with no prospect of employment after that.  I think we would be able to frame regulations to admit such persons as unemployed. On the other hand, I do not think it would be possible to include such people as those mentioned by Senator Cummins, who have short hours of employment.  If Senators put any particular case up we may consider the question of something being done, but I think it would be very difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the period within which a new building must be begun or completed in order to obtain a partial suspension of an increase in valuation under the Local Government Act, 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remissions of rates on new buildings are designed to promote employment by encouraging business enterprise. The Local Government Act of 1927 enabled a reduction of two-thirds to be made in any increased valuation for a <Col N="437" /> period of five years from the date of the increase or for the period from such date up to that in which a general revision of valuation became effective in an area, whichever was the shorter. The period originally fixed within which the new work should have been completed to enable such benefit to be secured ended on 1st October, 1930.  By an amending Act of 1930 this date was advanced to 1st October, 1933, and in view of the representations which have been received it is now proposed to extend the date to 1st October, 1938.</P>
    <P>These remissions do not apply to houses erected under the Housing Acts or the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, which are otherwise provided for, nor do they apply to cottages erected under the Labourers Acts.  The Bill contains no new principle; it merely continues the existing practice for five years longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a very desirable one.  My only criticism is that the principle involved should be a permanent one instead of being merely for five years.  I am satisfied in the case of new buildings that local authorities do not lose by their creation, and that it is in their interest to have a reduction of the rates for a reasonable period.  I understand this Bill applies to alterations of existing buildings by way of the increase in valuation which may result, and that two-thirds of the increased valuation will be remitted for five years.  That is absolutely necessary if business firms are to improve their premises.  In the case of improvements they are generally paid for in five or ten years, so that it is to the advantage of all, and makes it easier for business people to consider extensions or improvements if there is some concession made during the period when they will have to repay expenditure out of profits.  Corporations or local authorities lose nothing.  I would like to see the Government extending the scope of the Bill by making the principle a permanent one.  My principal criticism concerns the form and the shape of the Bill, and I suggest to the Minister that he might convey to the draftsman the <Col N="438" /> view that Bills of this kind, which alter other Acts, might appear in a simpler manner.  I see Senator Comyn looking at me.  He may realise that a Bill of this kind may be in the interests of his profession, but I am sure he would not support it on that ground.  After careful examination of three Acts I know that a number of people who are interested told me that they could not understand this Bill.  It would be much clearer if the sections that are being repealed were indicated.  I suggest that a hint of that kind might be given to the draftsman, so that these things would be clear to ordinary people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>When I looked at Senator Douglas it was really a look of approval, because I thoroughly agree with him that while legislation by reference was probably necessary in the state of the times, and in the press of legislation, it is not desirable.  In more leisured times the practice was to have each measure self contained, and in a sense self sufficient.  That is the idea of all legislation.  It would be best for the public, and for the lawyers also, if that ideal could be approached as nearly as possible.  Departments having so many new functions now, apparently have little time for perfect legislation, and as a result we have legislation by reference.  It is not the fault of the draftsman; it is not the fault of the Departments; it probably arises from the fact that great numbers of new Bills come before Parliament now.  If you look at the statute books they seem to be growing in bulk year by year.  Our statute book for one year now is much more bulky than the statute book for a year of the Imperial Parliament was 30 or 40 years ago. It is a curious fact, however, that the statutes which survive, like the Statute of Frauds, the Real Property Limitation Act, and measures of that kind are self contained and perfectly drawn. Therefore I thoroughly agree with Senator Douglas that, if possible, statutes should be self contained, and perfect in themselves, without reference to any other legislation, if that could be accomplished.  I emphasise the fact that the fault is not with the <Col N="439" /> draftsman.  The draftsman usually does what he is told.  A draftsman can draft anything when he is told what to draft.  So far from being displeased because a statute is perfect, lawyers are always pleased because legislation by reference causes more trouble, more inconvenience, and loss of profit than any other form of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Following upon that lead may I suggest that it is worth while repeating what has been said frequently, that Bills that are not self-explanatory should have attached to them something explaining them in every-day terms, having no legal effect, but helpful to those who will be reading them, whether legislators or the general public.  This is a Local Government (Amendment) Bill, 1934 and will appear under that title in the files and in the bound statutes. People who will come across the Bill will want to know what it means, and the time that will be wasted looking up paragraphs and sections of other Local Government Acts, which are referred to, will be infinitely greater than what would be lost by a simple statement summarising what the Minister has stated to-day.  The principle of issuing an explanatory statement, describing in simple terms the purport and intention of these Bills, will be particularly valuable in cases where there is so much legislation by reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to say, in reply, on this Bill.  One or two points were raised by Senator Douglas. His first was as to the desirability for permanency in the case of a measure of this kind.  I do not think you would get the local authorities, who are primarily concerned with the subject matter of this Bill, to agree with him that it ought to be a permanent measure.  Such has not been my experience.  At any rate, perhaps, three of the most important public authorities that will be concerned with the Bill have not been enthusiastic about it, nor have they been enthusiastic about the suggestion to extend its period.  They claim that every extension of this kind means putting a tax on other ratepayers in <Col N="440" /> their area to provide benefits for people who improve their property.  Of course, we have to bear that in mind when considering any legislation of this kind. I agree that there is a good deal to be said for the point of view of Senator Douglas: that it would be well to encourage people to put up new buildings and to improve their property, but you have to take other view points into consideration as well.</P>
      <P>With regard to the form of the Bill, I must say that I am probably responsible to a very considerable extent myself for the fact that it comes up in this shape.  I have been pressing &mdash;as one or two members of the House know who were anxious to get this Bill brought in and to get the period extended&mdash;to get that done, but I found it would be with great difficulty that I could get a new Bill through the draftsman's office.  It was only when I consented to have a very short Bill of this kind put through that I found it would be possible to do so in this session.</P>

After the words &ldquo;Jewish community of Dublin&rdquo; it is proposed to insert the words &ldquo;and holding a licence granted by a sanitary authority.&rdquo;  On the Committee Stage, Senator Counihan proposed originally to delete the licensing conditions altogether.  In doing so he had to put down amendments deleting all reference to licences issued by the sanitary authority.  He subsequently withdrew all these, with this particular exception, and he moved it under a misunderstanding. I confess that I was too much engaged with the amendments that I myself was responsible for to notice what was happening until the amendment had been carried.  It is necessary to re-insert the words in the amendment.  It is the intention that Jewish butchers shall apply for a licence from the sanitary authority. Their qualification for the licence will be the certificate which they will get from the Jewish authorities.  Senators will notice that sub-section (6) of Section 3 lays down: &ldquo;The provisions of this section shall apply to any licence granted by the sanitary authority for the purpose of the provisions of this Act with regard to the Jewish and Mohammedan methods of slaughter.&rdquo; It is necessary that the words in the amendment should be inserted, and I move accordingly.</P>

Although he may do that regularly still he only slaughters animals to a small extent. I am anxious to know if the farmer's premises would be regarded as a slaughterhouse under the provisions of the Act, and whether a gun, which is a perfectly satisfactory and humane instrument for the purpose of killing animals, would be sanctioned for the purpose?  It would be rather hard on people to have to get a special instrument and keep special cartridges for the purpose of slaughtering animals, when the thing could be quite satisfactorily done with an ordinary shot-gun and be absolutely painless.</P>

Of course, if the person concerned had not got a shot-gun already it would be much cheaper for him to buy a mechanical killer, the cartridges for which only cost one halfpenny each.  They are much cheaper than the ordinary shot-gun cartridges. There is nothing to prevent the Minister specifying a gun as a &ldquo;mechanically operated instrument.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>This is rather a peculiar amendment. It is to insert the word &ldquo;hinny&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;mule.&rdquo;  I do not know whether anyone here heard of an <Col N="447" /> animal known as a hinny.  The animal is popularly known as the jennet, but in the standard dictionaries, including the New Oxford Dictionary, jennet is defined as a small Spanish horse. Chambers' <i>Twentieth Century Dictionary</i> describes a jennet in exactly similar terms.  What is known as the jennet here in this country is not known as such in any dictionary and will, therefore, not be protected.  The &ldquo;hinny&rdquo; is described as the offspring of the she-ass and a stallion, and the &ldquo;mule&rdquo; is described as the offspring of a he-ass and a mare.  They are two distinct species and should be mentioned separately.  They are not mentioned separately in Northern Ireland or in Britain, but that is no reason why they should not be mentioned here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10.  To delete the section <Col N="448" /> and to substitute the following new section therefor:&mdash;</P>
    <P>10.&mdash;The provisions of this Act shall not apply to any person engaged in the slaughter of sheep, ewes, wethers, rams, lambs, goats or kids for the purpose of the flesh being used as butcher's meat who does not slaughter for that purpose any other animals (as defined by this Act) and whose principal or only occupation is not that of a butcher.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to delete a section inserted on the Committee Stage, and to insert the words on the Order Paper. The original amendment was moved by Senator Counihan and accepted by me in order to meet the case of a farmer who for the time being owing to economic circumstances did some butchering.  The amendment when first drafted was not sufficient to cover the object intended.  I am advised that the amendment I am now moving covered all the cases mentioned by Senator Counihan and the experts who advised in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator O'Farrell is advised in this matter it would be quite wrong for me to raise objections but I think this section is defective inasmuch as there is no definition of &ldquo;butcher&rdquo; in the Bill.  Probably, I think, through inadvertence that matter has not been considered.  For that reason I think Senators Counihan and O'Farrell ought to reconsider this section.  Of course, it is quite obvious to any ordinary person that the word &ldquo;butcher&rdquo; has a certain meaning, but when you come to deal with legislation for people who are particularly interested objections will be raised and these objections will have to be met.  I think when the section was being drafted probably the draftsman did not advert to the fact that the definition section in the beginning of the Bill does not include the definition of a &ldquo;butcher.&rdquo;  For that reason I think this section is wrong and will not be found to be workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point put by Senator Comyn would be a very important one were it not for the fact that &ldquo;butcher&rdquo; is already defined.  The Senator knows that words already <Col N="449" /> defined in law could not be defined in the Bill.  Again, if he refers to Stroud's <i>Judicial Dictionary</i> he will find the definition of the word &ldquo;butcher.&rdquo;  In the case of Cleaver <i>v.</i> Bacon (4 Times Rep. 27) Kekewich J. cited from the Imperial Dictionary the definition of &ldquo;butcher&rdquo; as &ldquo;one who slaughters animals for market or one whose occupation is to kill animals for the table&rdquo;.  That is the definition in Stroud's <i>Judicial Dictionary</i>, which is an authority on words and phrases judicially interpreted. It is hard, of course, to remember everything and I think Senator Comyn would not have raised this point if he had that before his mind.  I am sure this definition is enough and that is the reason why no definition was put into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>A definition from Stroud's <i>Judicial Dictionary</i>, which is a work of considerable authority, would be very well for an argument in the court of justice.  What I want is a statutory definition of the word &ldquo;butcher&rdquo; now when you are dealing with the slaughter of animals&mdash;a definition that cannot be the subject of argument.  I would remind Senator O'Farrell that Stroud is not exhaustive. The English decision he referred to is probably old and related to a stage of society different from what exists at the present time, where people, in consequence of conditions prevailing, may be one time farmers and at another time anxious to kill sheep.  The Standard Dictionary defines what a butcher is.  There can be difference of opinion as to what comes within that definition, but as this is a statute which emanates from the Seanad I hope it will pass through the Dáil without amendment, and it should, therefore, be a statute as precise as we can make it.  Now that the point has been raised, I think it ought to be met by a definition emanating from the authority of this Parliament and not something drawn from what some learned judge said a hundred years ago in England. I do not make this point to create discussion or debate, but to help Senator O'Farrell, who has gone to very great trouble in making this Bill as workable as possible.  I hope he will <Col N="450" /> take my observations on this matter in the way they are meant.</P>

I can assure Senator Comyn that I do not take his remarks as being uttered in any cavilling or captious manner, I take them as made in a perfectly sincere way.  I am sure the amendment is quite sufficient to cover the definition of &ldquo;butcher,&rdquo; and that being so I prefer that the House should accept my amendment now and, if there is any doubt on the matter, it can be gone into and considered in the other House.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of privilege raised by Senator Miss Browne earlier in our proceedings to-day, the Minister for Defence was <Col N="451" /> informed that his presence here was desirable.  He has not attended, however, though I have this moment received a communication from him; and so the matter must be dealt with in his absence.  According to what Senator Miss Browne stated, she brought two friends to the gate at Kildare Street this afternoon, having previously obtained tickets of admission for them for the Visitors' Gallery of this House; but they were refused admission by the Military, who stated that they were acting under orders.  I can only assume that such orders, if given, were given by the Minister for Defence.  If Senator Miss Browne's facts are correct, a breach of the privileges of this House has undoubtedly been committed, and, if my assumption is correct, the person who has committed such breach is the Minister for Defence.  Before reading what the Minister has to say in the matter, I propose to state both the constitutional position and the facts so far as they are known to me, and I shall do so at some length in view of what I conceive to be a challenge to my authority.</P>
      <P>As regards the constitutional position, Article 20 of the Constitution provides that each House of the Oireachtas shall make its own Rules and Standing Orders, with power to attach penalties for their infringement.  Article 25 of the Constitution provides that sittings of each House of the Oireachtas shall be public.  Standing Order No. 70 of the Standing Orders of the Seanad, which was made pursuant to these Articles, provides that visitors may be introduced by Senators to such places as may be reserved for them by me and upon such conditions as I may prescribe. It follows, therefore, that no Minister of State and no other person whatever, has power to debar from access to the Visitors' Gallery of this Chamber, which is the place reserved for them by me, visitors duly introduced by Senators who comply with such conditions as I may prescribe. Anyone who so debars them, or attempts so to debar them, commits a breach of privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> Coming to the facts in the present case, I received some days ago a letter from Senator Miss Browne, in which she stated that she proposed to bring two visitors wearing blue shirts to the Visitors' Gallery, and, quite properly, she requested my permission beforehand. Before giving her permission, I made inquiry as to the practice in the other House so as to acquire a full knowledge of the facts before intimating my decision.  So far as I understand, a verbal order was given some months ago by the Minister for Defence to the Superintendent of the Oireachtas that persons wearing blue shirts were not to be admitted to Leinster House, on the ground that such persons are dangerous.  Subsequently, an order was given by the Ceann Comhairle in the same sense to the same official, again verbally.</P>
    <P>I say nothing as to the propriety of such an order from the Minister for Defence.  As regards the order of the Ceann Comhairle, it will hardly be controverted that such an order, made by him solely, is valid only so far as concerns the House to which he is responsible, and cannot possibly operate to debar duly authorised visitors from access to the Visitors' Gallery of this Chamber.  I may say, in passing, that though this order is said to have been made some months ago no intimation of it whatever was conveyed to me, and I had, in fact, no knowledge of it until I made inquiries consequent on the letter of Senator Miss Browne.</P>
    <P>It devolved upon me to decide whether the wearing of a blue shirt was a sufficient reason for depriving a person of his undoubted right, under Article 25 of the Constitution, to be present at a meeting of this House of the Oireachtas; and all I had to go upon was the verbal ruling made by the Ceann Comhairle that such persons were debarred from the Public Galleries of the other House on the ground that persons wearing blue shirts are dangerous.  I thought the matter over deeply, and, as is well known, I am quite impartial in politics.  I found that I could not in conscience agree with the view that the mere wearing of a blue shirt is <Col N="453" /> evidence that a person is dangerous; and, as I could find no other valid reason for discriminating against such persons, I gave Senator Miss Browne the permission she requested and directed two tickets of admission to be given to her for the two visitors in question.</P>
    <P>In order that there should be no element of discourtesy on my side in the matter, I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle apprising him of my decision and of the reason for it.  Further, I assumed that the duty of supervising the arrangements for the admission of visitors outside the entrance gates of the Oireachtas premises lay with the Gárda Síochána and not with the military; and so yesterday afternoon I telephoned to the Minister for Justice and told him personally that I had given instructions that Senator Miss Browne's visitors were to be admitted.  He replied that he would telephone this information to the Minister for Defence.  I profoundly hope that the occurrence at the gate to-day was not the direct result of an order given by the Minister for Defence subsequent to, and with knowledge of, my action.  The Minister has not seen fit to be present, but he has sent me the following letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>A Chara,&mdash;I understand that the question of the admission of persons dressed in blue uniform shirts has been raised in the Seanad to-day. In reference to this matter I enclose herewith a copy of a letter I sent to the Ceann Comhairle on the 20th July, 1933.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Is mise,</P>

    <P Just="Right">Aire Cosannta.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the enclosure&mdash;addressed to the Ceann Comhairle, mark!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An Ceann Comhairle,&mdash;As Minister responsible for the protection of Government Buildings and Leinster House I have reason to believe that it is necessary in order to carry out such protection adequately that all persons, other than members of the Dáil and Seanad, wearing the blue uniform shirt of the organisation <Col N="454" /> known as the A.C.A. be prohibited entry to those buildings.  I am accordingly about to issue instructions to the military guard that all persons so attired be not permitted to enter Leinster House or Government Buildings and I request your co-operation in the effective carrying out of the order.</P>

    <P Just="Right">FRANK AIKEN,</P>

    <P>This makes it quite clear that a breach of privilege has been committed by the Minister.  Fortunately, there are ways and means, and very definite ways and means, of upholding and enforcing the privileges of this House. I suggest that a notice of motion be tabled for next Wednesday that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges do forthwith consider the matter and report back to the House for appropriate action to be taken.  This motion, if tabled, will appear first on the Order Paper.  I ask the House to agree to that course.  There is not a shadow of doubt that the privileges of this House have been outraged. Egress and ingress to our House&mdash;an essential part of the Oireachtas&mdash;have been prevented and so I feel very strongly that strong and active measures must be taken to protect the privileges and rights of this House.</P>
