      <P>On last Saturday, Sir, I handed in the following notice of motion for next Wednesday:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that a grave miscarriage of justice has occurred in the case of Captain P. Hughes sentenced on 1st instant by the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal to two years' imprisonment and requests the Government in pursuance of their powers under the Constitution Amendment Act No. 17 to order his immediate release.</P>
      <P>Last night a decision was taken to initiate legal proceedings in this case. Therefore, by next Wednesday the matter, probably, will be <i>sub judice.</i> Accordingly, I ask leave of the House to withdraw the motion.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  A Chathaoirligh, in April last the Seanad put in an amendment to the annual Army Bill limiting its operation until the 31st July of this year.  Senator Blythe's plea on that occasion was for the introduction of an amending Bill to the present Army Act. I informed the House then that the Department of Defence was preparing that Bill.  The Bill has left the Department of Defence but it will not be introduced here or into the Dáil for at least another six months owing to the pressure of other business.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was under discussion on the last occasion, in April, the Minister for Defence made a statement that on every committee or sluagh of the new Volunteer force in Ireland there were members of the Opposition Party&mdash;of Fine Gael.  I have absolute proof that that statement was not true.  I should like to ask the Minister to state if on any one of these committees in Wexford there is a single person who is not an ardent adherent of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I should like also to call his attention to the fact that the area officer of this force in Wexford has constantly attended political meetings&mdash;meetings of Fianna Fáil.  I have a number of cuttings from local papers to prove that on one occasion this man attended a meeting of the I.R.A.  It was a memorial meeting or something of that kind.  The speeches made there on that occasion were violently opposed to all constitutional government even to the present Government.  A person of strong and openly Communistic ideas at that meeting denounced the President of the Executive Council, the <Col N="1531" /> Government, and of course, all of us of the Opposition.  This area officer, who is now an officer of the regular Army, attended that meeting.  He did not speak, but nevertheless he gave approval of everything that was said by his presence there.</P>
      <P>The volunteers themselves, as I have proof, have attended political meetings. Notices such as this have appeared in the local papers where a Fianna Fáil meeting was held and where a large number of the new Volunteer force in uniform attended the meetings.  I have some cuttings here giving an account of that.  Two weeks ago a volunteer in uniform was summoned to attend the District Court in Enniscorthy on a charge of riotous behaviour at a Fine Gael meeting there on the 28th April.  He failed to appear in the court and no warrant has since been issued for his arrest.  I should like to know from the Minister whether or not it is intended to issue a warrant as is usual in such cases.  I should like the Minister also to tell us whether any reference is required from the Guards or the clergy, or from any of the people who usually give references, as to the character of these men who are being taken into this force.  A case occurred in Dublin quite recently where a member of this force was prosecuted for neglecting his wife and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. It came out, during the progress of the case, that he had previously served a sentence of penal servitude.  We have been told that in future officers of the regular Army are to be chosen from this Volunteer force.  We can only say: &ldquo;Heaven help us from the Army in future if people of this kind are to be chosen in the future.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was up for discussion about four months ago I put down certain amendments which you, Sir, ruled out of order, largely, as I think, on the ground that very little notice had been given and very big issues were involved.  Having ruled them out, you gave me permission to move without notice a motion to make the period of continuance only four months instead of the 12 months asked <Col N="1532" /> for.  At the end of the four months we have the Bill back in its original form and no attempt now made, as I think can be inferred from the whole proceedings, to meet the wish of the Seanad that something should be done to ensure that men were not commissioned in the Army as officers who were without military training and who had no qualifications except the qualifications of a certain record in the past &mdash;which ought to be a disqualification &mdash;and of certain political views.  I think it would be much more satisfactory if any amendments to a Bill of this sort were introduced by the Minister.  He has opportunities of having them drafted, and of having every aspect of a proposed amendment considered, that ordinary members of the Seanad have not.  As he has not seen fit, however, to deal with this problem in any way, I intend to put down again for your consideration, Sir, the amendments I had on the last occasion with, perhaps, one or two additional sections to cover points which I did not clearly see at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that it is a most undesirable thing that we should have this militia force, which is being formed, given deliberately by the Government, in spite of certain protestations, a political bias.  I do not say that there is no attempt to get in people of different points of view from the Government, but the mere fact that admission to the force must be through these specially commissioned officers&mdash;and they, apparently, are going to have the decision of who are to be the officers in the force&mdash;means, of necessity, that they will have a political bias.  That, undoubtedly, has operated on the minds of the men who have been recruited.  For instance, there was an attack on a Blueshirt in O'Connell Street a few months ago where the man was set upon and beaten by the crowd, and two men in the uniform of this force were in the crowd.  Of course that sort of misbehaviour by individuals might occur anywhere, but it is a very serious thing to have this sort of force growing up.  No additional officers of this sort have been commissioned since some time before March, but, of <Col N="1533" /> course, the Bill had only four months left.  I can tell the Minister that all sorts of rumours have been going around that more of these officers are going to be commissioned, and commissioned to the high ranks.  That is a disturbing factor.</P>
    <P>It is particularly necessary, in view of the fact that the officer personnel of the Army furnishes the members of the Military Tribunal, that there should not be the opportunities of pressure which the present state of the law gives.  It is particularly necessary that that should not remain in the hands of the Government.  I think it should not be possible for men to think that not only may they be removed from their posts, but that men from outside with no military experience may be brought in to replace them&mdash;political partisans to replace them&mdash;and that perhaps that policy of replacement by men with no military qualifications may be carried very far.  I think, therefore, that not only should the bringing of men without training be stopped, but some assurance should be given against the arbitrary dismissal of the men with training already there.  There is a general feeling that there is some extraordinary system of pressure being exerted to break down the morale of some officers who are charged with heavy and delicate responsibilities. Therefore, I think that the Seanad must give a Second Reading to the Bill, but I do not think the Seanad ought to continue the existing body of legislation without any amendment, having regard to the circumstances of the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>You have allowed&mdash;I do not say improperly&mdash;Senator Blythe to make a number of peculiar statements. To my mind, the Seanad was very wrong on the last occasion when it refused to pass this Bill as introduced. As Senators are aware, it is entitled the &ldquo;Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1934,&rdquo; and its object is to continue the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1923.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>To 1934.  My personal inclination is towards an annual Army Act.  The law regulating discipline in the Army was so limited in these countries more than 200 years ago for a specific purpose&mdash;to prevent the monarch from having a permanent army and governing without the consent of Parliament.  Parliament insisted that the Army Act should be brought before them once a year.  I think that that was a wise provision. In the years since the Act of 1923 was passed a Bill for its renewal has been brought annually into the Oireachtas and passed as a matter of course. About a month ago the usual Bill came before the Seanad.  Senators made it the subject of controversy and some very sinister suggestions were made.  Senators did a thing then which, I say respectfully, was very unwise.  They refused to pass the Army Bill as introduced.  They introduced an amendment limiting its operation to four months.  If the Executive had not been more prudent than the Seanad discipline in the Army would have been broken.  The Army would have been disrupted and a state of revolution would have been precipitated.  As long as I have been here, I have endeavoured to uphold the reputation of this great Assembly of sensible men.  The action of the Seanad on that occasion will, I think, be judged as the main ground of any complaint which may be hereafter made against it.  It certainly operated most in my mind and it would operate most in the mind of any person whose business it is to be thoroughly conversant with the constitutional history not merely of this country but of the other countries of Northern and NorthWestern Europe.  I think that what the Seanad did on that occasion was a very serious thing.  I have to congratulate the Ministry on accepting the amendment which was proposed by Senator Blythe and passed by this House limiting the duration of the Bill to four months.  It was a humiliation to the Ministry.  It would be a humiliation to any Ministry.  It was unprecedented in the course of 250 years.</P>

      <P>I sat down to give Senator Gogarty an opportunity to speak.  He had no joke ready. Senator Blythe says that he intends to introduce a number of amendments to this Bill.  No man in this House understands the effect of his amendments better than Senator Blythe does.  He was responsible for the action of the Seanad in regard to the last Army Bill.  He was also responsible for the action of the House in regard to another measure.  He is probably responsible, to a great extent, for the measure which was debated in this House last week.  He is, certainly, responsible for what he himself said. Let me read the last sentence in the speech of Senator Blythe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it relevant to the Defence Forces Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  Senator Blythe said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not to get rid of something that the Government believes to be useless but it is simply an effort to gather all power into the hands of the people who were defeated in their attempt to override by force the majority will in 1922-23 and who, I believe, were mistakenly let go unpunished at that time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that that is the spirit in which Senator Blythe has spoken on the present occasion and in which he has made the suggestions he has made. He says that there are rumours floating about the city.  Rumours of what? Are you to act on the mere statement of a new Senator that rumours are floating about the city?  He also says that attempts have been made to break down the morale of honourable gentlemen. I wonder if that has any reference <Col N="1536" /> to the motion which he was to have before the House to-day and which he has very prudently withdrawn. Who are the men in respect of whom an attempt has been made to undermine their morale?  Are they the members of the Military Trimunal?  I have been opposed to the establishment of a military tribunal or of military rule.  I think that it is unwise and I hope that to my dying day I shall be opposed to military tribunals and always stand for civil liberty.  But I am bound to say that I have appeared as an advocate before military tribunals and I find that the gentlemen who compose these tribunals are gentlemen of integrity.  That does not diminish my unaltered and unalterable opposition to these tribunals. So far as I can judge from newspaper reports of proceedings in cases in which I myself did not appear, the findings of the Military Tribunal have been consistent. Whatever may appear from a casual reading of the judgement of the Military Tribunal in the case which was to be brought before this House, it will be found on examination that that verdict and finding was quite consistent and quite just.  Therefore, Senator Blythe has no reason whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing the Military Tribunal at present and I ask the Senator to desist from reference to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Blythe has no reason whatever, on the Second Reading of this Bill, for making the suggestion that honourable men are being corrupted, or that their morale is being undermined.  He has no reason whatever for stating that the new Volunteer force is being officered by men who are unworthy to be officers of that Volunteer force.  He is making suggestions without any proof&mdash;suggestions which are very dangerous in the circumstances of the time.  I am greatly surprised that a Senator of his experience, of his knowledge of affairs and of his ability should go forward in this way, adding fuel to the flame in very difficult and dangerous times.  I hope that when his amendments come forward they will be <Col N="1537" /> rejected by this House.  I have the greatest faith in the prudence and good sense of this House and I should not have spoken on the present occasion if it were not that I could not allow to go uncontradicted the suggestion that the morale of gentlemen of integrity was being undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Blythe is certainly an adept at innuendo.  So far as the innuendo, that pressure was brought to bear upon members of the Military Tribunal to bring in a certain verdict in a certain case, reflects upon the Government, it does not affect them in the slightest.  In so far as that innuendo reflects upon the behaviour of the Government, it only discovers Senator Blythe to the country, showing what he would attempt to do in similar circumstances.  In so far as it reflects upon the honour of the four or five officers of the Army, I think that innuendo is most contemptible and unworthy.  The gentlemen who are members of that Tribunal do not require any defence from me. But I certainly think it was a scandalous insinuation or innuendo for Senator Blythe to make.  Senator Blythe has talked about rumours going around the city.  I think Senator Blythe is the principal source of a great number of rumours that have started in this country for a number of years.  However, the people of the country know that the Government are endeavouring to act in a straightforward and honourable fashion, and they do not pay much heed to Senator Blythe's rumours.  A certain number of people will, of course, be always affected by them, but I do not think that the majority of the people of the country will ever again be affected by them.  Senator Blythe rebukes me for not having made provision for the introduction of a permanent Bill at the end of four months.  I have already informed the House that so far as the Department of Defence is concerned, it is finished with the permanent Army Bill, which, I hope, will be introduced as quickly as the other Departments concerned can deal with it.  Owing to the pressure of other Government <Col N="1538" /> business, it has been found impossible to have it dealt with and introduced.</P>
      <P>Regarding certain allegations made by another Senator, I wish to say this: that if a volunteer is found to be guilty of any scandalous behaviour, or if he is tried and found guilty in the civil courts of a criminal offence he will be immediately dismissed.  It is impossible to ensure, when a large number of men are recruited, that every one of them is up to the standard required.  About 19,000 volunteers applied for admission to the volunteers within the last few months. It may happen that an odd one will get through who will bring no credit to the volunteers, but if it is discovered that any of them act in a way that will not bring credit on the volunteers or on the country, I promise that they will be immediately dismissed.  One volunteer has been so dismissed already.</P>
      <P>I think there is no necessity for me to go into, or combat, at the moment the amendments which Senator Blythe introduced to the last Army Bill.  I hope that upon second thoughts he will refrain from putting in the amendments which he introduced on the last occasion.  It is altogether unprecedented that amendments to the Army Bill, or to any other annual Act, should be introduced except by the Government.  However, if he insists on going ahead with the amendments they can be debated when they come up on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Title>Fisheries (Tidal Waters) Bill, 1934&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is very clearly set out in the Long Title, namely, &ldquo;To make provision for the regulation and control of the public right of fishery in tidal waters in which formerly a several or exclusive fishery was believed to exist, and was enjoyed as of right, and to make provision for other matters relating to or connected with the matters aforesaid.&rdquo;  Senators are aware that some time ago, according to a court decision, the tidal waters of the River Erne which were believed by certain people to be owned by them were declared to be a public fishery.  As a result of that decision the public have a right to fish there. <Col N="1540" /> It has been found necessary to bring in this Bill in order to regulate those fisheries as well as to provide an income for the conservators to protect the River Erne or other rivers that may come under that decision either as a result of further litigation or because of their surrender by the present owners due to that decision. Provision is also made in the Bill so that certain arrangements may be entered into between the conservators on the Free State side of the Border and on the Northern Ireland side of the Border.</P>
      <P>I think the Bill can best be explained by referring to its sections. Section 2 of the Bill provides that this Bill can be applied to any tidal waters which were believed to have been privately owned but are now declared to be a public fishery.  As the law stands, any person proposing to fish for salmon or for trout with a net must purchase a licence from the local board of conservators.</P>
      <P>He must pay the appropriate licence for the particular class of fishing that he is about to engage in.  These licences provide part of the income of the board of conservators.  In addition, in the case of a fishery like the River Erne&mdash;the same applies, of course, to other fisheries&mdash;there are rates levied on the value of fisheries privately owned.  These rates also go to the board of conservators and provide them with part of their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the two principal sources of income that the conservators had. Out of that income they have been able, up to this, to protect the fisheries. The amount of rates received from private owners was considerable.  Out of that income, received from the sources I have indicated, the conservators were not only able to protect the River Erne but also some of the smaller rivers which came under their jurisdiction.  Now that the private ownership has been removed from the River Erne, the board of conservators is left very badly off, so that some provision has to be made to supplement their income in addition to what they get from ordinary licences.  That is necessary so that they will have the funds required to protect the fisheries under their control.  Under Section 4, <Col N="1541" /> instead of the licence that would be applied for on an ordinary river, we are substituting what is called a special local licence.  Senators may find it difficult to understand the method by which we are trying to get the amount necessary for the conservators through those special local licences.  If we estimate, for instance, that £600 will be required in the case of the River Erne for the conservators, and take it that 12 boats would be likely to apply, then, in that case, we would make the special local licence £50 for each boat for a full year.  In that way we try to arrive, if possible, at a sufficient income for the board of conservators.  The amount of the special local licences will vary according to the type of fishery, according to the district, the river or the tidal waters concerned.  I am taking the River Erne as an example because this Bill does not apply to that river only. The River Erne, however, is the first river that will be dealt with under the Bill, but this measure may apply to other rivers as well.  In the case of the River Erne I would like to mention that the conservators will require rather a larger income than they had when the private ownership existed because the private owners did a certain amount of protection themselves apart altogether from what was done by the conservators.  In the future the conservators, in addition to carrying on the protection that they were in the habit of giving up to this, will have to take the place of the private owners so far as giving protection is concerned.  Sections 5 and 6 simply provide the machinery for the issue of special local licences.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides penalties for fishing in tidal waters by unauthorised persons.  Section 8 provides for the making by the Minister of regulations settling the time and the hours at which the different boats may fish; the number of boats which may be allowed to fish at the one time and so on.  We were not sure on the 1st May how these fisheries would be regulated.  In the case of other tidal waters around the coast, the fishermen make certain regulations of their own as it were.  There is a sort of tradition <Col N="1542" /> among them as to how the fishery should be regulated; who should fish first; what hours they should fish; the number of boats that might go out at one time and so on.  But here we had the possibility of boats coming from any part of the coast and in all probability coming long distances to fish in these public waters in which there was a great reputation, at any rate, for salmon.  We could not be sure whether these men would agree to regulate the time of fishing among themselves, or whether there would not be a certain amount of trouble amongst them.  At any rate, we thought it well to have power to regulate the fisheries in such cases.  If things go smoothly the Department of Fisheries would not be inclined to interfere at all.</P>
    <P>Section 9 contains the usual clause empowering a duly authorised officer to demand of any person fishing in such tidal waters the production of his special local licence, and for a penalty in case he does not respond.  Section 10 provides for the making of regulations. Section 11 provides that, in addition to other penalties, the holder of a special local licence convicted of an offence under the Fishery Acts may have such special local licence forfeited. Section 12 confers on the holder of a special local licence the same voting power as if he held an ordinary licence.  It does not take from the holder of the special local licence any of the privileges given him, but gives him no privilege that he would not have when holding an ordinary licence.  Section 13 provides that the conservators will pay to the Minister the difference between the ordinary licence and the special local licence.  Section 14 enables the Minister to pay the conservators whatever they may be short, or whatever deficiency he considers reasonable, as put up by them in their income in relation to the ordinary licence.  Sections 13 and 14 might appear rather cumbersome and unnecessary, because Senators might be inclined to ask: &ldquo;Why not let the conservators collect the special local licences and let the Minister keep out?&rdquo;  It is thought that it would be almost impossible to <Col N="1543" /> strike at the beginning of the year an estimate of what the special local licence would amount to.  It is better that the conservators should have a regular income and that if there is anything over it would go to the Exchequer, or if there was anything short, the Exchequer should stand the deficiency.  As far as possible, taking it on the whole, the Department does not intend to make any profit out of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with a situation to which I have already referred, the case of rivers where the source might be in Northern Ireland and the outlet in the Free State.  It is very important that there should be an understanding between the conservators at each side of the Border, because salmon going to spawn inside the territory of Northern Ireland will need protection from poaching, and the conservators on that side of the Border might very well say that it was no concern of theirs because they got nothing out of it.  In such a case it is made possible for the conservators on the Free State side to contribute a certain amount to the conservators on the Northern Ireland side, to help them to protect the waters.  That was provided for in another way in the past.  The conservators on the Free State side of the border of the Erne had no power to make contributions to the conservators in Northern Ireland, but the owners of the River Erne did contribute to the conservators on the Northern Ireland side.  It is to make up for that that this clause has been introduced.  Section 17 is self-explanatory. Section 18 limits the duration of the Act to two years, roughly, to the end of December, 1935. It is hoped by that time to have a more comprehensive Bill to deal with inland fisheries as a whole, as a result of a report expected from the Commission now sitting dealing with fisheries.  The Seanad may take it, therefore, that this is a temporary Bill to meet an emergency.  As far as possible we are trying to avoid entering into any controversy, or getting up against any big principle, such as State ownership or private ownership.  We have tried to leave things as they are, <Col N="1544" /> and to deal with the regulation of things as they are until the Commission on Inland Fisheries has reported.</P>

      <P>I am glad this Bill is in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture, and I am sure he will act reasonably in regard to all the interests concerned. I see that in addition to the persons who, for a number of years, enjoyed as a fact the several fishery on the Erne he contemplates that there might be a great number of other people who enjoyed as a matter of fact the several fisheries in other rivers, and who may be inclined to surrender them in view of the decision given in the Lough Erne case.  The Minister is wise in not entering into any controversial matters in the measure now before the House, which, as he says, is an emergency measure, to deal with the special circumstances arising from the decision given in the Lough Erne case.  The fishermen who contested the right of private owners in that case imagined that they were contesting for their own benefit when, in point of fact, they were making a case, not merely for themselves but for the public throughout Ireland.  The same thing would apply, of course, in the case of all other rivers, in respect of which there was not a title going back beyond legal memory.  I hope when the more comprehensive measures come forward that some plan will be devised, whereby some compensation might be given to people who have enjoyed in fact exclusive rights of fisheries, although in view of the decision they may not be entitled to that enjoyment as of right.  I think the result of a generous gesture on the part of the Government would be that, perhaps, a great number of several fisheries, which are now enjoyed in fact, though the right to enjoyment might be doubtful, would be surrendered to the State, and that a more comprehensive scheme for the regulation of inland fisheries might be rendered possible.  In view of that consideration, I am glad the matter is in the hands of the present Minister, because I am sure he will be reasonable and, as far as he can, will be fair to every interest concerned.</P>

I would like to know what constitutes a right, if that does not, where the property was in their possession for 150 years, was paid for but is now to be taken without any compensation. That is a serious matter.  Does the Minister stand for absolute confiscation of property without any compensation? I am glad at the introduction of this Bill, as a whole.  I am interested in fisheries, but I want to see that there will be no irregularities or inconvenience caused to people with their rights established.  It seems to me that these rights are to be taken without compensation.  It is an exceedingly dangerous principle if property of any kind can be confiscated without compensation. Another matter that is disturbing the public mind is the Commission that was constituted by the Government to inquire into the inland fisheries.</P>

For the honour of the country the Government should not allow everyone to say that they stand for confiscation of fisheries, land or anything else.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a difficult one to understand.  It is based largely on the result of the Erne fisheries case, which has been going on for several years, and on which a decision was only pronounced recently.  That case dealt with a fishery over which there were supposed to be people with rights extending over a long period, I believe some centuries, and the court decided against the individuals who considered themselves to be the owners and gave public rights over the river. From the remarks made by the Minister it would appear that the Government was anxious to take over, or rather to claim rights over, the tidal waters of the rivers of Ireland.  When one comes to think of it that is a very large question.  Ireland is blessed with a great number of rivers, nearly all of them fishing rivers, and, as far as I am aware, practically all of them have fishing rights.  That being so, is it the intention of the Government under Section 2 to take over jurisdiction on all these rivers, without any judicial decision?  There was a judicial decision in the Erne case which was argued at great length.  Is it the intention of the Government to step in now, on the strength of the Erne decision, to introduce regulations for the control of private property, which is undoubtedly the position in which these fisheries in tidal waters are?  It is, to my mind, very difficult to ascertain for certain that that is the intention of the Government, and I should like the Minister to tell us if it is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again the Minister speaks of conservators of fisheries and says that they require additional funds which, I am sure, is quite correct. The funds that he asked for are mainly in connection with the Erne <Col N="1547" /> fishery.  If the other fisheries throughout the country are to be taken over and declared public property, as the Erne fishery has been, the conservators will require a very large sum of money to enable them to control them as they should be controlled.  A case was made as I believe by the Minister, only for the Erne, but there are hundreds of rivers, tidal waters, all along the coasts of Ireland.  If these rivers are to be properly looked after by the conservators, it will mean a very large expenditure and there is no provision in the Bill, so far as I understand it, for that.  No doubt, as the Minister has told us, this is merely a Bill for one year.  It is provisional and a much larger Bill will be introduced later on.  Possibly in that larger Bill all these points will be finally and properly settled, but in the meantime I think it is important that we should know whether it is the intention of the Government to take over all the tidal waters and to manage and control them in the same way as the waters of the Erne will now be controlled as a result of the judicial decision.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Guinness has completely misunderstood the intention of the Bill.  As I understand it, the intention of the Bill is to achieve in effect what he wishes to have done.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point with which the Minister has dealt, but I should like an amplification of it.  It has reference to Sections 13 and 14 in regard to the financing of the board of conservators.  Is there any check upon the amount of money which that board may spend inasmuch as Section 14 throws upon the Minister an obligation to make up the difference between what he expends and what he receives? I do not think that under this Bill, though perhaps there may be under some other Act, there is a check upon the amount the conservators may expend.  If there is not, this Bill seems to give to the conservators a free hand and an assurance that the Minister will make up the difference between what is received and what is spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Guinness, Senator Johnson is quite right.  This Bill can only apply, first of all, where a public right of fishery was claimed for at least 20 years before 1st January, 1933, and where since 1st January, 1933, either it has been determined in a competent court of jurisdiction that that right does not exist, or where the person claiming it has surrendered his rights.  The question has been asked who would be likely to surrender his rights.  As a matter of fact, there is one such case, the River Ownee, in County Donegal.  That river was owned by the Department of Fisheries and the Department took the court decision in the Erne case as governing the legal position of the Donegal rivers and immediately surrendered the ownership of that river.  That is the only case that I know of where a public right was actually surrendered. If we did not have this Bill, and any owner did come along to surrender his rights, we might be put to the trouble of saying to that person: &ldquo;We will have to bring you to court first before we can take it over.  We will have to have the matter determined in court.&rdquo; It is to avoid the necessity of doing that that clause (b), sub-section (1), is <Col N="1549" /> inserted.  We cannot interfere with tidal waters except in such cases, or where a court decision is given as in the case of the River Erne.</P>
      <P>Senator Miss Browne raised a point about compensation for those who enjoyed the fishery rights.  As I explained in introducing the Bill, it was such questions we tried to avoid when drafting this Bill.  We tried to avoid any reference to the owners, whether they were right or wrong, because that is a matter for the court to decide.  I think it is not right that Senator Miss Browne or any other Senator should refer to the court decision as confiscation.  The courts, after all, are competent to decide these matters.  If the court decides that a person has not got a right that that person claims, we ought not to refer lightly to such a decision of the Supreme Court as confiscation.  It is true, of course, in some cases the law is severe and may lead to injustice although the position is quite legal, but that is a different matter.  It is not confiscation, at any rate.  If those people who claim to have a public right to the River Erne come along and make a case to the Government that they have been badly treated, that they paid a certain amount of money for the fishery, instead of going around threatening us and saying that they do not care about our courts, that they will go to the Privy Council&mdash;well, if they choose the Privy Council, let them have the Privy Council.  As long as they put their faith in the Privy Council, I do not see that anybody here should have any sympathy with them.</P>

      <P>I want to protest against the term confiscation being used by Senator Miss Browne.  The Government had nothing to do with this case. It was the Supreme Court decided it <Col N="1550" /> and I do not think the judges of the Supreme Court should be accused of confiscation.  In the first place, the Supreme Court has to decide every matter according to law and in the second place, the judges are not here to defend themselves.  I was asked if I stood over this confiscation.  There is no necessity to answer that question because there was no confiscation.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson drew attention to Clause 13 and inquired if the conservators would have a free hand in the spending of money.  They have not of course.  The estimates of the boards of conservators must be submitted to the Minister each year and approved of by the Minister.  We compare them, first of all, with the expenditure during the previous year and, secondly, compare them with the expenditure, under similar circumstances, of other boards. Other things are taken into consideration such as the rate that is struck on the exclusive fisheries; the amount received for licences and whether they have sufficient money for adequate protection.  All these things having been taken into account, the estimates are approved or not, as the Minister may decide.  The conservators have not a free hand to spend money as they like.  It is more or less laid down as a guide that they will be permitted to spend roughly something about the same amount as they had been spending.</P>

      <P>Before this Bill passes its Final Stage I should like to <Col N="1551" /> remove a misapprehension which seems to have been created in the minds of some people who will have to deal with this Bill when it leaves this House.  I heard one Deputy suggest that, if the Bill becomes an Act, its terms may be applied to Acts which have already passed the Oireachtas.  A great railwayman said some time ago that the only exercise that some people take is jumping to conclusions.  I am afraid that that would apply to the grotesque apprehension which has been created in this particular respect.  Reference to the Bill will show that no Bill can be submitted to referendum unless a written request in respect to it is presented to the President of the Executive Council not later than seven days from the day on which the Bill shall be so passed or deemed to have been so passed.  Quite obviously, therefore, the terms of this Bill could not apply to any Bills which have now become Acts.  In any case, I could not imagine any person professing to be a democrat having any objection to any Bill, even one which had become an Act, being submitted to the judgment of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to emphasise the fact that this people is devoid of Party association.  I, for one, would not have anything to do with the Bill or help its passage into law if I thought it had any tinge of Party politics.  I have associated myself with the Bill because of the fact that I think it is a necessary safeguard for democracy. It is a good Bill in itself.  I support it because I opposed as vigorously as I could the deletion of the referendum provisions from the original Constitution. I hope that elsewhere, all Parties will see the wisdom of treating this Bill in a non-Party way and of discussing it on its merits solely.  I think that if they look at the experience we have gathered since this State was formed they will agree that this measure is necessary in the interests of us all.  A constitution is a contract made with the people, all the people, and not merely a majority of them.  It should have more stability than an ordinary Act of the Oireachtas which can be altered by a decision of <Col N="1552" /> a bare majority of the elected representatives in the Dáil.  Many things have been done by majorities, bare majorities in some cases, who are flushed with victory or inflamed with passion, which are not just or right according to the laws of God or man. We know that there was a definite majority for the Crucifixion of Christ but that did not render the act right in itself.  There should, in the long run, be some haven of refuge to which a minority who are oppressed by the majority should be able to retire and therein find security.  The Constitution, which should represent the fundamental principles upon which our State is formed and upon which all Parties may agree irrespective of detailed differences regarding general legislation, should, in my opinion, form such a haven of security.  If the Constitution can be altered from year to year and from month to month, without any reference whatever to the people with whom the contract was made, then it becomes a mere delusion and a snare.</P>
    <P>We are told that adult suffrage and five-yearly elections are the best possible safeguard.  They are a safeguard to a certain degree, but they are certainly not an adequate safeguard for many reasons.  One reason is that, in regard to constitutional law any more than general law, you cannot rely upon any single Party in the country &ldquo;staying put&rdquo;, so to speak, during a period of five years.  An Opposition, that represent themselves as the unbiased and pure-souled advocates of the best type of democracy, can very quietly and very easily shed their democratic tendencies after a short time of office.  Even the most reactionary government, when hurled from power, becomes an advocate of both constitutional and individual liberty the moment it becomes the Opposition.  We have numerous instances of that for our own use and benefit.  The late Government proceeded to knock out of the Constitution anything that tended to delay or impede their progress or to interfere with Party policy without even giving these Articles of the Constitution a fair trial as trials go in national <Col N="1553" /> affairs.  They now protest vigorously against a similar tendency on the part of their successors.  They eliminated the Referendum from the Constitution, but they are now apparently agreeable to its reinstatement although they professed to look upon it as an eyesore and a hindrance to liberty.  The Fianna Fáil Party violently opposed the removal of the Referendum, but since they were returned to power they have given no indication whatever of their desire to reinstate it.  Naturally, they desired to avail themselves of the same freedom which they denounced the late Government for seeking to secure for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Cosgrave Government sponsored a Public Safety Act amending the Constitution, and it was declared by the then Opposition to be the most ruthless and unjustifiable invasion of public and private liberty in the history of parliaments.  Yet, on being returned to power, they not only failed to repeal that Act but gladly seized upon it as a dandy weapon against the very same people by whom they said the Act was inspired.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to give names.  Neither Government could claim a mandate for that Act, but I think that surely the present Government could claim a mandate for its repeal.  Now, in view of these contortions on the part of Deputies and Senators of all Parties&mdash;I am excepting none&mdash;what guarantee have the people, when they elect a Government to power, that that Government is going to act in accordance with the principles upon which it was elected? There is no guarantee.  What happens in regard to general legislation may <Col N="1554" /> very well happen, and it has happened, in regard to constitutional legislation. The late Government had very little compunction in putting the extinguisher on local bodies that they considered were not acting as they should.  That was violently opposed by the Opposition, who said that new elections should take place instead. Yet we have the present Government extinguishing county councils at the rate of one per month and we have the very people who denounced the closing down of the Dublin Corporation and other bodies loudly applauding the present Government for extinguishing county councils at the present time for the same reason.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the present Opposition is most illuminating.  In the Dáil, where they were in a minority, and where their votes did not count, they vigorously opposed Bills proposing cuts in the salaries of civil servants and officials of local bodies, and sponsored numerous amendments deleting various sections of the Bill so as to make it inoperative.  In the Seanad, where they were in a majority, they either voted for these Bills or abstained from voting, and voted against many of the amendments that their colleagues in the other House had voted for.  That, of course, was because they would have been carried if they had voted for them here.  The Opposition that were pledged against anything in the nature of wage-cutting definitely and actively associated themselves with the policy of wage-cutting in that particular instance.  Of course I know that this is all in accordance with the game of politics, and I am sufficiently realist to know that we cannot hope always to allow national affairs to supersede Party expediency; but the electors, the ordinary people, should have some real protection against those Party contortionists so far as their fundamental rights as citizens are concerned as laid down in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued also that, through the action and inter-action of small groups or Parties, menaces to public liberties can be averted.  The experience of other countries, however, <Col N="1555" /> shows that that is not always so. A judicious distribution of a few salaried posts, and the creation in the minds of others of a lively sense of favours to come, invariably create chaos and confusion in the ranks of all Parties and render them too often the tools of their bigger brothers.  This may never happen in this country, but if we pretend that we are political purists and above the rest of mankind, I am afraid we are claiming a little too much.  I am afraid that there will be in this country always, as in every other country, an element among politicians who will be prepared to adjust their political convictions to suit the requirements of the Party having at its disposal the disposition of privilege, patronage and power.</P>

      <P>Again, admitting that we cannot hope to be perfect in all things political, I think we should at least save ourselves as well as our opponents in all cases from having the power, when temptation offers, to filch from the people the rights and privileges for which many generations of men and women have fought and suffered.  One would like to think that the Constitution here was the repository of the liberties and freedom of the ordinary people and that it would not be open to any single Party, without consulting the people on that single issue, to make a serious invasion on those rights and privileges. Otherwise, we may find that, through amendments to the Constitution, by one Party first and then by the other, most of the best sections of that Constitution are gradually frittered away, and the effect of that will be felt not only by this generation but by generations to come.  In order to get them back, a further sacrifice of blood and tears may be necessary, and I think it is up to us, now that the powers lie with us, to see that this sacrifice should not be necessary in the future.</P>

    <P>I would not be disposed to entrust to any single Party in the State, acting <Col N="1556" /> on a bare majority of the elected representatives, the right to invade the constitutional rights, liberties or privileges of the people as a whole. I would have much greater faith in the people as a whole that, on one single issue referred to them on a plain straight vote, they would take a decision that would be more consistent with freedom and liberty than any Party could take, dominated, as it must be, by Party and political expediency.  I hope, therefore, that all Parties, having something to answer for in regard to their attitude whilst in Opposition and whilst in power, and knowing as they do the temptations that are placed in the way of politicians, will, in the interests of the people for whose wellbeing they profess such concern, give legislative effect to this Bill.  No democrat need fear it, and I think that in the long run it will be found that it will have the effect of preventing, to a very considerable extent, the elimination from our political institutions of some of the very best sections that have been inserted into the original Constitution.</P>
    <P>We are threatened with dictatorships here, and at the moment it is difficult to say whether these dictatorships shall come from the Right or from the Left.  The one thing, however, that I believe will or can prevent a dictatorship, apart from the deliberate decision of the people themselves acting under adult suffrage, is the passing of this Bill into law.  Those who fear dictatorships at least should put this barrier in their way.  Accordingly, I hope that whatever may be thought about the circumstances in which the referendum was first interfered with, the referendum, as now proposed, will receive the unanimous vote of the people's representatives not only here but in the other House also.</P>

      <P>I think it is a pity that Senator O'Farrell did not deal a little with the record of the Labour Party, because if he had devoted a little industry to the study of their record he would have found them to be the greatest contortionists so far as any Party in this country is concerned. <Col N="1557" /> With regard to this Bill, I could not do more myself than praise it with faint damns.  I do not think the referendum is very much good.  I fear that if a Government is inclined to take away the rights of the people when it is in the first flush of its popularity, it will be able to carry a referendum.  I am afraid that if it is faced with a referendum and if it is an unscrupulous Government it will be very difficult to get a fair vote.  In any case I think that it is almost always impossible to get a single issue put clearly before the people.  Theoretically, there is no reason why it should not be done, but in practice it will always be found that other things will be brought in to cloud the minds of the voters.  I think it would be very much better if we had a constitutional feeling among Parties and if we had a Second House which was independent of the First House, or of the Dáil, which changed more slowly and which was less dominated by Party. That seems to me to be a much better arrangement than any other that can be devised.  If it were not for the proposal which has been before this House and which has, apparently, been determined by the Government&mdash;to abolish the Seanad&mdash;I should be inclined to vote against this Bill.  But if the Seanad is to be abolished, then any check, however little confidence we may feel in it, ought to be applied if it is possible to get agreement on it.  If the Seanad goes and there is no provision for a referendum, it means that we have, in fact, a dictatorship because we have a majority without any limitations on its power.  This Bill, if adopted, would provide certain limitations.  It might not effectively safeguard the people's rights &mdash;I am afraid it would not&mdash;because it is more easy to mislead the majority of the people if a Government sets out to do it than it is to get rid of their rights over the opposition of the Dáil and an independent Second Chamber. Senator O'Farrell seemed to place great reliance on what could be done by a referendum.  I was told on very reliable authority that, at the last election in Dublin City and County, there were from 10,000 to 12,000 personated <Col N="1558" /> votes.  Two Deputies were elected by the dead and the absent.</P>

      <P>I know of whole districts where the minority could not vote at all because of terrorism, which obtained to such an extent that personating agents could not be got.  I know that that happened in districts in Kerry and in districts in Connemara, so that if you rely on the referendum to beat a Government with the record that Fianna Fáil has, you may be sure that they will be only beaten when there is a very substantial majority against them.  As I see nothing better offering, and as the proposal to abolish the Seanad continues, I shall vote for this Bill.</P>

      <P>I have listened with tremendous interest to the two speeches that have just been delivered. If ever this House had the appearance of a restaurant it is to-day.  I never saw such a mixed grill in all my life as was presented to us to-day.  As regards Senator O'Farrell's speech, I agree with every word he said.  He hit off the situation between a Government and an Opposition as I had never heard it hit off before.  I leave it at that.</P>
      <P>Sometimes I find it difficult to follow Senator Blythe.  It is a case of &ldquo;first he would and then he wouldn't.&rdquo;  He is for the referendum and he is against the referendum.  With the greatest respect, I think that the reason why Senator Blythe made such a speech was to cover up his tracks as a member of the former Government in destroying the referendum.  I thoroughly agree with Senator Blythe when he says that, if we are to have a Second Chamber, it should be thoroughly independent of the other House.  That is the real bone of contention so far as the Seanad is concerned. If we had a Second Chamber independent of the other House it would not now be on the books that the Seanad is to be done away with in the course of 18 months.</P>
