      <NameTxt>Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The next business on the Order Paper is the election of a Cathaoirleach for the coming term. Any Senator may move that Senator So-and-so, naming him, be elected and do take the Chair of the Seanad as Cathaoirleach.  This motion must be seconded.  Should only one Senator be proposed, I shall put the question <Col N="766" /> forthwith.  If two Senators be proposed, a division will be taken between them. If more than two Senators be proposed, the procedure laid down in the Standing Orders will be followed.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that no debate can be allowed, but, according to precedent, a short speech may be made by the proposer of the candidate or candidates if he sees fit.  The seconding must be purely formal.  I call upon Senator MacLoughlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to propose that Senator Thomas William Westropp Bennett be elected as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and do now take the Chair. It was my privilege to propose the first Cathaoirleach of this Assembly.  Some of my colleagues, with a sombre and lugubrious sense of the fitness of things, think it meet that I should have the honour of proposing the last Chairman of this House.  I, therefore, submit for the Chairmanship the name of Senator Thomas William Westropp Bennett, who has presided over the deliberations of this Assembly for the past six years with dignity, discretion, and, despite all assertions to the contrary, a fine impartiality.  Not the least of the services which Senator Bennett rendered to this House was on the occasion when he stepped down from the Chair and defended with courage and ability the rights of this Seanad and corrected the misapprehensions and misrepresentations of those who would destroy it.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is proposed to contest Senator Bennett's claim to the Chairmanship.  In my humble home away in the fastnesses of Donegal I read with amusement last week of the conflict of opinion amongst our friends, the supporters of the Government, as to the candidate to be put forward on their behalf for the Chairmanship. I was under the impression that our friends held this House in such contempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, Senator. This is not relevant to the proposal. This is a matter that is quite foreign to the occasion.  You must stick to the subject matter of your proposal.  I do not want to hear anything about anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely I may give the reasons why Senator Bennett should be elected?  I am giving those reasons and I want to point out the inconsistency of our friends in the event of their proposing another candidate. By doing so they would be definitely inconsistent.  They are pining for the extermination of this House in the interests, as they say, of the nation, but notwithstanding their desire for the abolition of the Seanad, our friends seem to be inexplicably anxious to add to its dignity by proposing that one of their number should take the Chair.  I can only assume that their anxiety is due to a very laudable desire on their part to add to the respectability and decorum of the wake.  I do not know that even the satisfaction of having the obsequies presided over by a Fianna Fáil Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Chairman Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator MacLoughlin, I am getting a little uncertain.  You are proposing the election of Senator Bennett and you must not speak about anybody else.  I must ask you to confine yourself simply and solely to the reasons why he should be elected and not to give reasons why anybody else should not be brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I was merely going to say that I did not think that the satisfaction of having the obsequies of this House presided over by a Fianna Fáil Senator, even a Senator of the unimpeachable idealism of Senator Comyn, would repay us for the loss of Senator Bennett.  I have great pleasure in proposing that Senator Bennett be elected, and I hope the majority of the Government Party will acquiesce in this proposition, if only to demonstrate in a practical way the utter contempt in which they hold the House, for whose annihilation they have voted.</P>

      <P>I move that Senator Michael Comyn be elected and do now take the Chair as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  I understood it would be merely a formal proposition and I was anxious as nearly as possible to keep to that.  In view, however, of the fact that Senator MacLoughlin has mentioned one or two things reflecting on the Party, I just want to say that, whatever our view is, it must be recognised that while we were in this House we admitted that the House still existed and accordingly we tried to conform to the rules governing the House.  I do not want to make any special eulogy in relation to Senator Comyn's qualifications for the position of Cathaoirleach. Senator Comyn has been six years a member of the Seanad.  His experience and reputation as a lawyer in my opinion fit him to occupy the position. I think that he would be quite competent, equally competent to any of his predecessors, to interpret the rules governing the House and to keep people in order.  The one thing I would hope for would be that he <Col N="769" /> would show such impartiality that when he would be in the Chair he would stay in the Chair.  I have great pleasure in moving that Senator Comyn be elected.</P>

      <P>Fellow Senators, one cannot help, at a moment like this, feeling some natural excitement and hesitation in saying anything, but to those who supported me and to those who did not support me, I extend my heartfelt thanks.  The division, apparently, was purely on political lines, and I think it was political affiliations rather than personal likes or dislikes which secured the vote which has occurred. In the past, I have always secured the co-operation of every section of the House, and I hope I may count on it in the future.  Let our stay here be long or short, we will work, as we have ever worked, for the improvement of our country, and I feel that, in that, the new members and the old members will heartily co-operate.  I thank you all sincerely.</P>

      <P>I greatly regret to announce to the House the death, on the 28th November, of Senator George Crosbie, and, on 30th November, of Senator Francis MacGuinness.  Both Senators died within a few days of the <Col N="771" /> expiry of their term of office.  Does any Senator desire to speak?</P>

      <P>I would ask your permission, Sir, and the permission of the House, to pay a tribute to the memory of Senator George Crosbie, who has passed away since we last met.  As those of us who have been his colleagues know, he was a man of the very highest character.  While he felt strongly, he was tolerant and considerate to those who differed from him, and no trace of ill-feeling or bitterness ever entered his mind, and, naturally, no bitterness was ever given utterance to by him.  I had the good fortune to be associated with him in many projects, and whether success or failure crowned his efforts, he was always the same kindly, courteous and considerate gentleman.  He was still a member of our House at the time of his death, and I am sure we all deplore the passing of one whose every thought was directed to the well-being of the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to join in the expression of regret at the passing of our two Senators.  Senator Crosbie was active in the House up to very recently&mdash;practically up to his death and while he and I, and he and my Party, had very little in common, one had always to feel that his courtesy and politeness and his method of <Col N="772" /> handling his material in this House stamped him to be what we would all like this House to be composed of, a courteous gentleman.  With regard to Senator MacGuinness, I should like to join with my colleague, Pádraic O Máille, in paying a tribute to his memory.  Many members in this House knew him in the later years. Some of us knew him in the earlier years and I feel that the occasion of his death should not pass without expressing my own and my Party's sincere regrets at his passing.</P>

      <P>I should like to join in the expressions of esteem and respect which have been made in relation to the two Senators who have left us. Senator Crosbie was a member of the old Munster circuit and on that circuit he was loved and respected.  In this House, he also won the respect and admiration of every member of it.  In regard to Senator MacGuinness, I am very glad that the leader of our Party has paid him a tribute in such well chosen words, and that we are recalling days when we were all united.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated, on behalf of the members of the Seanad who are not with the Government Party, in the tribute that has been paid to the two deceased Senators.  I had considerable intimacy with both.  I think that the name of Senator MacGuinness recalls memories that are precious to students of Irish history and to the many students of that period of Irish history with which he was associated. Senator Crosbie walked, perhaps, in a different groove, but he, too, contributed his share to the work of nation-building.  I think the two men to whom we pay tribute to-day fully earned that tribute.  I hope that the memory of their work will be an inspiration and an example to those who will have to carry on the work of the Irish nation.</P>

It was my great privilege <Col N="773" /> to be associated in earlier days with Senator MacGuinness, and in that way to become aware of his character, his history, and of his sympathies.  I am sure that Ireland is the poorer for his loss.  Senator Crosbie came to work amongst us here in more recent times. He, too, had been an earnest worker in the struggle for Irish nationalism.  I feel that I am voicing the views of every member of the House when I rise to accentuate what has been said by the previous speakers.  I have only to add that I shall ask the Clerk of the House to convey to the relatives of the deceased Senators the expression of our sincere sympathy with them.  Senators will signalise their assent by standing in their places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is intended to amend, in certain <Col N="775" /> respects, the existing Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, so far as milk is concerned, with a view to strengthening the requirements and so as to ensure that milk intended for sale shall maintain a definite standard of quality and purity.  Under Section 4 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1889, the Minister for Agriculture is empowered to make regulations determining what deficiency in the normal constituents of milk should raise a presumption that the milk is not genuine.  Under regulations made in 1901, the standards of 3 per cent. milk fat and 8.5 per cent. of solids, other than fat, were prescribed for whole milk.  As Senators, no doubt, are aware, for quite a number of years prosecutions in the case of milk deficient in fats have been met by the defence that the milk was sold &ldquo;as it came from the cow.&rdquo;  That defence, whether genuine or not, has been found, in court at any rate, to be a reliable defence.  It will be obvious that it is very difficult to disprove such a defence unless the adulteration of the milk has actually been seen by somebody who is prepared to come forward and give evidence that he was a witness of such adulteration.  The defence that the milk &ldquo;came straight from the cow&rdquo; is one that cannot very well be rebutted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the importance of milk as an article of diet, particularly for growing children, it is felt that the defence of &ldquo;straight from the cow&rdquo; should no longer be left open to purveyors of milk.  The removal of that as a defence is the most important amendment in this Bill.  The Minister for Agriculture will make regulations prescribing the percentage of fats and of solids other than fat in milk intended for human consumption.  Personally, I feel that it would be wiser to have the percentage of fats low so as to ensure that the milk would, at least, reach the percentage set out, than to permit of the possibility of having milk sold for human consumption that was very defective as to its constituents.  The other amendments to the Food and Drugs Acts are calculated to improve <Col N="776" /> the machinery, and I do not think there is anything in any way contentious in them.  There is no big principle raised in any of them. Therefore, I do not think it is necessary to delay the House further in explaining the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the position with regard to the fats in milk has not been satisfactory.  Those who have had any experience know very well that in the case of milk prosecutions the defence &ldquo;as it came straight from the cow&rdquo; is such that it is impossible almost to rebut it. The trouble is that butter fat in milk is very variable.  It varies according to the seasons of the year and the class of cow from which the milk is taken.  The treatment of the cow has also a good deal to do with it.  I have observed myself at times that in very hot weather, when cows are tormented a good deal by flies, the butter fat in milk varies considerably, but notwithstanding that it very rarely happens, I think, that the milk from a herd of cows falls below three per cent.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and, through him, to the Minister for Agriculture, to seek a method by which, in conjunction with the specific gravity of milk, the percentage of fats should be determined. If milk is skimmed it has a tendency to increase its specific gravity.  If, on the other hand, water is added, it reduces the specific gravity.  At certain seasons of the year, when milk may contain 4½ per cent. or 5 per cent. of fats, a considerable amount of dilution could go on and still you would have a sufficient percentage of fats to satisfy the requirements of the Food and Drugs Acts.  Water, as I have said, will reduce the specific gravity of the milk, and will give an almost certain indication that the milk has been tampered with.  I welcome this Bill because I believe that it will help to ensure that the supply of milk will be better than it has been.  I hope, too, that it will do away altogether with fraudulency in the treatment of milk, and that the Department of Agriculture will <Col N="777" /> pursue its investigations with a view to securing that end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a very lucid explanation of the principal provisions of this Bill from the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am sure that no farmer and no representative in this House would be anxious to put anything into the Bill that would be calculated to protect the dishonest trader. The Bill deals with the sale of milk. Members of the House will understand that there are times when milk as it comes from the cow&mdash;from a cow that has been properly milked and properly fed&mdash;will be found not to be up to the standard, and to be deficient in butter fats.  If, in such case, a prosecution takes place, an honest farmer or trader may be fined and disgraced for an act for which he had no responsibility whatever.  We are all agreed that milk sold for human consumption, and especially as food for children, should be of the very best quality, and that the standard prescribed in the previous Acts was not too high.  I would at least prefer that a dishonest trader should get scot free than that an honest trader should be victimised or scandalised for an act for which he was in no way responsible.  I think that the Minister and his legal advisers ought to devise some means or insert some amendment to this Bill which would save an honest man from the disgrace of being convicted of adulterating milk in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill gives power to the Minister to make Orders prescribing the amount of butter fat and solids.  I would very much prefer to have a separate clause in the Bill which would specify the amount of fats and solids, just as we have such specifications in other Food and Drugs Acts.  We do not know what percentage of butter fats and solids the Minister may prescribe.  Of course, when the Order is made, we perhaps may have an opportunity of discussing it, but why not have the percentages set out in the Bill so that there would be no necessity for making an Order and revoking it afterwards?  The Parliamentary Secretary could achieve the same purpose by inserting the <Col N="778" /> Order as a clause in the Bill.  We welcome the Bill and we are all anxious to facilitate its operation, but I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the two points that I have mentioned&mdash;firstly, that of devising some means to protect the honest trader and, secondly, that of inserting a clause in the Bill to achieve what he proposes now to do by Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Counihan that the prescribed percentages of fats should be definitely laid down in the Bill.  Senator Dowdall is an expert on this matter and we can all be guided by what he says.  I should like to say that the trouble arising from the sale of milk is caused more by the way in which these Acts are administered than from any other reason.  I know that in parts of the country, in fact all over the country, anybody can sell milk without any supervision.  I know places in which there are one or two registered purveyors of milk and in which there are as many as 20 persons selling milk without any supervision whatever.  I should like to call attention to that matter because it has been going on for many years.  The practice in the country is that a person who has not a cow of his own, goes to the nearest person who has a cow to get milk. Those who are registered take all the risks and all the trouble.  Numbers of others get the benefits and charge the same price, but they do not come under the law.  I know of a case where milk was being sold with 1½ per cent. of butter fats while the person selling it was not a registered seller of milk for some considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the main clause of this Bill empowers the Minister to make regulations fixing the percentage of butter fat and solids in milk.  As Senator Counihan has stated, it would have been better if the prescribed percentages were inserted in the Bill, so that we could discuss them before the Bill is passed. However, I hope that before it finally leaves the House we shall have some indication from the Minister of the percentages of fat and solids that he <Col N="779" /> proposes to prescribe under the regulations. I dare say the Minister will have the assistance of his experts in ascertaining what is the proper percentage. It is rather a difficult thing for the Minister, I admit, to fix a percentage such as will ensure that no adulterated or inferior milk will be sold.  There is, on the one hand, the consumer to be considered; and on the other hand the producer, who should not be punished if, through no fault of his own, his dairy herd is not producing the required percentages of fat and solids.  The Minister has an opportunity, in the case of farms which are under the Department of Agriculture, of ascertaining what the proper percentage should be.  I understand that some time ago the Glasnevin herd was tested both as regards the combined yield of the cows and also as regards the milk of each individual cow.  I understand that in several instances the yield was not up to the prescribed 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>In one part of this Bill there is a reference to the difference between the morning's and the evening's milk. That is a matter of which I entirely approve.  As far as I know, the percentage of fat in these cases is entirely different.  The sanitary authorities always were aware of that and they rarely took samples of the evening's milk, which is much richer than that of the morning.  Although it is not stated in the Bill that the Minister is going to prescribe a different percentage for the morning's milk to that of the evening's, I hope he will do so. If he does, I think it will help considerably in ensuring that no innocent person will be punished and that the consumer will get what he has paid for. In Section 1 of the Bill a definition is given of whole milk and that definition apparently includes milk that has gone through some process of cleansing.  I cannot imagine any milk that has been put through a cleansing process that would deserve the name of whole milk. As far as I know producers give milk that requires cleansing to pigs or reject it altogether.  I think milk that has been cleansed should not be retained in the definition of whole milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> There is also a reference to pasteurisation and sterilisation.  I do not know whether these processes are connected with the cleansing process or not.  I think that milk that would require cleansing should not be used for human beings at all.  I thought that the Minister would have inserted in the Bill a definition of another class of milk which most consumers prefer to either pasteurised or sterilised milk.  That is milk which I call fresh whole milk&mdash; milk that is delivered to the consumers within four or five hours after it has been milked.  Most consumers prefer that kind of milk to either bottled milk, sterilised milk or pasteurised milk. They are very glad to get that milk if they possibly can, and in a rough and ready way they ascertain from the temperature of the milk whether it is freshly milked or whether it is stale milk that has gone through some process.  The question whether milk that has been pasteurised has or has not lost any of its valuable properties would be a matter on which a medical man could give us some information, and I hope they do so, either in this Bill or in the accompanying Bill which is shortly to come before us, and which aims at the prevention of the sale of dirty milk.  I hope the Minister in fixing the percentages will be very careful to get all the information he possibly can from the existing herds that are under his control.  Of course these herds are of a higher quality and a higher character than the general run of dairy herds throughout the country. The cattle at Glasnevin are, of course, of a higher quality than the general run of cattle throughout the country, and he should make all due allowance for that in fixing the percentages.  I think also that if he fixes a different percentage for the morning and evening's milk, he will have done a good deal to remedy the trouble we have had in dealing with milk in the past.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill.  It will be a very desirable improvement of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, as regards the sale of milk. It will ensure the consumers getting <Col N="781" /> a quality of milk of reasonable standard, and it should also be the interests of the honest trader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The speeches of Senators Dowdall and Counihan make me think that I must have misread this Bill, and misunderstood its intention. I understood that the effect of the Bill was rather to remove from the dairyman the slur that he had adulterated milk, simply by the fact that he had sold a bad quality of milk, and that it would be an offence to sell a bad quality of milk even though he had not adulterated it.  I rather read that into the Bill.  I think that is the intention and, if that will be the effect, it will be a very desirable alteration of the law.  After all, when a man sells poor milk, if there is a presumption that that milk contains 3 per cent. of butter fat and 8½ per cent. of solids, and that that is the normal consistency of milk, it is up to the seller before he offers it for sale to ensure that it contains that quantity of butter fat and that percentage of solidity.  This Bill makes it an offence to sell milk below that normal standard, whether it was adulterated or not.  It should be an offence, and I think that is the effect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>To say that because milk has not been adulterated therefore there should be no offence, I do not think is good enough.  Dairymen here will, I think, agree if I say it is quite possible to provide a herd of cows that will give large quantities of milk of poor quality, and it is possible by a special process of feeding to get quantities of milk of a poor quality, and if the milk that is sold to the public is of poor quality, and a larger quantity is obtained, either by a selection for quantity as against quality or by feeding for quantity as against quality, then the public is prejudiced and I think it should be made an offence to sell milk of a poor quality whether there is a deliberate adulteration or not.  I think that is the effect of the Bill.  If it is not the effect of the Bill, then I think it will fail in doing what it is desirable should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> There are two grades of offence. There is the offence which is deliberate adulteration by definite malice, and the offence of selling a poor quality of article below a certain standard.  That, I think, is of less import.  It is not as great a moral offence as the other, and yet it is trading to the detriment of the public.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will reassure me on this point, that the Bill makes it an offence to sell milk below a certain standard and leaves still operative in the law the offence of selling adulterated milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the observations which have been made by Senator Johnson.  It is possible to get weak milk either by feeding or breeding.  You can get a cow that yields a large quantity of milk of low quality.  You can breed such a cow. You can also feed cattle in such a way that they will produce large quantities of milk of low quality.  That is wrong, and it ought to be provided for just as it is provided for by this Bill.  But I think there is something of greater turpitude in going to the pump and putting water directly into the milk.  I agree with Senator Johnson that these offences ought to be graded.</P>
      <P>In regard to what my friend Senator Linehan has said, I think the Minister has fully provided in his Bill for any reasonable doubts that the Senator may have in mind.  This definition which Senator Linehan speaks of, the definition of whole milk, is a reasonable and necessary one.  It includes pasteurised milk, sterilised milk and strained milk.  In ordinary language these are the three kinds of milk that it includes.  There is nothing in that definition to suggest the idea that dirty milk should be sold.  I think the cleansing process there means straining, pasteurising or sterilising.  I desire to commend this measure to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill will do some good, but I visualise the time when the Ministry will have to go much further.  In England, and most European countries&mdash;I would like to hear the medical profession talking on this matter&mdash;fully 80 per cent. of the milk sold is either sterilised or comes from <Col N="783" /> tested cows.  In England and in some continental countries 80 per cent. of the milk comes from tuberculin tested cows, or otherwise it is sterilised milk. I think it is almost impossible to get pure milk delivered from the cow under any circumstances.  The medical profession are ominously silent.  As I have already indicated, this Bill will do some good, but it will not get pure milk, until you have the milk either sterilised or you have tuberculin tested cows, such as some of our friends in Kildare have.  Only then will you have clean milk.  You will have to go further; you will have to call for the pasteurisation of the milk that is sent in for consumption by the public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with an entirely different matter to that which Senator Cummins has raised.  The Parliamentary Secretary will have power to specify a certain percentage of butter fat in the milk.  This is a troublesome question and it is one to which the law does not apply in the same way in various areas in the Free State.  For example, in Cork, if you can prove that the milk is as the cow gave it, the magistrate will not convict, whereas in Dublin, even if you prove that the milk is as the cow gave it, the magistrate will fine you £2. There is no use in the Minister saying that a cow gives bad milk.  Pure milk from a cow cannot be bad milk.  The law is now going to set a certain standard for milk which the Parliamentary Secretary thinks the public ought to get.  I am not objecting to that; I merely object when the Parliamentary Secretary puts up the standard.  At present under the British law, which applies to the Free State, the standard of milk all the year round in the matter of butter fat is 3 per cent.  It frequently happens that well-fed cows on good grass will give milk which might <Col N="784" /> fall below the 3 per cent. standard.  If the Parliamentary Secretary prescribes 3 per cent. then that dairy farmer would be subject to a fine because the cows were not doing what the Parliamentary Secretary says they should do, they were not giving 3 per cent. of butter fat.  That is the crux of the whole matter.</P>
      <P>I will ask the Parliamentary Secretary to get the records of tests made by the Royal Dublin Society.  They tested the produce of 17 cows, morning and evening, at the Model Farm. When he examines these records he will find that in the herd of cows kept by the Government, fed by the Government on the best of food at the expense of the taxpayer, at least seven or eight of them would be below the standard which the Parliamentary Secretary will fix when he prescribes 3 per cent.  If that herd were kept by a farmer those seven or eight cows would be sufficient to make him liable to a prosecution under these circumstances. The case is made that if the farmer is careful and keeps his cows well he will be in a position to supply milk with 3 per cent, of butter fat. He must not sell milk with a smaller percentage of butter fat.  The job is how is he to know if the cow gives milk below the standard.  There is no use in the Parliamentary Secretary making out that what the cow gives is not milk in law.  That is what he will have power to do when this Bill is passed.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill just as I would welcome any regulation that will give us pure, good, clean milk.  The Parliamentary Secretary stresses the importance of milk as a food for human beings and especially for young people.  I have been listening carefully to all the speeches that have been made and, if I will be pardoned for saying it, I think most of them were absolute nonsense.  It is not so much a question of what the milk should contain as what the milk does contain.  It should be recognised that the milk contains tubercle bacillus. Fully 80 per cent. of our children who are suffering from bone disease have it because the milk contained tubercle <Col N="785" /> bacillus.  I would suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that instead of killing calves he should devote his attention to killing tubercular cows. The only Senator who spoke about good, clean, honest milk was Senator Cummins.</P>

As regards the treatment of milk, the Parliamentary Secretary knows very well that there are very valuable elements in milk destroyed, especially by the process of sterilisation.  I do not agree with sterilisation.  I agree with the policy of getting milk from good, healthy cows.  I would prefer to start at the foundation and get the milk from good, healthy cows.  If we did that we would help to do away with the tubercle bacillus and with bone disease.</P>

It has been clearly demonstrated in England, by just as great an authority as Senator O'Sullivan, that only 2 per cent. of tubercular cows give tubercular milk.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how practical men advocate the establishment of a certain standard for milk and set out in a measure of this kind that that standard will have to be produced and sold and that no milk below that standard can be sold.  If that is embodied in a statute it will follow that a great percentage of our cows will have to be scrapped; there will have to be a big percentage of them taken out <Col N="786" /> of commission as regards the supply of milk to the towns and creameries.  No matter what way cows are fed or treated, the percentage of fat in the milk remains fairly constant.  No matter whether they produce a high or low quality of milk, the percentage of fat will proportionately increase or diminish according to the feed.  It is also certain that a great number of the cows of this country and of every country produce milk of a standard below 3 per cent. in butter fat content, so that it strikes me as altogether unreasonable to establish, as the absolute law, a standard of 3 per cent. of butter fat for all milk supplies.  It would, in my opinion, be more suitable if it were possible to arrange for inspectors to sample the milk and to have it sold according to its quality. It looks as if that is the logical outcome of the whole matter&mdash;that milk will have to be sold according to its butter fat content&mdash;which would mean that it would be sold according to quality as any other commercial article is sold. Otherwise, I do not see anything practical in that portion of the Bill.</P>

The present standard of fat content laid down in the regulations is 3 per cent. and Senators who are interested in milk production and who have expert knowledge of the subject know that 3 per cent. is not a very high standard.  The 3 per cent. set out in the regulations as the standard at present will be the minimum standard of fat content. There is no doubt whatever, and I would not question it for a moment, that the milk will occasionally fall even <Col N="787" /> below the 3 per cent., but if it falls below 3 per cent., it falls for causes that can be removed.</P>

There is no doubt whatever that in a well kept and well fed herd, there will be individual cows, even well bred cows, which have an individual peculiarity and which do give milk which is deficient in fats although they are good breeds of cattle.  That is established beyond any doubt, but the man who takes up this particular branch of the agricultural industry to make a living out of it has got to eliminate from his herd the cows that are not giving milk up to a certain standard and we have got to protect the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather you did not.  A point of very considerable importance in relation to this question of deficiency in fat content is the regularity of milking the cows.  It has been found&mdash;and experiments on a very extensive scale have been carried out; I have lots of figures but I do not want to weary the House with them&mdash;that the further it is removed from equality, <Col N="788" /> the bigger the discrepancy will be as between one milk and the other.  That is definitely established and it has been found and proven that the morning milk from well kept and good herds is deficient in fats, but it has also been established that by continuing up and learning the lesson which these experiments taught&mdash;by regulating the interval of milking&mdash;the morning deficiency has been practically eliminated.  There are figures to prove that, if it were necessary to prove it.  There are difficulties of distribution.  The intervals between milking cannot be equalised for transport reasons and by reason of the time that milk must be delivered in cities and towns and all that sort of thing, but the producer and the purveyor of milk must at any rate do all the obvious necessary things in order to bring his milk up to a certain standard and I believe that if he does all the things, without incurring any great expense or going to any great inconvenience which he himself can do to improve the standard of his milk, he will have very little difficulty in producing milk that will uniformly reach the minimum of 3 per cent.</P>

    <P>Suppose, for the sake of argument, the 3 per cent. is too high, I maintain that it is still better to fix a percentage&mdash;let that percentage be whatever it will&mdash;but if the public believe the Statute has safeguarded them against milk of a low grade, the public are entitled to get their high-grade milk which the Statute purports to provide. If the 3 per cent. standard is too high, when the Minister for Agriculture comes along with his regulations, by all means persuade him that he has fixed too high a standard, but ensure that the public get milk of the standard of purity that they believe they are getting and for which they are paying. Somebody mentioned in the course of the discussion that it would be desirable to have the standards of milk set out in the Bill.  I do not think it would be, and for the reason that it may be necessary from time to time to change the standards, and they cannot be changed except by regulations made by the Minister.  If, at any time, we wish to change the standards&mdash;medical <Col N="789" /> opinions change from time to time and lay opinions change&mdash; I think it would be an undesirable position to put ourselves into of having to introduce fresh legislation, if we wished to raise the standard, say, to 3.5 per cent. or if, on the other hand, we wished to reduce it to 2.75 of butter fat content.</P>
    <P>I think that on full examination those people who advocated the setting out of the standards in the Bill will agree with me that it is more desirable to leave the law as it stands in relation to that.  It might be well, however, and I should be quite prepared to consider favourably such a proposal, that the regulations setting out the standards should be laid on the Table of the House and that Senators should be afforded an opportunity of discussing these regulations and persuading the House that they ought to be nullified or rejected if, in the wisdom of the House, it is considered that the right standard has not been set out. That is a matter on which I would have a very open mind, and if an amendment to that effect is tabled, there would be no serious objection to it. There has been a good deal of discussion which I do not intend to follow up on the general question of purity of milk, that is not proper to this Bill at all.  This Bill is really incidental to the comprehensive Milk Bill at present before the Dáil and many of the matters raised here, and not pursued very far, were matters which, I think, were not proper to this Bill at all.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Wilson who felt very disturbed that anybody who sold milk that came &ldquo;straight from the cow&rdquo; should be liable to conviction if that milk did not reach a certain standard. I do not know whether the particular abuse I have in mind is very extensive, but I do know for a fact that milk that has been sold as &ldquo;straight from the cow&rdquo; has come &ldquo;straight from the cow,&rdquo; but it has only been the fore milk, and Senator Wilson, of course, knows that the percentage of fat in the fore milk is considerably lower than the percentage of fat in the later milk.  A case has come before my notice where the fore milk was sold for human consumption and a high price <Col N="790" /> got for it, while the strippings were sold to the creamery where they are paid on the percentage of butter fat.</P>

In so far as our responsibilities to the general community are concerned, nothing, of course, of a disparaging nature can be said of us.  One of the last Senators who spoke, Senator Dillon, appeared to be under the impression that this standard of 3 per cent. would apply to milk sent to creameries.  That is not so.  The milk will go to the creameries as it always went, and the people who send it will be paid on the butter fat content. We are not concerned with that in this Bill.  We are concerned with ensuring that the milk sold for human consumption will reach a certain standard, and that standard will be set out in regulations made under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am taking this Bill on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  It is necessary to pass an Expiring Laws Bill before the end of the present calendar year.  This measure continues for another year the same statutes which appear in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Expiring Laws Act of 1933, with the exception of the Motor Car Act, 1903, which is being repealed by the Road Traffic Act of 1933 and the Workmen's Compensation (War Addition) Act, 1917, which is being repealed by the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934.  With regard to some of the other measures a Bill dealing with the poor law position generally will shortly be introduced which will make unnecessary, it is hoped, the annual renewal of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  A permanent measure to amend the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, is also under consideration, and an Aliens Bill has been introduced.  With the exception of these three measures it is not considered necessary, at the moment, to introduce legislation of a permanent character in respect of the other Acts in the Schedules to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is made necessary because of the increase in dancing throughout the country and, consequently, of the increase in the number of dance halls. Many dance halls are considered by the authorities to be quite unsuitable for the purpose, and it is deemed necessary that power should be given <Col N="792" /> to the Gárda Síochána to supervise and have some control over them. The position, previously, has been that the public health authorities have been responsible both for the supervision and for the granting of licences for these dance halls.  That has not proved to be satisfactory owing to the increase in the number of dance halls and the consequent increase in supervision which that entails.  Instead of the public health authorities having the right to grant these licences, it is now proposed to transfer that power to the District Courts.  An appeal will lie from the District Court to the Circuit Court if persons feel aggrieved.  Under this Bill, when the statutory notice has been served, power is given to the Gárda Síochána to come in and oppose the granting of licences as well as to any person who can show any interest in opposing the granting of a licence.  The District Justice is given power to grant licences.  In doing so he can attach such conditions as he considers necessary to have inserted in the licences, such as limiting the time during which dances may be held, and so on.  The grounds are set out in the Bill on which a District Justice may refuse to grant a licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a much needed measure.  I also think it will be effectual for the purpose for which it is intended, namely, to control these public dance places.  Without in any way wishing to criticise the Bill, I desire to call the Minister's attention to the expression in the Bill defining &ldquo;public dancing.&rdquo;  It means &ldquo;dancing in which members of the public actively participate.&rdquo;  I suppose that is a good definition, as good as the Minister could possibly get.  I am sure that he had considerable difficulty in considering that, but I am wondering whether it would be possible to improve it so as to exclude from the operation of the Bill private balls in private houses.  Would the Minister consider if a dance held in a private house, for which subscriptions were required, would come within the operation of this measure? On the other hand, does he consider that a dance, for which an admission <Col N="793" /> fee is charged, is a public dance within the meaning of this definition?  Perhaps in the interval between this and the next stage the Minister will consider the questions which I have tentatively put to him.  I am certain that the Minister has already considered this as carefully as possible, because although the definition looks very simple it seems to me to be one which has caused him considerable thought.</P>

      <P>I have gone as far as I could to try to provide for what Senator Comyn has mentioned.  It is the nearest definition I could get.  If the Senator has any further definition to suggest, then we can consider it on the Committee Stage.  It is not intended to deal with the class of dances that the Senator has in mind, because it is set out in the Bill that there must actually be over the door of the dance hall a notice setting out that the place has been licensed for the purpose of public dancing.  That indicates that it is not the intention to bring within the measure people who hold private dances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will be familiar with the main principle of this Bill, so that I do not think it is necessary to elaborate in any way the details of it.  The Bill briefly proposes to raise what is generally known as the age of consent from 16 to 17 years, and the offence is made a felony under the age of 15 years instead of the age of 13, as at present.  The penalties are increased, particularly for a second or subsequent offence.  The defence that was formerly available, that the accused person had reasonable cause for believing that the girl was over that age, will not now be available according to this Bill.  The Bill also makes more definite and stronger <Col N="794" /> provision for dealing with offences against weak-minded people.  As the law is at present, there is no power to issue a search warrant to deal with brothels.  That has been remedied in this Bill.  Section 17 forbids the sale or the advertising of, or the importation and sale of contraceptives. Section 18 relates to improper conduct in public places.  In certain towns such offences could not be dealt with summarily in the District Court as the law is at present.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention, in connection with this Bill, that there was what was known as the Carrigan Commission. It was set up some years ago. A good deal of evidence was taken by it and recommendations made.  Subsequent to that a Committee, what may be called an informal Committee of the Dáil, was set up by the then Minister for Justice to consider those recommendations and the evidence given before it.  Numerous representations came through the Ministry of Justice while that informal Committee was sitting. All those representations were considered. The Bill, as it is now before the Seanad, is the result of the recommendations of that informal Committee. I should say, however, that that informal Committee had not what might be called the formal sanction of the Dáil itself.  It was a Committee that was representative of all Parties in the Dáil, the members of which gave a good deal of time and consideration to this question in an effort to try and bring in on what is a delicate matter&mdash; a matter that is not perhaps easy to discuss or debate&mdash;what they believed would receive the approval of all Parties in the House.</P>

      <P>This as the Minister has stated, is not a pleasant subject to discuss in public.  I have had a consultation with him, and I now propose that this Bill be referred to a Special Committee of the Seanad.  I am sure that members of the House will agree to that because of the delicate nature of the discussions that may arise.  It would be better, I think, that these discussions should take place in private, and that the result of <Col N="795" /> the Special Committee's deliberations should afterwards be brought before the House.</P>

      <P>I think that this Bill will be welcomed by almost all sides of the House.  There are improvements which some people, I think, would like to see made in it.  Personally, I should like to see the age under Sections 1 and 2 higher.  There are some other amendments that I would also like to see made in it.  I agree in principle with the suggestion that has been made by Senator Colonel Moore, but instead of a Special Committee I should like to see a Select Committee set up.  My reason is this: that in the course of the discussions one might want to get advice or consult with some people who have given a great deal of attention to this matter.  The setting up of a Select Committee will not make it essential that evidence should be taken, but will make it possible if it be thought necessary.  For that reason I should prefer a Select Committee to a Special Committee.  The matters that this Bill deals with are unpleasant but we cannot discuss them in secret. At the same time it would be easier for eight or ten Senators who are anxious that this Bill should be made as good as it can possibly be made, to try and amend it in Select Committee rather than by way of general discussion in the House.</P>

      <P>As Senators will remember, we had some conversations with regard to this Bill before the Adjournment of the House took place in the Summer.  Consultations took place between representatives of all Parties, and it was generally agreed that we should postpone the taking of the Bill until after the Summer Adjournment. There was general agreement, too, between all Parties that the Bill, having got a Second Reading, should be referred to a Special Committee.  Consequently I have consulted the representatives of the different Parties and the Whips of the different Parties in this House to-day, and there has been agreement that the Bill should be referred to a Special Committee.  I move, <Col N="796" /> therefore: &ldquo;That the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 1934, be referred to a Special Committee of the House consisting of Senators Mrs. Wyse-Power, Mrs. Clarke, Miss Browne, David Robinson, Sir E. Coey Bigger, S. Brown, and T. Farren.&rdquo;  That is a Committee of seven.

      <P>I should like to support the motion of Senator Farren to appoint a special committee to inquire into this Bill.  When this Bill came before the Dáil, the Dáil, in its wisdom, appointed a committee of representatives of every Party in the Dáil to consider in private the terms of the Bill and to bring forward a report.  The measure recommended by that special committee is practically the Bill to-day.  When the Dáil set up a special committee they were very anxious that every Party should be free to discuss the terms of the Bill in a private manner, but the Dáil, in its wisdom, forgot one point of view that should be very properly considered. There was no woman on the special committee in the Dáil which considered this Bill.  The Criminal Law Amendment Bill, as given to us, represents <Col N="797" /> an immense improvement and we all welcome it as a measure to which we have been looking for the protection of women and children.  It deals with many things which have been considered by those who have been asking for a measure of this sort for many years, and who have given a great deal of time and attention to the problem. In the course of our investigations, we received a good deal of education on these problems by meeting with people who are all equally concerned&mdash;clergymen, representing all shades of opinion.  I sat on committees at which we had Catholic clergymen as well as the Dean of Christ Church. From these people we learned many things that previously we had not known.  I therefore think that it would be very advisable indeed if a special committee were now set up to consider the Bill.  Some time ago, we had a special committee on the Affiliation Orders Bill, which was a Bill that also dealt with sex problems.  I think that where sex problems are concerned, select committees can give a tremendous amount of help.</P>

      <P>I should explain to the House that there is an intrinsic difference between a select committee and a special committee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that, as already stated, we had the Carrigan Commission to deal with this matter.  A good deal of evidence was taken before that Commission and the matter was investigated as fully as possible.  The Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána placed himself at the disposal of the Commission, and all the evidence that could be obtained from philanthropic and other societies was obtained.  All these <Col N="798" /> bodies came forward and gave evidence, and I think all the evidence that could possibly be got was produced before that Commission.  Afterwards there was a Committee of the Dáil to consider the Bill.  They considered it in the light of the evidence and the recommendations of the Carrigan Commission.  They also considered the various memoranda that came from people who are interested in this Bill.  I respectfully suggest that all the evidence that could possibly be got has been got and that a special committee would likely be in a position to make recommendations to this House much more expeditiously than a select committee.  I do not know whether Senators since this Bill came to the Seanad have received representations as to the urgency of this problem, but certainly the Department of Justice has been pressed to have this Bill passed as expeditiously as possible.  Might I respectfully suggest that a special committee would achieve the purpose which Senators have in mind and it would obviously be much more expeditious than if you were to set up what would amount to another commission to deal with the problem?</P>

      <P>That a select committee of ten Senators, of whom four shall form a quorum, be appointed to consider, and if it so desires, to take evidence upon the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 1934, with power to send for persons papers and records and to report its opinion for the information and assistance of the Seanad; the committee to report by&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> I was going to put in 1st February there, but that is a detail.  Senators should understand that I do not want a committee which would invite everybody to give evidence who think they have new points of view, nor do I want the committee, if it finds itself in a difficulty, to be in the position that it cannot send for experts and question them here.  The position is that we have not seen the Carrigan Commission Report.  It may not be available for such a committee, but I imagine it would be.  Neither have we here seen the evidence that came before the Dáil Committee but we have had points of view put very forcibly in relation to this Bill, with which I am in sympathy, but about which I do not feel that I know quite enough to be quite sure that I know whether they are right or not.  In a committee of this kind, I should like that the members should be able to send for a particular person, possibly a clergyman of certain experience, or possibly some social workers and question them on this very important point.  Nothing like taking notes of the evidence would to my mind be desirable, nor could it be done in the time at our disposal.  The only difference between my proposal and that of the Special Committee is that the select committee, if they desire to do so, could take evidence.  The Special Committee would have no power to take evidence.  That is my only reason for moving the motion.  I can assure the Minister that I have no desire to delay the measure.</P>

I wonder whether it would be possible to deal with the particular amendments which Senators have in their minds, on the Committee Stage, and see then whether you want a special committee? There is a danger of going too far. If you have a special committee or any committee, I think there should <Col N="800" /> be an equal representation of lady Senators with men.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that there is an agreement that the Bill should go to a committee, and that the difference between us is as to whether it should be a special committee or a select committee.  I think we are all familiar with the evidence that could be brought before a committee, and it is not a subject about which we are anxious to hear anything more.  I think we all realise what the position is.  The Bill has been sent to this House from the other House after careful consideration, but some members of this House think that this Bill should get special examination by a committee set up in this House.  The understanding, as far as I can remember, was that a special committee would be appointed to examine this Bill and to report to the House whether or not, in its wisdom, it thought amendments were necessary or not.  We did not intend, as far as I understood, that we should have a select committee to go into all this matter over again.  For that reason I move an amendment to the motion of Senator Douglas that the matter be referred to a special committee of nine members, five of whom shall form a quorum, and that the committee consist of the following:&mdash;Senators Mrs. Wyse-Power, Mrs. Clarke, Miss K.

It is a matter which involves the honour of a country.  We all take a very serious view of it, because the outlook with regard to this matter is totally changing in the country.  I support the proposition of Senator Douglas because from what I have learned since the Bill came to this House, I believe it may be necessary to hear further evidence.  Changes have been made in the laws of other countries, I think.  In particular, I think that the views of certain clergymen who have given a very close study to this matter should be heard.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the proposal of Senator Douglas.  I am sure every Senator here has received a considerable amount of correspondence dealing with the very important matters contained in the Bill from an organisation very competent to deal with these matters.  Apparently they have changed their minds about these things.  These are matters that cannot be discussed in the House and, consequently, I believe that the Select Committee is the proper body to deal with the matter.  I am very much in favour of Senator Douglas's proposal.  I know that the matter is urgent, but we might go too fast in these and other matters.  Seeing that the members of this organisation, which is very competent to deal with the subject, have changed their minds and want the whole matter reviewed, I certainly would feel in favour of referring it to the Select Committee.</P>

      <P>This Bill, if it is referred to a Special Committee, cannot be dealt with in the same way as if it were referred to a Select Committee. The Special Committee will deal only with the form of the Bill as it stands. This is a difficult question and Senators have been pressed on different issues.  The very fact that these Committees that have been referred to by the Minister have met in private has made it impossible for any Senator to exercise a judgment on the respective points of view.  Consequently it seems to me that it should be possible for whatever Committee that is set up to call for elucidation in relation to various matters.  I think it is fair to assume that every member of the Select Committee will have the discretion that Senator Douglas refers to.  It need not delay the discussion inordinately, but it will at least give these different points of view an opportunity to clear up certain questions of doubt.  It seems to me that is necessary. If it is not done in that way it may have to be done in a public session of this House and, if possible, that ought to be avoided.</P>

    <Title>Shannon Fisheries Bill, 1934&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the acquisition of and the management by the Electricity Supply Board of the fisheries of the River Shannon.  As Senators are aware, when the Shannon hydroelectric scheme was contemplated it was anticipated that certain damage would be done to the valuable fisheries of the Shannon and the Shannon Electricity Act provided for the payment of compensation to the owners of such fisheries whose property was damaged by the construction of the Shannon works.  By what was an oversight, no provision was made for compensation where the damage arose through the operation of the works. That particular defect is made good by this Bill.  The Electricity Supply Board is under obligation to pay various sums in compensation in respect of damage done to fisheries either by the construction or the operation of the Shannon works.  It is further <Col N="804" /> to be noted that because of the erection and the operation of the works certain changes have occurred in the river which will result in further damage to the fisheries unless various works are undertaken and various measures adopted in order to preserve the fisheries.  Under these circumstances it was decided that it was necessary to bring all the fisheries of the Shannon under one control if they were to be preserved.  It was also realised that only some person or some organisation having control of all the fisheries could plan the works necessary to preserve them and make the necessary provision for their maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is, firstly, to enable the Electricity Supply Board, where compensation is due by them to the owner of any fishery in respect of damage, in lieu of paying the compensation to acquire the fishery and, secondly, to enable them to acquire any other fishery on the Shannon that they wish to make subject to their control and management. The whole purpose of the Bill is really expressed in that sentence. The other parts of it provide for the management of the fisheries by the Electricity Supply Board and for the assessment of the amount of compensation to be paid to persons whose fisheries have been acquired.  Special provision is made for additional compensation to be paid where the fishery was owned by persons who worked that fishery personally and depended upon it for a livelihood, having regard to the difficulty that might arise in their case of transferring themselves to any other place in the country where their particular skill as fishermen could be of value to them.  Other portions of the Bill are of a miscellaneous nature.  There is provision for the maintenance, through the weir at Parteen Villa, of a minimum flow of water of 10 cubic metres per second, which is the minimum amount necessary, we are advised, in order to preserve the fisheries in the river below the weir.  There is a provision for the alteration of the weekly close season from 48 to 72 hours, which new close <Col N="805" /> season, it is considered, will have to be maintained for some time in order to prevent the depletion of fish in the river.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to restrict the issue of licences for fishing with drift or draft nets in the estuary to the number which was issued during the last few years.  That is to enable those who were given licences to fish to continue to fish, but to prevent any addition to their number.  It is also proposed to prohibit net fishing in the fresh waters of the Shannon except by persons who have been lawfully exercising the right to fish during the past 12 months.  Such persons will be able to continue their right until that right has been purchased from them by the Electricity Supply Board.  That is the whole purpose of the Bill.  The only matter that may require explanation is the decision to place all the responsibility in this respect on the Electricity Supply Board.  It was felt it would be most undesirable to have a rival authority created on the Shannon.  To some limited extent the interests of the fishery owners are in conflict with the interests of the Electricity Supply Board and it would be inevitable, if a separate organisation was created for the purpose of acquiring and operating the fisheries, that at some stage they would come into conflict with the Electricity Supply Board.  There is no objection in principle to giving the Board the ownership of the fisheries, the responsibility for managing them and empowering them to establish a separate organisation under their control for that purpose and setting out in specific terms in the Bill their obligations to maintain and develop the fisheries, to maintain the flow of water in the old river and so forth, so that the Shannon fisheries can be made in future what they undoubtedly are at present, that is, a very valuable national asset.</P>
    <P>In connection with this Bill various extraneous matters have been raised in different quarters which really do not arise at all.  The essential point is, first of all, that damage has been done to the fisheries for which compensation must be paid.  It is proposed, <Col N="806" /> instead of paying compensation, to buy the fisheries outright.  It is proposed to enable the Electricity Supply Board to acquire any other fishing right that it considers necessary to acquire on the Shannon in order to enable it to embark upon various schemes to protect and develop the Shannon fisheries.  It is proposed to permit certain fishing to continue upon the estuary, but to limit these licences for fishing with draft or drift nets to the number of persons who have been so fishing in the past.  This is to prevent any substantial addition in consequence of the acquisition of fresh water fisheries by the Board.  The compensation to be paid to fishery owners will be determined by the arbitrator appointed under the Acquisition of Land Acts and in accordance with the provision of the Acquisition of Land Acts, subject to an additional amount of compensation being paid where the owner of the fishery also worked it himself.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any other point that need be mentioned at this stage.  The Bill is probably one more for discussion in Committee than for discussion on Second Reading.  The principle of the Bill is to secure the Electricity Supply Board in the ownership of these fisheries and impose on it the obligation of developing them in the belief that any alternative course will lead to the continued decline of the fisheries and, consequently, the loss of what is a potential national asset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has not said all that he might have said on the Second Reading of this Bill. I think that one would like an explanation as to why this was not a Bill to amend the Shannon Electricity Act rather than a Shannon Fisheries Bill, because, in effect, what it does is to enlarge the powers of the Electricity Supply Board, and we have the Minister for Industry and Commerce explaining a Fisheries Bill while under an Electricity Supply Bill, I take it, we would have had the Minister for Fisheries.  There seems to be a certain amount of cross purposes.  It is the extension of the powers of the Board <Col N="807" /> to manage and control the fisheries on the Shannon from the source to the sea, and this is done at a time when there is a fisheries inquiry going on.  I should like to know from the Minister why this Bill, giving powers in regard to the control of fishing and the regulation of fishing to an Electricity Board, should be brought forward before we have had the report of the inquiry into the inland fisheries which is now in progress.  It seems to me that the effect of this Bill is either to prejudice the findings of that inquiry or to make it impossible for that inquiry and the results of that inquiry to have any effect upon the Shannon fisheries.</P>
      <P>If this Bill were intended to do what has been assumed&mdash;to make it possible for the Electricity Supply Board to get out of the difficulty of compensating those who claimed that they had been damaged by the operations of that scheme and to get out of it by taking over those fisheries&mdash;it would have been simple and we need not have had added to this Bill all these other propositions regarding the control of fisheries in different parts of the Shannon, and certainly not until we had had the report of the Commission.  I think it is unfortunate that the Bill should have been introduced before we got the report of that Commission, as I take it that, so far as fisheries are concerned, what is desirable and reasonable in the matter of control and regulation of the different types of fishing, in respect of other rivers, would be desirable and reasonable in regard to the Shannon, but this gives the Electricity Supply Board the power to do for the Shannon things the effect on which of the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission we do not know.  Consequently I think the Bill ought not to be pressed at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does rather more than the Minister has hinted at and while I am agreeing that there is need to have a single authority over the Shannon, I am not at all certain that the Electricity Supply Board should be the body, but even if it is, I think it should be set out in this Bill that it must set up another organisation, even if the Board itself has the final veto upon the <Col N="808" /> acts of that other organisation.  One is not so certain that the Electricity Supply Board, and the members of the Electricity Supply Board, are competent to manage fisheries because it is selected for another purpose.  It is chosen because of its capacity in other respects and not for its capacity in respect of fisheries.  I am not sure whether one could not make as good a case for the management by the Electricity Supply Board of the navigation on the Shannon as for the management of the fisheries and probably a much better case could be made for the management of the navigation than for the management of the fisheries.</P>
    <P>There are smaller matters that, perhaps, may have to be raised, but it might be no harm to give the Minister a hint as to one or two of them that will have to be raised on Committee Stage.  One finds in Section 6 that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may transfer to the Board, that is, the Electricity Supply Board, whatever rights he has under the Act of 1925.  There is no question of compensation from the Board to the Minister or to the State for that transfer, but under Section 7, the Office of Public Works, which is another part of the Government, also has power to transfer to the Board its rights in regard to fisheries.  The Minister for Finance there, however, has made quite sure that there will be some recompense.  I should like the Minister to explain why there should be that distinction.  Then, I come to a point about which I am not quite sure.  It is as to whether Section 7 is in order at present unless there are the limitations referred to by Article 11 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>A much more important matter from my point of view arises in connection with the miscellaneous part of the Bill. It deals with prohibitions in respect to fishing with snap nets in the tidal waters&mdash;it is an absolute prohibition&mdash; and with prohibitions in respect to fishing with nets in the fresh waters.</P>
    <P>This question affects a body of men known as the Abbey Guild which the Minister has heard about.  They have made a considerable noise and, I think, have very rightly made a considerable noise in respect to the possible effects <Col N="809" /> of this Bill, and it surprises me that the Ministry should have agreed to the elimination of this institution of Abbey fishermen, because that is, in effect, what is aimed at by this part of the Bill.  This is a body which has been in existence for centuries.  It consists of a group of families which have had certain rights in respect to the fishing, both in the fresh waters and in the tidal waters of the River Shannon.  At present, I think it is composed of about 50 fishermen who have these rights from time immemorial, and they have these properties in the fisheries in their particular area.  They have depended upon fishing with nets in the fresh waters and with snap nets in the tidal waters&mdash;four miles in the fresh waters and four miles in the tidal waters.  This Bill, as drafted&mdash;and I presume the first draft of the Bill that was circulated, really indicates the intentions of the bodies concerned, that is, the Electricity Supply Board and perhaps, the Fisheries Department &mdash;prohibited fishing in fresh water with nets and in tidal waters with snap nets, that is to say, this body of fishermen with rights coming down for centuries, ratified by Parliament, ratified by custom and ratified by everything that could be brought into operation, was to be destroyed utterly by the operation of this Bill, and, as originally proposed, without compensation.  Some amendments have been made and the Minister has told us that in respect to owners of fishery rights who not only own the property in the fisheries, but earn their living by personal activities in those fisheries, they are to have an additional compensation if their rights are taken over.  The question of compensation for injuries does not arise here, but the question of the price to be paid for these fishery rights does arise.  I am not sure whether the prohibition of Section 22, which will be an Act of this House, will entitle this body of fishermen to any compensation at all.  I think not, so that a large part of the livelihood of this group of fishermen will be taken from them by this Act without any compensation coming to them.  In regard to the question of fresh water fishing they are allowed, because they <Col N="810" /> have been fishing within the last 12 months, to continue that until the Electricity Board takes over their rights to fish.  When they take over those rights the Electricity Supply Board will be obliged to pay certain compensation to be fixed by an arbitrator if they cannot arrive at an amicable agreement.  But with all the generosity that the Minister has attempted to exert in the drafting of the amendment which was inserted in the Dáil, regarding this extra compensation, he has not by any means met the equities of the case because the deprivation of a man's property is usually assessed on the basis of the net profit; that is, the profit after expenses have been paid.</P>
    <P>In the case of these men there is not only the profit due to their ownership but there are the earnings which are the wages of their labour, and while it is said that the deprivation of these earnings as workers will be taken into account there is no possibility, as I see it, of any compensation due to this guild, as a guild, for their sons who are coming on and who have naturally expected to take up the work which their fathers, their grandfathers and their great-great-great-grandfathers have followed.  One is surprised at the attitude of the Minister in this matter, in view of the tendency towards a revival of mediæval practices in industry&mdash;the establishment of guilds, for instance.  Here you have a body of men who, as I say, have been working for centuries as an organisation, a continuing body, consisting today of about 50 people who are working and earning a living by this right. It is now proposed, in the interests of the Electricity Supply Board, to take away from them those rights and these opportunities of earning a livelihood and continuing that right to their sons. It is not continuing a right to draw from the fishery a profit rent, but a right to continue earning, a right to work at fishing, and I think there is more than the simple compensation that is suggested in Section 23, as amended, due to those people, if that right is to be taken away.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that what is intended is to give to the Electricity Supply Board the opportunity to get <Col N="811" /> out of a difficulty which a continuous succession of claims for compensation for damage could put upon them, by taking over the property in the fishing, I think the Minister should agree that the right of the Electricity Supply Board in the matter should only be exercised, and exercisable, in cases in which claims for compensation had been submitted.  If these fishermen and others like them put in a claim for compensation, because of injuries, then the Electricity Supply Board ought to have the right to take them over rather than to pay compensation, but if no claim for compensation is submitted, then it seems to me just and reasonable that the rights that these people have exercised in the past should continue unless other reasons than those that have been adduced are submitted.</P>
    <P>It is said that damage has been done to the fisheries.  I think the Minister said in the Dáil that the fears in regard to damage were apparently not going to be fulfilled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is really questionable whether any permanent damage is directly traceable to the electricity supply scheme.  I am not sure that the fishermen concerned, or other fishery owners, will agree with that.  Most of them, I daresay, have put in claims for compensation or, at least, have asserted that they ought to be compensated, but such figures as are available,&mdash;that is to say, the figures for 1927/29 and 1931&mdash;do not prove at all that there has been permanent damage done to the fisheries of the Shannon since that year.  1927 was an extraordinarily good year, not only on the Shannon but on the other rivers.  1929 was a bad year, only half as good as 1927, but the year 1931 rose to three-quarters as good as the best year for many years.  I do not know what the Minister can say in regard to the year 1933.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now going into the realm of theory and talks of the fish that escaped in spawning. I am talking about the fish that were caught.  If the Minister gets into talking about the causes or changes in the quantity of fish caught, he will find himself in an awful ravel because there are as many theories in regard to salmon as there are in regard to herrings and mackerel, and there are as many experts and scientific propositions in regard to the causes of the decline and rise in the quantities going into particular rivers or seas.  So that it is better that the Minister should not be too confident as to what are the causes of any changes in the capture of fish in the Shannon or other rivers.</P>
      <P>I come back to the point that if the Minister is thinking of regulating the fisheries in the interests of the fisheries he surely ought to wait&mdash;and this House ought to ask that he should wait&mdash;until the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission is presented so that we shall know exactly where we are.  To bring this Bill in now in regard to the chief river in the country is, undoubtedly, either to prejudice the Commission or to ask us to assume that the Minister knows what the Commission is going to report, and I think that either of these propositions is damaging to the Minister's reputation for the conduct of affairs in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill, because I think it is desirable that there should be a single authority to co-ordinate the work and to bring the various interests into some kind of harmony.  I am not by any means enamoured of handing over this power, because it is a tremendous power, to the Electricity Supply Board.  If the Electricity Supply Board are to exercise it, I think they should be required to set <Col N="813" /> up a separate organisation of people who are actually concerned in the fisheries and not leave it to any electricity board.  There are people on the Electricity Board interested in the salmon fisheries, and, by the way, it is interesting to note that the representative of one of the largest interests who will have a property to sell is also a member of the Board which will be buying, but that is merely incidental. I think, in any case, that there should be a definite amendment inserted in the Bill requiring the Board to set up a separate organisation to manage the fisheries even if the Electricity Board retains the final say in the policy of that organisation. Apart from that, I would ask the Minister if he would not consider waiting until the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission is presented before legislating in regard to the purely fisheries side of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with a variety of subjects.  It deals with the question of compensation in respect to the injuries caused to the Shannon.  It deals with that and with matters relating purely to the fisheries.  I do not think that the two things should be embodied in the same Bill while we are waiting for a report from the Commission that has been set up specifically to enquire into that subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that the Minister must have as much information about these Shannon fisheries and the injury done by the Electricity Supply Board as is available to any Commission, and for that reason I think we ought not to delay the passing of this measure.  I am greatly disturbed by what Senator Johnson has said in reference to the Abbey fishermen.  I have heard of these Abbey fishermen and of litigation in connection with their rights for the past 30 years.  There is also another class of fishermen at Castleconnell.  I think that their interests and their just claims ought to be adequately dealt with if they are not adequately dealt with under this measure.  I, myself, thought, when reading the Bill, that full provision was made for the Abbey fishermen.  When the Minister <Col N="814" /> said, in the course of his statement, that a certain number of licences were to be issued, I understood that to mean that he was preserving certain rights of certain fishermen who are earning a livelihood in the estuary of the river.  Fisheries and all that relate to them are a greater source of litigation, discontent and quarrelling than any other branch of human activity.</P>

What occurs to me is this: that under this measure it appears that the Electricity Supply Board, the parties who will be alleged to have caused the injury, are the very persons who will measure the damages.  Now, they may be angels, but whatever decision they give will not be accepted by the Abbey fishermen or any other fishermen on the Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an arbitrator appointed, but, in addition to that, you have this further consideration: that the person who alleges that he is injured, and applies for compensation, will apply for compensation under the shadow of the threat that his fishery will be acquired. I do not think that I am wrong in that any more than I am not wrong on the other point, because, taking the view of the fishermen, he will regard the arbitrator in the very same light as he would regard the Electricity Supply Board.  Therefore, I am only pointing out the absolute necessity of convincing the fisherman that his claim will be settled by an absolutely impartial person.  That is necessary. I do not say at all that the Electricity Supply Board, or the arbitrator, will not be perfectly honest, but it is necessary to convince the fisherman <Col N="815" /> that the authority before which his claim goes is an absolutely impartial authority.  It will be hard to convince him.  However, that is a matter which I am sure the Minister has fully considered.</P>
      <P>When I read this Bill I thought it was a very thorough measure, but I am disturbed by what Senator Johnson has said, particularly in regard to the Abbey fishermen.  If there is any doubt on the point that the Abbey fishermen, if their fisheries are taken over, are to get compensation not merely for the right, as an abstract right, but for the loss of employment, you will have serious discontent in Limerick City.  I do not know that I ought to say anything more.  I took this measure as meaning that the Electricity Supply Board would take over complete control of the Shannon fisheries and run them as one big concern. If they do that, or if they take over any particular fishery and let it again then I hope they will have due regard to the persons who have been employed in the fishery before it was acquired, that is, the people fishing for eels, salmon and other things above the weirs at Castleconnell and of the men fishing on the lower reaches of the Shannon in the estuary above Limerick.  I would like very much that their interests should be fully examined, because I have seen a tremendous amount of litigation in reference to the fisheries in the waters where these Abbey fishermen earn their living.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that this is a Bill which will lend itself to more satisfactory discussion on the Committee Stage.  That, I think, is so.  To secure proper investigation when we get to that stage, and to know what to do in the meanwhile, it is necessary that the House should know exactly what the purport of the Bill is, what it means to do, and what its limitations are.  The Minister has told us that the principle of the Bill is to secure to the Electricity Supply Board the whole ownership of the Shannon fisheries.  I should like to ask several questions which I think is <Col N="816" /> the easiest way of dealing with the matter and which will enable me and others to know what to do on the Committee Stage.  Does the Bill apply only to waters vested in the Board or does it apply to the River Shannon, its tributaries, its confluents, lakes and head waters hundreds of miles back, because these are two different things? That is to say, does it involve the abolition of all ownership of fisheries in the Shannon area, other than by the Electricity Supply Board?  If I had from the Minister information on these points, I should know better how to approach the Bill.  I confess that, although I have read it as carefully as I am capable of doing, there did seem to me to be certain contradictory elements in the Bill.  These are important questions and I shall repeat them.  Does the Bill apply only to waters invested in the Board or does it apply to all waters of the whole Shannon system?  Thirdly, does it involve the abolition of all private ownership?</P>

      <P>I confess that I am very jealous of the Shannon electricity scheme which I defended so much in the beginning and which now gradually seems to be swallowing up everything that comes in its way.  The old Shannon drainage scheme was swallowed up and now the fisheries are to be swallowed up.  Goodness knows what is going to happen next.  The fisheries are a very important asset to a great many people in this country. A great deal of money goes into them and they give a great deal of employment, and I confess I should like some assurance as to their future.  It would be difficult, I imagine, to get any such assurance when handing over the fisheries to a Department that does not know anything about fishing.  I think there should be a separate body who would control the fisheries if they have to be handed over to the Electricity Supply Board, who have already altogether too much to do.  They began in a very small way, and I think we should be very careful in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Johnson's suggestion that this Bill be postponed until the findings of <Col N="817" /> the Fishery Commission, which is now sitting and of which I am a member, are made known.  I do so because of the fact that I believe this Bill is brought in to hand over at a rather inopportune moment the largest river and the most important fishery or potential fishery, that could possibly exist in these islands.  I think that it is an admission that the Electricity Supply Board and its works have practically destroyed the fisheries on the River Shannon.  I believe that there is a considerable volume of well-informed opinion which is of the belief that if the Shannon were developed as a fishery to the extent of which it is capable, it would be more important, as an asset to the nation, than even the generating of electricity. However that may be, we must all recognise in the Shannon fisheries immense potentialities in regard to the development of the fishery industry of this country, a means of producing a very valuable commodity for export, and a means of attracting tourists to the country.  The fact is that under this Bill, this whole vast stretch of water is to be handed over to a body which is not primarily concerned with fisheries, and whose greatest concern is the development of electricity.</P>
      <P>I notice in Section 8, Part III of the Act, the following:</P>
      <P>In addition, but subject and without prejudice to, the primary function of maintaining, working, and developing the Shannon hydro-electric works under and in pursuance of the Act of 1927, as amended or extended by subsequent legislation, the Board shall have and perform the duty of managing, conducting and preserving the Shannon fisheries under and in accordance with this Act.</P>
      <P>Other sections of the Bill enable the Board to acquire every fishing right on the Shannon where they have a grievance, because of the activities of the Electricity Supply Board.  Whether the fishery has been injured or not injured, the Bill would give them power to acquire these fisheries, to develop them in the interests of the country or to neglect them in the interests of electricity whichever would seem to them the more appropriate course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> Senator Johnson has referred to the Abbey fishermen.  In the Abbey fishermen we have a body of individuals comprised of small farmers and labourers drawn from about 60 families who have certain rights on the freshwater portion of the river.  I think it is one of the very few cases in Ireland where that is permitted.  These families have, in the course of time, formed a guild or corporation.  There are certain well-recognised rights regarding succession and the right to fish in that particular stretch of the river.  They also argue that they have a right to go down and fish in the tidal portion of the river in the estuary.  They have been prejudiced to some extent in that by decisions given in the law courts from time to time.  However, they maintain that they have the right to fish in the estuary, the tidal portion of the Shannon.  This Bill, as originally drafted, would absolutely wipe out these men's rights.  It would deny them the right of fishing at all in the freshwater portion of the river, but owing to an amendment which was inserted in the Dáil and which is now contained in Section 23, these men's rights seem to be recognised, but even though it is recognised that they can fish legally, in that freshwater portion of the river, the Bill still gives the Electricity Supply Board the right to purchase them out, willy-nilly, whether they like it or not. That seems to me a great hardship because there is no evidence as far as I have been able to gather to prove that this particular exigency exists.</P>
    <P>These people say that they are quite prepared to go on fishing as they fished for generations back, as they fished back to the time of the siege of Limerick in 1690 or 1691.  It seems rather an extraordinary thing that those men should be deprived of a right which they have exercised so long, a right which they have controlled and kept within reasonable limits.  There is no evidence to show that the fishing of the river in the freshwater portion of it by those men has resulted in any diminution of the quantity of fish in the Shannon.  They have a well-defined system by which each four persons, in virtue of the position in which they live, and by virtue of a <Col N="819" /> right inherited from their forefathers, are entitled to fish.  I am assured that it takes four of them to form a boat crew, and that if there are only three available for a boat they will not be allowed to fish or will not be allowed to take an outsider.  Each individual fishing that portion of the river must be a descendant or a son of a fisherman who enjoyed the right before him.  I think in this case we have a number of men who deserve very careful consideration before we agree to a measure which would absolutely put the fishery in the hands of the Electricity Supply Board, which is not a fishing body and which was not constituted for the purpose of developing fishing or safeguarding it.  We would put in their hands the lives and the fortunes of a number of men such as I have described, the Abbey fishermen.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing against the rights or the wrongs of freshwater fishing by net.  These Abbey fishermen fish by snap nets, which are nets about 21 feet in length, operated between two boats. This Bill prohibits their using these nets in the tidal portion of the river. In Section 23 the Bill admits their legal right but at the same time retains for the Electricity Supply Board the right to take over particular portions of the river and so deprive these men of a means of livelihood.  The Bill also provides systems by which they may get reasonable compensation. Considering that all those peculiar and unfortunate situations arise under this Bill, I, as a member of the Comsion which is sitting at the present time and which, I believe, will report at the furthest within the next three or four months, would like to support Senator Johnson's suggestion to the Minister, to withdraw this Bill for the time being or to delay the passage of it until such time as the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission, is submitted, so that an opportunity would be given to them and to this House to try to reconcile the provisions of this Bill with its recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible <Col N="820" /> for the Government to agree to this Bill being withdrawn until the Inland Fisheries Commission had submitted its report.  The necessity for legislation of this kind has been outstanding for a long time.  A committee of representatives of the various departments interested met over four years ago to consider the position that had arisen in respect to the Shannon fisheries and submitted a recommendation to the Government then in office for the enactment of legislation which, in broad outline, was similar to that now before the Seanad.  A Bill was introduced by the last Government in the Dáil and it reached a certain stage in that House when the general election occurred and the Bill was cancelled thereby.  On coming into office the present Government directed that the matter should be further examined and another committee was established which, throughout 1932 and 1933, went into the matter in great detail again and submitted a report which again recommended that the only possible manner of dealing with the Shannon fishery problem was to secure a uniform ownership and control and that it was best to vest that ownership in the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>The situation, therefore, is, as some Senators are aware, one which is gradually becoming worse.  I stated in the Dáil that as yet there was no evidence that the operation of the Shannon electricity works had reduced the run of fish in the river, but it is a matter of grave doubt as to what happens to the fish that enter the river.  A great number enter the tail race and it is not quite clear what happens those that do.  Others make their way up the old river, where the flow of water is considerably reduced and they have to run the gauntlet of the Abbey fishermen who, whatever difficulty they may have had in taking fish in the old days when there was plenty of water, have now very little difficulty in catching whatever salmon they want as the fish are making their way up the reduced river that is now flowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for works and these <Col N="821" /> works must be undertaken if the fish are to ascend the river to the spawning beds, and if the fish do not get up to the spawning beds the Shannon fisheries are going to be destroyed for a long number of years.  Senators are probably aware that any reduction in the amount of spawn produced in the river will not be immediately noticeable. It takes a year or two for the young fish to get out to the sea and they remain at sea for a few years before they come back again to the river.  In such circumstances it is only very gradually that the deterioration of the fishing would be evident.  Last year, owing to the drought and the depletion in the flow of the water, the spawning beds themselves became exposed, the birds fed upon the ova and immense damage was done to the fisheries.  In addition to that, there is the complication created by the fact that claims for compensation are arising and they must be met, leaving the problem entirely unsolved after the expenditure of a large sum of money, or else substituted for by the payment of the acquisition prices proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not proposed for the purpose of getting the Electricity Supply Board out of a dilemma.  It is a wrong idea that the Electricity Supply Board wanted this measure or that they were enthusiastic on the subject of being given control of the Shannon fisheries. I am quite certain that the electricians and the engineers and those responsible for carrying on the Shannon electricity works had rather an antipathy to these additional functions being conferred on the Board.  But the Board is itself an organisation created and owned by the State and there is no more difference in giving the ownership of these fisheries to that semi-State institution than there would be in giving them to the State itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obligatory in common sense.  It is the obvious thing for the Board to do.  The only practical alternative to giving over the ownership of these fisheries to the Electricity Supply Board is for the State to acquire them themselves and establish another organisation.  There would be no obligation on the State to establish that other organisation, but it would be the obvious thing to do.  You would then have two rival authorities on the Shannon, each operating perhaps to the detriment of the other.  It is the opinion of those who went into the matter with great thoroughness that you can secure all the advantages of nationalisation as regards the fisheries and develop the hydro-electric scheme by conferring the ownership on the Electricity Supply Board and charging them primarily with the function of operating and developing the hydro-electric scheme, and secondarily with the function of developing the fisheries. You can in that way secure the full benefit for the nation of the potentialities of the Shannon from the point of view of electricity and fishery development.</P>
      <P>The matter referred to by Senator Johnson in respect to Sections 6 and 7 is something that we can discuss in Committee.  In brief, the fisheries which the Minister for Industry and Commerce owns as a result of acquiring stretches of the river during the construction period are of no value, and in giving them to the Electricity Supply Board we are not giving them much.  But the fisheries which the Commissioners of Public Works own are in some cases of very considerable value indeed and it is quite right that the Electricity Supply Board should have charged against it the capital value of such fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made here that the Abbey fishermen should be allowed to remain undisturbed.  That is completely impossible&mdash;at least not impossible, but if we were to allow them to remain undisturbed the whole Bill would have to be dropped; the whole idea of developing the Shannon fisheries or having unified control would have to be abandoned.  The <Col N="823" /> Abbey fishermen are in the key position. They command a very valuable stretch of fisheries on the fresh water immediately above the tail race and if they are to remain in existence and be allowed to continue to exercise their very liberal rights of fishing&mdash; they have a right to fish by day and by night and they have other facilities nobody else possesses&mdash;if they are allowed to fish in that manner all question of developing the fisheries in the manner which the experts consider necessary will have to be abandoned.  We all have sympathy with the Abbey men and because of that we are inclined to treat them as generously as possible, to pay them, not merely full compensation for the acquisition of property, but also for the loss of their employment, even taking into account the fact that the employment was not merely for the present members of that community but for their sons and grandsons. Our obligation is limited to giving that generous treatment.  I do not think we should allow our sympathy to get us into the position that Senator Johnson has got into, where he claims that the existence of an immemorial right to property even if held by some people who work that property for a livelihood, is to be advanced as an argument against what is, in fact, the nationalisation of these fisheries in order to increase their value and secure their operation for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Snap netting on the tidal waters has not been resorted to for some years.  There has been no such licence issued for many years past.  In 1927 there were two such licences issued. All the fishing has been by the draft or the drift nets and, in so far as they are concerned, we are proposing to authorise the number of licences equal to the number issued in 1934 and 1933.  Nobody who has been engaged in getting a livelihood from fishing with draft or drift nets in tidal waters is going to be deprived of it, but there is going to be no addition to the numbers engaged.  People up the river who are going to be compensated for their fisheries, as we hope generously, <Col N="824" /> cannot subsequently come to the tidal waters and destroy the whole scheme by over-fishing that portion.  There is no question that the Shannon is over-fished. There are too many engines and nets permitted in the estuary and there is too much fishing in the fresh water.  The value of the fisheries has been depleted on that account.  Any expert on fisheries will tell you what very valuable national asset these fisheries could be made.  Senator Duffy referred to that when he said that the Shannon could be made more valuable as a fishery than as a means of developing electricity.  That can be done only on the basis of completely eliminating all the existing instruments for taking fish out of the river and concentrating your fisheries in one particular place under competent management, or getting as near as possible to that position.  As regards the Abbey fishermen, this immemorial right they have had has to be terminated in this generation if the Shannon fisheries are to be developed.  Our proposal is to give them not merely similar compensation to that which other fishery owners will secure under the Bill, but to give them additional compensation based on their loss of employment.  I am inclined to be as generous as it is possible for us to be in determining the basis on which that compensation is to be assessed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say the Electricity Supply Board will take over all these fishing rights so that they may concentrate all the rights into one and leave that one a private institution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The fisheries of the Shannon are defined in Section 2. They include the whole of the Shannon and the tributaries, right from the source to the sea.  The Bill does not transfer all the fisheries to the Board. It enables the Board to acquire them compulsorily if it thinks it necessary to do so.  It is quite possible that the Electricity Supply Board would not be interested in the fisheries in some of the tributaries flowing into the estuary.  They may confine their activities to the Shannon itself, but that is a matter that they will have to be guided upon by their advisers. <Col N="825" /> The intention is that a subsidiary company should be formed which would exercise for the Electricity Supply Board the functions of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether it is possible that the Abbey fishermen and all those other separate rights may be taken over by the Electricity Supply Board and, let us say, be left in the hands of the Lax weir owners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible under the Bill as framed, but it is not the intention.  The intention is that all the private owners on that portion of the river are likely to be removed forthwith and the fisheries there concentrated in the Electricity Supply Board.  It is there that the works to develop the fisheries are most urgently required.  The fact that a gentleman who was a manager of one of the most important fisheries on the Shannon is a member of the Electricity Supply Board has little bearing on this except that there is on the Electricity Supply Board one member, at any rate, who is probably the best authority we could have upon the Shannon fisheries.  It does not affect the situation because of the fact that the Electricity Supply Board will be acquiring that particular property.  The Board will acquire the property on the basis determined by the arbitrator, who will be appointed under the Acquisition of Land Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not correct, as Senator Duffy said, that the Shannon works are destroying the fisheries.  The Shannon works have, undoubtedly, destroyed some of the fisheries and interfered with the river to a considerable extent, but it was not the construction or the operation of the Shannon works alone which had the bad effect on the fisheries, but the existence of these works, plus the fact that everybody who was making a livelihood by fishing on the river continued to endeavour to get the same livelihood by fishing on the river.  You had, therefore, on the river itself, and particularly upon the fresh waters of the river between the weir and the tailrace, an undue <Col N="826" /> amount of fishing, which made it impossible for the spawning fish to get up and lay their ova.  I think that most of the other matters that were raised had better be discussed in Committee.  There are a number of sections in the Bill which may require elaboration before their meaning is quite clear, but if the matter comes up on Committee, I shall endeavour to give all possible information on the point.</P>
    <P>The one thing I wish to stress now is that it is regarded as essential to the future of the Shannon fisheries that this change over should take place now, and, particularly, that the change over should take place in the form contemplated by this Bill, so that we will have the position, which we consider to be the most practicable in the circumstances, created, namely, a position in which all the fisheries, or most of the fisheries, will be in the hands of a semi-State institution and managed, preserved and developed by it, having regard to the other obligation of maintaining and developing the hydro-electric works at the same time, without producing a conflict of interest and to produce that position on the basis of adequate compensation to the private interests affected.  That is the whole purpose of the Bill.  There are certain other provisions embodied in it, some of which affect purely fishery concerns and which should perhaps be defended by the Minister for Fisheries rather than the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but they are only incidental to the main scheme which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>The procedure of the House is that on a Second Reading debate, when apparently everybody has spoken, I call on the Minister to close the debate.  I have called on the Minister to close it and the debate is closed.  That is the position of affairs. It was within your competency, any of you, to move that the question that the Bill be read a Second Time be taken two years hence, a year hence, a month hence, a fortnight hence, or this day week, but nobody chose to do that.  Senator Johnson knew it quite well, I think, but he did not want to do it.</P>

      <P>This seems to me to be a case in which a Select Committee might be set up.  Again, I do not think there is any necessity for a long delay and, in fact, I would hope there would not be, but we do need the information that is available to the Minister. He has spoken of departmental committees, but so far as I know there has been no report and there would not be a report of a departmental committee.  I am satisfied that there is need for examination of the principles of this Bill and that information should be made available.  With a view to sounding the House as to whether a Select Committee on this Bill should be set up, I would formally move that that course be taken.</P>

      <P>I think that what Senator Johnson says is quite unreasonable.  There are really only two points that were discussed.  The first question was the measure of compensation in regard to the Abbey fishermen in respect of their fishing rights that were to be acquired and, the second, the tribunal that was to determine the amount of compensation. There was also the question of whether the fishery was to be acquired or not. Surely, these can be dealt with on Committee Stage?</P>

      <P>I move that motion, but I should like to hear some views on the matter.  I do not want to press it against the views of the House at all.</P>

      <P>I think that ordinary Committee discussion would suffice, but I think a little time ought to be given because the scope of the Bill is enormously greater than most of us realised.  I think if it were held over until after Christmas we would have time to look into it and to prepare any amendments we think necessary.</P>
