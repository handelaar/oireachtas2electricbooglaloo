      <P>This Bill is in part a simple one, and has for its object, taking power to vary, either by addition or omission, the countries to which the benefit of the preferential rate, attached to any duty, applies, and in respect of future duties where there is a preferential rate, to enable the countries, to whom the benefit of that rate will be extended, to be determined, subsequent to the enactment of the duties.  At the present time, the Saorstát is required to extend, automatically, to countries of the Commonwealth the benefit of any preferential rate that may be in operation, and the Saorstát is the only country in the Commonwealth that adopts that practice.  It is considered desirable that that should be terminated, and that, in future, the benefit of preferential duties should be granted only to countries with which we have made agreements requiring such treatment. It is not contemplated that the powers in this Bill will be used to any great extent but it is thought desirable that the Saorstát should have such powers. It is provided that every order shall cease to have effect, and will become invalid, at the expiration of three months from the making thereof, unless such order is approved of by the Dáil by resolution passed before the expiration of the said three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems most extraordinary that a Bill of this importance should be allowed to pass, so far, through the House, without any comment. The reason I did not speak upon the Second Reading Stage was that I accepted the position taken up by the Government in this particular case, that is, that preferences should not be automatic, but that they should be the basis of agreements.  But I would not like to be taken as agreeing that the passing of this Bill, without comment, was an assumption that we should not make a very big effort to continue those preferences that have resulted in advantages to ourselves.  I take it, for instance, that the Government would not, in any circumstances, make any difference between ourselves and Canada because we have a specific agreement with Canada.  The powers given by a Bill of this kind could be used for putting pressure upon India and on other Dominions in the endeavour to secure that they should give us as good treatment as Canada does.  The fact, is that we are not getting fair treatment from some parts of the British Commonwealth&mdash;at least, I do not think we are.  Preferences are given by some of these Dominions to Great Britain which do not apply here. Of course, that is their affair, and they must judge for themselves whether they are acting wisely or not.  But I think it is plain that while that state of affairs exists it is up to our Government to take what steps they can to see that our traders and manufacturers here doing business with those Dominions should feel that our Government has done its best to get reciprocal consideration for them.  The Government knows the difficulties experienced by our traders in regard to some of these Dominions.  I believe that applies to New Zealand.  Negotiations, I believe, are going on with India.  I presume the Minister is not yet in a position to make any statement with <Col N="1208" /> regard to them but I hope he soon will be.  I make these comments because as the Bill is now going through all its stages I would like to make clear the reasons why I supported such a measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is somewhat as Senator Douglas has stated. In the case of Canada there is an agreement under which we are bound to give most-favoured-nation treatment to the products of that country.  We concluded an agreement with South Africa which was not of great importance and to which I refer because it was the only type of agreement possible with that country.  It is an agreement which sets out certain definite concessions to be given by each party.  In the case of India negotiations are at present in progress. They were adjourned for some weeks to enable the Indian delegates to get more specific instructions from their Government.  In the case of Australia and New Zealand I think it would be correct to say that negotiations are in progress but have not advanced very far yet.  I think there is reason to believe we will be able to get down more definitely to the making of agreements with these countries at some time in the near future.  In each case, we propose to use as bargaining factors the concessions at present enjoyed by these countries.  The question of the continuance of these concessions will arise and it is necessary therefore to have the power to continue or withdraw those concessions as the results of negotiations may determine.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the statement just made I understand that there are negotiations going on at present with India.  Is the reason that we are giving preference to Indian tea, to enable us, subsequently, to be in a position to make a deal on the strength of our purchases from India?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There always has been a preferential rate of duty, in respect <Col N="1209" /> of tea, the benefit of which is being enjoyed by India.  What arises in these negotiations is whether that is going to continue and that will depend upon our getting from India similar preferential treatment.</P>

      <P>I have always wondered why China tea should have to pay a heavier Customs duty than any other.  As a matter of fact, China tea is far more healthy than Indian tea as everyone knows who has lived in India.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to advise the House as to the order of business for next week.  As far as I can see, the only business that we are likely to have is the Bill which concerns this House so intimately&mdash;Constitution (Amendment No. 24) Bill.  I would like to know from the Minister for Lands if we are likely to have that Bill in time for Wednesday next.</P>

      <P>There appears to be some doubt as to whether Constitution (Amendment No. 24) Bill will be finally passed by the Dáil in time to be placed on the Order Paper for a meeting of the Seanad on Wednesday next, but if it is, we shall take it on Wednesday. In that connection, I would suggest that the House should make an Order that it be taken as the first public business on that day, the debate to continue until 8 o'clock.  The House will adjourn at that hour if the debate on the Bill has not then concluded, the debate to be resumed at 3 o'clock on the following day.  I suggest that Senators should not allow any other business to be introduced while the House is engaged on the discussion of that important Bill.  Is the House agreed?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>As the President is in charge of that Bill I will advise him in regard to our procedure.  The <Col N="1211" /> House will now stand adjourned until possibly next Wednesday, but if the Constitution (Amendment No. 24) Bill <Col N="1212" /> is not ready to come before us on that date, the House will not meet until Wednesday, 6th June.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.20 p.m.</P>
