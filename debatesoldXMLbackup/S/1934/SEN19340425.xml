      <P>I move: &ldquo;That leave be given to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the law relating to local government franchise and to the registration of local government electors.&rdquo;  This is a motion for leave to introduce the Local Government (Extension of Franchise) Bill, 1934.  On the 12th July last, the question that the Bill of 1933 &ldquo;Be now read a Second Time&rdquo; was declared to be defeated.  The Bill for which leave is now sought is the same Bill as that previously before the Seanad, with certain alterations, without which the original Bill would not fully achieve its object.  The alteration suggested in the new Bill is one which refers to the date.  The original Bill purposed to make the extended franchise cover those qualified on the 15th November last.  The new Bill aims at doing so, too, but verbal change in the terms of the Bill is <Col N="1038" /> necessary to make this effective.  This Bill, as Senators will remember, was before the House for its Second Reading on 12th July last.  It embodied a right that the Government feel should be afforded to all the ordinary adult voters in the country to enable them to take part and to vote in local elections. We feel that it is quite anomalous that voters who have the right to vote at the parliamentary elections for Deputies to the Dáil should be deprived of the right to vote at elections for the local authorities. It is for that reason and to give the widest possible franchise to all the adults of the country that this measure was introduced.  I do not feel that any real argument can be put up against the measure as it was drafted.  I feel that in these days, when we are hearing so much about democracy and the democratic rights of the people, that it is absurd&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently the attitude of mind of the country received a new light on the question of adult suffrage, and the rights of all adult electors to be entitled to exercise the franchise at the local elections.  It is for that reason that we feel that it is due to this House and to the Oireachtas generally that members should get an opportunity of reconsidering their <Col N="1039" /> attitude as expressed on the 12th July last.  The leader of the Opposition stated on April 15th, according to the Press reports that &ldquo;they were at a great disadvantage that the youth had not got a vote at these elections.  It is our purpose to give the youth of this country a say, not only in national affairs, but in local affairs too.&rdquo;  I may say that I entirely agree with that view.  I feel that it is the logical thing to expect that, with that view being expressed by the leader of the Opposition throughout the country, the Government should give the opportunity which he seems to seek by the statement he has made.  Following that statement the Minister for Local Government clearly intimated through the Press that he was prepared to remove this disadvantage which had been referred to, and he promised to give the Seanad an opportunity of reconsidering its decision at the earliest moment.  That really accounts for the introduction of the measure here to-day.</P>
      <P>It is only fair, perhaps, to point out that after the statement which I have quoted was made, the newspapers carried a further statement, and in that the leader of the Opposition made it clear that he was not prepared to exercise any pressure either on the Dáil or on the Seanad to have this measure carried into effect.  I would suggest that there are many things on which we do not seek to exercise pressure, but when that suggestion is made, I feel that those of his loyal supporters who are members of this House will be only too glad to avail themselves of the opportunity to bring into effect what he clearly intimated.  He goes on to say further in his statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My proposals for giving youth a voice and responsibility in connection with local government will be presented in a very different spirit and a very different way from Mr. O'Kelly's, and they will commend themselves to the country for the reason that they will associate youth with these matters in a spirit of unification and construction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it somewhat difficult to analyse just what that means.  It is <Col N="1040" /> either too vague or too subtle for me. I do not know in what sense it is meant.  The Minister for Local Government, in bringing this measure here, and the Government in presenting this measure in both Houses, had very definitely in mind the extension of the franchise on purely democratic grounds because we feel it is an intrinsic right of the youth of the country to have a voice in the election of those who are responsible for all branches of administration in the country.  I feel that the quotations which I have given, and the spirit in which we have interpreted these quotations, are an adequate reason and justification for the Seanad changing its view of July 12th last year.  If an additional reason were needed, perhaps one further quotation from the statement of the leader of the Opposition might be read.  It is this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since last autumn the position in the country has so changed and the Blue Shirts have grown so strong, that adult suffrage would now be much more favourable to us than to the present Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a statement on which I do not profess to be in a position to express an opinion.  It is a matter of opinion. It is a matter which can only be decided when the different candidates go before the country at the next election.  It will be decided by the votes of the people and since Gen. O'Duffy feels that it will be to the advantage of his Party to have the widest extension of franchise and that he wants the youth of the country to be represented and to have votes in that election, I feel the last argument against this Bill being introduced here has been made.  Whatever the result, in how far his opinion is justified or otherwise, we are prepared to stand for this principle not because it may be to our advantage but because we believe it is intrinsically the right thing that in these elections, the fullest possible franchise should be exercised.  It has to be remembered that this question of the extension of the franchise to adults over 21 years has been under consideration right back to 1922 or 1923, and it has always been felt that <Col N="1041" /> adult suffrage was the only fair basis of representation.  Moreover, I feel, as I have said already, that those people who are competent to vote for the election of Deputies to the Dáil are surely equally competent and entitled to vote for the election of people to local bodies.  That is all I have to say in justification for the introduction of this measure to-day.  I think that if the matter is looked at reasonably, from the point of view of its merits and in view of the statements and challenges that have been thrown out, the Seanad has no alternative but to give this Bill a First Reading and to pass it as it left the Dáil.  It is the only justification we can have from those Senators who have lectured us on democracy, as to the dangers of a dictatorship and all the rest.  Here is a test of democracy, a test as to whether they really believe in democratic rule or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to make a speech.  My purpose in rising is to ask a question which I think is quite pertinent. I was not in the House when the Minister for Lands rose to move his motion.  The question that I wish to ask is this: Is this Bill identical with the Bill which was rejected by the Seanad in July, 1933?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I answer that question?  It is exactly the same except as regards the phrase which makes the necessary change of date. The only change is one merely of phraseology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as the Minister for Lands has said, was before the Seanad ten months ago.  It occupied the time of the House for a couple of days.  The pros and cons of the measure were fully discussed.  All the arguments for and against were gone into at great length.  In the meantime, nothing has happened in the sphere of local government to cause a change in the ratepayers' point of view.  It has always been maintained as <Col N="1043" /> a good, sound principle of democracy that whoever pays the piper ought to have the calling of the tune.  The people who have the right to elect persons to these local boards are the people who have to provide the money to enable the local services to be carried on.  They are the most responsible people in the country&mdash;people who are not likely to go wrong.  I have no reason whatever for opposing anything in the nature of a test for the Government, as regards getting the mind of the people, by means of an election.  If the Government are desirous of finding out what the people at the present time think of them then the proper course for them is to have an election on a parliamentary issue and not to bring politics into local government, which should be concerned entirely with economical administration and good service: good service in return for the money that has to be paid by people who can very ill afford it at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intrinsic right of youth to govern has been quoted in support of the introduction of this measure.  My answer is that if the youth of 21, if all irresponsible young fellows, are to be allowed to vote, then let us give that right to every youth: to the whole population, from babies up.  Senators <Col N="1044" /> know very well that the only people who pay rates in this country are householders.  It may be argued that indirectly other people pay.  I think that the present basis of representation for local bodies is the best you can have.  It was introduced in the old days when we were part of the United Kingdom.  It has been my experience that it is very difficult to improve on British legislation.  I am not saying that changes should not be made in cases where it is found desirable to make them.  In the case of these local bodies the moneys which they disburse are contributed by the ratepayers.  As to the people who should be elected to these local boards. I hold that is essentially a question for the ratepayers and for them alone. These were the reasons I gave ten months ago in opposition to the Bill that was then before the House.  I think this Bill is really political strategy on the part of the Executive &mdash;to bring in something so that if, perhaps, they are beaten at the polls when the local government elections take place they can have some excuse. For these reasons, I am opposing the introduction of this Bill.  I hope the House will support me in my endeavour and, therefore, keep the position as it is.</P>

The Clerk was informed that it was the desire of the Government to take the Town and Regional Planning Bill, and the Local Services (Temporary Economies) (No. 2) Bill, and for that purpose I arranged with Mr. Lemass to postpone his Bills in order to facilitate the Vice-President.  Only that I received such information I would not have proposed to go on with the Town and Regional Planning Bill.  It is not Mr. Lemass's fault that he is not here, in view of the arrangement I made. The position now is that the Minister for Lands has been good enough to try to get some of the Ministers.

This Bill, as introduced, is substantially the same as the Act passed in Great Britain, and I am informed by some acquaintances who are architects that caravans are held not to be a structure, and that the Act has been evaded even in the case of advertisements by getting old lorries which, because they are on wheels, are held not to be a structure. The amendments have been suggested by prominent architects in Dublin, because it is desirable to have powers to enable the Department to deal with anything that may be on wheels which, in the strict sense of the word, is not a structure.  If the Minister is not in a position to accept the amendments, I would ask him to look carefully into the matter.</P>

    <P>10.&mdash;(1)  A planning authority or a responsible authority may, for any purpose arising in relation to the making, enforcement, or carrying out of a planning scheme, by notice in writing require the occupier of any land or structure in the area to which such planning scheme relates or is intended to relate or any person receiving, whether for himself or for another, rent out of any such land or structure to state in writing to such planning authority or responsible authority (as the case may be), within a specified time not less than 14 days after being so required, particulars of the estate, interest, or right by virtue of which he occupies <Col N="1048" /> such land or structure or receives such rent (as the case may be), and the name and address, and the estate, interest, or right (so far as they are known to him) of every person who to his knowledge has any estate or interest in or right over or in respect of such land or structure.</P>

    <P>(2)  The responsible authority shall not be entitled to recover under this section expenses incurred by them where either the occasioning act or omission was done or omitted under and in accordance with a special permission or the occasioning act or omission was an act which consisted solely of the completion of work which either was begun before and was in progress on the relevant date or was begun under and in accordance with a general permission and in either case was not done in contravention of a special prohibition.</P>
    <P>(3)  All moneys recoverable under this section by the responsible authority in respect of expenses incurred by such responsible authority shall, immediately upon completion of the work or thing in the doing of which such expenses were so incurred, become and be a charge on the land on which such work or thing was done or, in the case of any work or thing done on or to a structure, on such structure (if and so far as it still exists) and the land on, in, or under which it is or was situate.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 57 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>57.&mdash;(1)  When a planning authority has passed a resolution for the making of a planning scheme and has, before such planning scheme comes into operation, made a special prohibition in relation to any work, such planning authority may, if they are of opinion that the prejudicial effect of proceeding with or doing the work to which such special prohibition relates would be of such nature as to be incapable of being remedied after the coming into operation of such planning scheme, declare, at any time before such planning scheme comes into operation, that any contravention of such special prohibition shall be penal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Every person who proceeds with or does any work in contravention <Col N="1057" /> of a special prohibition which a planning authority has under this section declared to be penal, shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new section. It is being introduced to meet certain views expressed by members of the Dáil during the Report Stage of the Bill.  It is conceivable that, where a work is prohibited, the work may still be undertaken and damage done which could not be subsequently repaired, as in the case of the demolition of a structure of artistic or historic interest.  Where a work is undertaken in contravention of a prohibition, the only provision in the Bill is that no compensation is payable, and the owner or occupier can be required to remove the building or put the land into proper order and condition at his own expense. The section proposed to be added takes power to make penal any contravention of a special provision, and I recommend that the section be added to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this provision is necessary because if an occupier or owner disobeyed the prohibition, when told to stop the carrying on of some work where a planning system was being carried out, and there was no penalty provided in the Bill, he could not be punished.  This amendment makes action of that kind penal.</P>

      <P>One aspect of this question has been worrying me, and I have not found a way of meeting it.  I refer to a point raised in the Dáil with regard to the cutting of trees.  That is a matter we have not been able to deal with, so far.  Under the Forestry Acts, there is power to stop the cutting of trees but not in urban areas or county boroughs.  There are places in and around this city and other cities where, owing to extensive building operations, clumps of trees and single trees are running a very grave risk, including trees we should like to see preserved. If we knew that, in a certain area, trees which we would like to see preserved were in danger of being cut down owing to a building scheme, we could possibly step in and stop the cutting, but the difficulty raised in the Dáil had to do with preserving certain specified trees in urban districts and county boroughs.  I have given considerable thought to that situation but I have not yet found a way of meeting it.  If anybody has any suggestion which would meet that situation, I should be very glad to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way of dealing with the situation which the Minister contemplates would be to take power to apply for and obtain an injunction. That could be done in the space of an hour or two.  And it may be a continuing injunction.  So far as I know that would be much more effective than the provision here with a penalty which is a single penalty.  Probably the Minister might consider that.  Supposing a tree was singled out to be cut down, it is quite possible, having regard to the arrangements provided now, to go at once and, in the course of a few hours, get an injunction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to refer, in reality, to two or three sections, and I think that this might be a suitable time.  There is provision that where there is arbitration and payment for betterment has to be made the arbitrator may fix a time when the payment is to be made and may, if he thinks fit, provide that it be payable by instalments.  I should be glad if the Minister would tell us whether, in the event of agreement for the payment of betterment, the local authority could make a similar arrangement, or make it at once.  It might be that they could and that it might not be necessary to provide for that.  I think it is desirable that if that is so it should be known.  There is objection to planning schemes by persons who believe that they should make payment for betterment.  There is, I believe, such difficulty in England. What I want to make clear is that the man who is to have his property improved and who finds that the payment is gradual over a series of years, will put no difficulties in the way of the scheme, because he will have the assurance that he will be able to provide for the betterment.  Reading the sections together it does not seem to me that that is so clear.  It is clear where there is an arbitration, but where you want to bring people into a scheme it seems to me it should be possible to make payment to the local authority by instalments.  That might be clear, but I do not think it is and I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.</P>

      <P Just="Center">TITLE.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Title be the Title of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the subject of the Title I want to put to the Minister a question that I raised on the Second Reading: Whether it is possible, on this Bill, to make provision that would enable a local planning authority, or a local authority that might become a planning authority, for these minor purposes such as the prevention of the destruction of the amenities of a town or a district to do so without having to compile a planning scheme?  It is pretty well recognised that there are many towns and districts which have been destroyed from a scenic or amenities point of view by ugly advertisements and dilapidated buildings being allowed to remain and to become probably destructive of any decency in that town; yet the local authority is not able to deal with these minor matters until they have gone to the trouble and expense of a planning scheme.  Now it strikes me that this Bill will be of very little use for a long time so far as it affects the country as a whole, until the smaller towns have had experience of what the larger towns have done. Until there has been a great deal of attention given which is not possible until the local authorities' officials have more time to spare than they have at present, very little planning in such districts will be done at all. But these authorities would like to have power to move those undesirable dilapidated structures or advertisements in undesirable places.  I have in mind, and I am sure every Senator <Col N="1066" /> could multiply the illustration, where, in reference to one of the most interesting archeological objects of the country, we have, right up against the wall, planted a hoarding advertising somebody's cure all.  It certainly ought to be in the power of the local authority to control these matters. We have in many small towns hoardings that destroy the local views and that generally make the place hideous.  The same applies to some of the dilapidated buildings in some of these districts.  A public authority if it is to be treated fairly and wants to make decent its surroundings should have the power to do so.  Their plan might be very small and such only indeed as to touch that particular view of the subject.  They might compile a scheme dealing with what might seem to be required before they would come to advise a much more detailed and more important plan and therefore, that power should be given to these authorities is a very desirable thing.  I hope it will not be found impossible for the Minister to introduce an amendment of that kind.  If it is I would plead that some new Bill should be brought in to give such power to the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what has been said by Senator Johnson on this question of dilapidated buildings, advertisements hoardings and eyesores in general. It should be a simple matter to have legislation, even in this measure, to give local authorities power to deal with a question of that kind.  I observe that the Minister does not consider that in the present measure we could deal with that subject.  That being so, I do hope that we shall have a measure expressly designed to meet the crying evil of these advertisements and these eyesores, especially on structures of archeological interest. Senator Johnson referred to some advertisements for pills and he appealed to other Senators to give examples of advertisements they have seen.  The most remarkable advertisement I ever saw was an advertisement for a cure for rheumatism which was pasted up on Maire Ruadh's stronghold in Co. Clare.  Certainly there was the past <Col N="1067" /> and the future meeting.  It is an offence to the good sense and the good taste of the people&mdash;in fact, it is an offence to every proper sentiment of the people of this country&mdash;to have things like that done.  It is advertising gone mad and I am sure that every member of the Seanad will agree that some check should be put upon the man with the paste-pot and the brush.  I hope other Senators will also express their approval of what Senator Johnson has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to join in the sentiments expressed by preceding Senators.  There are some advertisements that are less objectionable and less unsightly than others. From my point of view, the most objectionable eyesores to be seen around our city and other cities are the political slogans which are painted with whitewash on buildings and on walls.  Some of the loveliest districts around Dublin are rendered hideous by illiterate buffoons who go around with whitewash brushes writing political slogans on ancient walls and even on new buildings.  They are generally written where they can best catch the eye and they offend every sense of good taste and decency.  They are done too, very often in tar on white walls and on concrete walls so that not even the weather will wash them off or wear them away.  Outside the Church to which I go, we are repeatedly greeted on the asphalt road with these political slogans extending for several yards on each side of the entrance gates.  Any fool who thinks that he is going to win recruits or popularity for a political party, or a movement, by offending the taste of every decent citizen in that way, is certainly a fool in the truest sense of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that people who are found defacing the countryside in that way should be subjected to very severe penalties.  It takes away from the value of property in a district.  It makes the whole thing look cheap, <Col N="1068" /> low and despicable.  At election times, there may be some excuse for conduct of that kind, but political parties without exception exercise no discretion or sense of proportion when they are posting up their propaganda and I think there should be some provision whereby those responsible for defacing any particular part of the country, during an election, should be made responsible for pulling down these posters and removing these slogans when the election is over.  At all events, whatever excuse there is for it during an election there is none whatever for it when there is no election pending.  Followers of movements that are supposed to be idealistic and patriotic, which want to make Ireland all that its greatest lovers would have it, have no hesitation in making it by their smearings of whitewash and tar, a place from which any decent citizen would be glad to get away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the fullest sympathy with the views expressed by Senator Johnson and other Senators who supported him.  I should be quite happy to see legislation in operation which would give power to local authorities to take the fullest charge of the amenities of their towns and neighbourhood in general and to have objectionable structures, ruinous unhealthy areas, and unsightly advertisements destroyed.  I certainly agree in toto with all that Senator O'Farrell has said with regard to the way buildings, new and old, have been defaced in recent years.  I think that an appeal from members of this House and members of the Dáil to all sections of the community to discourage those who have been active would have a good effect.  I think there is no one Party, or the adherents of no one Party, who can claim that they have not been guilty in this matter.  I think that all of us should join in helping to create a public opinion that would, at any rate, help to deter those who have been indulging in this pastime of destroying buildings, roads and the countryside in general with the advertisements and slogans they have painted on our walls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> I am not certain if there is not power to do some of the things that Senator Johnson would like to see done given in Section 39 of the Bill, which points out certain provisions which may be contained in planning schemes.  A planning scheme could, I think, be made to contain any one of the things set out in the sub-sections of that section.  Paragraph (c) says: &ldquo;for preserving, improving and extending the amenities of the area to which the scheme applies, and in particular for all or any of the purposes mentioned in Part III of the Second Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;  No. 6 of Part III of that Schedule states &ldquo;Preventing, remedying, or removing injury to amenities arising from the ruinous or neglected condition of any structure or by the objectionable or neglected condition of any land attached to a structure or abutting on a road or situate in a residential area.&rdquo;  I think a planning scheme could be made for this purpose. There are also powers under the Public Health Acts whereby a a ruinous house could be, on public health grounds, removed but then the question of costs arises.  I had applications, in the last year or two, from local authorities to provide money out of relief funds for the clearing away of ruins in country villages and small towns.  I think some local authorities have used some of the relief moneys that have been granted, for the purpose. It could be done by the local authorities out of such moneys.  Outside that, there are certain powers in the Town Planning Bill as it is. There are, I agree, not the full powers that Senator Johnson should like to see but I am afraid they could not be brought within the ambit of this Bill. It is possible too, that other legislation may be brought forward to cover the points he has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the advisability of issuing a circular to local authorities pointing out the powers they have under this Bill and other Acts, and drawing attention to the general desire that the painting of notices and political slogans should be prohibited in so far as they have these powers?  I believe <Col N="1070" /> that if a circular of that description came from the Minister, pointing out the powers given to local authorities under this Bill and the powers they already enjoy, it would serve a useful purpose.</P>

The place in which it is proposed to insert the limiting words, &ldquo;other than a medical officer,' is after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 44, but, on further consideration, I think the most suitable place to insert the words would be after the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; in line 45 instead of after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;.

      <P>I think amendments Nos. 4 and 8 go together.  They arise out of the discussion that took place on the Committee Stage on an amendment moved by Senator Farren.  The Senator has put down an amendment for Report&mdash;amendment No. 5&mdash;proposing <Col N="1072" /> that special consideration be given to analysts having regard <i>inter alia</i> to their commitments in regard to special equipment.  I could not give special consideration to any one class of officers, but amendment No. 8, which I am moving to have inserted in the Bill, sets out the manner in which I am prepared to meet Senator Farren on this matter.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has gone some way to meet the amendment I put forward.  I would like to be assured by the Minister that his amendment No. 8 covers the expenses which these analysts are obliged to incur in the carrying on of their business.  The fees they receive as analysts cannot, I submit, be taken to be part of their actual income.  Some are paid a fee per sample and others a fixed salary by local authorities.  All these analysts have to maintain laboratories and pay staffs.  Suppose, for instance, that an analyst has a total income for the work he does for local authorities of £1,500 a year.  He has out-of-pocket expenses for the upkeep of his laboratory, purchase of chemicals, apparatus, and payment of the staff he requires.  There are only four of these analysts.  Take the case of one of them.  He has a staff of four assistants.  Let us assume that he pays each of them a salary of £300 per annum.  That accounts for £1,200. An analyst may be doing work for ten, 12 and, in some cases, 30 different local authorities.  In some cases, as I have said, he is paid a fee per sample and in other cases a fixed annual salary.  In the case of some local authorities that pay a fixed salary it has been found that the number of samples which they send for analysis is far in excess of the number sent by other local authorities which pay a fee per sample.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of all the expenses which analysts are obliged to incur, I think the Minister ought to give special consideration to their case.  The upkeep of a laboratory is a very expensive item and then there is the payment of the staff that an analyst must keep. I do not think that the out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the carrying on <Col N="1073" /> of a business ought to be the subject of deductions, whatever may be said as regards making actual salaries subjects to the &ldquo;cuts.&rdquo;  All these analysts have to engage staffs in their laboratories.  I think it is only fair, in view of all the circumstances, that the allowances which I suggest should be made to them to enable them to carry on their work.</P>

      <P>I think I have gone a certain way in amendment No. 8 to meet the case put up by Senator Farren.  It would not be possible, I think, to go the full length that he would like me to go.  I believe the Senator's statement is correct that there are only four analysts in the country, and that it is true, as he said, that the expenses they have to meet are heavy.  At the same time, I cannot single out analysts, even though there are only four of them, from other people who are in the service of local authorities, and make special terms and conditions for them.  However, I think I may say that in deciding what is to be allowed to be taken as equipment the Department will take a sympathetic view and see that no injustice is done to them in proportion to what is being done to every other official under a local authority.</P>

    <P>Question proposed:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to effect a number of miscellaneous amendments in the Road Transport Act of 1933.  That Act, as Senators will remember, attempted to bring subject to regulation the business of carrying merchandise by road for reward.  The Act was framed with great care but it was inevitable that, as soon as the Department of Industry and Commerce came to operate it, certain factors would arise which would necessitate amending legislation, because the available information concerning the extent of the business and the manner in which it was conducted was necessarily limited.  It is a very widely scattered industry, carried on by a very large number of people, altogether different in the manner of its operation from the business of carrying passengers by road which had been brought subject to regulation by the Road Transport Act of 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main features of the Road Transport Act of 1933 were the sections which required that all persons engaged in the business of carrying merchandise for reward on the roads should, in the first instance, get certificates that they were engaged in the business during the qualifying period; and secondly, that they should be licensed to operate in the future. Senators will remember that last year we introduced the first amending Act, the sole purpose of which was to extend the period within which applications for existing carrier certificates could be made.  That was necessitated by the fact that the big majority of people engaged in the business had failed to make application within the period specified in the <Col N="1076" /> original Act: that is, one month after the date of its passing.  We found, however, that even at the end of the extended period there was still a number of carriers who had failed to make application.  I was at first inclined to leave the position in that way; ruling these people out from the receipt of licences because of their failure to qualify under the Act; but when the number of them increased to 200 I felt that it would be unfair to penalise them to that extent because of their failure to get certificates and thereby debarring them from carrying on their business in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions of this Bill, therefore, is to extend the period within which application for these certificates can be made to the 1st of April in this year.  The effect of extending the date to the 1st April will be to enable all those who applied subsequent to the 31st October of last year, the last date on which applications should have been made, but prior to the introduction of this Bill, to secure their certificates.  It does not permit of any fresh applications in the future.  We presume that by this time all persons interested in the business will have learned the nature of the legal requirements, having regard to the fact that extensive publicity has been undertaken by advertisements in the newspapers, by posters outside public buildings and Civic Guard stations and by broadcasting announcements, and also by reason of the fact that the date on which persons holding certificates were also required to have licences in order to operate had been fixed as the 1st February.  There was, consequently, reason for believing that anybody who had failed to take notice of the existing legislation prior to that date would continue to act in a similar manner after that date.  We have every reason to assume that all applications likely to arise are now in.  The purpose of the extension is merely to enable us to deal with 200 applications which were late, and which otherwise would have to be excluded.  The extension of the date in connection with the qualification certificates necessitates the cancellation of the order already made, <Col N="1077" /> fixing February 1st as the date on which the main provisions of the Act came into operation and the taking of power to fix another date after this Bill becomes law.  That is done by Section 7.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a minor amendment, the purpose of which is to deal with a situation which was not foreseen. Apparently, it is the practice in many parts of the country to distribute newspapers to newsagents' shops in ordinary, passenger vehicles.  It would be illegal for newspapers to be carried in that way under the terms of the 1933 Act, unless passenger vehicles were licensed under that Act.  They were not eligible to be licensed, because they were not constructed for the carriage of goods.  The purpose of the section is to make a passenger vehicle a lorry when used for the carriage of newspapers.  The other main provisions of the Bill are to enable us to deal with certain difficulties which arose out of the administration of the original Act.  It was frequently found that persons who had a lorry or lorries engaged in connection with road transport business had disposed of the lorry or lorries and purchased new ones.  Where a new lorry was fitted with an Irish-built body it was sometimes found that the unladen weight was somewhat in excess of the weight of the old one.  Under the terms of the original Act we could only issue a licence permitting business being carried on with lorries of the same total unladen weight as were possessed by the applicant during the qualifying period.  Consequently, when the unladen weight was increased in that manner, the applicant was put in the position, in order to qualify, that he would have to dispose of the new lorries and get ones of the necessary unladen weight.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of Section 10 is to enable a certain element of discretion to be introduced where the circumstances are as I have described, and the unladen weight to be fixed, in respect of an application, slightly in excess of the unladen weight which would be fixed under the original Act, where, in the opinion of the Minister, <Col N="1078" /> it is desirable and just that that should be done.</P>
    <P>Another sub-section of the same section introduces the element of discretion, where it appears that a lorry owned by a person applying for a licence was available in connection with his business, but was not in fact licensed during the critical period, or on the critical date.  Senators will remember that an applicant under the original Act was required to state the number of lorries available for his business and licensed on a date selected by him during the qualifying period, a date described in the Act as &ldquo;the critical date.&rdquo;  Some persons engaged in this business had lorries available, but they were not licensed, because the business did not offer.  They could have been licensed at short notice if there was need for doing so.  This applies where the Minister for Industry and Commerce is reasonably satisfied that the situation was as I have described, and permits an unlicensed lorry or lorries, in the case of any applicant, to be taken into account in fixing the total unladen weight of the lorries or tractors as the case may be. These are the main provisions of the Bill and I do not think any of them can be regarded as controversial.  They are really amendments of the original scheme, occasioned by the experience of the Department of Industry and Commerce in administering it.</P>

      <P>This is another evidence of the disposition of the Government to go through the whole procedure of introducing Bills to suit a few people.  All that need happen is for a small deputation, accompanied by a few influential Deputies, to go to Government Buildings to make a plausible case, and forthwith comes a Bill.  We have an indication of that in the chopping and changing in the law in regard to motor taxation, which leaves the trade in the position that it does not know how it stands for two months.  It is introduced with regard to this Bill.  As everyone knows, the Act of 1933 took a considerable time to pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  People who took the slightest interest in transport <Col N="1079" /> knew that that Act was passing through the Oireachtas, and knew the extent to which its provisions affected their interests.  The Bill became an Act on June 12th.  It was laid down that anybody that desired to apply for a certificate as a public carrier in order to get a licence for that purpose should make application not later than July 12th, 1933.  That left a month.  In order to facilitate them, an amending Act was passed, extending the period to October 31st, 1933, giving an additional three and a half months.  Public notices were issued through the Press and appeared on public buildings.  Anybody who allowed all that time to pass and ignored all these notices, and who still desired to have the fact recognised legally, that he was a public carrier, or who took the smallest interest in his business, all he had to do was to apply.  Now, in order to meet that type of individual, the Minister comes along with another Bill, extending to April 1st a particular part of the law that should have come into operation on October 31st.  What was the cause of these people being late?  We are told that 200 have made application now, as against 2,043 who applied by October 31st, 1933.  Clever people have been going around&mdash;racketeers, in other words&mdash;telling people with a few broken-down lorries of a splendid way of making money if they go the right way about it.  Lorries that were lying under hedges, or disused for a good while, are to be resurrected now.  The owners are seeking certificates for these lorries and licences as public carriers.  They can put them on the road for a month or so and then apply to the Minister for an order requiring a railway or a shipping company to purchase them.  The Minister may make an order that they shall be purchased, and a railway company or a shipping company have to pay for what is really a bogus concern brought into operation for the sheer purpose of levying blackmail on a legitimate transport concern.  It is a new way of making money.  The Minister indicated that there were 2,043 applications.  Of these, 67 were <Col N="1080" /> withdrawn and 313 were not proceeded with.  The applications were evidently only chance work.  The owners hearts failed them after a certain period.  Now we have 200 people coming along at this hour of the day, and this Bill is brought in specially&mdash;a second amending Bill&mdash;before the original Act is in operation in order to meet them.  Of the 2,034, almost one-fifth desisted from pursuing their applications, showing what the provisions of the Act make possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what has been the procedure regarding the method of issuing licences, but every person seems to have got a licence to operate throughout the whole State, even though he has only two lorries. Obviously, such a person could not cater for the State as a whole.  If he gets traffic he has the option of making a load and operating here, there and everywhere as a privateer, upsetting transport conditions generally, making it impossible to have anything in the nature of stability.  If a railway company buys up transport in any area people in an outside area can swamp that area and make them buy them up, so that there is no prospect of finality, although the original Act was intended to have something like stability and solvency in transport.  There is a provision here also by which the Minister may increase the unladen weight of these lorries by 100 per cent.  Anyone who reads sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of Section 10 will see that that is the case.  Section 7 is really the most audacious of all, because it provides that a man who scrapped his lorry in July, 1931, and never intended using it again, can come along now and add it to his fleet, in order to get a certificate and licence for it, and he can include it in his claim when seeking to be compulsorily acquired, or to get a railway company to acquire him.  Surely, there could have been some limit.  There must be some good reason to include a man who dropped out three years ago.  Otherwise, the vehicle was unroadworthy or there was no business.  He cannot claim that he has done business since, seeing that he was not licensed within that period, and that traffic has certainly not <Col N="1081" /> increased in the meantime.  Yet, he is allowed under this Bill, if he was licensed any time up to July, 1932&mdash;or it could be up to three years ago&mdash;to be treated as having had a new lorry according to the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Department when considering licences would see whether the business was carried on with reasonable continuity as provided in Section 3 (5) of the principal Act.  It is laid down that, in order to get a licence, the Minister would have to be satisfied that the business, having regard to its nature, was carried on with reasonable continuity. It is alleged by people in the business that licences have been given to those who have not carried on business with reasonable continuity during that period.  I daresay the Department is largely at the mercy of individuals, but there are wholesale complaints that the Act has been abused in a very serious way, and that information placed at the disposal of the Minister, and alleged to be correct, was not correct.  I think there requires to be some speeding up in connection with this matter.  As far as railwaymen are concerned, this Bill comes along at a most unfortunate time, when they are engaged in negotiations with the railways, and when they are asked to agree to cuts in salaries and wages. Because of the effect this will have, the railway companies profess to have most serious views, saying, that this is getting behind the spirit and letter of the original Act, and is going to neutralise what were stated by the Minister and believed by the companies to be the good effects of the principal Act.  If that is the case it is a matter of very serious concern for railway employees and it could not have come at a more unfortunate time than the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the proposals in the Bill are very wise.  They seem to strike a middle course.  I have listened to Senator O'Farrell, who is the greatest advocate in this House of regulating other people. Unlike Senator O'Farrell, my idea is that there should be no time limit at <Col N="1082" /> all on the right of a person who is entitled to apply for a licence.  In the original Act, a very short time limit was prescribed.  That time limit had to be extended.  It is proposed&mdash;and rightly proposed&mdash;to extend it again to the 1st April of this year.  My view is that there should be no time limit.  However, the Minister has thought fit to introduce a time limit. Now, he is attacked by Senator O'Farrell because he would not deprive of their just rights people who, because of ignorance or because they had not a radio, did not apply for a licence in time.  There are two points of view in this House in respect of this question&mdash;one favours the regulating of everybody and the other would afford to ordinary people ordinary freedom.  As between these points of view, the Minister has taken the middle course and this Bill is a reasonable one.  Why should Senator O'Farrell use arguments such as he has used to-day?  What evidence has he that there are racketeers going about the country resurrecting old lorries?  That is a serious charge. Particulars of a charge like that should be given.  What evidence has the Senator that blackmail is being used against the railway companies? The Senator does, very efficiently and well, advocate the cause of the railway companies and their employees, but he ought not to go too far.  Notwithstanding the extension of time, 200 persons entitled to licences did not apply for them in time.  Are these 200 persons to be deprived of their living and of their rights?  Has Senator O'Farrell no confidence in the Minister?  Does he think that the Minister will grant licences where racketeers and blackmailers are attempting to resurrect old lorries?  There are businesses which, during part of the year, are very flourishing and, during another part of the year, are practically idle.  As I know myself, some lorries did not happen to be in use during that particular time and the Minister has very properly taken account of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made is that power is taken in Section 10 to make allowance in respect of weight to the extent of 100 per cent.  What the Minister has said is that he is taking power to make <Col N="1083" /> allowance in a case in which the unladen weight of a lorry is increased because an Irish body is affixed.  Will any sensible man say that is wrong?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Senator O'Farrell said that it was alleged&mdash;he was careful to say that he himself did not allege it&mdash;that licences are being given to people who have not carried on a road transport business with reasonable continuity during the qualifying period under the terms of the Act.  I merely mentioned that to draw Senator O'Farrell's attention to the fact that <Col N="1084" /> sub-section 3 of Section 24 of the original Act provides that &ldquo;the Minister may at any time, of his own motion and at his full discretion, revoke a merchandise licence if he is satisfied that such licence was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I invite Senator O'Farrell to ask the people who have made these allegations to furnish to the Department of Industry and Commerce any evidence that people have got licences who are not entitled to receive them under the Act or that people procured them by fraud or misrepresentation.  I assure him that if such evidence is forthcoming or if such allegations are found, upon examination, to be sustainable, licences so issued will be revoked.  I do not think that the Senator's statements are correct, because the Department of Industry and Commerce have exercised very considerable care to ensure that only persons qualified to receive certificates and licences should receive them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was not introduced following a meeting with a deputation or representations from anybody.  I did not receive any deputation in connection with this Bill.  The Bill was introduced mainly because the departmental records showed that there were 200 applications for certificates from persons who claimed that they were entitled to these certificates under the terms of the Act as they had been engaged in carrying on road transport businesses with reasonable continuity. The Department could not deal with these applications because they were received after the appropriate date.  I think that justice and fair play require that we should empower ourselves to deal with those applications and not disqualify those people or deprive them of their businesses because they either failed to take note of the terms of the Act or were not informed of it.  This is a very scattered business as I have said.  It is conducted by people all over the country&mdash;some of them in a very small way&mdash;and the possibility of these people not being familiar with the terms of a complicated statute is not a remote one.  It may be that they were not able to find out exactly what was required in time to enable them <Col N="1085" /> to comply with the Act.  I do not think that any of us would like to see the transport position regularised and the position of the railways made stronger at the expense of what would be an obvious injustice to a number of people.  Even though they may be poor people, doing business in a small way, they were dependent upon this business for a livelihood.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by Senator Comyn, that there should be no time limit for the making of applications by persons qualified under the terms of the Bill, is one which, while it might commend itself from one point of view, is impracticable because we must fix some date on which we will say: &ldquo;There are so many qualified to engage in this business to whom we are prepared to issue licences for the future and who will come within the provisions of the statute both in respect of the regulation of their services and in respect of the compulsory acquisition clauses.&rdquo; I do not believe that anybody has alleged seriously to Senator O'Farrell that people took old lorries from under hedges and proceeded to set up a road transport business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody who knows the terms of the Bill could take that allegation seriously.  First of all, a person must qualify as an existing carrier before there is any question of a licence.  Before there is any question of determining the unladen weight of the lorry which he is to operate, he must first get a certificate.  That <Col N="1086" /> certificate is proof that the Department of Industry and Commerce have accepted his contention that, for the qualifying period, he was conducting with reasonable continuity a road transport business.  If he was not engaged in conducting such a business during that period, the applicant will not get a certificate.  If he does not get a certificate it does not matter how many lorries he has, or whether they are new lorries or picked out from under hedges, he cannot engage in road transport business, nor can he get a licence to engage in it.  The statement that persons are getting licences to operate over the whole of the Saorstát is, of course, correct. Under the terms of the Act, as it passed the Oireachtas, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is bound to give a licence to any applicant to operate in any area the application may define.  The applicant, of course, makes himself subject to the terms of the Act, which require him to undertake common carrier obligations in respect of the classes of goods and the area he has himself defined.  If he fails to meet these obligations, he is subject to penalties of various kinds. The rest of the Senator's remarks were directed towards the provisions of Section 10.  Let us get clear what these provisions are.  First, what are the circumstances in which a person may get included in the standard weight of his lorries or tractors an additional unlicensed lorry or tractor?  First he must show that it &ldquo;was the property of such licensee on a critical date specified in the application for such licence and (2) was not duly licensed on that date and (3) was duly licensed at any time during the 12 calendar months ending on the 1st day of July, 1932.&rdquo;  It is clear, therefore, that the lorry could not have been lying in a hedge for a long time because it must have been licensed at some time during the 12 calendar months ending July, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>From July, 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely no one licensed a lorry and then proceeded to dump it in a hedge.  It was licensed in that year.  A lorry can be included in the calculation of the unladen weight if the <Col N="1087" /> owner is able to satisfy the Minister that such claims are well-founded.  He must procure a certificate that he was an existing carrier and carried goods in the qualifying period.  He must then prove that the additional lorry he wants included in the calculation of the unladen weight was owned by him on the critical date, and although not licensed on that date was licensed during the year prior to July, 1932, and he must prove his claim to have that lorry included as a well-founded claim. The same provision applies to tractors. The next case is where a lorry the unladen weight of which was taken into account in determining such standard weight had become unserviceable and has been replaced by another the unladen weight of which exceeds the unladen weight of the old. This is a provision that enables us to deal with the fact that the new body might be of Irish material and might be heavier than the old.  There is another provision that enables us to include in the unladen weight a lorry ordered from the manufacturer before the date when the Act was passed and not delivered to the road transport operator until after that date.  That lorry could also be included in the unladen weight.  All these provisions seem to be fair.  We found many cases of hardship that would remain a hardship if we decided to adhere to the terms of the old Act and not to amend it.  It would be impossible to eliminate these cases of hardship if we had not done so.  We might take the view that all those 200 people who had failed to take the necessary means to ascertain the law should be deprived of their business, but that is a punishment that would have been too severe, having regard to the fact that for the first time we are bringing this industry subject to regulations of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two other cases of hardship are those which arise in connection with the fixation of the unladen weight. One case is where a lorry was ordered before the Act was passed but was not delivered till after; we include that lorry in the unladen weight.  The second is a lorry that complies with <Col N="1088" /> the proper conditions but was not licensed on the particular date.  If we are satisfied that the claim that the lorry was available, and fit for use, in connection with the owner's business in a short period, we provide for the inclusion of the lorry, and the third case is a new lorry of the actual carrying capacity but of greater weight than the old one.  I do not think anyone can say that we are unreasonable or that we are doing anything that would impinge upon the principle of the original Act. The principle of the original Act is not touched in the slightest.  Very great care was taken to ensure that nothing in this Bill would alter the principle of the original Act.  Various representations made in favour of the alteration of the original Act have been rejected.  Railway companies, shipping companies and those interested in such operations would take an unreasonable view if they contended that the passage of this Bill would affect their interests in a detrimental way.  The railway companies had no reason to anticipate that 200 persons entitled to carriers' certificates would fail to apply.  If they had applied, the position of the railway companies would be the same as it will be after this Bill is passed.  They could not hope to gain anything by the hardship and the injustice which the absence of these various provisions would mean in connection with fixation of the unladen weight.  The contention that apparently has been made that the operation of this Bill was going to prove detrimental to the railway business is so preposterous that I do not think anyone need take it seriously, and I am quite certain that it had no influence upon the other parties to the negotiations.  The total increase in licensed carrying capacity under this Bill would not amount to one day's carrying on the railways of the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (2).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Every order made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and, if a resolution annulling such order is passed by either such House at any time during the continuance of such order, such order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Committee Stage we postponed the consideration of this amendment in order to give the Minister an opportunity of considering the application of this amendment to the Bill, and also to give the Minister an opportunity of providing amendments that might satisfy the Seanad in regard to this Bill as it stood.  But nothing has been done.  Therefore, I am forced to move now the original amendment brought up in Committee Stage.  At that time the Minister said the whole purpose of this Bill was an order and if the Seanad had power to revoke that order it might revoke the Bill.  I do not agree with the Minister in that statement because if we revoked one order the Minister would have power to make another.  The Minister himself takes power to revoke any order he makes under this Bill. Consequently, I cannot see what great <Col N="1090" /> hardship there could be in the mind of the Minister in regard to this matter.  I cannot see any hardship, where if any great injustice is done, or the purchasers who buy the sheep under the operations of this Bill do not pay the price they get from the fellmongers, in having a resolution passed to revoke the order and to let sheepskins again be exported.  There have been a number of Bills passed in the last year and a half and two years.  Under many of these Bills the Minister has power to make orders. I challenge him to cite any case in which the Seanad sought to revoke orders made by the Minister, or to hamper his legislation in any way. Why he is so anxious to get this thing and to work it by order I cannot follow.  The whole tendency of the present Government is to legislate by order, it is a tendency, also, growing up in other countries.  I think it is time that the Seanad sets its face against such legislation.  All such legislation should have some safeguard. This Bill is an example of what may be called departmental legislation. Under Section 2 the Minister may by order prohibit</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the export of sheepskins otherwise than under and in accordance with a licence in that behalf issued under this Act, and may so prohibit such export either for so long as such order is in force or for a specified period or for two or more specified discontinuous periods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is obvious danger in this type of legislation, which is growing so much in England that a book about it was written by the Lord Chief Justice. One certain safeguard would be the insertion of such an amendment as I have now moved providing that every order made by the Minister shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  By the adoption of my amendment some sort of parliamentary control will be maintained.  I contend that the Seanad should certainly endeavour to maintain such control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. This Bill, in my opinion, is very much more serious than it appears to be.  It restrains the market of the <Col N="1091" /> sheep farmers and it puts the entire control of the price for sheepskins into the Minister's hands.  It opens up a possibility of unfair discrimination in granting a licence.  In that respect it is on all fours with other legislation of that nature.  He does all this for the benefit of three or four fellmongers, as I understood from the Minister on the previous occasion, who cannot afford to pay the current price for sheepskins.  It is done at the cost of depriving tens of thousands of farmers of a free market, and done after the Government has spoiled their markets for a great many things by plunging the country into this tariff war, the effects of which we all know.  Why not subsidise the fellmongers?  Why not do the thing openly?  I dislike subsidies very much but it would be a much more honest way of helping them than this method.  The cost to the country would be known, whereas by this method it is all hidden in fog, in a smoke-screen.  We cannot tell what it will cost.  I think for these reasons the principle of the Bill is a bad one. I do not think we really should have given a Second Reading to the Bill. However, we did so, and having done so, it is quite reasonable on our part to adopt this amendment, so that there shall be some check, at all events, on the Minister, either the present Minister or any Minister who may follow him, to prevent a misuse of these powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Bill would be better without this amendment for the reasons I stated on the Committee Stage.  I do not think this amendment is any check, and if it is desired to have a check, I do not think it is by such an amendment it can best be secured.  Provision is made in the Bill that it shall come into operation by order.  It shall be brought into operation by order because obviously that is the simplest method.  If the Bill were framed on any other lines it would presumably become law, and the regulation of the export of sheepskins would be in operation this weekend. We are not ready to deal with the matter by the time the Bill becomes law.  It will be necessary to <Col N="1092" /> set up machinery to carry out the functions under the Bill and the order bringing the Bill into operation will not be made until the machinery is in existence.  That is why it is provided that it shall be brought into operation by order and not automatically on the passage of the Bill.  I do not think this amendment improves the Bill.  I do not think it effects any real safeguard against possible abuse, nor do I think that the Bill in any way influences the price of fat sheep in the Saorstát.  However, if there is anybody of opinion in the Seanad which thinks that this amendment should go into the Bill, I am not disposed to fight the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in line 2 to insert the words &ldquo;or that the acquisition of the lands proposed to be taken would seriously interfere with the amenity of the residence of the owner of such lands and that there <Col N="1093" /> are other sites which are, or another site which is, reasonably suitable for the purpose for which the lands are being compulsorily acquired.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment embodies in a considered form a matter that was discussed on the Committee Stage.  The object is to prevent a local authority from compulsorily taking over land for public purposes if its acquisition would seriously interfere with the amenities of a residence.  The object of the amendment is to be reasonable to all parties.  If there is no other site available, then the amenities have to give way.  But, where another reasonably alternative site is available, the order will be annulled and the Minister and the local authority will have to start again and acquire that alternative site.  The whole of the discretion in that matter is left to the judge.  A judge, who will have the whole of the evidence before him, will be able to say whether the amenities of the place are being interfered with and whether there is any reasonable, alternative site elsewhere.  It is for the judge to pronounce on the facts.  That would appear to me to be more reasonable, more equitable and to be more in the interests of justice, than to leave the whole matter to the arbitrary decision of the Minister.  I do not think that the Government need be afraid of an endless flood of litigation.  Litigation is not cheap.  It will be a very unusual occurrence when accommodation cannot be found between a party and the Minister.  Where that fails, if it is only once a year, it is a reasonable proposition that a man should be allowed to go to the courts.  The public is fully protected, because if no reasonable site is available, the appellant must give way and his amenities are allowed to suffer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>The foundation of this amendment and the real reason for it is that you cannot get monetary compensation for injury to amenities.  It cannot be given.  There is no measure for it and it is no part of the compensation that is given where lands or buildings are compulsorily taken.  For that reason if there is a reasonably suitable alternative site, an injury which cannot be compensated for by <Col N="1094" /> money ought not to take place.  That is the real ground for the amendment. I respectfully suggest that it is a better amendment than any of the three previous amendments, which really depend on the finding of a local inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised on this amendment is as to whether the Minister is to determine if the alternative site is reasonably suitable or whether that is to be determined in a court of law.  It appears to me that the function of determining whether a possible alternative site is reasonably suitable for the purposes of the Bill&mdash; that is for the purpose of providing a hospital site&mdash;should devolve upon the Minister.  It was suggested by one of the Senators interested in this amendment that it would not involve the endless litigation that some of us have in mind.  But it appears to me that the owner of a parcel of land, which it is proposed to acquire by compulsory order, can make the case, in almost any particular instance, that the amenities will be seriously interfered with if the site is acquired for the purpose of erecting a hospital. While there may be no substance in his case, while his chance of success may be very remote indeed, if he succeeds in holding up the acquisition of a site for 12 months the local authority will, by force of circumstances, be obliged to abandon the site and find an alternative site, because the scheme of hospitalisation must be proceeded with.  So, that while there may be no substance in the complaint, he may achieve his object by taking the matter to court and delaying the acquisition.  Senators are well aware of the machinery that will be set in motion if the owner objects to the compulsory order.  A public inquiry will be held.  All the evidence will be submitted to the Minister.  The owner of the land will have ample opportunity of putting forward every possible argument that can be adduced against the acquisition of his land or portion of it.  The Minister will have all these arguments before him in determining whether he <Col N="1095" /> shall confirm the order, modify it or cancel it entirely.  I submit that there are no real grounds for apprehension and that the question of determining an important matter like that may with safety be left in the hands of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the amendment is put, I should like to refer to the point raised by the Parliamentary Secretary in saying that the Minister is a better judge than the courts. Why should that be?  The Minister has no more technical knowledge than the judge.  The judge is accustomed to weighing up evidence and the Minister is not.  I think, consequently, the judge is better able to arrive at a fair decision than the Minister, who we all know may, in certain cases, be liable to certain pressure.  We cannot go round like ostriches with our heads in the sand.  We know there are <Col N="1096" /> cases where Ministers are subject to pressure.  I think that, where an essential provision of justice is concerned, the courts should be the last resort.  I cannot agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that there will be endless litigation.  There will be very few cases, because it will cost something to bring such cases into court. If a case goes against the complainant, presumably he will have to pay the cost of the local authority as well.  At any rate, whether he does or not, he will be put to very considerable expense.  I do ask the House to support the view that in the last resort justice to the individual must prevail. We are very much inclined nowadays to set aside the rights of the individual as against the community, but the object of the amendment is to hold a fair balance between the parties.</P>
