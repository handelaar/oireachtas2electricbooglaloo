      <P>I move the amendment in my name on the Order Paper:</P>
      <P>Section 1.  To delete in line 20 the figures and words &ldquo;31st day of July, 1935,&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the figures and words &ldquo;31st day of October, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment, limiting the duration of the continuing legislation, because the specific amendments which I had wished to move cannot be put before the House under Standing Orders.  The Minister, however, stated that new legislation is being prepared, that its preparation has gone a considerable distance&mdash;in fact, I think he <Col N="1642" /> said that it had passed out of his Department&mdash;and, presumably, therefore, it will be introduced, or can be introduced if the Minister desires to introduce it, within a relatively short time. On the other hand, one knows that, so far as the time spent on the drafting and the consideration of Bills is concerned, the delay may be prolonged. I feel that the Seanad ought not to continue the legislation as it stands for a period of 12 months.  I do not want to go over the ground again.  I have already pointed out to the Seanad that the legislation, as it stands, enables very great and dangerous abuses to take place.  There are indications that the powers given to the Government in the legislation proposed to be continued by this Bill are being used in a manner that is menacing the rights and liberties of the people.  I think that the Seanad ought not to continue this legislation for 12 months and, at the end of that period, discover that the permanent legislation which, unlike this legislation, can be dealt with in detail, is still under consideration, while the Government has, meantime, taken steps which might be very undesirable but could not be undone.  I think we should limit the period of this Bill to three months and, before the expiry of that time, the Minister will at least have introduced his permanent legislation in the Dáil.  We shall then know that the Bill is coming before us.  Once we have that knowledge, the Bill can be continued for a longer period.  I should not mind the period of continuance if the new legislation, which we could discuss, and amend if necessary, was actually before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Blythe on the necessity of having the new legislation introduced as soon as possible.  I think that the House would be quite justified in putting a limit on the continuance of the present Bill unless it were absolutely certain that this new legislation would be introduced within the period of continuance. It may be that the 31st October gives too short a period.  It may be that the period from the time when the House would meet in October until the end of November would not enable the <Col N="1643" /> Government to get the new legislation through the two Houses.  That, I think, would be a fair objection to the date that the Senator has put in his amendment.  I think that the period of continuance ought to be sufficient to make quite certain that the Government, in the ordinary course and without delaying unduly in any way, would be able to get their legislation through the Oireachtas.  I suggest to Senator Blythe that he ought to extend the period so that it would be certain that the Government would be able to get their new legislation through within the continuance period.  There is nothing to prevent the Government introducing their Bill in October.  I understand that the Bill is ready.  I think that the Minister has stated that the Bill is ready, so far as his Department is concerned.  There is nothing to prevent him from introducing it in October.  If they have an honest intention of doing that, then we shall have an opportunity, within the continuance period fixed by this Bill, of discussing amendments which are most important, having regard to what Senator Blythe has said.  In these circumstances, I ask Senator Blythe to amend his amendment by putting in a somewhat later date.  I suggest that the earliest date should be the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I should go further and ask Senator Blythe to be satisfied with an assurance from the Minister.  I do not like this Bill to be dealt with in hand-to-mouth fashion.  If the Minister gives us an assurance, I am satisfied that he will, so far as humanly practicable, carry out that assurance. I should be satisfied with an assurance from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask for information which has a very important bearing upon this Bill and upon the attitude which the House will take in regard to this amendment.  The <i>Irish Press</i> of March 26 contains a report of a speech delivered by President de Valera in Mullingar.  Referring to the Defence Forces, the President <Col N="1644" /> made this very important and significant statement: &ldquo;These forces are pledged to support the national policy, as formulated by the elected Government of the people.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister to tell us explicitly and definitely what are the exact terms of the pledge administered to these forces, when that pledge was administered and if there is any statutory authority to administer a pledge to the Defence Forces to support the policy of the elected Government. If such a pledge has been administered, then we have a political army and we have every reason to think seriously and at very considerable length before we give a continuance of the authority embodied in the Defence Forces Act.  If, as stated by the President, this pledge has been administered, then we have a political, party army.  If such a pledge has not been administered, then we may take it that the President was talking through his hat and stating something that was not a fact.  I think it is incredible that the head of the Executive Council would deliver himself of such a statement if it were not a fact. <i>(Interruption).</i>  I should like to repeat my interrogation to the Minister.  This is not a matter for levity.  I think that the Minister should inform us definitely and explicitly what are the terms of the pledge administered to the Defence Forces pledging them to support the policy, not the authority, but the policy of the Executive Council.  The second point is: when that pledge was administered, and the third, what is the statutory authority for administering a pledge binding the Defence Forces to support the policy of one Party in the State.</P>

      <P>I stated several times here, and I wish to repeat it now in order to strengthen what Senator Blythe has said, that there is evidence on every side, plain to everybody who has eyes and ears, that this is a political army.  All their activities are political.  They are openly taking part in political meetings, and, so far as I know, they are all adherents, active adherents, of the policy of the present Government.  I do not wish to go over these matters again, but merely to state that that is quite definite and <Col N="1645" /> clear to everybody.  From the experience that we have had, I want to say that I would not be satisfied with a mere assurance from the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the difficulty lies in this: that we have absolutely no assurance and no indication of a specific character as to when this new Bill will be introduced.  I would like to put it to the Seanad that what ought to be done to-day is to pass the amendment on the Order Paper.  If, by this day week, the Minister is able to come back and, speaking not only on his own behalf but on behalf of the Government, and tell us when the permanent legislation will be introduced, we will then be in a position to consider the matter further.  Personally, I think the position simply is that rather than let the whole matter of Army legislation be fully discussed here in the Seanad, after the Minister gets his 12 months' Bill, we will have no further legislation for the 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like this Bill to have been phrased in such a way that the limiting Act would coincide with the end of the financial year; with the period within which the Government have been granted certain moneys for the upkeep of the Army.  I have frequently said, and I am going to repeat it to-day, that the original Temporary Provisions Act dealing with the Defence Forces was passed in this House without any criticism at all of a detailed nature.  It was introduced by General Mulcahy as Minister.  He stated several times, in the course of his introductory speech, that &ldquo;this was a temporary Bill put forward for a period of 12 months.  He realised that it should be discussed in detail and he had thought in fact of having it extended for only a six months' period, but in deference to certain representations which had been made to him he had consented to put in 12 months.&rdquo; The explanation given at the time for passing the Bill through all its stages in this House in one day was that circumstances necessitated the passing of the Bill.  The Second Reading was passed, and immediately a motion to suspend the Standing Orders was agreed to.  The later Stages of the Bill <Col N="1646" /> were then passed immediately without any further discussion whatever.  That was a Bill containing 246 sections and eight schedules, occupying 234 pages in the book containing the Acts passed that year.</P>
      <P>The Act has been continued year by year since.  It has been extended without any question, and has been the law under which the Army has been maintained and disciplined.  Now it is suggested that there should be some cat-and-mouse game played with the Minister simply because there is certain criticism about a new force that has been set up&mdash;a new force on exactly the same lines as a previous Volunteer Force was set up, thereby stretching, as I thought then and still think, the authority of this Act in a way that it should not have been stretched.  That precedent was set and that example given by a Ministry of which Senator Blythe was a leading member.</P>
      <P>The suggestion now is that this Bill should only continue until 31st October next.  Presumably, the intention is that by that time both Houses will have enacted a new Bill and, presumably, the new Bill will contain as many sections and schedules as the existing measure.  Therefore, one must assume that in addition to what other business there may be before the Oireachtas, and making allowance for the Summer Recess, both Houses will have gone through a new Bill of that elaborate nature before the end of October.  It may be that the Minister will follow the example of his predecessors and get it through without any discussion at all, but I do not think he ought to try to.  Consequently, I think that this Bill, if it is to be amended in regard to its period, should be amended so as to coincide with the end of the financial year.  I hope that the Dáil will not encourage this House to play the cat and mouse with Bills of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering what would be the effect of the passing of this amendment and the non-passage in the interim that elapsed at the end of October of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act.  The first section of the Act is curiously phrased.  It says that: &ldquo;This Act shall continue in force until other provisions shall have been made by law <Col N="1647" /> for the defence of Saorstát Eireann and shall not in any case continue in force after a period of one year from the date of the passing hereof.&rdquo;  That date has been altered periodically.  I take it that the position on, say, the 1st November, if this amendment were passed and no new measure had been enacted, would be that there would be an Army in being, but that the Executive Council would have no authority to set up such an Army.  A Senator near me says that there would be no money to pay it.  That is where, I think, he is making a mistake.  There would be money to pay an Army.  If the precedent of all the previous years in regard to the Appropriation Act is followed there would be money to pay the Army.  I wonder if Senators who are inclined to support this amendment have given any consideration to the possibility that you would have a Government with large sums of money to support the Army, the Army being, in fact, there, but with no legal authority in the hands of the Ministry to maintain that Army.  You would have then a state of things that would not be very conducive to orderly development.  With the duty imposed upon the Ministry, whatever the Ministry might be, to maintain order and the defences of the country, it would be obligatory on them to use the money that the Dáil would have voted, and to maintain the Army without legal authority.  I think that the Seanad should face that as a possibility, and that it would be very inadvisable to run the risk of that eventuality.  I think that the procedure in regard to this Act and in regard to any other measures where moneys are voted to be spent within a year&mdash;the period during which such a service should be legalised&mdash;should be that it would coincide with the financial period embodied in a particular measure.</P>

      <P>I do not want to anticipate the lines of the reply to be made by the Minister concerned with this measure, but I would like to mention that in the years when we were in Opposition this Bill came along annually for continuation. On several occasions during those years <Col N="1648" /> I and several other Senators raised the question with regard to the introduction of a permanent Army Bill.  On each occasion we were told that the matter was under consideration; that the Government hoped to introduce it soon and so forth.  It is interesting to find Senator Blythe's anxiety about this Bill and his intention, if possible, to hold up the operation of the Bill. Already he has succeeded in limiting its duration to three months, and now he proposes to repeat that.  I would like to know why Senator Blythe's interest and anxiety did not arise during the ten years that elapsed from the first introduction of the Temporary Provisions Bill.  If he is so concerned about the introduction of a permanent Bill, why was not that anxiety of his displayed during the time he was a leading member of the Ministry then concerned with the Administration?  As it happens the permanent measure has been under consideration.  It has been completed, I understand, by the Department of Defence and is now with the Department of Finance.  The intention is to have it introduced at the earliest possible moment.  I am reasonably satisfied that the Bill will be before the House before the end of 1934, not to speak of the end of the financial year.  However, the Minister for Defence is in a better position to deal with that than I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting and illuminating to find this undue anxiety on the part of Senator Blythe.  Senator Blythe, Senator Brown and Senator Sir John Keane say that they are disinclined to hold up this Bill but would like to have an assurance from the Minister concerned. I have no doubt he will be able to reassure them on that.  It was also illuminating to learn, as Senator Johnson explained, the method that was adopted when this Temporary Provisions Act was passed originally.  It was interesting to learn that it was put through almost without discussion. Most of the Stages were passed through without any discussion at all.  It is symptomatic of the times we are living in and of the atmosphere that has developed in the Seanad that Senators have become suddenly alert and aware of so many things that they <Col N="1649" /> accepted without question during the period of the previous Administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Milroy has raised a question which I have no doubt the Minister will deal with adequately, but I would like to stress this point: that I do not think a member of the Seanad is justified in bringing forward Press reports and using them as evidence against any Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Not even the Irish Press.  I would be very long sorry to be responsible for every statement that is reported in the Dublin newspapers or in the papers elsewhere.  I think that should be clear to everybody in the House who realises what modern journalism is.  You get short excerpts of statements which, taken out of their context, mean an entirely different thing.  However, I do not propose to anticipate the Minister in dealing with that matter.  So far as I understood the procedure here is exactly the same as prescribed in the Act before we came into office.  I think it is unfair to ask the Seanad to take the attitude they are asked to take, and I think it is hardly decent for a former Minister who for ten years supported a continuing Bill, coming up annually, now, when the same Bill comes up before the Seanad, to wish to limit its operation to three months hence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly true that this Bill was continued for ten years and when it was felt that there was a necessity for a review of its provisions in a new, or in a permanent Bill containing a great many new provisions to replace it, it was introduced. Especially in the early years there was extremely good reason for that, perhaps, but at the latter end of the period the reasons were less strict.  So far as I am concerned, I would not urge the limitation of the period, or, in any way, hurry the introduction of a permanent Bill if I felt assured there was not going to be a continuance of the policy of creating a political force, either alongside, or in substitution for <Col N="1650" /> the existing Army.  During the ten years period the whole effort of the Government was to make the Army, which had originally begun as a national, and as necessarily a political force, in the sense that its members practically all took one political view, non-party; the whole effort of the Government was to ensure that the Army would become entirely non-political and entirely non-party.  In all directions steps were taken to secure that end.  The success of the first Government in securing that the Army should be entirely non-political was surely demonstrated when a change of Government took place, and since.  It seems to me there could be nothing more important, for the interests of the country, and the safety of the people, than that the Army should be entirely non-party.  I do not mean that individuals in the Army should not have their own views, but I do mean that the Army should be non-party in the sense that its action should be strictly disciplined and constitutional.  My interest was, in the first instance, to introduce a few amendments into the existing legislation, and as that was impossible, to take all the steps that could be taken to ensure that new legislation would be introduced as speedily as possibly, and to secure that steps that have gone some distance, and that are menacing in themselves, should not be continued any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was an extraordinary thing that when this new Volunteer Force, which was to attain to very big numbers was started, the entire control of it, in the sense of the selection of recruits or membership of it, should be put into hands of political gentlemen specially commissioned into the Army for the purpose.  I would not have seen the slightest objection to the Government bringing in a certain number of people with one political point of view, even though it would not be good for the Army to bring in men who had not the requisite training. But if they only brought in a few, to make it easier to get recruits with certain political views, then I should not have seen much in that. That the whole recruiting of the Army should be put into the hands of those men seemed to me, apart from what <Col N="1651" /> one might hear from any other source as to the Government's intention, a most ominous thing.  There is no doubt that the whole tone of this new party is strongly political and strongly party.  I mentioned the other day that when a Blueshirt was attacked by a mob of 200 people near O'Connell Street, two members of that mob were members of this new force.  I have seen with my own eyes one man in uniform mingling with the crowd&mdash;I did not see him strike anybody&mdash;but mingling with the crowd trying to break up a meeting.  I have no doubt at all that the thing is being organised along lines, and on a discipline that will hold party allegiance in this force. I do not know what may come ultimately of that, but I think it is the greatest possible danger to the country. We have no assurance at all, considering what is going on, that the story one hears of Ernie O'Malley being brought back as Chief of Staff may be more than nonsense.  But stories of that kind are going round and when the Government have gone so far there is no evidence that they will not go further, and that there will be another 16 men more in a few years, and 16 others later on.  That may mean that we will have the whole control of the armed forces handed over to men whose outlook is not professional or constitutional, but party and political, and it is because of that I think the Seanad should take some steps a little out of the ordinary practice.  I feel, from the attitude of the Minister in this thing, and in regard to other matters, that if he is simply left to himself, he will not introduce legislation here that might be discussed and that might be amended in such a way as to ensure that the Army did not proceed along the lines I fear it is going to proceed.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson talked about the possibility of the Government carrying on the Army without any authority, if new legislation could not be got through this House before the end of October.  If the Government did introduce new legislation into the Dáil I have no doubt the Seanad would give them another continuance Bill, without a word of discussion, that would enable <Col N="1652" /> them to have new legislation fully discussed and brought into operation without jumping any ditches at all.  I think that what is really of concern is for the Seanad to mark disapproval of any tendency that may exist to create an Army political machine and, also, to secure discussion as to the powers of the Government with regard to Army matters by limiting the duration of this Bill so that we might not be again faced with the same position as before.  If the Department of Defence has a new Bill it ought to face up to it as other Departments do.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer to the Military Tribunal.  But the fact that it is operating, and seems likely to operate, and that the Constitution (Amendment) Act, unless by other methods, is not likely to be put out of operation by the Government, makes it very important that we should secure that there are not going to be mere politicians commissioned, and, perhaps, put into any position&mdash;even membership of that Tribunal.  The possibility that that might happen being present, is a factor that would have certain undesirable results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the gravity of the question under discussion.  It is a very serious matter and I think some amendment is justified in the creation of this Volunteer Reserve Force.  I do not myself see, for that reason, that there is any inconsistency in Senator Blythe's attitude now as compared with previous years, because the situation is quite a new one.  But on the other hand I recognise that the constitutional position of the armed forces of the State is so important, and so serious, that there should be no reason of any kind, in practice, in the continuing of this constitutional position or its control.  For these reasons I cannot bring myself to vote for the amendment in its present form because I think the date is too near. If the date were extended I would be prepared to vote for the amendment but not if the date is put to the end of October.  I think the subject is too serious a one to fix an early date.</P>

      <P>Senator Blythe told us he saw a volunteer in uniform taking <Col N="1653" /> part in the disturbance at a political meeting.  I informed the Minister for Defence that that Volunteer was summoned, before a District Court, for riotous and disorderly behaviour, and that he failed to appear and that no warrant was issued for his arrest.  The Minister refused to answer as to whether a warrant would be issued but I know no warrant was issued in the meantime.</P>

      <P>When I was introducing the Second Reading of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill on the 14th of March of this year I made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is the annual Army Bill.  It comes before the Oireachtas each year.  I had hoped at this time last year to introduce a Bill this year which would be a complete amendment of the existing Army Act.  Unfortunately the Bill had not reached the stage at which it could be introduced. I hope, however, before the expiration of the period provided by this Bill, to introduce a Bill amending the whole Army Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that Senator Blythe is quite well aware that while the last Government promised continually from 1923 to 1931 to introduce a permanent Army Bill, no steps were taken to carry out that declaration. One of the first things I did when we settled down in office was to call the General Staff and the legal officers together, to get after the construction and preparation of a complete amendment of the present Army Act.  As Senator Johnson pointed out, an Army Act is quite a long and a voluminous piece of legislation.  The work has been going on steadily since.  I have been pressing for it for 18 months, and it has reached the stage when it has left my Department.  I cannot attempt to promise anything more than I did on March 14th.  I hope, however, before the expiration of the period provided by this Bill to introduce a Bill amending the whole Army Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Defence has done its share to date, but the introduction of the new Bill into the Dáil depends <Col N="1654" /> upon the pressure on other Government Departments.  I cannot, and neither can the Executive Council, give any definite promise that the Bill will be introduced before Christmas, or before the end of the year.  I hope to get the Bill introduced into the Dáil and to get it through as quickly as I can.</P>
    <P>Senator Blythe is not just quite so innocuous as he appears to be.  For a number of years he has been steadily trying to sow the seeds of dissension, while pretending to be a man of peace and all the rest of it.  If the present Government were going to act, as he claims they might act in the next 12 months, they should have shown some evidence of it in the last two years. They have had all the powers of the Army Act at their disposal for the last two years.  I think any fair-minded man who goes into the records of both Governments will say that the present Government has hesitated to use its full powers very much more than the last Administration did.  Senator Blythe spoke here about a rumour which he said is circulating, and which I suspect he is one of the principal agents in starting, that a certain gentleman is to come over here to replace the Chief of Staff.  He says that it is necessary to introduce a certain amendment to the Act to prevent that being done, the plea being that the Act as it stands gives power to dispense with the services of a number of officers and to replace them by others.  When Senator Blythe gave notice that he was going to move an amendment, I took the trouble of having the records looked up to see how the previous Government acted, and compared their actions with my own actions as Minister for Defence since I took over charge of the Department.  I find that in the years 1929, 1930 and 1931 we had three large sheets containing lists of officers who resigned voluntarily, who were compelled to resign, who were dismissed, or whose services were dispensed with, while in our period of over two years, less than half a sheet contained the list of officers whom I either compelled to resign, who resigned <Col N="1655" /> voluntarily, or who were dismissed. Even during the normal years 1929 to 1931 I think the rate of retiral of officers under the last Government was about four times greater than it was under this Government.  It is necessary for a Government to have in its hands certain powers for the dismissal of officers.  The Government has such powers in regard to the Civil Service.  There might easily and reasonably be complaint if there was any evidence that the Government was exercising these powers unfairly, either in regard to the Civil Service or anything else.  No such evidence is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I must say, as far as I am concerned, that the Army has behaved magnificently. I took over charge of it on being appointed to do so by the Government. We had been on opposite sides in the civil war.  I find generally through the Army that the officers are prepared to obey any Government elected by the people, and are prepared to give that Government a fair crack of the whip.  On my part I tried to give to the officers who were there a fair crack of the whip also.  I am saying all this to show that Senator Blythe's reasons as to why a Bill should be introduced before October 31st, are absolutely without foundation.  If he were proposing the amendment with a view to getting permanent legislation introduced, in order to implement the promises of both Governments, I would have sympathy with it.  That is not his real reason, because he made no effort, even while acting Minister for Defence on many occasions, to bring forward a Bill.  To-day the Senator gave as one of his reasons that if the Army Bill was continued for more than three months very great and dangerous abuses might take place; and also that the powers which the Army Act confers on the Government might be used in a manner menacing to the rights and liberties of the people.</P>
    <P>If the Seanad thinks there is any danger of the Government using the powers which the Army Act confers upon them, or that very great and <Col N="1656" /> dangerous abuses might take place, or in a way that is menacing to the rights and liberties of the people, then the proper course for the Seanad to take would be to refuse to pass the Army Act altogether, even for three months, or even for one day.  I cannot see what virtue there is in taking these powers from the Government at the end of three months, rather than at the end of 12 months.  If it is necessary to disarm the Government of these powers, and to create a revolutionary situation that should be done at once&mdash;forthwith. If the Government is not fit to have these powers in its hands for 12 months, it certainly is not fit to have them for three months.  I did not catch Senator Milroy's quotation from the President's speech.  As far as I heard it, the Senator said the President stated that the Army was pledged to support the national policy of the elected Government.  The fact of the matter is, that all members of the Army, volunteers, regular army soldiers or reserves, take the ordinary Army oath to the Constitution.  I take it the oath to the Constitution is to obey the orders of the Government elected, and that that is a promise on the part of the soldiers to support the Government in whatever policy is decided according to law.  If Senator Milroy can give any other interpretation I should like to hear it.</P>

      <P>There has to be some body to carry out national policy. That body is the Executive elected by the people.  Soldiers in the Army take an oath to obey the orders of the elected representatives of the people. As far as I am concerned, as to certain allegations against Volunteers, if it is proved to my satisfaction that any Volunteer has behaved in a disorderly manner, or takes hand, act or part in maltreating his neighbours, or in breaking up public meetings, he will not be in the Army for one day.  The young men of the country were asked to come forward in order to strengthen national discipline.  They are to obey any Government elected by the people, and <Col N="1657" /> if any of them dishonours his uniform, by behaving in an undisciplined way, certainly that uniform will be taken from him as quickly as I can take it from him.  There is no use in slinging around allegations here in the Seanad or anywhere else.  If any sort of reliable evidence comes forward I will inquire into it and act upon it if it is found to be reliable.</P>

      <P>Senator Blythe repeated here to-day a most unfair attack, in my opinion, on the gentlemen who composed the Military Tribunal.  If there was an attack on these particular officers by someone who had no responsibility for putting them into the office they hold, then it might be forgiven, but Senator Blythe was one of those responsible for asking these five gentlemen to undertake the onerous and unpopular job of sitting as members of the Military Tribunal, and I think he should be the last to cast any aspersions on their honour. As far as I am concerned, and as far as the Government is concerned, they have carried out their duties in a fair and in an impartial manner.</P>

      <P>Nothing that I have heard from the Minister, especially what I have heard as to the annual promise given, has altered the opinion which I had, that it was absolutely necessary that this permanent Army Bill should arrive in this House, and that it should have an opportunity of discussing it in the next session; that is before the end of this year.  I am still of the opinion that the date, October 31, is too short.  I take it the House will not meet until October 1st. That will only give a month for getting what must be a heavy Bill through the Dáil and up to this House.  That is too short, and I suggest to Senator Blythe that he might agree to an extension of the time. Personally, I would rather see the date the 31st December.  That would ensure its being dealt with and would give the country an opportunity of knowing what is going to be done. I would press Senator Blythe to agree <Col N="1658" /> to that amendment.  I think it would give us all the security which we can reasonably ask for.</P>

      <P>The matter is so important that I would ask the Minister who thinks that the President has not been accurately reported to take a note of the date, bring this matter <Col N="1659" /> before the President, and ask him, if he has been inaccurately reported, to publish a correction of it.  The Minister for Defence, however, seemed to think that this might be taken as an accurate report and a perfectly justifiable statement by the head of the Executive Council, as to the function of the Defence Forces.  He says that the pledge or the oath to which I refer, is the pledge that was taken by the Defence Forces in the time of his predecessors.  The Minister for Defence thinks it is an undertaking to support the general policy enunciated by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;These forces are pledged to support the national policy as formulated by the elected Government of the people.&rdquo;  If the words had been that &ldquo;the Forces are pledged to support national authority,&rdquo; I would say that it was a perfectly sound constitutional position to take up, but when it is stated by the President, and reiterated here by the Minister for Defence, that it is allowable for the Government to consider the Defence Forces as one of their political adjuncts, one of the means by which they can give effect to their political policy, we are up against a situation which is not only unprecedented but which is fraught with dire menace to the State.  I challenge any Minister to get up and say in support of the Minister for Defence that that is a correct and legitimate view to take.  The only possible way out of the difficulty is, as the Minister for Lands and Forestry suggested, to say that the President was not correctly reported.  If that is so I presume there is a representative of this particular organ here to-day and I hope steps will be taken to correct this false report of the speech of the President and that the Minister will let us know exactly what is the outlook of the Government in regard to the function of Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Defence is to be taken as speaking correctly, there <Col N="1660" /> is no such pledge as that referred to by the President and the President was simply talking through his hat. It is regrettable to find the Minister for Defence even in this roundabout way making such an allegation against the head of the Executive, but at any rate, when matters of this serious import are being discussed, I think it is extremely important that Ministers should make up their minds what viewpoint they are going to take and stand over it, so that the head of the Executive Council will not go down to the country, make a statement, and then get one of his underling Ministers to repudiate its accuracy here in this House.  In any case, it is sufficiently important to have attention drawn to it.  If it meant nothing except that the President was trying to delude his followers, even then there is sufficient justification for introducing such an amendment as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to understand the case put forward by Senator Milroy.  I read in the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, the form of oath or declaration to be made by a soldier.  The latter part of it reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>And I further solemnly swear (or declare) that I will bear true faith and allegiance to our country and faithfully serve and defend her against all her enemies whomsoever and that I will submit myself to discipline and obey without question the orders of the officers appointed over me according to law.</P>
      <P>I read also:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The command in chief of, and all executive and administrative powers in relation to, the Forces including the power to delegate authority to such persons as may be thought fit shall be vested in the Executive Council...</P>

The business before the Oireachtas is sufficient to keep it going until August and whilst the Executive Council, those of us who are responsible, are quite willing to carry on during the whole summer, the 30th November will not facilitate the object that Senator Brown has in view.  I merely want to point out that difference, from the ordinary practical point of view.  If the House sits until August the question is when will it again assemble and how long will it take to put through such a heavy, complicated piece of legislation as Senators have in mind? How long will it take to put it through the Dáil and again through this House?  I think on principle the Bill should be passed now and I propose to resist the amendment to that extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of the Seanad closer co-ordination is desirable in regard to the detention of books on importation under Section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876 (39 and 40 Vic. cap. 36) and the censorship of books under the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929 (No. 21 of 1929).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To many, this may not be a matter of much concern but there is a substantial number of people with intellectual interests who have been very much affected and, I may say, annoyed by the lack of co-ordination in the administration of these two statutes and by their extraordinary inconsistencies and reactions upon each other.  The House is probably aware that the Customs Consolidation Act of 1876 was the principal Act under which the importation of undesirable books was prevented until this country passed the Censorship Act of 1929. The Committee on Evil Literature, on whose report the censorship largely followed, said with reference to this Customs Act that it appeared to provide adequate powers to prevent the importation, publication, sale or distribution of any printed matter of obviously or grossly obscene character. In due course, that was not considered sufficient for preventing the importation of obviously obscene literature, and the Censorship Act was passed.  I do not propose to say anything about the Censorship Act <Col N="1664" /> except to remark that it does not appear to hinder the curious and, perhaps, it does protect the innocent. Anybody interested in these books can get them and, probably, it does not matter what happens them.  The inno cent cannot get them so quickly and they are protected.  That is the law of the country and I am not making any complaint about its administration, but I should like the House to know what is happening under the earlier Act&mdash;the Act that was considered sufficient to prevent the introduction of matter obviously and grossly obscene.</P>
    <P>From time to time, apparently with no central purpose and under no control, books are being held up under the earlier Act.  My object in bringing the motion forward is to try to ascertain from the Government the policy under which that Act is administered because, to the ordinary outsider, there appears to be no policy.  A book is held up at one port and allowed in free at another port.  I want to refer to the case of a book published in January last.  Its title is &ldquo;Straphangers,&rdquo; and it was ordered by a certain person on reading a review in an entirely reputable paper&mdash;the Literary Supplement of the &ldquo; Times.&rdquo; The review is not very long and I think, when I have read it, Senators will be satisfied that the book, at least, is not grossly obscene.  I may add that the person who reported the matter had been talking to a friend of almost puritanical tendencies who saw nothing objectionable in the book, except that it is not a book to give to a school girl.  There are few novels that one can give to the raw and entirely innocent school girl.  The review says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Miss James has taken for her characters seven regular passengers on the Edgeware-Elephant and Castle Underground Railway and follows them in the shops, houses, studios, and offices in which they work and back into their homes. The daily details of their lives are laid bare, their thoughts are set down and the tragedies and comedies are shown to us throughout one entire year.  The travellers are <Col N="1665" /> varied in type and only in two cases do their lives become involved with one another.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a point to notice, whatever conclusions we may like to draw.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a guard, a young man who is studying painting, a traveller in silk stockings&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not wearing them, I presume&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;two girl clerks, a lift-girl, and an old charlady.  Miss James has departed entirely from the normal convention of narrative and, though the rather inconsequential style is at first a little trying, it is well suited to this book and is an interesting experiment.  The subject is, undoubtedly, a little drab.  Even with their little high lights, the lives of these workers are a study in grey, albeit a careful study.  Miss James' thorough work cannot make this a cheerful book; indeed it appears that the motif she wishes to impress upon us is one of sacrifice.  Each life has its ruling aim and in each life there is sacrifice for the master passion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means.  It may not please the person who stopped the book.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This book certainly bears out the promise of the author's earlier work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the case of a book taken at the port out of a number of books imported by an ordinary private reader&mdash; a consignment from an English library. I may add that the person importing this book has written several times in fact, once every week&mdash;to the Department of Customs for an explanation. All that came back were postcards in Irish&mdash;no explanation whatsoever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Which, on being translated by a neighbour in the Gaeltacht, said the matter was receiving attention.  No further attention was given the matter.  I now want to call attention to a more curious case&mdash;the case of a book entitled &ldquo;The Postman Always Knocks Twice.&rdquo;  Of course, we all know that postmen do other things than knock.  It has been the <Col N="1666" /> experience of most of us that they generally asked for money.  The postman, in the old days, used to be a rather pleasant association with those who were away.  Now the question is always &ldquo;What does he want to-day,&rdquo; and the family run round and say &ldquo;Have you got a sixpence or a shilling to serve the postman's needs?&rdquo; That is by the way.  It is interesting to know that while this book, &ldquo;The Postman Always Knocks Twice,&rdquo; has in certain cases been stopped&mdash;my information is quite authoritative&mdash;it is yet appearing in serial form every day in the &ldquo;Daily Express.&rdquo;  That shows an extraordinary lack of any central directing policy in this matter.  I may add that neither the &ldquo;Straphangers&rdquo; nor the &ldquo;Postman&rdquo; has yet been censored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another book entitled &ldquo;The Five Silver Daughters,&rdquo; whatever that may mean.  That book has been stopped again in a haphazard fashion at certain ports.  But so far as my information goes, it has not yet been censored.  The only conclusion that we can come to from all this is that an individual Customs officer can act as he sees fit.  If a Customs officer is curious and wants to read a book himself, he can dive into a parcel and take what he likes, but the owner of it appears to have great difficulty in getting any information as to why the book is being detained.  He gets a postcard in Irish and a promise that the matter is receiving attention.  This is a really serious matter though I admit it has its humorous side.  If there is to be this hidden censorship we surely ought have the right to be told by what method it is to be regulated.  Is there some central authority studying these books, and are certain instructions sent out to the Customs officers as to the books that are to be stopped?  How does that policy which, presumably, being a Customs matter is governed by the Minister for Finance, square up with the policy of the Censorship Board which is under the Department of Justice?  The matter is really very aggravating.  This is one of the minor aggravations that make life in this country very annoying to sensitive people, perhaps of leisure and of taste, <Col N="1667" /> who do not want to carry on a perpetual wrangle with the authorities.  I hope the Minister will give us an explanation of the policy under which these books are stopped by Customs officers, and under what conditions the books can be released.  If they are not censored, should there not be some redress for the person who has suffered a lot of inconvenience?</P>

      <P>This is a somewhat difficult and unusual type of matter for me to deal with.  The question of co-ordination between the two Departments can be answered easily.  There is co-ordination and co-operation between the two Departments.  The chief grievance that Senator Sir John Keane seems to suffer from at the moment is the result of an ancient enactment that is still in existence: The Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.  This Act gives power to the Customs people to examine and to remove anything in the nature of obscene literature or other material. The actual terms of the Act are:&mdash;&ldquo;Indecent or obscene prints, paintings, photographs, books, cards, lithographic or other engravings, or any other indecent or obscene articles.&rdquo;  That is an inheritance from 1876 and is still in existence.  I do not think there will be any tendency in this country to remove that inheritance.</P>

      <P>Very good.  We then come to the question of co-operation. What happens?  When a Customs officer removes one of these books under the powers of that Act if, in his opinion, that book is obscene he can hold it and retain it and forward it to the Censorship Board.  The Censorship Board will then rule on it.  But, meantime, he acts on his own judgment.  He is acting within his rights in preventing that book from being delivered.  Now we are not at the moment, I take it, discussing the merits or the defects of the Censorship Board.  Senator Sir John Keane may feel that the censorship is undesirable and that such a thing should not exist. <Col N="1668" /> But we are faced with the fact that the Censorship Board does exist, and I think there will be very little tendency amongst the people of this country, or on the part of responsible members of the Oireachtas, to remove the Censorship Board or to abolish the censorship.</P>

      <P>I am explaining to the Senator the conditions under which any book such as he referred to is held. It can be held up by a Customs officer, acting entirely on his own discretion, under the Act of 1876.  It can then be forwarded by him to the Censorship Board, and the Board can give a ruling on it.  Senator Sir John Keane mentioned a particular book.  One page of it has been pointed out to me. I would say that if any book might come under the censorship and be excluded from this country, leaving aside the abstract question of censorship altogether&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Straphangers.&rdquo;  I think that was the book the Senator was primarily interested in, and if any book might be considered to be brought under the censorship, I think that book certainly might, and leaving aside, as I was saying, the abstract question of censorship which does not arise at the moment.  Senator Sir John Keane mentioned another book, &ldquo;The Postman Always Knocks Twice.&rdquo;  I understand that this book has been excluded. I suppose, now that the Senator has knocked the third time, the paper he refers to will also be dealt with.  I do not know that I have anything more to add.  The co-ordination and the co-operation that the Senator seems to want is already in existence.  The Censorship Board and the Customs officers work in co-operation with a view to making the censorship more complete.</P>

      <P>I do not think that this is so much a matter for co-operation between the two Government Departments as for consideration by the Government as to whether they would not omit from the Act of 1876 &ldquo;books.&rdquo; At the time that Act was passed there was no censorship of books.  After all, when a Customs officer receives a parcel containing a book he has no real opportunity of judging the nature of the book.  Therefore, I think it would be very much better if the Act of 1876 were amended by striking out the word &ldquo;books.&rdquo;  The position then would be that if a Customs officer stopped a book it would come at once within the jurisdiction of the censorship which is very strict.</P>

      <P>When the Censorship Act was passing through the Seanad I feared that what is now happening would occur: that individuals would have entirely different opinions on this subject, because opinions vary very much, and that some very stupid things would be done.  I feared that some books perfectly sensible and reasonable would be rejected, and I think that is the case.  I am a subscriber to a circulating library.  When I asked for certain books I was told that they were not allowed to issue them.  But I have since read them, and it was perfectly absurd to stop them.  There was nothing wrong in them at all.  I do not know how in the world people can find anything to object to in some of the books that are not allowed to come through.  There are certainly numbers of books that have been censored that are far more moral and respectable than nearly any of our original writers&mdash;Shakespeare or any of the others.</P>

      <P>What we are primarily concerned with at the moment is the inconvenience that is caused to the public.  We are not concerned with any particular book.  I am sure that Senator Sir John Keane only mentioned a number of books in order to bring out his point about the inconvenience that is being caused by <Col N="1670" /> the present method of dealing with books coming in here.  I noticed that when the Minister was dealing with the question of co-operation as between the Customs officer and the Censorship Board he used the word &ldquo;can.&rdquo;  The purpose of this motion is to get some explanation of the delay that takes place when a book is held up by a Customs officer.  I take it that what is wanted is that, when a Customs officer forwards a book to the Censorship Board that it will deal with the book there and then, and that a prompt answer will be sent to the person from whom the book has been seized.  That is the real question at issue&mdash;to put an end to the delay that takes place at present.  That is the kind of co-operation that Senator Sir John Keane is pressing for.  His complaint has nothing to do with any particular book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the lady concerned&mdash;I do not want to mention names&mdash;was advised on the 26th March, the date of the seizure, that the book had been detained under Section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.  She was later informed, on the 14th May, to the same effect in a letter from the Revenue Commissioners' Office which set out the terms of the section.  Senator Sir John Keane may feel that the action taken was not as prompt as it might have been.  I am not in a position to speak for the Department, but in my opinion the delay was not unreasonable, considering all the circumstances.  With regard to the point made by Senator Brown as to the desirability of removing from the Customs authorities the power conferred by the 1876 Act and of concentrating all authority so far as this matter is concerned in the Censorship Board, I am not in a position to speak off-hand on that, but I will mention it to the Minister for Justice.  So far as I know, I do not think the Senator's suggestion would be practicable or possible because all sorts of matters come through in parcels which the Customs authorities have to deal with.  Some of these might be pornographic, and it might be desirable to exclude them from the country.  Therefore, I think that the <Col N="1671" /> authority of the Customs officers in this matter will have to be maintained, but, as I have said, I will ask the Minister for Justice to look into it.  I do not see any possibility of that restriction being removed.  It has not been removed elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I do not want to pursue the question of the correspondence between my informant and the Department.  I have the letter here that was written when the original seizure was notified.  My informant writes: &ldquo;I have been unable to get any redress from the Customs officers about my seized book, which is said to be obscene and indecent.  That is over two months now and I have written once a week to the Secretary at Dublin Castle.  The only reply I got was one postcard entirely in Irish which, as I was in England, I could not get translated.  I have since ascertained that it indicated that my letter would have attention.  About three weeks later I received a postcard saying the same thing in English.&rdquo;  Then on the 16th May something happened.  It is rather interesting that this discussion should have taken place, because we now know from what the Minister has stated that any individual Customs officer can exercise his own discretion and seize any book which, on the face of it, is neither obscene nor pornographic. The Customs officer gets a book, opens it and looks into it and if he sees a passage in it that he does not like he sends it up.  I suggest that is not a reasonable way to act in a matter of this kind.  There should be some provision for a central authority to examine these books and hold them over preparatory to censorship.  But <Col N="1672" /> to let each Customs officer act, at once, as his own inspector, does seem absurd.  It is no doubt legal but it really seems an absurd and grotesque method.  It would be his duty to do that if he was dealing with an obviously indecent and pornographic work.  In the case of the book the &ldquo;Straphangers&rdquo; I think it has not been censored yet.  Is the party who wrote it to have the book back if it is not censored?</P>

      <P>Before the motion is withdrawn may I say that Customs officers have even more responsible duties put upon their individual shoulders on this and other matters than what the Senator thinks.  How is a Customs officer to know whether a book is objectionable if he is not allowed to open and read it ?  We know all the books that come in are not read by the officers.  But the officer has, implicitly, the power to hold up any particular book or to take one book out of 50 and examine it.  I do think it is unreasonable to say that the Customs officer is vested with any undue power in that.  The Customs authorities have a right to hold up any book at the time it comes in.  In the case of this particular book I will say they were quite justified in holding it up according to the law.</P>
      <P>Motion by leave withdrawn.</P>
