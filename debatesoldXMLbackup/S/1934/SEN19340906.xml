These accounts will be submitted to and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and any comment he thinks necessary to make upon them will appear in his annual report.</P>

      <P>As an indication of the public interest in and, I suggest, apprehension about this amendment, I might mention that, although there are no papers and little is known of what is happening here, I have been approached by three persons who are very much concerned at the principle embodied in these amendments. Therefore I feel it my duty to ask the House to reconsider the matter.  There was no division on the amendment in Committee Stage and there was not a very full House.  Now that we have a better House, I ask Senators to reconsider the position.  Those who were here will probably remember and <Col N="685" /> those who were not here may be impressed by the diversity of support which this amendment got.  Senator Comyn opposed it and so did Senator Milroy and I&mdash;three Senators who are rarely in agreement.  Although only a week has elapsed, the Seanad may be prepared, on second thoughts, to revise its attitude on this principle.  It seems to be a limitation of the rights of shareholders to appoint whom they like to manage their business.  It is the first real direct invasion by the Government, or rather by the Legislature, of the sphere of actual control, or rather management.  It means imposing conditions of management on the proprietors and I think that is altogether undesirable; it is narrowing and putting a limitation upon efficiency.  We want to attract all the brains we can get to the management of industry.  I think the arguments, such as they are, are fully understood by the House and I will ask Senators to reconsider their attitude.</P>

      <P>I think the correction which Senator Sir John Keane made in the course of his speech was a wise one.  He said the Government is responsible for this and then he corrected himself and said the Legislature. I think he is right; it is the Legislature that will be responsible for this when it becomes the law.  There is nothing so clear as this, that the Minister washed his hands out of this amendment.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator Robinson I beg to move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  Section 12 (being the new section inserted in Committee).  To delete <Col N="686" /> the section and to substitute therefor a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>12.&mdash;(1)  As soon as may be after the passing of this Act the Minister shall establish and shall thereafter maintain a register (in this section referred to as the said register) of new manufacture licence granted under this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  Immediately upon the establishment of the said register the Minister shall enter therein all new manufacture licence granted under the Principal Act before the passing of this Act, and whenever a new manufacture licence is granted after the passing of this Act the Minister shall forthwith enter such licence in the said register.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every entry of a new manufacture licence in the said register shall include a statement of the name of the person to whom such licence was granted, the article, material, or substance to which such licence relates, and the thing or things which the licensee under such licence is authorised by such licence to do.</P>
    <P>(4)  The said register shall be kept at such place in the City of Dublin as the Minister shall direct and shall be open to inspection by the public during the prescribed hours on every day (except Sundays and bank holidays) on payment of the prescribed fee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>During the discussion of this Bill in Committee an amendment was inserted requiring the Minister to publish in the Official Gazette the name of any person to whom a licence is issued and particulars as to the subject of the licence and requiring him, in addition, to publish within three months similar particulars concerning any licence issued under the Principal Act.  Senator Douglas, who moved the amendment, and other Senators, including Senator Johnson, indicated in their remarks that they would be satisfied with and, in fact, they would prefer, an arrangement by which these particulars concerning each licence would be inserted in a register to be kept by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and which would be open <Col N="687" /> to inspection by members of the public on payment of a small fee.  I think that would be the preferable course and, consequently, I arranged to have this amendment drafted.  It provides for the maintenance of a register, the insertion in it of the same particulars as were mentioned in the amendment passed in Committee and the availability of that register for inspection by members of the public every day, during hours to be prescribed, on payment of a fee.  I recommend the amendment to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has stated is quite correct, so far as my remarks on the Committee Stage were concerned.  The principle, which I still believe is right, that the public should be able to know to whom a licence is given, is set out in this amendment just as it was in the original amendment. I am inclined to think that this is a preferable method.  It is much better to pay a small fee to those concerned, who have a proper interest in the matter, rather than to have single names published from time to time.  If the House agrees, I have no objection to the substitution of this amendment for the amendment carried on the Committee Stage.  The principle is exactly the same.</P>

      <P>Section 20.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Where the Minister refuses to grant a reserved commodity manufacture licence to an applicant who claims that he was, on the date of the application or on the day before the appointed day (whichever is the earlier), manufacturing the reserved commodity to which such application related, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such applicant may, within three months after such refusal, apply in a summary manner to the High Court for a declaration that such licence should be granted to him;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the High Court, if it is satisfied that such applicant was so manufacturing such reserved commodity as aforesaid and that having regard to all the circumstances <Col N="689" /> of the case it is just and equitable that such licence should be granted to such applicant, may make a declaration that such licence should be granted to such applicant accordingly;</P>
    <P>(c)  whenever the High Court makes an order under this section declaring that a reserved commodity manufacture licence should be granted to a person, the Minister shall, as soon as conveniently may be, grant under and in accordance with this Act such licence to such person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated during the discussion in Committee my intention of having this amendment moved on the Report Stage, in order to allay certain apprehensions which were aroused concerning the possible undesirable effects of Part III of the Bill.  Senators will remember that it was stated that it might be possible that some person engaged in manufacturing a commodity, declared by order to be a reserved commodity, might be refused a licence to continue manufacturing, and consequently be the victim of an injustice.  A resolution moved in Committee provided for compensation in such cases, but I indicated that I would prefer to provide that such person should be given the statutory right to a licence, rather than that the question of compensation should be introduced.  This amendment provides that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce refuses a licence under Part III, a person who claims to have been manufacturing a commodity declared a reserved commodity may appeal to the High Court within three months after the refusal for a declaration that such licence should be granted to him.  If the High Court, having heard the applicant, is satisfied that he was engaged in manufacturing a commodity, and having regard to all the circumstances, considers that it is just and equitable that he should be given a licence, the court may make a declaration to that effect.  If the High Court makes such a declaration the Minister, as soon as conveniently may be, shall grant the licence.</P>

      <P>I do not want to anticipate or to prejudice what I may say on another motion later on, but I would like the Minister to deal with a certain aspect of these words &ldquo;reserved commodity.&rdquo;  It appears in practice that the Minister can create a reserved commodity now, altogether outside the purview of this Bill.  He has only to take an article which wants substantial capital to make, and then put a duty or a quota on imports and arrange with a manufacturer to manufacture. Although we know that it will not be illegal for nationals to compete, I would like to have generally, if possible, an assurance from the Minister that he will not use these powers in that way, practically to create a reserved commodity indirectly.  The Minister must agree that that could be done in the way I have indicated.  It would be undesirable if all this machinery now being set up could be circumvented on account of technical defects or flaws in the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment in this form rather surprised me.  I wonder if the Minister is really in favour of it in the form in which it is drafted, if my reading of it is correct.  I understood from the Minister that it was his intention to provide a right for any person manufacturing a commodity, at any rate for sale to the public, that he would have the right to receive a licence, and that the only question in dispute would be between that person and the Minister, as to whether in fact he was really manufacturing at the time.  If that was the intention, then it was quite right to provide that the High Court should decide whether he was really manufacturing or not.  The amendment seems to me to create a principle which I do not think exists in any previous legislation, and which I would not like to have adopted, although I do not oppose it in this form without further consideration.  It seems to me that the High Court could virtually decide what the policy of the Department is.  Clause (b) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The High Court, if it is satisfied that such applicant was so manufacturing such reserved commodity as <Col N="691" /> aforesaid and that having regard to all the circumstances of the case it is just and equitable that such licence should be granted to such applicant, may make a declaration that such licence should be granted...</P>
    <P>That is a matter of fact which the High Court could decide between the applicant and the Minister, if there was a dispute.  But having so decided, they might then go into what is a matter of Government policy, and decide whether such applicant should have a licence. So far that is a matter for the Minister or for the Government.  Here the High Court, without any indication of what policy they are adopting in principle, or what would be regarded as just and equitable, could conceivably say to an applicant manufacturing in a small way that the Government had created such and such a commodity a reserved commodity.  They might say: &ldquo;We do not like him, because we do not think him financially strong enough, or we do not like his way of business, and, therefore, we do not think he ought to get a licence in addition to the new firm.&rdquo;  I do not like the High Court being placed in that position.  I would like to confine the High Court to an interpretation of fact or law.  That would be the better way.  As this section is only expected to affect very few, if any, cases, it would be better to leave it so that if anyone was manufacturing at the time, and wanted a licence, he was entitled to it.  Let the High Court decide whether in fact he was manufacturing or not.  I would be prepared to go further, and to say that he was manufacturing for sale to the public.  I would not give this right to anyone manufacturing in his own home or for experimental purposes, but I would like to safeguard the position of anyone manufacturing for sale to the public.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be wiser to leave the section as it was, having regard to all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>This amendment is introducing a new principle.  In the Industrial and Commercial Property Act there is a somewhat similar appeal to the High Court, but, in that case, the principle upon which the High Court would decide is whether it was just and equitable. <Col N="692" /> This does not seem to be an exact parallel.  I do not know of any other case where the High Court would decide what would be a matter of Departmental policy.  Whilst something should be there in order to allay apprehension, and while I do not oppose the amendment, I question if it is wise to include these words and to let the High Court decide whether a person was a manufacturer or not. I also suggest that the words &ldquo;for sale to the public&rdquo; might be a wise safeguard. While the amendment does not harm, we should realise that it is not an absolute safeguard.  There is not the slightest doubt that anyone manufacturing in a small way will be in a pretty helpless position against the position of a large firm manufacturing for the whole country if the Government creates a commodity a reserved commodity.  While it is better that some amendment should be introduced, I ask the Minister carefully to consider the effects of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has carefully considered the phraseology of the amendment, and I cannot agree with what Senator Douglas has said that the words &ldquo;just and equitable&rdquo; should be excluded from the section.  He says that the courts are not accustomed to determine matters of that kind.  Why, from the sitting until the rising of the courts, day in and day out, that is what they are always deciding&mdash;whether a thing is just and equitable.  It may be that a man who has been manufacturing a reserved commodity, may have been manufacturing it in such circumstances that it is not right that he should continue, or that the inconvenience of his continuing to manufacture that commodity would far outweigh any advantage that would accrue to him or to anyone else by its manufacture. That is a question which the court is competent to consider.  The court is also competent to consider whether a man is seriously injured, whether injustice is done to him, and in case he has no strict legal right, whether it is equitable that he should be deprived of his business or, on the other hand, that he should be allowed to continue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> I find, creeping into the debates in this Assembly, a desire to over-refine and explain what is obvious.  Two or three days ago we were asked to explain one of the plainest legal phrases known to the law.  Now there seems to be an idea that these words &ldquo;just and equitable&rdquo; are beyond the scope of courts and judges.  I can assure the Seanad that there is no tribunal better fitted to determine the question of fact, whether the manufacture of the commodity was going on at a particular date, and also the other fact, whether it would be just and equitable to allow the person to continue that manufacture, than the tribunals which have been determining the meaning and the application of these words on every day of every term during which the court sits.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in the section which I am surprised was not adverted in the very meticulous perusal which this and other sections have received.  What about the word &ldquo;commodity&rdquo;?  Does &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; always mean the same thing; and will it mean the same thing in the progress of manufacturing and industrial development? I do not wish to raise any questions as to the form of this section, but if I were inclined to be critical I would probably ask for some explanation of the word &ldquo;commodity,&rdquo; or whether there should not be some explanatory phrase after that word &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; indicating that the article manufactured at the particular date was a commodity of the same or a like description.  However, the point has not been raised, and I am certainly not going to raise it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say might not be said to be very strictly appropriate to this amendment.  But I want to ask the Minister if the position will be that, once having reserved a commodity, unless he fixes a limit of time under Section 16 (4), it remains for ever a reserved commodity.  Is there any means whatever of withdrawing it from reservation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was contemplated originally that once an article was declared to be a reserved commodity it should not be possible for the Executive <Col N="694" /> Council to alter that position without promoting legislation and securing the passage of that legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas. The amendment giving power to limit the time during which an order might operate was inserted during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil following certain discussions.  But if there is no limit of time prescribed when the order is being made, then the order remains indefinitely in force unless revoked by legislation.</P>
      <P>On the various points raised, I should like to say merely this: Senator Sir John Keane is undoubtedly correct when he says that it is possible to make a commodity a reserved commodity in certain circumstances, without the aid of this legislation, by the imposition of restrictions upon the importations of that commodity following its manufacture here by one firm.  In certain cases it is true that if one firm starts manufacturing a commodity it is unlikely that any other firm will do it, particularly if the market for the commodity is a limited one, or the capital required to undertake its manufacture is very great.  It is that situation that is in fact the justification for Part III of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances, although there is a certain amount of effective power to impose conditions regarding price, quality, location, distribution, etc., there is no legal power to do so. If that situation were likely to arise, the Government would obviously have to consider the advisability of making such a commodity a reserved commodity in order to get, under Part III of the Bill, the powers set out in Section 22; that is, power to require that certain conditions would be fulfilled with respect to meeting the requirements of the country with articles at a fixed maximum price and of a certain quality, employing Saorstát, nationals, using Saorstát materials, etc.  It is because of that situation that in fact Part III of the Bill was largely devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not quite agree with Senator Douglas that the words in paragraph (b) to which he referred are unnecessary or are likely to operate in a manner unfair to a person who claims <Col N="695" /> to be a manufacturer of a reserved commodity, who is refused a licence, and who applies to the High Court.  I think there is no particular harm in giving the High Court the wider discretion which these words permit of. My feeling in that matter is accentuated by the fact that I firmly believe this particular new section will never be called into use.  Part III of the Bill prescribes that no article can be declared to be a reserved commodity if it is being manufactured to any substantial extent in the country and I do not contemplate that at any time any article will be made a reserved commodity if there is anybody manufacturing it here.  Consequently, a claim under the proposed new Section 20 is never likely to arise.  If it does arise, I think the insertion of these words will give the court a discretion in doubtful cases of the nature indicated by a certain phrase used by Senator Comyn.  There is a difficulty in determining what is a commodity.</P>
    <P>Senators who have had experience of the operation of certain tariff resolutions know that the minutest description of a commodity contained in a resolution is often found to be inaccurate; to cover commodities not contemplated, or to exclude commodities which it was intended should be covered. On that account, it is always possible that some manufacturer might claim that his interests are being adversely affected by the making of a reserved commodity order, even though he is not making the precise commodity defined in the order, but claims to be making some commodity so closely akin to that as to be of the same description.  The giving of the wider powers to the High Court to determine whether it is in fact just and equitable that that manufacturer should be refused a licence is, I think justifiable under the circumstances.</P>

      <P>Section 3.  To delete in line 26 the words and figures &ldquo;to whom the Act of 1924 applies&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words and figures &ldquo;in receipt of a military service pension under the Acts of 1924 to 1930.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think my amendments, Nos. 3 and 4, and the Minister's amendment, No. 5, deal with the same point.  They all deal with the question of persons who under the 1924 Act were entitled to pensions, but did not get them because they did not apply in time.  Some of these people were scattered in different parts of the world.  Some were in Canada; some were in Australia; some were sailing the seas of the world.  My amendment No. 3 would allow these people to get the benefits of this Bill if this alteration were made.  The later amendment, No. 4, in my name, would bring them in under the 1924 Act and give them the full benefit of that Act.  Amendment No. 5, which is <Col N="697" /> the Government amendment, would, if the Minister accepted my amendment to that amendment, cover the points I raised.  There was an amendment circulated to-day by the Minister which goes a good way to meet my points.  I have not taken any legal advice but I think if the time is extended as proposed in that new amendment, I could accept it in substitution for my present amendment. I want the people who were late in applying under the 1924 Act to be covered, and I think the Government ought to go the full way in meeting that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with the men who are entitled to pensions under the 1924 Act and could not apply because they were abroad in other countries or serving on boats or something like that. Where that happened I have power without amendment of the regulations, to consider such cases and have them examined.  I have here the regulation made on the 3rd February, 1927, and it says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every application to the Minister for a certificate of military service under this Act must be made not later than the 31st December, 1925, provided the Minister for Defence may accept an application after that date from persons who tender reasons satisfactory to him for their failure to apply before the date fixed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would consider a person who had been away in Canada or who had been away serving on a boat as giving a satisfactory reason for failure to apply.  I intend to operate this regulation in any application brought to my notice, where a satisfactory case is made.  It is impossible to include all cases under the 1924 Act, but if a satisfactory case is brought forward I shall refer it to the Board of Assessors. With that in view I have circulated a further amendment.  It reads:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 16 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>16.&mdash;Where a certificate of military service is granted to any person after the date of the passing of this Act and a pension under the Act of <Col N="698" /> 1924 is granted to such person, such pension shall, notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Act of 1924, commence as from the 1st day of October, 1934, or the day of his discharge from the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann, whichever of those dates shall be the later.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House will notice the date 1st October, 1934.  As the 1924 Act stands, if a person came forward and had a satisfactory reason for not applying, if a certificate were granted his pension would date from the 1st October, 1924. I think it would be unreasonable to ask that.  Therefore, with a view to considering the number of applications that will come forward, I am asking the Seanad to say that it is a reasonable thing to date the pension as from the 1st October, 1934, instead of the 1st October, 1924, in such cases.</P>

If the Minister's new amendment is accepted, I think I would ask leave to withdraw my amendments Nos. 3 and 4 and my amendment to amendment No. 5.</P>

      <P>Provided that the grade of rank to be allotted to persons who claim and prove military service in Easter Week, 1916, and had no service after the 11th day of July, 1921, shall be, in the cases of such persons for whom Rank C, Rank D, or Rank E would be the appropriate rank, two ranks higher than the rank ascertainable under sub-section (1) of this section, and in the case of persons for whom Rank B would be the appropriate rank, one rank higher; provided also that the grade of rank to be allotted to persons who claim and prove military service for the period from but not including Easter Week, 1916, to the 11th day of July, 1921, and had no other service shall, in cases of ranks lower than Rank A, be one rank higher than is ascertainable under sub-section (1) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is general agreement amongst all parties that the men who took part in Easter Week and the Black and Tan war should be well looked after.  Senator Foran, on the Second Reading, said&mdash;I have the debates here, but it is not necessary <Col N="700" /> to read out exactly what he said&mdash;that he would like to see the same pensions granted to privates as to officers, and I think there is a great deal to be said for that point of view.  The privates who went out in Easter Week offered their lives for Ireland just as well as the officers did, and my amendment is a levelling up amendment, if you like. It is going half-way to meet the point Senator Foran made on the Second Reading.  I think it is just and fair, and I hope that the Labour Party in the Seanad, and particularly the Labour Party in the Dáil will support that point of view.</P>
    <P>I am only asking for one rank for the men who took part in the Black and Tan war.  They certainly deserve everything that can be done for them also.  We all remember the street shootings, and all the other kinds of warfare that were carried on, and we remember how brave those men were. I do not want to be shouting about it, but I think everyone will agree that only for the Easter Week men and for the men who fought the Black and Tan war we would not be sitting here to-day. There would be no Irish Free State.  So far as the men who took sides in the civil war are concerned, under the 1924 Act the people who joined the Defence Forces have been looked after and have been drawing their pensions for a long time.  The people who fought against the State at that time will be getting a pension under this Act, and certainly, unless there was a change to a Republic or some other form of Government, I am sure that they never expected any pension.  They are getting it now, however, and I do not begrudge it to them, but I think that the sensible men who took no part in the civil war should get some extra recognition.  When it comes to the writing of history, I think that the people who took part in the civil war will be forgotten when the people who took part in Easter Week and in the Black and Tan war will be remembered by the people of this country.  I think that the very least the people might do would be to treat them generously.</P>
    <P>It is true that a number of men who took part in 1916 have died since in the Dublin Union.  I do not know whether <Col N="701" /> they have the usual six feet by two feet which everybody claims as their right, or whether they are in a pauper's grave, but I think that the fact that these men died in the Dublin Union is a disgrace to this country.  I know of another man who is in a hospital at the present moment.  His name is on a monument over at Mount Street Bridge.  His name is actually on the monument built by a grateful people. He has been in hospital for many months, and a few months ago a subscription had to be made up to prevent his wife and children from being evicted.  I ask the Minister and the Government to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Staines has made a case that would be all right if it were not proposed already to treat the Easter Week men in a particularly generous way.  Under the 1924 Act, if a man had service in Easter Week he got four years' service for pensionable purposes for the service he rendered in Easter Week.  Under this Bill, as amended, it is proposed to give anybody who took part in Easter Week four years' pension for that week of service.  I think that is particularly generous.  In regard to the Black and Tan war also, for some of the half calendar years you have a year of service given.  For the calendar year from the 1st April, 1920, to the 31st March, 1921, you have two years of service awarded; and for the last four months of the Black and Tan war, one year's service is awarded.  I think that the pensionable service awarded, in view of the length a man served, is particularly generous and that there is no reason at all for this stepping-up in rank in addition to what has been done already.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry to see Senator Staines pressing this amendment, particularly as his attitude has been exceedingly helpful through all the stages of the Bill.  After all, if he insists on special extra treatment being given to the men of Easter Week beyond what is being given already in the Bill, I can visualise the people who took part in the Four Courts fight, where they went through a terrible time and who are getting nothing at all, sitting up and asking for special treatment also.  I think that the granting of four years' service for seven days is quite a consideration, and if they served for another year after, it is five years' service.  After all the Minister has been very anxious to meet Senator Staines's point of view and I think there is no use in pressing him too far.  I think that Senator Staines ought to withdraw his amendment in keeping with the rest of his attitude which has been most helpful.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (2).  To delete in line 51 the words &ldquo;or a practising barrister of at least ten years' standing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers to the section dealing with the appointment of a referee.  I ask the House to have in mind the supremely important position that this referee will occupy and the great power he will have.  I referred to it on a previous occasion.  To him every application that is made must be referred.  He will examine the <Col N="703" /> evidence in reference to the application and will make a report.  If he reports that the applicant is a person qualified for a certificate the Minister must give that certificate, and if the certificate is issued the Minister for Finance must find the money for his pension, provided that the Dáil votes it.  That pension, on the average, will continue, roughly, for 30 years.  I pointed out before that it probably means a lump sum of from £10,000,000 to £12,000,000 if one takes into account the figure of £400,000 for 30 years.  I raised some questions on the accounting of this sum before but I was not supported.  In the course of the discussion I was referred to the fact that the courts did this sort of thing regularly.</P>
    <P>I am asking in this amendment to ensure that the status of the referee will be of such a kind as to make him at least equal to that of a judge: that he cannot be removed except by a vote of the Houses.  Therefore I am asking that the phrase &ldquo;or practising barrister of at least ten years' standing&rdquo; should be deleted from this Bill.  I recognise that is the form of the previous Act.  The only difference as between this Bill and that Act is that there is now a Supreme Court judgment which removes from the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Defence any option in regard to the payment of a pension.  But in the position that the referee is to be placed, I think he ought to be a person who is not removable by the Minister or the Executive Council, and that he should at least have the status of a judge.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the duties of this referee will take all his time for a year or two, and that if the amendment were passed it would probably mean that one of the existing judges would have to be transferred from his duties in the courts to this office.  I take it that would not present a tremendous difficulty, as more judges will have to be appointed.  The important thing that I am asking the House to agree to is, that the referee, having these tremendous powers, the supreme authority in respect to the payment of these moneys, <Col N="704" /> the granting of these certificates and the awarding of these pensions, from whose judgment there will be no appeal, ought not to be &ldquo;a practising barrister of at least ten years' standing&rdquo; who, when his job is finished, will be looking for practice or promotion in the future, but that he ought to be an independent officer of the law.  That is the whole purpose of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson has overlooked one point and it is this: we have no guarantee that a judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court or a justice of the District Court is going to accept an appointment made by the Executive Council.  The person that I would like to see accept the appointment is one of the existing judges, and that he should carry out the duties as long as he was able to do so.  But, according to another amendment of Senator Johnson's, if for any reason the judge who was acting as referee got sick, then we would have to appoint another judge in his place.  As I understand it, the Executive Council, when appointing judges, have to appoint a barrister of at least ten years' standing.  According to the provisions of this Bill the referee must either be an existing judge or a man with such a practice at the Bar that he would be eligible for appointment to the position of judge if there was a vacancy.  I think it is only reasonable that the Executive Council, in looking around for a suitable person to appoint as referee, should be left with a discretion to appoint either a judge or a lawyer of such standing that he would be eligible to be made a judge if there was a vacancy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment really has reference to the same idea.  I do not want a referee, having all these powers, to be a person who can be removed at will by the Executive <Col N="705" /> Council.  It is in line with the argument that the referee should be of the status of a judge.  I agree that there may be some difficulty in the administration of this so long as the referee may be a mere practising barrister without the status of a judge.

      <P>Section 9.  To delete all after the word &ldquo;final&rdquo; in line 60 down to the end of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to have the law relating to these pensions similar to the law relating to the pensions of other classes of public servants.  The Superannuation Acts of 1859, 1887, 1909, and of 1923, which is a Free State Act, all declare that the decisions of the Treasury or, in our case, of the Department of Finance, shall be final in respect to the superannuation of civil servants, the Metropolitan Police, the Royal Irish Constabulary, etc. And in respect of a number of other Acts dealing with the same class of payment it is provided that the decision of the Treasury or the decision of the Minister for Finance shall be final.  That, I think, should be enough without double-locking and barring the possibility that the courts might have to be appealed to, or that the Comptroller and Auditor-General might want to report to the Dáil on some matters concerned with the payment of these accounts.  If the law is that the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall have no power to examine these accounts, then the deletion of these words will make no difference.  If also the provisions of the Constitution regarding the position of the courts&mdash; the High Court and so on&mdash;would cover this kind of case, notwithstanding the reference to &ldquo;conclusive and binding on all persons and tribunals whatsoever,&rdquo; and if the entry of this phrase has no legal effect <Col N="706" /> against the Constitution, it is better to delete it.  I am trying to do what I have tried to do for five or six years &mdash;to make it possible for the Dáil to know what is happening in regard to the allocation of pensions, and it is for that purpose that I ask the House to agree to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention of preventing the Comptroller and Auditor-General from examining the accounts.  It is however, intended, as it was under the amendment of the 1924 Act which was introduced and passed, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should not be set up as a trial judge to re-try all the cases that will go before the referee and the board of assessors.  In the case of superannuation of an ordinary civil servant, the years of service are down in black and white.  It is well known from the written records how long that civil servant served, and it is only on the word of some other civil servant who has examined the records that the Auditor-General has to go.  I take it that he accepts the certificate of his years of service and then, in examining the accounts, simply finds out whether the retired civil servant is getting more than the pension due to him by reason of his number of certified years of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of this Bill and the 1924 Act, the finding of service is a much more difficult thing.  The referee, in order to satisfy himself that a man had active service during any of the periods mentioned, will have to examine a number of witnesses and there are practically no written records.  Because the thing is so difficult, we decided in this Bill to have a judge or barrister of ten years' standing as referee and with him a number of men who will hear the evidence, act as a board of assessors and advise him what to do.  I think it would be absolutely impossible for the Comptroller and Auditor-General, coming along afterwards, to review in detail the work done by the referee and this board. If he did, I think it would be done in a most unsatisfactory way and if we did put that duty on him, he would <Col N="707" /> have to get a staff and it would take them as many years to review the cases as it took the referee and his board originally to go through them. It is quite correct that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should see the report upon which the Minister bases the certificate but I do not think he should go any further and set himself up as an appeal court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no suggestion in this amendment or in my argument about making the Auditor-General an appeal court against the referee.  I want to put the Auditor-General in the same position in this matter as he is in respect to superannuation to, let us say, policemen&mdash;R.I.C. men and others. The Minister said that he takes the certificate of service in respect of a civil servant.  Yes, he does, but he is not precluded from inquiring whether that certificate has been granted properly.  That officer is appointed by the Dáil according to the Constitution to examine the accounts for which the Ministers are responsible.  The Minister appears to take the view that his accounts have only to be examined from the point of issue from the particular officer of the Ministry.  That is not the position at all and there is no suggestion of the Auditor-General examining into every case, or even the great majority of cases.  He is to be allowed to do in this as he is allowed to do, and does, in respect of old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the whole of my argument. He may not require one additional officer but I think it is very bad policy definitely and deliberately to exclude him from his duties by this kind of legislation. I frankly acknowledge that the fact that the referee is to be an individual in the capacity of a judge, or one who may be a judge, is better than having a chairman assisted by two others who can override him.  I think it is far better to have a responsible judge or a quasi judge than to have a board, two members of which may be members of the Government whose accounts are <Col N="708" /> being audited.  But with all that, I think it is still a bad principle to have introduced time after time legislation deliberately depriving the Auditor-General of the rights which constitutional law and practice have given him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The only answer I would make to Senator Johnson's argument is that the certificate of a judge, when he gives his decision for the payment of a sum against the Government, has to be met and the Comptroller and Auditor-General cannot go back and re-try the case.  He has to accept the certificate of the judge, and all that he is asked to do now is to treat the report of the referee in the same manner.</P>

The Minister appears to think that the words which open sub-section (2) of this section, &ldquo;where it appears from a report,&rdquo; make a difference to the Minister's discretion.  He said the words were: &ldquo;If it appeared to the Minister that the report relates to a person to whom the Act applies, the Minister shall grant to such person a service certificate.&rdquo;  I wonder whether the Minister really thinks that he has discretion under that sub-section?</P>

      <P>(7)  None of the foregoing provisions of this Rule shall apply to any person who at any date was a member of Fianna Eireann or of Cumann na mBan and was not at any date a member of Oglaigh na hEireann (Irish Republican Army) or of the Irish Volunteers, and in lieu thereof the following provisions shall have effect in relation to any such person, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think it is very desirable that such an amendment should be put in.  My belief is that everybody who fought in 1916, and between that and 1921, should be under the care of the State, certainly to an extent sufficient to keep them from distress.  But there are other people who did just as much as the Cumann na mBan.  I am not depreciating the Cumann na mBan in any way, but there are plenty of women all over the country who did just as good work as they did.  They left their homes, carried arms across the country, went through all sorts of different hardships, looked after the wounded, and supplied them with food.  These women were not organised as the Cumann na mBan were.  They did just as much as the men did.  An army has the first and second and the third lines, and the second line is as important sometimes as the first.  These women were in the second line.  They did not carry firearms, but they did as much as could have been done, and I feel quite confident that if they had not turned up, and that if they had not spent their time and their lives in hardship, the people would not have succeeded.  I believe in the final result the battle was won by the way in which they supported the men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to Senator Sir John Keane that there should be a Pensions Bill brought in in 18 years' time for the soldiers of the economic war.  The men who fought in 1916 have been waiting for their pensions for 18 years.  Before we finish up with this Bill, there is another class to which I would like to draw the attention <Col N="713" /> of the Minister, and it is this: I think the Bill has been so well received by all Parties that we ought to start now with a clean slate.  The number of men who received pensions under the 1924 Act and to whom I am referring is small.  For one reason or another a number of the pensions then given have been cancelled.  I have in mind one particular case.  If we assume that the man in question would live for 20 years&mdash;which is a natural assumption considering his age&mdash;this man, for a very minor offence, an offence for which he would get one month in Mountjoy, has been fined £1,400.  We do not want to condone his offence in any way.  He was guilty all right of this offence for which he would have got a month in Mountjoy in the ordinary way.  But, as I said, he has been fined £1,400 by the cancellation of his pension.  That is one case.  The Minister has all these records in his office.  I would ask him now to restore the pensions in all these cases where the pensions were cancelled.  That would help in many ways.  We want this slate wiped clean.  I want, as far as I can, to have the slate wiped clean, and I hope that the Minister, who knows the few cases to which I have referred, will endeavour to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRobinson" hpid="Mr. Séamus Robinson Mr. Séamus Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Séamus Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Staines that it would be desirable if the whole slate were wiped clean.  The Minister has stated here that he does not want redundancy of legislation and that he can give effect to the Senator's wishes under his present powers.  With regard to the statement of Senator Sir John Keane, I think he need not be afraid of the Minister or the Government taking the bit in their mouth and running headlong into granting all sorts of pensions.  Even those who are friends of the Minister know how difficult it is to get him to move where there is the slightest expenditure involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the Bill leaves this House, I should like to say a word or two in appreciation of the attitude of the Opposition as a whole to this Bill.  In fact every shade of political opinion in <Col N="714" /> the Opposition including the dark brown shade, shot with blue, was favourably disposed to the Bill.  Senator Miss Browne sounded a note which was, perhaps, a little bit discordant, but that was entirely because she was under the misapprehension that those who took part on the side of the Republic in the civil war only, and who had no previous service, were getting pensions under the Bill.  I am sure she has found out since that that is not so.</P>
    <P>I would ask her, however, not to expect me to agree with her that these men do not deserve recognition or help, because I think they do.  Under this Bill it might not be very easy to give it because those who served in the civil war only, on the National Army side, did not get any pensions under the 1924 Act.  On that parallel, it may be said that those who took part in the civil war on the Republican side should not get pensions.  It should be remembered, however, that the men who took part in the civil war on the Republican side did so without receiving any pay such as the National Army received. They got no gratuity when it was over, and had no opportunity of finding work such as was provided for those who left the National Army.  There is, therefore, a good case to be made for suitable recognition for those men who had civil war service only.  This fact should also be remembered: During the Tan war, the War of Independence, no officer was anxious to bring in new men to the Army.  He had sufficient men to carry on, having regard to the arms at his disposal.  It was our policy deliberately not to allow young men to join up wholesale.  Many of the men who did join up afterwards would have done so earlier had they been allowed, so that Senator Miss Browne and other members need not think that we, Republicans, are getting all our own way under this Bill.  I would like to say, in conclusion, that I hope that the spirit shown in regard to this Bill by the Opposition and amongst members generally in this House will help us to forget the hatchet that we all believe has been buried for some time.</P>

    <Title>Manufacture of Motor Tyres in the Saorstát&mdash;Motion by Senator Sir John Keane.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, in the absence of official particulars, the Seanad views with concern, the reported intention of the Government to grant to one firm the monopoly of manufacturing motor tyres in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>It will be within the recollection of the House that when apprehension has been voiced at the probable effect of legislation which gave very wide powers to Ministers, and when it was said, by some of us, that power was passing away from Parliament into the hands of the Executive, not only the present Ministers but their predecessors have always said &ldquo;You have got the power of motion; you have Parliament sitting from time to time and you can ask to raise these matters specifically when you think there is danger.&rdquo; I am taking that action now because I feel that in a recent happening there is, perhaps I cannot say danger, but very grave grounds for apprehension and there is very great uneasiness in the public mind, uneasiness which cannot find its full expression owing to the limited facilities for publicity that now exist.  We know what we do know from fragments that have appeared in the public Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that it is the intention of the Government to grant to one firm <Col N="716" />&mdash;it is immaterial how it is formed&mdash;the right to manufacture motor tyres and other rubber goods in the country.  I would suggest that the bulk of the manufacture will be motor tyres and it is with motor tyres that this motion is mainly concerned.  When I raised the question incidentally, on the Control of Manufactures Bill, which has just passed, the Minister said that it was to avoid the circumstances to which I am now referring, that Part III or Part IV of the Bill was passed. I can only ask why the matter could not have been kept over until the Control of Manufactures Bill was law because under the provisions of that Bill this present concession could be given with safeguards.  It would have been necessary to come to Parliament, state your case, and get a resolution passed.  My recollection is not quite clear as to whether it would be necessary to have it passed in the Dáil only or in both Houses.  As it is, the Minister has given the concession indirectly and I suggest he is giving, in effect, a monopoly because he is placing a quota on imports pending the establishment by this firm, the Dunlop Rubber Company, of a factory in Cork. As soon as these works are in being and in production, there will be an effective prohibition of imports and that firm will have, I suggest, a virtual monopoly.</P>
    <P>On general grounds, I suggest, action of that kind is most dangerous.  It has been urged before that, in principle, the Government should not be given power to enter into contracts with firms and to give these firms a very distinctive and privileged position over other manufacturers.  We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that where that has been done in other countries grave scandals, sooner or later, emerged and, as I said before, this country possesses its own share of original sin.  I think it is the duty of the Legislature to take protective steps so as to avoid any possibility of temptation of that kind being placed in the way of Ministers or officials.  I am not suggesting that in this case or in any case in the past, the action taken has not been perfectly free from corruption, but anybody <Col N="717" /> with any knowledge of human nature must know that there is very grave danger in action of this kind.  I would suggest to the House to adopt the view that it is most undesirable in the public interest that monopolies of this kind should be given without investigation or without any kind of public inquiry.  The previous Government, I think, recognised that when they established the Tariff Commission, a body of independent persons, to investigate similar matters, because tariffed industries are, in effect, in the same position as monopolies.  The previous Government set up a body of independent persons to carry out investigations and allowed all interested parties to appear before it.  The evidence was taken in public.</P>
    <P>There was a report, and in that report a case had to be made.  Questions had to be dealt with under certain headings. That afforded very substantial safeguards.  In this case we know nothing.  We have no information as to the effect on employment.  We do not know how many people are likely to be employed.  We have no knowledge as to how many people are likely to be thrown out of employment.  We know nothing whatever of the hardships or injustices that may follow from this Act.  I know that there are two firms registered in this country for the purpose of distributing motor tyres not of Dunlop manufacture. These people paid stamp duty and acted fully within the law and, certainly, with an assurance that they would be allowed to trade freely.  No doubt they are under contract with regard to the premises they have acquired.  I have no doubt that they have lorries and other property.  If this concession is going to work as expected, these people are going to be ruined.  Does the Minister intend that any compensation should be given them?  Are they going to be allowed, even as an act of grace, to make their case?  I think that it is most unjust that consequences of that kind should be even contemplated.  Where there is a possibility of wrongful acquisition, or even interference with the amenities of citizens in certain circumstances, in <Col N="718" /> connection with local government, an inspector comes down and holds an inquiry.  Everybody is heard and a report is made, following the inquiry. Nothing of this kind is being done in this case.  Out of the blue comes a series of orders which, in effect, gives one firm a monopoly and, so far as we can see, may lead to the driving out of business and the substantial ruin of certain persons.  I do not care how many of these persons there may be. If there are only half a dozen it is still a grave and gross injustice.  The Minister should tell the House what capital outlay is likely to take place as a result of this concession.  My information is&mdash; I have no technical knowledge and I give the information for what it is worth&mdash;that the requirements of this country do not justify an economic plant, that the approximate consumption of motor tyres in this country is 100,000 a year or, roughly, 300 per working day.  That is not an economic output.  If it is not economic, presumably the Company is not going to work at a loss.  Whatever is not economic will be made up by increase in price or some deterioration in quality. Generally, we have a right to know what safeguards the Minister has imposed to secure that the public will not now or in the future pay any more for tyres of present quality.  Moreover, we are entitled to know what steps the Minister has taken to secure that the present quality shall be maintained. Speaking without knowledge of motor tyre manufacture, I do not see that the Minister can ensure that merely by some declaration or written contract. The only possible way the Minister could ensure the maintenance of quality would be to get the firm to undertake that they would submit their tyres to the same running tests to which tyres are subjected at present.  We know that there are what, I think, are called &ldquo;bench tests.&rdquo;  We see advertisements of a circular machine on which the tyres run round for so many hours at so many thousand revolutions per hour.  Is the Minister taking steps to secure that these identical tests will be carried out in the factory in Cork and that there will be a representative of the Government there at all times <Col N="719" /> to secure that the public are protected? That this is a most undesirable method of doing business I grant, but if these monopolies are created, these are the consequences that must flow if the public are to be protected.  I ask the Minister whether or not he is going to insist that a representative of the Government will be present at the factory to protect the consumer.  Can the Minister tell us whether we are, under this arrangement, going to have the same range of quality as at present, because that firm makes three qualities of tyres of the same size.  Shall we have the same range of quality in the future that we have had in the past? I also ask the Minister to give us an estimate of what the loss of revenue will be.  I am informed that the revenue derived from the duty on tyres at present is in the region of £100,000 or £150,000 a year.  Has that been taken into consideration in reviewing the economics of this problem?  We have a right to know, on the one side, how many men are to be brought into employment and, on the other side, how many men are going to be thrown out of employment.  With regard to those likely to be displaced, I should say that some of them are earning from £6 to £7 per week, and that they contribute substantial amounts to the revenue in the shape of income tax and other charges.</P>
    <P>Generally, I ask the House to take a very serious view of this whole transaction.  It is most undesirable that we should be suddenly told that so-and-so has got a monopoly.  Nothing is said; all is done in the dark, and we wake up to find that we are in the hands of a single firm&mdash;I do not care how eminent.  Competition is abolished. The only alternative is the competition that nationals may provide, and no national will engage in capital outlay and instal machinery to go into competition with a firm of this kind.  The public are very concerned about this matter, and the Government are lucky that Press facilities are so limited at present.  It is for the Minister to make a full and frank statement to the House as to the transaction and as to the details arranged between the Government <Col N="720" /> and this company.  He should also state what steps the Government are taking to protect the consumer. Not merely should we have such a statement now, but that statement should be amplified by some white paper or document setting out in detail what has been done.</P>

      <P>I listened with very great interest to Senator Sir John Keane's speech, and, to a very large extent, I agree with it.  I know that monopolies are very undesirable, but in the present circumstances we have to face the situation as it is to-day. There is no question about it, there is an enormous amount of money going out of this country for tyres.  I think Senator Sir John Keane mentioned that there were 100,000 tyres required annually in Ireland.  Roughly, I reckon that would mean at least £200,000 to £300,000 a year.  This is a trade that can only be undertaken by a very big combine such as Dunlops, and in order to induce them to come into this country you have to give them very considerable advantages.  I happen to know that, because I tried to get another company to do exactly what the Dunlop Company are doing.  Looking at it from a business point of view, I think it is a perfectly sound proposition. Senator Sir John Keane has talked of the labour that will be displaced. Even though the company may have a monopoly, I still believe that all these distributing agents will be required.  I can hardly follow him when he says an enormous amount of money has been sunk by these distributing agencies in Ireland, for, beyond the tyres that they have in stock, and which will probably go up in value now, and the houses they have built, I do not really see what other expense they have been put to. One extraordinary thing about making tyres is that it apparently requires an enormous variety of machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it is contemplated that bicycle tyres will be made by this company.  If it embraces bicycle tyres it will probably mean a very considerable addition to the <Col N="721" /> 100,000 tyres Senator Sir John Keane talked of.  I understand that you have to have almost a separate machine for every different make and size of tyre. It is really one of these businesses that I think it is very desirable to have in the country.  We know perfectly well what a tremendous loss Dunlops has been to the City of Dublin.  In days gone by they sent the Dunlop Tyre Company out of this city and it made its headquarters in Coventry and it helped to make Coventry, then a rather insignificant town, a very large and thriving city.  I differ altogether with the mover of this resolution and I think it would be very wise for the Seanad to accept the situation which the Minister has brought about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>For once I find myself in agreement with Senator Crosbie.  I am old enough to remember the advent of the pneumatic tyre.  I rode bicycles with the solid and the cushion tyres and then with the pneumatic tyres.  I have always felt that if a native Government had been in this country at the time that great industry would never have been driven out of the country.  No doubt with the advent of the motor car factories would be established in other countries, but we would have the advantage of the employment given in the making of tyres in this city, where they were made in the first instance.  It is easy to make a case such as Senator Sir John Keane has outlined with regard to a great many things, and no doubt monopolies, except you have one yourself, are rather objectionable things.  With an industry of this sort, in view of the amount of capital which it entails, no private enterprise would have any chance against the people who have established themselves in the market. If we are put in the position of importing tyres as against making them, I think in the mind of any reasonable man there could be no case against giving a monopoly, reasonably safeguarded, as I am sure it will be, knowing the Minister for Industry and Commerce as I do, in the interest not only of the concessionaire but also in the interests of the general public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much impressed with the horror displayed by Senator Sir John Keane at the idea of a monopoly.  I look upon Senator Sir John Keane as a deeply-read man. There is no one in this House could tell us more about monopolies in this country, going back not alone for years but for centuries.  Monopolies have been the curse, the ruination of Ireland for the past three or four hundred years.  The monopolists came from the other side in the first instance and grabbed the land of this country. I am sure if Senator Sir John Keane were alive in those days he would have held up his hands in the same kind of horror at the monopolists; he would have adopted, I am sure, the same attitude towards them as he did to-day when he talked of the monopoly that is to be created in Cork.  It was the monopoly in every branch that helped to ruin this country.  In the first instance we had the land monopolists, the monopolists of 150 years ago or less who drove the unfortunate people out of this country.  We had the great monopolists who cleared the lands of Meath, the plains of Boyle; we had the people who were responsible for the Pollock clearances away on the borders of Roscommon; we had the people who made a monopoly of cattle-ranching and who drove the unfortunate people out of their little holdings into lands beyond the seas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in thorough agreement with Senator Sir John Keane against monopolies. Monopolies destroyed the milling trade of this country and you can see the ruins of the mills silhouetted along the banks of our canals and rivers.  All these places at one time were busy hives of industry.  What of the monopolies that were created in this city where I was born?  What of the monopoly in the brewery industry? In recent times there has been much caterwauling about a certain industry leaving this city.  In my humble judgment it was one of the greatest curses ever created in this city&mdash;I refer to Guinness'.  I remember in my young days there were six or seven or ten breweries in this city, but the monopolist has driven <Col N="723" /> them all out of business.  We have the monopolists in the bakery trade.  We have three or four large combines that can now rule the price of bread for the rich and for the poor.  In my young days there were many little bakeries supplying good bread to the residents of the city.  I could go on enumerating the many industries that have been destroyed in this city by the monopolists.</P>
    <P>When Senator Dowdall referred to the pneumatic tyre it brought back memories to me and, if I might mention a personal matter, I remember that the Minister's father and I were the first to ride pneumatic tyres in this part of the country.  When a little tyre industry was started in Westland Row there was the prospect of the creation of a good industry, but the monopolists, of which Senator Sir John Keane has such a horror, came from the other side of the water, and with their envious eyes, and with the help of the goody-goody people in Merrion Square, who objected to its remaining there, that industry was destroyed.  I would like to know if the scheme propounded by the Minister, who is carrying out the policy on which the Government came into office, and with which I am in thorough agreement, is monopoly.  In my opinion, it is not.  It is but the re-creation of an industry which monopolists took from this country.  Although I would be better pleased if the industry was reestablished in the cradle of its birth, instead of in Cork, at the same time, I am in agreement with the Minister, who is doing a good day's work for Ireland, by being able to restore the making of Dunlop tyres here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt when the Minister replies he will tell us the great benefits that are going to accrue not only to Cork but to the Free State, generally, because of this monopoly.  I do not suppose anyone in this House will disagree with Senator O'Neill when he said that monopolies are things that are looked upon with great <Col N="724" /> disfavour.  I do not think that even the Minister would attempt to establish a monopoly of this kind here unless there were great benefits coming to the Free State.  No doubt the Minister will tell us what they are.  I think Senator Crosbie was wrong when he said that this industry was going to confer such benefits as he described by manufacturing here.  As far as the sources of this manufacture are concerned, even with all our productive qualities, I do not think we are ever likely to grow cotton or rubber in the Free State, or that agriculture will get any benefit.  As to the machinery, of which Senator Crosbie thinks such a good deal, I do not believe any of it will be made in the Free State.  I have no doubt the British will thank us very much for the order for the machinery which will be brought over by the Dunlop Company.  When we know that, we know that Senator Sir John Keane was perfectly right in saying that when you establish a monopoly of this kind, it is necessary to take tremendous precautions and have examination in order to see that the public are not injured.  We are not going to manufacture the machinery, we are not going to grow the raw materials, but we are destroying all the benefits which the public get from competition.  Everyone knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we going to get out of it? We are going to get some building done.  We saw Gallaher's factory put up and worked for a short time, but it is lying there now.  Undoubtedly there will be some building done, and there will be a certain amount of hands employed, mainly labouring hands in the factory, which will probably benefit County Cork.  But what amount of labour will be required with first class machinery to produce all the tyres required in the Free State?  It is quite evident that will not be economic production. There is no doubt whatever about that.  I am quite certain the Minister would not have given a monopoly unless he was forced to do so, as it was the only way he could get this firm to come in and establish a factory here.  It looks to me as if all the benefit we are going to get out of this monopoly is the amount of labour <Col N="725" /> that will be employed in the factory in Cork.  What is that to balance against the iniquity of establishing a monopoly and putting out of business all the people who are at present engaged in the sale of the different competitive tyres?  As against the benefits, you have the number of respectable citizens of the Free State, who travel through the country selling the different tyres, whose business will disappear with a monopoly.  In their stead you will have one individual selling tyres, all the others who sold the competitive tyres having been wiped out.  I suppose the Minister will tell us how that problem is going to be dealt with, and how the Free State is going to benefit.  As an ordinary citizen I cannot see what benefit the Free State is going to get that will repay it for what I am perfectly certain are evident disadvantages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad Senator Sir John Keane put down this motion, because it gives me an opportunity of correcting a number of misstatements which have appeared in the Press concerning the project of the establishment of a rubber tyre factory at Cork, misstatements which have obviously affected some Senators, and which were apparently in part responsible for the motion itself.  In the first place, I should like to make it clear that this development, to use the words of Senator Sir John Keane, did not come out of the blue, in so far as persons concerned with the distribution of rubber tyres in this country are concerned. The idea of establishing a rubber tyre industry here has been in the mind of the Government for some time, and practically every firm interested to any extent in this market has either been approached by the Government, or has itself approached the Government on the question of establishing a factory here.  Various proposals were put up by different firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as other firms are concerned <Col N="726" /> they apparently accepted what Senator Sir John Keane stated to be a fact, that the market here was not sufficient to support a factory and they did not put forward any proposals. But every one of these firms knew that the idea of establishing a rubber tyre factory was in the air and if they were interested in putting forward a proposal in that regard they knew their proposal would be considered.  I think that if Senator Sir John Keane looks up the files of the newspapers he will find that I myself, in a public speech at the beginning of the year, indicated this industry as one of those which the Government hoped to get established during the year.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; has been used.  I want it to be quite clear that, although I think the Government would be quite justified in creating a legal monopoly in order to promote the establishment of this industry, we are not in fact doing so.  It is true that the Dunlop Rubber Company, in so far as there will be a restriction upon the importation of rubber tyres, and in so far as they will be the only manufacturers in the country, will have an effective, if not a legal, monopoly in precisely the same way as very large number of firms or groups of firms in this country at present have effective, if not legal, monopolies.  I do not know that our experience as to the manner in which that situation has worked has been so unfavourable as Senator Sir John Keane or Senator Jameson would suggest.  There is a large firm of biscuit manufacturers here in the City of Dublin which is in precisely the same position, which in this market enjoys the benefit of a protective tariff and which is the only manufacturer.  I do not know that our experience of the manner in which that firm has utilised the situation is such that we should prevent the establishment of a new, important industry in this country in consequence of it.</P>
    <P>That is not the only firm in that situation. There are quite a number of industries in this country which are operated by one firm only.  There are also a large number of industries <Col N="727" /> operated by groups of firms, working in harmony with one another, fixing prices by arrangement amongst themselves and, generally, working the market as one group and they are, in practice, in the same position.  Although upon occasion we have had to take cognisance of the fact that the situation was not all that it might be, and sometimes take action to remedy the situation, on the whole our experience has been that the dangers which theorists tell us might arise from that situation are not always forthcoming.  It is true that we have established a Prices Commission and that that Commission is even at the present time taking serious note of the activities of certain firms which are in the same position.  But the powers which have been conferred under that Act upon the Commission and upon the Government will, I think, be quite ample to deal with the situation which they are now investigating.</P>
    <P>The Government have made an Order under the Control of Imports Act, which confers upon them the power to regulate the importation of pneumatic tyres in future.  For the present, and for some time to come, that power of regulation will be exercised to permit of the importation of the normal quantity of those tyres, and existing firms need not fear any serious dislocation in the market position.  Any goods on order or in transit will come in; contracts made by them can be fulfilled, etc.  Although I cannot state precisely how long it will take the Dunlop Company to get their factory constructed, equipped, and into production, it is not until that happens that any curtailment of imports will arise. The importation of tyres, therefore, is and will be subject to restriction, and a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act has been issued to the Dunlop Company.</P>
    <P>In effect that is the whole situation, except that, because of the situation, we felt it necessary to come to a certain agreement with the firm, and they felt it necessary to come to an agreement with us covering certain points.  We on our side agree (1) to afford the Company <Col N="728" /> the protection of the restriction of imports; and (2) to issue it the necessary licence to enable it to undertake manufacture.  That licence was available for any reputable company which chose to apply for it.  I do not say that it would be available in the future.  The policy of the Government in relation to the issue of such licences is well known.  Where the requirements of the country for any class of goods are being met satisfactorily by any firm established and operating in the country at the time that application for a licence to manufacture these goods is made, a licence would ordinarily be refused.  That applies to all classes of goods at present, and will apply to rubber tyres in future.</P>
    <P>The company, in consideration of the issue of that licence, will establish at Cork a factory equipped for the production of about 80 per cent. of our total requirements of pneumatic tyres. The balance of 20 per cent. is made up, in the main, of various odd sizes of tyres, classes of tyres which are not used in large quantity, which it would not be economic to make here, and which will be imported in future without any additional impost.  We undertook, also, to facilitate the firm in the equipment of its factory, and to operate the usual condition attaching to a Control of Manufactures Act licence, which requires a firm holding that licence to employ only nationals of Saorstát Eireann, except with the permission of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so as to permit of their bringing in certain trained key workers during the initial stages; they on their part undertaking to arrange for the training of Saorstát workers both here and at their main factories abroad.</P>
    <P>The company have, as I said, agreed to erect a factory, and they have agreed to sell the products of the factory at a price calculated in accordance with a certain formula, which will involve a substantial reduction on the price at which these tyres are now being sold.  The reduction, of course, is very largely due to the fact that the duty now paid upon tyres upon importation will not be payable if the tyres are produced here, unless, of <Col N="729" /> course, it should be deemed good policy by the Government at some future time again to seek revenue from tyres by imposing an excise duty, in which case the price of tyres will be increased by the amount of such excise duty.  Motor tyres have always been dearer in this country than in Great Britain, mainly because of the existence of that duty, but also because of certain higher charges for distribution and some other causes.  A formula has been agreed upon and the position in future will be that, subject to the maintenance of the present relation in respect of costs, with regard to raw materials, labour, distribution, etc., between the company's plant in the Free State and the company's plant in Great Britain, the price at which these tyres will be sold will be not more than 15 per cent. above the corresponding price in Great Britain, as compared with the present position in which they are about 30 per cent. above the corresponding price in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>That, in fact, is the whole story.  The only reason why this matter has got the prominence it has received is because of the substantial nature of the industry and the fact that there appears to have been some misunderstanding. The Dunlop Rubber Company is not the only company that has come into this country and undertaken the manufacture of new classes of goods in consideration of the issue to them, under the Control of Manufactures Act, of a licence, affording protection to their products.  Yet in other cases the same attention does not appear to have been given to the matter just as happened here.  We have every reason to be thankful that this development has occurred, and that the firm, undertaking this manufacture, is a firm of the reputation and standing of the Dunlop Company, because that firm has had considerable association with this country, and in that company there is, in fact, invested a very substantial amount of capital owned by Saorstát citizens.</P>
    <P>It is assumed that the number of persons to be employed in the manufacture <Col N="730" /> of pneumatic tyres will be between 600 and 700.  It is anticipated that the firm will manufacture other classes of goods than tyres in the course of time.  We hope that that will be so, and will press the company to do so.  Other goods manufactured from rubber are used in considerable quantities here.  It is to be hoped that all these will be manufactured by this company so that the number of persons to be employed will be increased considerably.  The number of persons to be disemployed, in consequence of this development, will be very small indeed.</P>
    <P>Senator Jameson said if we took the trouble to carry out a census of the number of persons engaged in the industry, we would see that the number of persons engaged in the distribution of those tyres was very considerable. There are a number of persons engaged in the retail sale of tyres, but it is of little matter to them whether they sell Dunlop tyres or any other tyres, so long as they get their commission.  The number of persons acting as agents for the manufacturers of those tyres, other than those manufactured by the Dunlop company, is not more than 70. That is the maximum number; and it is not to be assumed that the whole of that number will become disemployed. Probably some of them are engaged in the business only in a small way, and as a sideline to their other business, and, probably, they will have to drop that sideline in the future. But that is a situation which has arisen on every occasion that we have decided to extend an existing industry, or to establish a new one.  The persons engaged in the distribution of the foreign goods become disemployed, or have to seek some other occupation. But the number of persons engaged in the production of goods here has increased considerably, which is always to our advantage.  It always takes a much larger number of people to make goods than to distribute the same quantity of goods from abroad.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane said he was <Col N="731" /> advised that the production of rubber tyres in this country is not an economical proposition.  The Senator can put that idea out of his head.  A number of factories, which are successfully engaged in the production of rubber tyres elsewhere and which pay substantial dividends at the present time have a total output less than the total output of the Cork factory will be.  The number of tyres used here for motor cars is about 150,000 per year. The number of tyres for pedal cycles is, of course, considerably higher; but the market is quite sufficient to make a fairly large size rubber tyre factory an economic proposition, and I think the Senator can be certain that the Dunlop company would go into the business on no other basis.  The Senator also asked what is the protection for quality.  I mentioned that we had certain understandings as to price, quality for quality, size for size, and so forth, which it will not be hard to give effect to, and which are, in any event, subject to our jurisdiction in so far as we have to be satisfied that the undertaking is being observed.</P>
    <P>There is another protection for us in the reputation of the firm, which is one of the largest firms in the motor tyre trade, which is distributing its products all over the world, and which could not afford to damage its reputation for the quality of its products for the sake of whatever small advantage it might obtain in this country by depreciation of their quality.  I think that the Senator can be quite at ease in his mind upon that point.  It was a matter of concern to the companies that were interested in the position here that their selection by the Government, for the issue of licences to them, under the Control of Manufactures Act, indicated our confidence in the ability of the manufacturers selected and might substantially increase their market in other countries if the people here were satisfied with the manner in which these manufacturers availed of the position created for them.</P>
    <P>I agree, also, with what was said by one Senator, that the amount of capital <Col N="732" /> invested in the distribution of rubber tyres in this country is comparatively small.  The firms that have been established for that purpose, in the main, consist of the agent for the tyres and certain office equipment.  Nothing else was required.  I do not think there was any considerable amount of tyres ordinarily stored in this country.  They were simply imported as the orders were received.  The loss of revenue will be nothing as substantial as Senator Sir John Keane seemed to indicate. The duty upon tyres was 22 2-9 per cent. until February this year, when it was increased to 33?.  At the rate of 33?, which was not intended to be a permanent duty, the total revenue from the classes of tyres to be manufactured here would be £48,000.  I do not know that it is fair to take that figure, because the ordinary revenue should be calculated at the rate of two-thirds of that if the duty, which is purely a revenue duty, had been maintained at the rate it existed at from the establishment of the Free State.</P>
    <P>I do not know that any other points were raised.  I reiterate that the position is that we have protected the market by the restriction of imports and issued a licence to one firm to manufacture.  We have undertaken to facilitate the Dunlop Company in the matter of the equipment of its factory, and to maintain the protection afforded to it, in consideration of their establishing a factory here, for a period of fifteen years, in so far as it is in our power to do so.  They, on their side, have undertaken to construct a factory capable of producing about 80 per cent. of our requirements, and to distribute their products here at prices which, subject to maintenance of the relative costs and Government policy in respect to excise duties, will not exceed 15 per cent. of the corresponding goods in Great Britain, representing a considerable reduction on the price at which these goods are now available here.</P>

      <P>I should like to know whether that difference between 15 per <Col N="733" /> cent. and 30 per cent. is irrespective of any additional charges due to import or excise duties as the case may be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said that the 15 per cent. will operate on the basis of the maintenance of the present relative costs.  If the costs of production here are increased for any reason, such as the imposition of excise duties, then the 15 per cent. would be increased.  If, on the other hand, the costs are reduced, as may happen, say, following the introduction of an excise duty in Great Britain, then the 15 per cent. will be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The 22 2-9 tariff is chargeable upon the declared value of the tyres on importation&mdash;not the price at which they are sold to the consumer, and consequently the increase in price would not be 22 2-9. The price here exceeded the English price by something less than that&mdash; portion due to the duty and portion due to the extra costs arising here.  The amount of the duty payable remains the same, and the prices of all tyres were increased at the same time.  Now, the total amount by which the prices of their tyres will exceed the prices of <Col N="734" /> similar tyres sold in Great Britain, allowing for all the higher costs which they anticipate may arise here, will be 15 per cent., unless and until the relation between the costs is upset by some such action as the imposition of an excise duty, in which case the price of the tyres will have to be increased by the amount of the extra charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>I have to thank the Minister for his statement, but I do not suppose that he would expect me to say that my apprehensions have been allayed entirely by his statement.  They are not.  These things can be dealt with very nicely in the abstract and in general terms, but it is not until they actually come into being that we really know what we are in for.  I cannot agree that biscuits are at all comparable with tyres.  There are a lot of substitutes for biscuits, but I know of nothing that will suit the wheel of a motor car except a tyre.  While biscuits may be inordinately required by some people, there are substitutes which would supply everything necessary for internal personal nourishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is undesirable that these agreements should be arranged in private between the Government and these firms, that there should be no preliminary inquiry, and that we should not know what really in essence is involved.  There are three parties to all these agreements.  There is the Government and the particular firm concerned; but there is also the public. All along I have been complaining about the Minister's policy in that respect.  The consumer is ignored and does not receive a fair amount of consideration. Whatever consideration is <Col N="735" /> to be given is given to capital and labour, but the consumer is left to take his chance.  He is the under dog.  The Minister did not attempt to deal with the question of quality except to say that the reputation of the firm would be a sufficient guarantee.  I hold that the only real test of quality is to be able to try an alternative make of tyre against a particular firm's make of tyre, and that will be no longer possible under this arrangement.  We have got to take it on the assurance of the firm's reputation that the article they will be giving us is the same as before.  We will have no means of testing that.  It is only human nature for people to want to be at liberty to try alternative makes of an article, and if they feel that they are tied up they are always suspicious.  I can quite understand that Senators Crosbie and Dowdall could not act differently from the way they did.  They have got to face their supporters and friends, and I should not like to be in their shoes if they supported me in this.  I am not prepared to divide the House on this motion, even though what the Minister said will not tend to make us any more happy.

I appreciate, of course, the fact that the Seanad is quite at liberty to go on with the discussion on this motion, but I want to protest against its being taken at the present time.

      <P>May I be allowed to say at this stage that I regret, of course, and I am sure the House regrets, the decision of the Government Party to withdraw from the House during the discussion of this important matter.  To a certain extent the question of the order of this motion arises from the remarks of Senator Connolly, and I should like to make a short statement on the position.  The Clerk was handed a typed note from Senator Connolly, which he in turn had received from the Minister for Justice, containing certain statements.  This communication was not addressed to me.  If it had been addressed to me I would have endeavoured to ask the Minister for Justice what his grounds were and whether there was any reason to think that this particular matter was not in order.  I have considered, and considered rather closely, whether the motion is in order or not. The letter which was received by the Clerk from Senator Connolly was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not desirable that any discussion should take place in the Seanad on the above subject at the present moment, and if such a discussion is initiated no representative of the Government will take part in it.....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have now been warned by Senator Connolly that that course is to be taken, which I very much regret, and which, I am sure, the House regrets. The letter continues:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Some dozen men have been charged by the State with criminal offences in connection with the riot at the Copley Street Repository on <Col N="737" /> 13th August, and these cases are at present <i>sub judice.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remark the word &ldquo;riot.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would not be possible to have a satisfactory and complete discussion on the subject matter of the motion on this occasion without including in the discussion references to the conduct of the accused men and such reference should not be made so long as the matter is <i>sub judice.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As to the statement that a discussion in the Seanad is not desirable, that is a question which is quite outside my province.  The motion having been handed in, all I have to decide is whether it is or is not in order.  I hope that the fact that the unhappy affair is described as a &ldquo;riot&rdquo; will not prejudice the trial of the men who have been charged.  The word &ldquo;riot&rdquo; has a definite legal connotation, and one of the facts which will presumably have to be established to the satisfaction of the court will be whether there was in fact a riot on the occasion in question.</P>
    <P>I find that there is ample precedent for ruling in order a discussion of this kind in similar circumstances. In July, 1914, some of the citizens of Dublin were shot down in Bachelor's Walk by soldiers of the British Army. The matter was discussed at great length in the House of Commons even though the Chief Secretary announced that a Commission of Inquiry had been set up.  During the Colliery Riots of September, 1893, a miner at Castleford was shot dead by the soldiers, and the matter was discussed in the House of Commons.  It seems worth noting that these riots provide the background for what Professor Dicey has written in his <i>Law of the Constitution</i> on the duty of soldiers called upon to disperse an unlawful assembly.  It is here that the common law on this subject is authoritatively laid down.</P>
    <P>Other House of Commons precedents which could be given are the attack by the Royal Irish Constabulary on the people of Ennis, which was discussed in <Col N="738" /> 1888 on the motion of Mr. Parnell, and similar attacks at Cashel and Tipperary in 1890, the discussion of which was initiated by Mr. John Dillon.  But the outstanding example is the famous Mitchelstown case.  On the 9th September, 1887, the Constabulary fired on civilians at Mitchelstown with fatal results.  In spite of the fact that a coroner's inquest was pending, and possibly, as Sir William Harcourt said, a higher and more serious tribunal, the discussion on the action of the police occupied the whole day, and it was long after midnight when Mr. Parnell rose to speak.</P>
    <P>It is clear on all the authorities that the motion is in order.  It purports to condemn the action of the police, and not the action of the men who are about to be tried.  So far as I am concerned, I shall do my best to ensure that nothing is said during the debate which might conceivably prejudice the fair trial of these men.  A public tumult or affray is a matter of the gravest public importance, and the Oireachtas is the proper forum in which to discuss it. Senator Wilson.</P>

      <P>I would like to explain first of all that that was not a letter, official or otherwise, to the Clerk of the Seanad.  It was an opinion which the Minister for Justice gave me on the subject at my request to guide me in the line of action that I ought to take here.  As a matter of courtesy, and so that the Clerk of the Seanad would know exactly what course we would be taking here to-day, I passed him a copy of that.  That is all.  It was not a letter, as I have said, either official or <Col N="739" /> unofficial to the Clerk of the Seanad. It was an opinion expressed to me. With regard to your ruling, I have no fault to find.  You are the custodian of this House.  You can rule and decide within your own jurisdiction what you wish to do.  That does not, at the same time, prevent us from taking any line of action that we choose to take.  I do not wish to reiterate what I have already stated, but, with your leave, I will decline to discuss the matter and will withdraw from the House while it is being discussed.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That the Seanad condemns the action of the members of the special branch of the Gárda Síochána who, on Monday, the 13th August, 1934, fired on unarmed citizens in the City of Cork, causing the death of one and seriously wounding others; and demands that the Guards who took part in the deadly fusillade be put on trial, and that in future no Guard who has not undergone the full ordinary training of members of the force be permitted to carry firearms:</P>
      <P>(2)  That the Seanad further recommends that the Government, with a view to preventing developments likely to provoke disorder, should appoint an impartial tribunal to consider and report whether, in fairness to the farmers of the Saorstát, the collection of land annuities should not be suspended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion deals with the unfortunate occurrence which took place in Cork at a sheriff's sale of cattle seized for the non-payment of land annuities.  This public sale was held in a yard, access <Col N="740" /> to which was by a gate.  The gate was shut against the public and against the farmer whose cattle were going to be sold.  Only a privileged few were permitted into this public sale.  Anyone who knows the mentality of farmers generally as regards rights-of-way or anyone who has had in the past to deal with questions of rights-of-way is aware that the ordinary course taken by people is to pull down gates which block such rights-of-way.  I am not saying that in this case the action of the men in breaking down that gate was a creditable one, but underlying their action was something of that mentality to which I have referred in connection with rights-of-way.  There were 20 men in the lorry which they ran against the gate.  As soon as they entered the yard they were fired on by special Guards who were on the opposite side of the yard.  One man in the lorry lost his life and several others were wounded. It appears also that the action of the men who fired was not instituted by an order of their superior authorities. These men fired on their own initiative. I know no part of the common law which permits one man to fire on another except in defence of his life. The action of these special constables, without orders from their superior officers and without notice to these men in the lorry in firing on them was a reprehensible action.  I am asking the Seanad to condemn their action and to see if it is possible to have them brought to justice.</P>
    <P>The motion deals with another question.  It proposes that there should be some kind of restriction placed on the carrying of firearms by the police. As Senators know, last year there was a new levy of police.  Guards were hastily levied, and were inadequately trained. Four months, I believe, was the usual period of training.  These men are now carrying weapons through the country. I believe it is because of the want of training which these men received that this deplorable occurrence took place. I am asking the Seanad to agree in demanding that in future the Government should see that no Guard who has not been adequately trained in the Depot should be permitted to carry <Col N="741" /> firearms.  That is not an unreasonable demand, I think.  Necessity forces us to make that demand.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows there is a state of unrest among the farmers at the present time.  The fact that the sheriff's work is increasing daily is a very ominous sign of the times.  We, as farmers, do not take the view expressed by the Government, that it is merely a political conspiracy which is at the bottom of this unrest.  We take the view that it is really economic necessity that is at the bottom of it, and that a cure for the situation is not to be found in repression, or in the use of firearms by the police, but rather in an investigation of the position of the farmers&mdash; the setting up of a tribunal to examine into the economic situation existing at present, and by that means to do justice to the claims which the farmers make against the Government.  In County Dublin alone, at the present time, there are 566 sheriffs' decrees issued, and of the land annuities in respect of last year, only 80 per cent. have been collected up to 24th August, and of the land annuities due on 30th June, only 50 per cent. have been collected.</P>

      <P>The statement, which I read in one of the Belfast papers, is a statement issued by the Minister for Lands.  I did not see it in the Library, but it is correct, because I spoke to Senator Connolly on the point.  The figures are very specific and they have a great bearing on the position of those who are paying their way because, by reason of what is known as the Guarantee Fund, the ratepayers of this country will have to foot all the deficiencies which come about through the non-payment of the land annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in the second part of this motion directed attention to a method by which these disorders might be prevented and in order that the Seanad may support that part of the motion, I must make a sort of <i>prima facie</i> case for the farmers&mdash;a rough case which will be readily understood&mdash;from which <Col N="742" /> information will be at the disposal of Senators which will enable them to decide whether, in fact, there is a case for investigation of the economic situation as it exists.  It was admitted by the Minister for Agriculture last week that the price of stock in this country was reduced by the difference between the bounties and the special duties imposed by the British.  Mark the effect of that.  In respect of a live stock population of 4,000,000, there is an artificially depreciated price of about £3 a head, so that the farmers' capital to the extent of £12,000,000 has been lost.  That does not take into account at all the 40 per cent. tariff imposed on bacon, butter, eggs, poultry and horses, so that a capital depreciation of a tremendous number of millions can be seen at a glance. When you remember also that, on top of that depreciation, a second depreciation took place because of the quotas put on at the beginning of this year by the British and which were admitted by the introduction of the Cattle Bill in order to raise prices, you will find that there is again a further £10,000,000 to £20,000,000 added to that already depreciated capital.</P>
    <P>On top of all that, the value of land in this country has been depreciated, in my opinion, more than the amount in dispute with Britain, and I think that is a moderate estimate.  The value of land generally is computed by its earning power and the earning power of land at the present time has very seriously decreased.  The Minister met a position of that sort by a reduction by half of the annuities, which were hitherto paid directly to the State.  What does that mean? That particular concession was useless because the same amount of produce was required to pay the half amount of the annuities as it required before the reduction in the price.  Prices have depreciated to such an extent that when the Government reduced the annuities by half, it was actually no help at all to the farmers.  In addition, the Government thought fit to reduce the agricultural grant in aid of rates by the enormous sum of £448,000 in last year's estimates.  That had a very injurious <Col N="743" /> effect on the rates and as an example of what happened, I will give some actual cases of increased rating as between 1932-33 and 1933-34 in consequence of the reduction of the agricultural grant, and increases in home help to able-bodied people who were in want.</P>
    <P>In respect of a farm situated seven miles from Dublin, with a valuation of £51 10/-, the rate in 1932-33 was £18 16s. 3d., and the rate in 1933-34 £30 13s. 4d., an increase of 63 per cent. In respect of a farm in the neighbourhood of Malahide, with a valuation of £201, the rate in 1932-33 was £74 19s. 9d., and in 1933-34 £130 16s. 11d., an increase of 75 per cent., and in respect of a farm at Finglas, with a valuation of £135 10s., the rate in 1932-33 was £36 2s. 8d., and in 1933-34 £62 9s. 2d., an increase of 73 per cent. These increases have to be provided out of produce depreciated in value and with a limited market.  In fact, Government figures show that the sellng price of agricultural produce to-day is 20 per cent. below the pre-war level, and that is based on returns only up to last March, when the full effect of this blockade or quota system was not felt.  I put it to the Seanad that where you have a reduction in the income of these people, and where there is such an increase in rating and such a decrease in the purchasing power of the farmer, it is no wonder that such distress exists.</P>
    <P>It is not political bias or political conspiracy that is at the bottom of this unrest.  The farmers would pay their way if they were able, and as they have always done, and it is not to make any political capital out of this situation that I am speaking here to-day.  I am urging the Seanad to ask the Government to set up a tribunal to examine the situation.  I have stated the case in a rough and ready way, and I will just finish my remarks by a reference to the payments which are being extracted at the present time on the basis of the low prices.  Last year the British collected from the farmers of this country £4,500,000.  The Free State Government collected in land annuities <Col N="744" /> £2,000,000.  That is £6,500,000 collected, and out of that they gave in bounties £1,750,000 leaving a sum of £4,750,000 net loss to the farmers.  That, in fact, is more than all the annuities and the other moneys that are in dispute.  The farmers have to pay that money out of produce which they are selling 20 per cent. below pre-war prices.  If civil servants who get a bonus were suddenly to find themselves deprived of that bonus, and, in addition, if they were to find their wages cut 20 per cent. below pre-war level, what would they say about it?  If the Guards or the servants of the local authorities, the school teachers or the artisans&mdash;if all these people had their remuneration reduced to the same extent as that to which the farmer's remuneration is reduced, surely we must all agree that the farmers are really mild in their protests in comparison with the protests that would be made by those people?</P>
    <P>The position shows the necessity for the setting up of some authority to examine and investigate the farmers' position in order that we may allay this unrest and in order that the peace of this country may be preserved.  I have spoken sufficiently in connection with the second part of my motion and I hope the Seanad will pass it.  We are not here to make political capital against the Government.  We are here to allay a situation which is now in the offing and which is very dangerous. If the position is boldly and honestly met I have no doubt a reasonable settlement will be effected and we will continue to enjoy what we desire&mdash;the peace and prosperity of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I regret very much that the Government Party have left the House here because I was going to devote myself entirely to the second portion of this motion. Unfortunately the tragic circumstances of the inquest are merely a symptom of what is the cause.  The cause I put it to you is the hopeless position in which the farmers find themselves to-day. I wonder is there one of us who does not look to the future with foreboding? <Col N="745" /> I am considered to be an optimist, but I confess the prospects rather stagger me.  We were assured that if this Administration were put into office it would be necessary to bring back men from outside to fill all the positions that would become vacant owing to the rush of work.  True, men have been brought back to fill, I suppose, the highly-specialised work of detectives, but there are at the moment 100,000 people out of employment. There are 100,000 people on the Unemployment Register in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers too, we were assured, would be put upon the back of the animal which the English comic papers always described as &ldquo;the gentleman that pays the rint.&rdquo;  How far the Government have failed in their promises I leave it to the House to judge. Do not misunderstand me in what I have to say.  I am not suggesting that the Minister acted with what is known in criminal law as <i>malice prépense.</i>  It has to be borne in mind that more injury in this world is done by want of thought than by want of heart, and I only want to recall these to the Minister's notice to remind him that fanaticism rarely accomplishes much.  I speak from the patriotic point of view, not as a politician.  If the Government accede to what I suggest I have no doubt it will strengthen their position very materially in the country.  For my part, I hold that instead of giving any help to the farmers up to now they have added 50 per cent to the annuities.  For England has collected them very nearly in full and by a process as expensive to the debtor as if they were extracted through the machinery of the law.  I think the Minister would be hard put to it to prove that at any time during the last 50 years farming was less remunerative than at the moment. History we know has an act of repeating itself and the situation of the tiller of the soil to-day is analogous to what it was in the 'eighties.  In those days the landlords combined to collect what we described as &ldquo;impossible rents.&rdquo; The tenants combined to resist their payments.  Just as the Government supporters of to-day proclaim, the landlords <Col N="746" /> said the tenants were thriving and could pay if they wanted to.</P>
    <P>May I quote a little stanza, written at the height of the Land War, by T.D. Sullivan.  It went:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I heard it, I saw it, said T.W. Russell,</P>
    <P>How tenants can rob and campaigners can cheat,</P>
    <P>Since Cassidy's daughter is wearing a bustle,</P>
    <P>A fringe on her forehead and boots on her feet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may explain that in those days that a bustle and fringe were indispensable to a well-dressed woman.  I think indeed this little song ought to be set to music for the benefit of the present Ministry and sung at popular concerts for their supporters, because the burden of all their speeches is that the tenants to-day are dishonestly withholding their payments.  Even in the 'eighties farmers did not go around in rags, and I give it as a present to the Ministers the concession that to-day our country folk are highly respectably dressed.  This is a fact which apparently annoys some leading members of the Administration.  There is no doubt that there were many tenants able to pay in the 'eighties who did not do so.  The campaigners did not take the trouble to dispute it.  I suppose to-day there are some who could meet their annuities who are not cashing in.  It is, however, now conceded that 90 per cent. of the farmers who adopted the Plan of Campaign could not pay up and, looking broadly at the situation, the conditions now are almost identical with those existing then.  I have yet to hear of a farm&mdash;large or small&mdash; in the Free State where the principal source of revenue is other than cattle. We were told over and over before they got into power, by the present Ministers, that the farmers were bankrupt. Has their régime given them a chance to retrieve their position?  I think that all will have to admit that it has not.  What, then, is the prospect before the country?</P>
    <P>May I digress a little and tell you the tragedy of Glenbeigh Estate? Either through conspiracy or inability to meet the landlord's demands in the <Col N="747" /> late 'eighties, no rent was paid by the occupiers.  The alien Government of the day proceeded to carry out the law with the same determination that we now experience.  The English Navy sailed proudly into Dingle Bay.  Horse artillery, field artillery and a strong force of infantry supplemented by a great number of the Royal Irish Constabulary advanced by land on the doomed district.  Not alone did they dispossess the tenants at a cost far exceeding the value of the fee simple of the property, but they burned down every farmstead and every cowshed in the vicinity.  One of the tenants told me his story:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For 15 years I lived as best as I could on the roadside.  My father and mother died in one of the hovels called Land League huts, that were erected there.  I was 15 times in jail, because my allowance from the war-chest was doubled if I were under arrest.  If money then was wanted very urgently by the family I had only to trespass on our farm, and they got an increase of pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The alien Government went further.  It set up divisional commissioners with practically unlimited powers over Munster.  We disrespectfully christened them &ldquo;Pashas.&rdquo;  I wonder will the present Government too copy this example.</P>
    <P>The landlord party established a Defence Union with the object of getting a remunerative price for the seized cattle.  They recruited troops of landless men&mdash;they called them &ldquo;Emergency Men&rdquo;&mdash;to plant on the evicted farms.  These farms were let to them at a uniform rent of 10/- per acre, many of these holdings having previously had to pay £3 an acre.  All this was done by an alien Government and an unsympathetic body of land owners. I speak with a full sense of the gravity of the outlook, and I do not want to say one word to embitter the situation, but I ask the Government whether they realise where they are heading.  Following Arthur Balfour's example, they have not hesitated to shoot.  Has that fatal shot brought a single pound into the <Col N="748" /> annuity fund?  They have put up for auction seized cattle.  What have these cattle realised?  It is notorious they have been sold for little or nothing. The Minister for Agriculture told us not long ago that it is a patriotic action for anyone who wants to buy a beast to buy it at these auctions.  They carry, too, with them, it is understood, a licence to export which is far more valuable than the beast itself.  And yet in the whole length and breadth of the Free State they can only get one man ready to pick up easy money.  Why is this?  Have the Fianna Fáil farmers no money or are they afraid?  I do not believe it, but the fellow feeling between neighbours, the tradition that still hangs round our hillsides against goods procured at a sheriff's sale is too strong for the sturdiest of them, and &ldquo;Mr. O'Neill&rdquo; is left in proud possession of the field.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister, when he has swept all the cattle off the land of the defaulters, is he still going to emulate Mr. Balfour's record and evict the occupiers forthwith?  Remember, he and his colleagues have promised to hand over such places to the landless men.  Incidentally, he has in his possession or on offer more than would satisfy all the legitimate claims.  He knows in his heart he has as much chance of getting anyone to accept the job of grabber as he has of getting a decent Fianna Fáil farmer to bid for seized cattle.  If he carries out the law with the rigour he threatens, he will have the country studded with deserted villages and rotting farmsteads like Glenbeigh, grisly memorials, not to an alien Government, but to one so completely Irish in its outlook that such weak-kneed individuals as myself they can only describe as Imperialistic, West-British traitors.  The Glenbeigh farmer I spoke of to-day pays an annuity of £2 a year.  In the bad old days his rent was £7.  He has now an excellent house to replace his old cabin.  He erected it himself with £30 worth of material supplied by the Board of Works, but what has his victory cost him and what did our country suffer throughout that long fight?  I lived through it all, and I was with the tenants in the fight and well remember <Col N="749" /> the scars on our country &mdash;black patches that took many years to efface.  A little forbearance, a spirit of compromise, would have saved untold suffering, but pride and passion were in men's hearts then.  Are we now going to repeat what even an alien Government admitted later on was a ghastly, aye, a bloody failure?  I press the Minister, therefore, to accede to the suggestion contained in the second part of this motion, and to set up a Commission to inquire into the present very awful situation.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest, as I always do, to Senator Wilson's narrative of the economic war.  I would have no fault whatever to find with Senator Wilson's statement if it were delivered on another occasion, but I think it unfair that many of the side issues connected with the economic war should have been introduced under the terms of this motion. I followed Senator Crosbie when he was reading his well-prepared essay and the question just occurred to me: what in the name of God have the fashions of the Cork maidens in the year 1880, when they were wearing fringes and bustles, to do with the unfortunate death of a young man in Cork recently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very much struck, about half an hour ago, when Senator Séumas Robinson, after the Pensions Bill had been passed, congratulated all sides of the House on the manner in which they had treated that Bill.  The Seanad has held many meetings recently at which many Bills were discussed in a very fair and impartial manner although at times it is naturally critical.  During their discussion, everyone here was apparently in the best of humour and there were no personal reflections arising out of incidents in the past.  They were discussed in a rather mellowing atmosphere, an atmosphere which, as a Minister said to me, was very different from that in which Bills are discussed in another place.  That goes to prove, undoubtedly, the usefulness of the Seanad to the country, that is, if the Seanad refuses to be turned into a political platform for Party purposes, <Col N="750" /> which I have no hesitation in saying is the main object of the motion before us.  I think it a pity, even if we are on our last legs, that our usefulness should be destroyed.  I think it is unfair to many members of the Seanad, many old members who have given great service to the country in many pathways of life, but I am glad to say that they have shown by their absence here this evening what they think of the motion before us.  I am not going to delve into the purposes of the motion.  In my opinion, it would have been better if it had been left alone.  If it were a motion asking the Seanad to show its sympathy in some way in respect of the death of the unfortunate young fellow in Cork, there might be something to be said for it.  If it were a motion to improve the farmers' position in some way, there might be something to be said for it.  I acquit Senator Wilson but I cannot acquit the two other Senators whose names are attached to the motion of putting it down for the set purpose of political propaganda.  I say, unhesitatingly, after the statement by the Minister, that it was put down for the set purpose of defeating justice.  I feel that certain of my colleagues adopted the right course in leaving.  Not meaning any disrespect to you, A Leas-Chathaoirligh, for whom I have a wonderful regard and respect, I feel I cannot conscientiously take any further part in these proceedings. The motion is put down solely for political propaganda and for Party purposes.  In my long life as a public representative, I have never come across such an indecent motion, particularly as we have been already told that the matter is yet to be dealt with by the Minister for Justice.  I am leaving now&mdash;I know I shall not be missed&mdash;but I do not mean any disrespect to you, Sir.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

      <P>The decision of the Fianna Fáil Senators to retire from the House prevents this motion from being discussed as fully as it might be if they were present and took part in the debate.  At the same time, I am not altogether sorry that they went. I think it is better, in view of all the circumstances, that they should go <Col N="751" /> than that they should stay and brazen this matter out.  It would be, perhaps, helpful if we had Senator Connolly here but I think it was more seemly for him to leave the House than it would be for him to remain and emulate Sir Hamar Greenwood.  This is a matter which it is the duty of the Seanad to discuss.  It is a matter which might not have been discussed if we had had any indication that the Government realised the seriousness and the awfulness of the occurrence. I am glad that consideration of the motion was adjourned until the inquest had concluded.  I do not know whether all the members of the Seanad had an opportunity of reading the evidence given at the inquest.  It is difficult, as I know, to get the <i>Cork Examiner</i> here.  I did not see the report of the proceedings every day but I saw it almost every day.  It was clear from that report that the men who fired could offer no justification that would hold water for a moment. This lorry, carrying a dozen men, was driven against the gate.  It was stopped partly by the gate, which still hung on, and partly by an obstacle inside the pound.  It blocked the gateway. There were very few citizens in the pound.  There were a large number of police there.  The men in the lorry numbered about a dozen and they were not armed.  I do not know how many of them, or whether any of them, had sticks or batons.  Most of them, I think, had neither.  The lorry blocked the gateway so that people could only get in by coming under it or squeezing past the edges.  Nothing would have been more easy than for a number of Guards in the pound to have held the gateway and to have dealt, by way of arrest if they chose to do so, with the men who came in on the lorry.  It was a very small disturbance&mdash;something that could easily have been dealt with by the uniformed police with their batons.  Instead of that, we had not one shot or two shots but a regular fusillade, which ended in the death of Lynch, and which it was a miracle did not result in the deaths of many others.  There was a sort of pretence put up by the &ldquo;Broy <Col N="752" /> Harriers&rdquo; at the inquest that they feared O'Neill would be killed.  Anybody who read the inquest proceedings will say that that was only a pretence put up afterwards.  Some of them were a considerable distance from O'Neill.  Some of them did not know where O'Neill was.  What they were out for, as shown by the circumstances, was blood.  They got no orders.  I do not want to say for a moment that every one of the &ldquo;Broy Harriers&rdquo; is a man who ought not to be in the police force.  I believe that a number of quiet, decent and suitable men joined the &ldquo;Broy Harriers&rdquo; simply for the purpose of getting a job at the time that force was being formed.  Undoubtedly &mdash; everybody knows this&mdash;other men were brought into that force who would never have been brought into a police force by a Government with a sense of responsibility&mdash;men whose only recommendation was previous bloodshed and a career of violence of one sort or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These men were given practically no training except training in the use of rifles, machine guns and revolvers.  There has been some talk about four and a half months' police training.  It was not really police training, but training in the use of different forms of firearms. Recruiting men in that way, training them in that way and sending them out, as they have been sent out through the country, was almost bound to lead to something such as happened in Cork. The &ldquo;Broy Harriers&rdquo; who have been posted in many places have behaved well enough and there is no ground of complaint in respect of their conduct. In other places, groups of them have behaved extremely badly and have been ready to pull guns without any cause or justification.  Others of them have threatened life and attempted to take life on other occasions.  Here we had them finding their opportunity.  So far as I can learn, this lorry incident was not planned to any great extent before its occurrence on the 13th August.  But there had been talk about some such thing amongst the crowd at the previous sale.  What occurred, in my opinion and the opinion of other people, <Col N="753" /> is that the &ldquo;Broy Harriers&rdquo; knew that something like this was going to occur, and that they determined to have blood. They had blood.  It seems to me that there can be no denial that the death of young Lynch was a case of murder, and that the Government should have dealt with the members of the special section of the Guards who fired on that occasion.  No good can be served by glossing over that matter.  I am prepared to admit that there may be difficulty for the Government.  The Government may have some sense of their own responsibility in the matter because of their recruiting this force in the way it was recruited, their training it in the way it was trained, and their sending it out raw, and with this particular background for the duty it was called upon to do.  In spite of that I think that it is necessary in the public interest, and it is the duty of the Government, to put these men on trial and to make it clear that that sort of fusillading is not going to be tolerated in future.</P>
    <P>I think, as the resolution suggests, that firearms should be taken from men in the Civic Guard who have not had a regular police training.  The regular police training includes a certain amount of law; it includes instruction in the respective rights of the police and the citizens and it gives a man some reasonable idea of how he might behave even in an emergency.  I would say that men who have got a regular police training and who have done some ordinary police duty would not, when armed, be liable to seize the opportunity of using their firearms with deadly effect as these men did in Cork. It seems to me that there never was any incident&mdash;I cannot recall any incident&mdash;in the Black and Tan struggle here that was more disgraceful than this prolonged fusillading on this handful of unarmed men.  The fusillade was conducted not merely with revolvers but also with rifles.  It is a miraculous thing that the number of deaths was not greater.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion seems to be complementary to the first.  This occurrence in Cork arose undoubtedly out of the feeling which exists through <Col N="754" /> the country in regard to the collection of land annuities.  Senator Wilson has dealt with the economic position of the farmer and, no matter what Ministers may say, the position through the country undoubtedly is that a great body of farmers are unable to pay the annuities.  They are unable to pay them, at any rate, under circumstances in which a man ought to pay them. They are unable to pay them without so denuding their farms of stock that they will be prevented from carrying on their work, unless they deny the primary necessities to themselves and their families.  There are other farmers who, while not yet in that position, fear they are going to be in that position within a few months, and accordingly they are reluctant to make sales or part with their cash in order to meet the demands of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>They are more reluctant than they would otherwise be because of the history of this matter.  Undoubtedly, whatever President de Valera may have done by way of safeguarding his own position, and whatever other members of the Fianna Fáil Party may have done by way of indicating that the annuities would be collected, the great mass of Fianna Fáil propaganda through the country made it clear, prior to the 1932 election and the last election, that the collection of land annuities was going to disappear.  That was without taking into account the losses that were going to arise out of the economic war. There is no doubt that the farmers not only feel themselves unable to pay, but they feel that they have been deceived and put into a false position through the acceptance of promises which they now find denied by those in authority.</P>
    <P>There was no agitation, there was no propaganda by responsible people in favour of the withholding of land annuities.  There was no propaganda in favour of demonstrations such as have taken place.  Those demonstrations have arisen naturally out of the strong feelings of the farming community about the present position.  A brutal occurrence like that which took place in Cork is not going to have any other effect than to make people more anxious to demonstrate against these collections.  It seems to me to be perfectly <Col N="755" /> obvious that the Government is ultimately going to have to abandon the attempt to collect the land annuities. The arrear is increasing; the ability of the people to pay is decreasing. If 80 per cent. of the November-December gale was collected, there is going to be much less obviously than 80 per cent. of the June-July gale collected and, if the Government continues its policy, there will be still less of the gale due next November-December to be collected.</P>
    <P>What the Government is going to do by persistence in attempting to collect is simply to raise bad feeling and if it does not restrain the &ldquo;Broy Harriers&rdquo; it will mean other incidents of a serious character.  At any rate, by continuing the attempt to collect annuities it is in danger of causing a series of minor incidents, all of which will be extremely bad from every point of view, which will tend to bring the law into contempt, and which will tend to create enmities between different classes of citizens. It will result, in the long run, in the abandonment of the attempt to collect the land annuities.  What the Government ought to do now is to accept the substance of this motion.  It ought, in the first place, to take action to make it clear that it will not tolerate wanton killing by armed agents of the State.  It ought to make the citizens realise that whatever the relations of particular police and members of the Government have been in the past, those members of the police forces must behave themselves properly and must not use their arms on the citizens except in circumstances which will justify doing so, except when there is a dire necessity for the protection of life.  Even then, they should see that they are going to use their arms to the minimum extent and that we will not have a sort of miniature Amritsar business, which, but for something in the nature of a miracle, might have occurred in Cork last week.  They ought to make it clear that the police must behave themselves, and they ought to take the precaution that only trained men are in possession of firearms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> The Government should also face up to the economic problem which has arisen.  I hope instead of talking, as the Minister for Finance did here the other day, about some farming family making, as was alleged, greater profits than ever before, that they will accept the facts as they are known to the great bulk of farmers and realise that the payment of land annuities is a matter of extreme difficulty for farmers and is an absolute impossibility for perhaps most farmers.  It is to be hoped that they will abandon the collection of annuities or, if not, that they will set up a tribunal as requested here, an impartial tribunal which will, perhaps, recommend some middle course, if there is any middle course possible, between the complete abandonment of the collection and the attempt to continue the collection under the conditions that exist at the present time.</P>
    <P>In any case if the Government is determined to continue the collection in the public interest, they must take steps to see that there is not the same procedure in connection with auctions and the sale of cattle, that we have been accustomed to for some time.  An auction almost by definition is a public sale.  An auction to which only a privileged few is admitted is certainly something which gives the owner of cattle ground for complaint, and gives ground for warm feelings to the owner's neighbours.  I am informed that people who were prepared to bid have been kept out of several auctions.  In future the Government must see to it that all who are prepared to bid are not kept out.  A person ought not to be required to guarantee to bid before being admitted to a public sale.  All who are not obviously going to create disturbance should be admitted to these sales. Something must also be done about the question of granting licences to these mysterious Government buyers, while licences are refused to other persons who may have cattle for sale.  It seems to me that there is something almost unsavoury about this whole business of the conduct of these auctions.  We have mysterious buyers, perhaps giving false names.  No one really knows <Col N="757" /> whether they give their real names or false names.  These men come along to sales with the police, sometimes transported apparently by the police, and sometimes even representing themselves as detectives, to which the ordinary public are refused admission, getting cattle at &ldquo;knock-down&rdquo; prices and then being able out of the ordinary course, to get licences for the export of the cattle.</P>
    <P>I have here a report of a sale at Clonmel on August 20th at which a cow was sold for 5/- and others at 15/-.  It is not to the credit of the Government that they should be carrying on in that way.  If they will insist on collecting the annuities they should, at least, make some arrangement for sales that will not have a hole-and-corner appearance, an appearance of mystery and intrigue associated with sales, as they are conducted at present, and that will not arouse public anger as they are arousing it.  Taking everything into account, I think the Government instead of brazening it out, instead of disappearing and refusing to listen or to answer what is said, should face up to the facts as they have arisen, and do their best to see that the confidence which the people had in the police force as a whole, taking all branches of it together, is restored, by imposing discipline upon the part of it which is naturally indisciplined at the present time.  In addition to doing that they should, one way or the other, recognise the farmers' case in relation to the annuities.</P>
    <P>If they are satisfied that the farmers can pay, as some Ministers have stated, then they can have no objection of any sort to having the matter considered by an impartial tribunal.  An impartial tribunal will say whether the farmers are able to pay or not.  After that, the impartial tribunal having been demanded by so many farmers, it is to be presumed, if there is any deliberate refusal to pay by people able to pay, that will cease, and the Government will have gained.  If the Government prosecutes unjustifiably people who were wounded by that murderous <Col N="758" /> fusillade, and allows the police to go too far, if it disregards all the facts and arguments in regard to the farmers' position, continues to collect these sums, and if these private and privileged buyers are to get cattle for practically nothing, as well as licences to export them, they are going to create a position which I do not say will be disastrous but which will have many ill effects on the country, and on public opinion, as well as on respect for the law and the maintenance of peace and order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am chiefly concerned with the predisposing causes of this trouble, and that is the economic position.  I do not say that I am not concerned also with the protective side, and the police side.  With regard to the police side, as I said on a motion a year ago, it is very dangerous to take men, if they have had any political affiliations with any party, and to arm them and let them loose at times when public feeling is running very high.  Past experience has shown that something in the nature of a proclamation or an order is necessary in cases of riot, before troops use firearms. I should first of all say that uniformed Guards should deal with the situation, being supported by military, which, if possible, could be kept in the dark.  It is most dangerous to have plain clothes police on such duty. With regard to the economic position, I appreciate the difficulties of the Government.  It is very difficult for the Government to call the sheriffs off, but, on the other hand, they must have regard to the position of the farmers. I am afraid the Government is acting in the spirit of believing that these people are doing this for political purposes and that they are not going to have that or to be ridden by Opposition political organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, however, must have regard to the facts.  There is undoubtedly distress, and unless the Government have satisfied themselves of the measure of that distress, while they have a legal right, of course, they have a moral responsibility to apply the law of discretion.  Creditors like banks <Col N="759" /> cannot call in the sheriffs on every occasion.  They have to have regard to individual cases and to hold their hand in many cases.  A similar duty rests upon the Government.  To justify this action the Government must have first an inquiry to realise what the economic position is, to see if the farmers can or cannot pay.  They have their rights and they ought to have their duties.  If the Government's case is to steam-roll law I feel they are courting disaster. One does not want to condone illegal action, but men will not sit still and see their cattle or their furniture sold. It is beyond human nature to expect people to sit down when there is no attempt made to go into their case.  I make these remarks with reluctance, because I feel that in some matters we have unfortunately a heritage of disorder in this country.  I do not want to encourage it.</P>
    <P>The situation is such that I feel the Government must inquire before they act.  If they are going to act they should do so on the circumstances of the case.  If a man has matured stock and cannot get licences they should take the cattle and sell them to the best advantage.  They should not sell them, as Senator Blythe said, to the highest bidder, and let whatever profit is made go to mysterious buyers.  The farmers should get full credit for any matured stock seized and marketed, and there should not be, except in a case of proved imposture, where a man can pay and will not pay, any seizure whatever of stock which constitutes a man's earning power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish to say a few words, as the matter has been very ably dealt with from the different points of view by Senators Wilson and Blythe.  I endorse what they have said.  I could add figures to Senator Wilson's to prove that the farmer in remote parts of the country is in a worse position than the farmer in the instance he has given&mdash;that is, living in County Dublin where the Dublin markets may give him certain advantages. I deny absolutely that we who put our names to this motion have <Col N="760" /> any inclination or desire to make political capital out of it, as we have been accused by the Government.  We merely want to see bare justice done; we are not asking for anything else. I believe this motion is a very reasonable one, and that the Government might have treated it with more courtesy.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a matter which has not been dealt with by any of the other speakers.  It seems to me extraordinarily inconsistent on the part of the Government supporters, and especially Senator Connolly who represents the Government here, to leave this House on the plea that the matter referred to in the motion is <i>sub judice.</i>  Strictly speaking, it is not. It does not deal with the case of the men arrested for riot.  Anyone reading it can see that it does not. Their inconsistency seems to be most extraordinary in view of the fact that the Minister for Finance, even before the inquest on this unfortunate boy was held, rushed up to a meeting in Cavan and in the usual violent and reckless language which we are accustomed to hear from him condemned and placed the blame for the whole matter.  We have not had the slightest apology from the Senator representing the Government or from any of the followers of the Government for that. Their action to-day seems to me thoroughly inconsistent in view of that.  There is nothing more that I can add to the very forceful arguments that the other Senators have made.  I think the least the Government ought to do is to have an impartial inquiry into this matter. The shooting of this young boy Lynch &mdash;an exemplary young man as we know &mdash;has sent a thrill of horror through the country.  We ought to allay that feeling, at any rate, and I think they might accept this motion and act upon it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate closes, I should like to add my voice to that of the other speakers in asking for an inquiry into this matter.  As far as I can see, the offence committed by these young boys was a comparatively small one and the punishment meted out to <Col N="761" /> them was very serious.  Their action was admittedly violent, and, I suppose, illegal, but I, at all events, have seen many more violent assaults than these boys made in Cork which were suppressed with the greatest case by the unarmed authorities of the State. I witnessed, for instance, the Larkinite riots in Dublin many years ago and there was no difficulty in suppressing them.  They seemed to me, at all events, far more dangerous to life and property than anything which occurred in Cork.  All that these boys appear to have done was to break down a gate which was illegally closed against them.  The sale was a public one and the gate was closed.  These young boys in the lorry simply broke down the gate.  As far as could be learned from reading the evidence at the inquest or from anything that one could hear otherwise, there did not seem to be any lives endangered by their action, so that the public conscience has been shocked by the shooting down of these young fellows and the life which has been lost.</P>
      <P>I think it is a reasonable thing that a responsible public representative body such as this should at least ask that an inquiry should be held into it.  I do not suggest that it was for the purpose of evading responsibility that the Government representatives withdrew from the House.  But I certainly think the Government cannot evade responsibility in this matter.  They are certainly responsible for the basic conditions which brought it about and brought about these sales.  I think there are many extenuating circumstances that could be mentioned with regard to what these boys did.  At all events, there is a traditional objection to the use of bailiffs and emergency men and the making of seizures. There is a traditional objection bred in all Irishmen to such things as that.  When all is said and done, therefore, I think that their offence was very small compared with the terrible punishment meted out to them by the use of firearms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I suggest that the Government cannot evade responsibility, I am referring to the conditions which they have <Col N="762" /> brought about in the economic life of the farmers.  The farmers have become a sort of pawn between the British and our native Government.  There is very little thought for the economic welfare or prosperity of the farmers when considering the international position brought about by the withholding of the annuities.  So that, as I say, the farmers are merely pawns between the two, and it certainly is a suitable proposal to make that a tribunal should be set up to inquire into the whole matter; to inquire into the responsibility of the men who used the firearms and also of the Government which has brought about these conditions in the country. The public mind is certainly disturbed as to what is likely to happen in the future, because if things go on as they are going, there is certainly no doubt but that we shall have more seizures and more demonstrations because of the impossibility of the farmers earning the money to pay the annuities and rates.  That is self-evident. I think the responsibility remains with the Government to set up some tribunal to try to bring about some amelioration or remedy.  I certainly have great satisfaction in supporting the demand.</P>

      <P>Before you, a Chathaoirligh, make any statement with regard to the adjournment of the House, I would like to call the attention of those present to one matter of some interest, particularly having regard to the attacks made upon this House, and the proposal of the Government to abolish it.  I refer to the quite remarkable record this House has set up.  During the last three weeks the Seanad has had inserted in eight Bills no less than 93 amendments. Thus, the Seanad inserted in the eight Bills that came before them practically as many amendments as the Senate of the South African Parliament inserted in Bills that came before them in the ten years, 1923-1933.  The details are as <Col N="763" /> follows:&mdash;The Agricultural Co-operative Societies (Debentures) Bill, seven amendments; Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill, 16; Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill, 43; Tobacco Bill, two; Electricity Supply (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, two; Alcohol Bill, two; Military Service Pensions Bill, nine; Control of Manufactures Bill, 12.  Total 93.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of these amendments was of an obstructive character, and all of them are likely to be accepted by the Dáil. Practically every one of them had its origin in points raised in this House, or out of the superficial and defective manner in which these Bills were dealt with in the other House.  May I make this further observation: During the <Col N="764" /> month of August, when these Bills were before the other House, and what will shortly, it is to be presumed, be the only House of the Legislature, the attendance at divisions often was under 50 per cent. of the membership of that Chamber.  During the last three weeks the attendance here was over 67 per cent.  There is no need for me to say another word upon the record of this Chamber in these matters.</P>
