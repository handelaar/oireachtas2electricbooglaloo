      <P>As the Seanad is aware, this Bill provides for the issue from the Central Fund of the moneys required for the balance of the Estimates for the current financial year, not already covered by the Central Fund Act of 1934.  There have been no supplementary estimates to date with one exception&mdash;the exception of the £300,000 which is provided as an advance from the Guarantee Fund to local authorities in respect of land annuity arrears not yet collected.  The total sum required, as set out in Section 1 of the Bill, is £19,448,207 as compared with £17,750,847 on this occasion last year.  Section 2 of the Bill is in the usual form and gives to the Minister for Finance power to borrow for the purpose of meeting demands on the Exchequer.  Section 3 of the Bill expressly appropriates to the various services set out in Schedule B of the Bill the total amounts granted for the supply services since the passing of the Appropriation Act, 1933.  That Schedule, therefore, includes supplementary estimates amounting to £2,181,888 which were passed during the last financial year.  The second paragraph of this section also gives power to utilise certain Departmental receipts as appropriations-in-aid for the specific purposes mentioned in the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the usual statutory declarations being made before a person can receive payment in respect of superannuation or other non-effective services.  This safeguard is necessary in order to prevent payment <Col N="1850" /> in respect of superannuation or other non-effective services being made to a person not entitled to receive such benefit.  The Schedules set out in detail the specific purposes for which the sums granted by the Central Fund Act, 1934, and by this Bill, are to be appropriated.  Schedule B forms the basis of the audit of the Appropriation Accounts to be subsequently carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Part I of Schedule B is in effect an amendment of Part II of Schedule B of the Act of 1933 and shows the additional sums provided by way of additional and supplementary estimates during the year 1933-34.  On the Second Reading of the Central Fund Bill in March last, I reviewed in some detail the programme of expenditure so that I think it is unnecessary for me to refer to it again at this stage.  This Bill, however, also provides the Seanad with an opportunity of raising any matter in connection with the general administration of the public services.  In that connection, it is customary for members of the House who desire to raise any matter to notify the Minister in charge&mdash;in this case the Minister for Finance&mdash; so that arrangements could be made to secure the attendance of the Minister responsible for those specific questions to which attention was to be directed or consideration given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In looking over the items of this Bill it struck me that, now, more than half the adult population of this country are receiving money from the State in the way of pensions or salaries or payments for unproductive work.  Looking at the items as they stand, it makes one ask the question, how long is it all going to last?  Our expenditure has increased over £5,000,000 in a couple of years. Our trade has fallen by 50 per cent., and our adverse trade balance has increased from £12,000,000 to £18,000,000. I contend the figure of £18,000,000 is not correct and that it would be much more correct to say that our adverse trade balance is over £20,000,000.  We are paying £2,500,000 in bounties and subsidies.  Most of that goes to <Col N="1851" /> foreigners and is sent out of the country for the purpose of selling our goods.  I contend that should be subtracted from the prices we receive for the goods we send out for export.</P>
      <P>My particular reason for rising is to refer to the statement made by the Minister for Finance on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill on the 4th July this year.  In column 1765 of the Official Reports he is reported as having said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It may be quite true that the farmers are suffering.  I do not deny that the farmers are suffering here as they are suffering elsewhere.  At the same time, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that in counties like Mayo farmers have paid 99 per cent. of their annuities and, according to the last figures I saw, 92 per cent. of their rates.  The same is true of a number of other counties.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That statement of the Minister must do away with the contention often put forward by members of the Executive Council and other representatives of Fianna Fáil that there is a conspiracy amongst the farming community not to pay their rates and annuities.  I contend that 75 per cent. of the people worthy of being called farmers in Mayo are supporters of the United Ireland Party, and the fact that 99 per cent. of them have paid their annuities certainly does away with the contention that there is a conspiracy amongst them not to pay their rates or annuities. There is another question.  It is easy for the farmers of Mayo, and other counties in the Gaeltacht, such as Kerry and Cork, to pay their annuities.  The standard of living in these places is very low.  Does the Minister want to reduce other farmers to that level?  The rates or annuities of these farmers could be paid by one of their sons getting three or four weeks' work on the roads.  The money thus earned would pay the annuities of a big percentage of the Mayo farmers.  And therefore if the contention is right that the farmers in Mayo are able to pay their rates and annuities, are we to take it that the other farmers are in a conspiracy not to pay <Col N="1852" /> their rates?  I would like the Minister to tell us, when he mentioned that 99 per cent. of the annuities and 92 per cent. of the rates were paid, was he referring to the year 1932/'33 or the year 1933/'34.  Following up that statement, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They paid them and the fact that they paid them shows that they could pay them.  I think that is an indication also that other people could pay.  That is the position in a certain number of areas.  In one of the areas where the collection is worse both in regard to non-payment of annuities and non-payment of rates, I happen to have personal knowledge of circumstances attaching to one farm of £50 valuation.  I have been at pains to satisfy myself as to the position of these people.  They tell me&mdash;I believe they are telling me the truth&mdash;that in the year 1932/'33 they were better off than they were in the year 1931.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will accept the Minister's statement that there are exceptional cases where it is possible that the farmer could be better off in 1932-33 than in 1931, but would the Minister tell us what class of farming that man is carrying on?  I can speak from personal experience.  I practise all branches of farming, except growing tobacco and beet, and I can assure the House definitely that there are not 5 per cent. of the farmers capable of holding out in this country for another year and paying their rates and annuities, or paying anybody else, if things continue as they are.</P>
    <P>I did not rise to make a contentious speech on the economic war, but I would like to bring home to Senators the fact that the country is in a bad way.  The whole question of the economic war does not depend upon the retention of the land annuities, nor does the settlement of the economic dispute.  We are told that the British Minister for Agriculture and the British Government are out, no matter what happens, to continue the quota on our cattle.  I say there is no foundation whatever for such a statement. We have in our hands, if the Government will adopt the proper <Col N="1853" /> course, the greatest bargaining power with England of any country in the world.  Even at the present time we are the second best customer, and upon a pound for pound basis we have a natural market in England for all the stuff we can produce.  When it comes to protecting the British farmer checks are put on, but they put up a different proposition to the British Commonwealth and the Argentine. There is no quota against Canada for her live stock.  Does the Minister contend that it is not a political stunt to reduce £500,000 or £550,000 of Argentine beef that comes into England by £30,000, and to reduce our little quantity which, on the whole, would not be more than £35,000, by 50 per cent.?  To only reduce the imports from the Argentine which amount, as I said, to over £500,000 by the sum of £30,000 does not make the British farmer's position any better.  It is now admitted that the quota system against Irish cattle is of no avail whatever to the British farmer so long as the Argentine stuff is allowed to come into England.  The amount of beef imported into England from the Argentine and South America is in or about 600,000 tons.  If we assume that it takes on the average three beasts to produce a ton of beef, then the amount of beef we supply to England would be 60,000 tons, and on those 60,000 tons we are cut 50 per cent.  As regards the 550,000 tons which the Argentine and South America send into England, there has been a reduction of only 30,000 tons, and I want to emphasise this, that that reduction has never been enforced.</P>
    <P>I read in this morning's newspapers a very alarming statement made in the House of Commons yesterday by the British Minister of Agriculture.  If the policy outlined in that statement is going to be carried out to the full it will mean not only the complete ruination of our fat stock trade but the complete ruination of tillage, and will create in this country a welter of unemployment amongst our agricultural labourers.  The policy indicated in that statement is this: that from 1st September next, and not later than the 1st March of next year, there will <Col N="1854" /> be a tariff of 1d. per lb. on all beef either on foot or dead going into England. The amount of money which that tariff will produce is to be given by way of subsidy to the British farmer.  With the £6 per head already on our cattle going into England, that tariff is going to put another 50/- per head on them.  I read in that statement also that there is to be a 50 per cent. preference for members of the British Commonwealth.  That was the one little ray of hope that I saw in the statement.  I hope that even at this late hour the Minister will admit that we are still members of the British Commonwealth, and that he will take steps to see that we will get this 50 per cent. preference which we are entitled to receive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards all these tariffs, bounties, subsidies and pensions, the only sufferers are the farmers of the country and the agricultural labourers.  No matter what the Minister for Finance may say he will find, if he makes inquiries, that the decent farmers in the rich grazing parts of the country are in a terrible position.  The policy of the Government has placed them practically in the position of being herds to foreigners &mdash;not Irishmen, mind you&mdash;but foreigners.  I am in a position to point out to the Minister where you have 5,000 acres of the best land in the country at present being grazed by people who are not Irish nationals.  I do not want to mention names, but, if the Minister wants to know it, these people are grazing cattle on that land. They are getting bounties for what they export and they are able to obtain licences, while you have farmers in the Counties of Meath, Kildare and Dublin left practically in the position of being herds.  They are being made mendicants of.  That is what the most respectable class in the community is being reduced to.  That is the position which the country is coming to, and the people who are suffering in that way are receiving very little sympathy from the Government at the present time. I do not want to say anything harsh <Col N="1855" /> about Ministers.  It is no pleasure to me to have to stand up and speak like this, but I want to assure the House that it is very difficult under such circumstances to speak with an even voice on those matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Counihan has an obsession with regard to the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a tacit admission that the Senator has.  I would commend the Senator to read the speech made recently by Mr. Baldwin in Worcestershire.  It was published in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> on Monday fortnight.  Speaking to an audience of farmers, Mr. Baldwin outlined the measures which his Government had taken, and said that they had more than justified themselves with regard to mutton.  He admitted that no appreciable improvement had taken place in the case of beef.  He went on to say that it seemed to him that the tastes of the housewifes of England were changing: that they were going in more for the smaller joint.  He said if that tendency continued that no legislation that the Government could pass would be effective in raising the prices of fat cattle.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether we are fortunately situated in the south of Ireland or not, but I had occasion to visit the Cork Agricultural Show held a week or ten days ago to meet Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture.  I had some difficulty in finding him, the result being that I had to go through all parts of the Show.  If the statement that Senator Counihan made a moment ago is true, that the farmers of the country are reduced practically to a condition of mendicancy, it certainly has no application in the neighbourhood of Cork, because I never saw a gathering of better-dressed, better fed or happier looking people than I saw at the Cork Show. The newspapers reported that the attendance at the Show was over 4,000 in excess of any previous record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> Mr. Bohane, the Director of the Royal Dublin Society's Show, said that he recognised that his great show was at last having a competitor. Let us take also the facts and figures in connection with the recent local elections in which all the farmers of the country voted.  I do not wish to draw any exaggerated inferences from the results of those elections, but if the condition of the farmers was such as it has been described by Senator Counihan, well, I think that we would have a reflection of that in the elections and that the results would have been very different from what they actually were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the result of the recent elections goes to show what I have always believed: that the farmers of Ireland will not vote according to self-interest.  If there is anything put before the farmers of Ireland which indicates to them that their vote has a national significance, they pay very little attention to their private interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you do not agree with Senator Dowdall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because amongst that class is the real manhood of Ireland, and I would like everybody to understand that.  Senator Counihan has spoken on behalf of the farming interest.  I do not think that he is entitled to speak for all the farming interest.  I think that there is a great section of the farming community who are entitled to have their views expressed through the mouths of people who, in general matters of policy, support the present Government.  There is no doubt whatever but that the events of the last two or three years have prejudiced the farming community. I am sure that the Government in the struggle in which they are engaged, now that they have time to think out more clearly and more fully measures of amelioration, will see that measures are taken to ensure that the farming community does not suffer unduly.  There are three heads under which I think the case of the farming community may be put.  They are prejudiced undoubtedly by the special <Col N="1857" /> tariffs imposed by Great Britain in regard to cattle from the Irish Free State.  I think that the bounties paid are not a full recompense in regard to the prejudice done to the Irish farmers by reason of these special tariffs.  They are also prejudiced under what I will describe as the second head of account. They are prejudiced by the fact that these tariffs have artificially reduced the price, not merely of the cattle exported, but the cattle sold at home. I understand that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture are carefully considering that aspect of the case.  The townspeople&mdash; you and I, and everybody who consumes beef or other agricultural produce&mdash;have been deriving an advantage at the expense of the farmer by reason of the artificially reduced price of beef and other farming commodities.  That is the second head of loss.</P>
      <P>There is also a matter which has been very much overlooked, I think, by politicians on the other side.  The agricultural community is also prejudiced by the tariffs imposed in this country during the last two or three years. These tariffs have resulted in increasing the price of all the commodities which the farmer buys.  These are the three heads.  I am in favour of these tariffs. I know that they prejudice the farmers. I know that this matter is capable of adjustment, and I am quite confident it will be adjusted as soon as the Government get an opportunity of surveying the whole field.  These are the three heads of loss suffered by the farming community.  It has not, so far as I can see in the Press, been fully, clearly or dispassionately stated by any politicians on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But we do represent the farming community and we are thinking of the farming community.  Most of us are farmers, as I said, squeezed out of the soil.  It is idle to assume that we on these benches do not consider the interests of the farmers.  It is idle to say that we have not lost and that all those belonging to us have not lost as the result of what has happened in the last two or three years.  But I am happy to say that when there is a national issue it does not influence our <Col N="1858" /> votes in the slightest degree.  I said on the last occasion that in the north of the County Clare, which is altogether a grazing district, where the people have lost most, perhaps, as the result of the struggle which has gone on, they voted unanimously for the men sent forward by the present Government.  The first five men elected to the county council were Fianna Fáil representatives and if they had put up six they would have got the six.  That shows that the farmers will not vote according to what might be regarded as their immediate interests.  I will say this, that they expect, of course, when occasion offers to see that their interests are looked after and that their condition will be ameliorated as far as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Counihan made a statement which, of course, knowing him as I do, I would accept, but it is a statement of such consequence that I think it ought to be more fully elaborated.  He said that 500,000 acres of land in this country are grazed by people who are not Irish nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Five thousand acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is only 5,000 we can make a present of them.  I should say that Senator Counihan himself has more land than that.  I must say that he has shown that he was worthy of land, and I am sure he will continue to be of service to his country in the future as he has been in the past.  We cannot complain, I think, of the tariffs imposed by Great Britain; it was part of the contest. But I do complain of the quota for reasons which are well known to Senator Sir John Keane and which I hope will be expressed by him in the course of this debate.  There is no justification for the quota as against this country.  Everybody in this House understands that.  Everybody who knows anything of the history and development of this country and of Great Britain knows that imposing a quota against Irish cattle is not playing <Col N="1859" /> the game.  In fact, I should say that the English would be disqualified by any board of control for a foul blow in regard to that.  I do not want to elaborate it further.  There are other Senators who can elaborate it fully. There are Senators here who know all the reasons why the statement I now make is true.</P>
      <P>I do not know what to say in reference to the tariff of a penny per pound on beef, with 50 per cent. preference, referred to by Senator Counihan.  I saw that some days ago &mdash;not this morning.  I think it is more than a fortnight ago since the first intimation was given as to that change in policy.  I do not know how that will affect us.  I think that the people of Great Britain are making a great mistake in trying to assail this country through our agricultural industry in the way they have done. No matter what the English people do, it seems to me that they will never be able to supply more than 20 per cent. of their food requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are supplying 45 per cent. of their beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is not well to go very minutely into facts of this kind.  Would Senator Counihan say that the 45 per cent. of beef which they are supplying was born in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a great deal of it went on foot from this country.  There is no real difference between us as to the amount which the English people can supply for their own use.  It is perfectly obvious that, in respect of cattle, horses and other agricultural products, they can never dispense with the Irish market. Another point made by an English statesman, who has been referred to here, was that the taste of the English people had changed. Undoubtedly, it has changed.  The big round of beef has gone. The English people are going in for smaller joints now.  We <Col N="1860" /> can supply the smaller joints and Senator Counihan will be able to adjust his industry so as to supply these needs.  These are observations which I felt I ought to make as a farmer, representing farmers and the spailpin fanach.  I believe that the matters to which I have referred are always present in the mind of the Government.  I am perfectly certain that, in a very short time, these grievances of the farming community will be adjusted in so far as they can be adjusted in the circumstances of the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but when I have heard what Senator Dowdall had to say about Cork Show I felt that I had to get up and endorse all that the Senator had said.  It has to be remembered that we, Irish people, have a tendency to celebrate on occasion.  While I admit that everything that the Senator said was perfectly true, I cannot help feeling that it is not representative of the true condition of the country and in a few words I hope to point out the grounds of my belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take the Senator to some of the country fairs through which I had to pass on my way to the Seanad. Anything more deplorable could not well be imagined.  There is no festive air there.  In the towns of Mitchelstown, Thurles, Fermoy, or the other towns on the way from Cork to Dublin, there is no evidence of festivity.  On the contrary, one sees a very depressed and, I might say, a humiliated people. You see the cattle going away in droves from the fair and, from the dejected appearance of the people driving them, you realise that they have not met with the demand with which they ought to have met.  After all, the farmer to-day has to depend on what he gets for his cattle.  If you recollect for an animal similar to that for which his neighbour across the border gets £5 5s., he, with the bounty gets, only 30/-., you will not wonder that he should feel depressed.  I differ with my friend, Senator Counihan, who seems to think that no section of the community is suffering save the farming section.  If <Col N="1861" /> my friend, Senator Dowdall, were here, he would agree with me that the City of Cork is suffering very much, indeed, because of the diminution of the farming revenues.  The industries there&mdash;I can vouch for this&mdash;are not having much effect in balancing what we have lost through the farming moneys.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not showing much result, so far.  I should like to have two curious things explained by the Minister.  I have been going through the flour mills lately and I am told that the consumption of flour has fallen off very largely, indeed.  We know that the Government set aside last winter a certain proportion of the supply of creamery butter.  That proportion, they believed, represented the amount which had been consumed in Ireland every winter so far.  They believed that that butter would have been absorbed by the Irish community before the new season opened.  What was the result?  At the opening of the new season, they found themselves with hundreds of tons of butter on hands, meaning, so far as I can see, that the people could not afford to buy butter.  Senator Comyn made the point that the Government can adjust this question of the price of cattle.  There was a wise old king called Artaxerxes, who reigned in Persia&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Senator, what I said was that the Government can adjust the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of bounties&mdash;out of the revenues of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not telling them how they are to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that very wise king laid it down that the taxes in every country must be borne by the agricultural producers of that country.  The fox had many tricks but, when he tried to escape from the hounds, he was caught, but the cat, who had only one trick, escaped.  You cannot get away from the fact that there is only one producer in Ireland.  That producer is <Col N="1862" /> the man who gets from the soil the wealth that God has given to us.  Upon his shoulders will the burden of these bounties fall.  All these bounties and all these subsidies for the export of cattle must be borne by him.</P>

      <P>In every other country you have farmers and you have also ranchers and graziers.  The man who is a grazier does not feel in the least insulted if he is so described.  In fact, he feels proud of it.  In this country we have people who are in reality graziers or ranchers who get highly insulted if they are so described. These alleged representatives of the farmers get up and talk about the farmers of the country.  If we had a proper definition of &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; it would settle the question once and for all.  Senator Counihan talks about the various tariffs put up by Britain against other countries.  Does not Senator Counihan and most other Senators here know that the various Ministers in Great Britain have, within the past few weeks, made statements which would convince anybody that their principal object in putting on these tariffs was to protect the British market?  For years British farmers have been crying out for this protection from their own Government and their Government &mdash;I suppose they have been slow, like a lot of other Governments&mdash; eventually have come to the conclusion that it is up to them to protect their own farmers and they have now taken the steps that they consider necessary to protect the farmers of Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Counihan talks about the farmers in the rich grazing parts of the country.  I say those people are not farmers in the proper sense of the word.  If Senator Counihan wanted to speak with any sincerity he should have referred to those people, as his <Col N="1863" /> leader referred to them, as ranchers. It was evident, listening to Senator Counihan, that he was not speaking with that same conviction which appeared to be behind his speeches here in the past.  On the thousand and one occasions when he spoke of the economic war he spoke with considerable conviction, but he seemed to-day to have lost all that conviction. We must only assume that it was because of the fact that during the last week or two on more than one occasion he and the people he represents have been repudiated by the leader of what he calls his Party.  It is hard to blame Senator Counihan if he feels a bit depressed as a result of the action of his leader.  I do not think he ought to try to paint such a picture as he endeavoured to paint of the country as a whole.  Amongst the various grievances that Senator Counihan has mentioned is the one relating to 5,000 acres of rich grazing land, possibly the fertile plains of Meath and Kildare, being let to people who are not Irish Free State nationals.  I do not know to whom the lands are rented, but I take it the Senator means the company who have been exporting cattle to Germany in recent times.</P>

      <P>It is pretty easy to read between the lines when Senator Counihan is talking.  I know where the boot leans, all right.  I do not know exactly to whom the lands are rented, but I do know that at least 50 per cent. of the people who make up that company are Irish Free State nationals. Has Senator Counihan any objection to selling cattle to those people whom he claims not to be Irish Free State nationals?  Has he any objection to the friendship of those people when he meets them in the Dublin cattle market?  Have his friends raised any objection to letting their lands to those people simply because they were not Irish Free State nationals?  I think I am right when I say that the principal grievance that Senator Counihan and his friends have with regard to those <Col N="1864" /> people is because they cannot get a monopoly of the trade to Germany which has been a great relief to this country and which everybody should be very glad we secured when we had our backs more or less to the wall so far as Britain was concerned.  If Senator Counihan were really interested, even in the ranchers or the farmers of the rich grazing plains of Meath and Kildare, as he claims to be, he would be very thankful to see that company buying our cattle and shipping them to Germany.</P>

      <P>If we had 6,000 extra cattle left on our hands I have no doubt the moans from Senator Counihan and others would be terrible.  If they were not buying these 6,000 cattle, or whatever the number is, Senator Counihan knows very well that the other men would be in a position to offer us whatever they liked for our cattle.  It is quite obvious to everybody whom Senator Counihan means when he says these people are not Irish nationals. We all know whom he means and I do not want to mention names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1865" /> Senator Counihan tried to deny the fact that there was a conspiracy in connection with the non-payment of rates and annuities.  That kind of thing is getting a little bit old-fashioned. We have men here and in the Dáil making certain statements when they know perfectly well that there has been such a conspiracy.  I would not say there is a conspiracy now because it is about broken by this time.  We all know that there was such a conspiracy and the men who said that there was not were the principal organisers of it in the country.</P>

      <P>It would be far more decent for these men to stand the racket themselves.  When they lead people to battle the least they might do is share the brunt of it.  Instead of that, we have these men going behind the backs of their followers in the country and paying their rates and annuities&mdash;which, of course, they should do&mdash;while advising others not to do so.  It is a contemptible thing to see them letting other people bear the burden, but they take very good care to escape any trouble, and I have no doubt some of them have their own cattle grazing on the plains of Kildare.</P>
      <P>Senator Crosbie speaks about the depressed and humiliated people whom he has seen at the various fairs.  I do not know what they are like in the County Cork, but I would be inclined to take Senator Dowdall's word as against the word of anybody else in that part of the country.  He has, perhaps, as much, if not more, association with the people in the country districts as any other member of the Seanad.  If Senator Crosbie talks about the depressed and humiliated appearance of the people in the County Tipperary and if he mentions Thurles as one example, if he required to get a more depressed and humiliated bunch of people he should have passed through Clonmel on last Saturday, after some cattle had been sold in the pound and when a protest meeting of United Ireland Party supporters &mdash;about 24 of them&mdash;was being held, and he would then see some picture of depression and humiliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> Senator Crosbie says further that the production of flour in the local mills has gone down considerably within the past few months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>The sale of flour all round has gone down.  Not merely the output of the mills, but the actual sale of flour, whether from England or made locally, has fallen very materially, so I am assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Crosbie has not quoted his authority for such a statement, but in any case he will hardly hold that the people quitted eating as a result of the economic war or anything else.  He will hardly try to argue that we have less people in the country now than we had at any other period.  If Senator Crosbie wanted to look into the question from an unbiased point of view, I think he would find that the mills, as a rule, do not keep on producing flour unless they can sell it and I think he would also find that they have purchased more wheat within the past year than they have purchased in any previous year for a number of years.</P>
      <P>Last year, in 1933, we imported 8,208,894 cwts. of wheat.  In 1932 we imported 5,917,849 cwts. of wheat.  If the mills have bought less wheat within the past few months, Senator Crosbie must know as well as anybody else, that the reason for that is that the price of wheat has taken a considerable jump within the past few months and that those people realised that fact and are not prepared to rush in and buy in an inflated market.  The wheat crop has been a failure all over the world, as everybody knows, and that is why the price jumped.  Senator Crosbie should take that into consideration before making the statement he made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no Farmers' Party in this House.  I can say definitely, as I said here before, and I can prove it up to the hilt, that the farmer who is suffering now under the Government's policy is not the very small farmer who gets employment other than on his farm, who gets employment on roads and gets money in other ways such as Senator Comyn mentioned in Clare.  That man is not the representative of the farmer who is suffering.  Even the grazier is not the greatest sufferer in this matter.  The real sufferer is the man who employs the most labour, who tills the most land, and who uses the produce of his farm for fattening his stock on his farm. He is the real victim, and that is the man I represent and no other.  I have no interest in grass at all, except in so far as every farmer must have in his farm a certain amount of grazing to keep his farm going.  Above all, if he goes in for horse-breeding, he must have a considerable run of grass or he cannot breed horses.  The veriest ass on the country roads can tell that.  I am amazed at the kind of discussion that has taken place on this question of the farmers.  My county is representative of the districts that have been hit the hardest.  We have been told here that the result of the recent elections is a proof that farmers are persons above mundane considerations altogether; that they do not consider the mere question of living in this country at all; that their only outlook is the great national goal of the Republic, I suppose, or something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Comyn made the most fantastic statements&mdash;that the farmers have voted for Fianna Fáil because, although they had lost their living, they were concerned with nothing except the great national outlook of the Government.  It is exceedingly difficult to have patience in listening to statements like that.  The result of the election is written as plain as a pikestaff in the figures.  It is the <Col N="1868" /> direct result of the doles.  It is the direct result of what Senator Counihan said&mdash;that more than half the population of this country is living, without doing any work, better perhaps than they ever lived before.  They are being reduced to the state of paupers and being fed from the Government's hand and enjoying it.  The slums in the towns and villages and other places&mdash;there are slums even in the rural areas also &mdash;voted in this election for Fianna Fáil.  No doubt some of those small farmers voted for Fianna Fáil also because they are not farmers at all. They do not live on what they make out of their farms.  The figures of the Labour vote in this election proved that clearly.  They proved that the Labour vote is going to Fianna Fáil, and that is all they proved.  Labour was the sufferer in this election, not the United Ireland Party, and that is proved by the doles.  The demoralising effect of that will be felt for many and many a year to come, even into generations.  The demoralisation of the people's character is going on to such an extent that it is painful to think of it.</P>
    <P>Senator Comyn mentioned a word that struck me as having a strange sound when he used the word &ldquo;amelioration.&rdquo;  Those who have read the &ldquo;Jail Journal&rdquo; of John Mitchel will be familiar with that word.  It was a favourite word of those who tried to apologise for the action of the Government during the days of the Great Famine.  It is the same kind of people who are now trying to apologise for this Government for the same reason&mdash;because they are giving amelioration to the people rather than their rights.  That word has a painful significance in the Irish history of the last century.  It was the word which John Mitchel quoted with the greatest contempt, and when I hear it quoted now it brings to my mind a remark made to me recently to the effect that this Government are copying not only the wrongdoings of the world at large with regard to economics but every mistake of the British Government. Not only are they undoing some of the <Col N="1869" /> good things the British did in their good days, such as land purchase, but they are copying every bad thing the British did in this country.  That is the fact.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke said something with regard to the wonderful trade we have had with Germany and the way Germany came to our relief when the terrible enemy over in Britain was trying to hound us down.  The British market brought us, for the first five months of this year, £6,750,510.  The alternative markets&mdash;the war-cry of this Government&mdash;brought us from all over the world, £469,306.  We bought from Germany goods to the value of £1,037,561, and for all the cattle and all the other goods that we sent over to the German Empire, or the German Republic, or whatever it is, they sent us the grand sum of £6,692.  That would not be missed out of the £6,750,510 from the British.</P>
    <P>Senator Comyn made a speech&mdash;I am sorry I did not time it&mdash;enlarging on the wonderful benefit the Germans conferred on us by buying a few cattle when the British were hounding us out of existence by their tariffs.</P>

      <P>I might go a little further with those figures while I am at it.  From Soviet Russia we bought goods to the value of £7,638 for the five months.  Soviet Russia sent to this country in payment for the total of our exports sent them the handsome sum of £1.  That sum was distributed amongst all the importers of this country, I presume.  I must offer a word of congratulation to the Statistical Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They must have the noses of bloodhounds to find out where that pound went.</P>

      <P>We are getting fonder of Soviet Russia every day.  Now I come to the up-to-date figures with regard to our trade.  I have examined the figures with regard to the report in <Col N="1870" /> the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> as to the trade of this country.  I submit there is something there that all the Ministers put together cannot answer.  It is, to my mind, no use for the Ministers to argue on this little item and that little item.  There is here the tally of the ruin of this country under the present Government.  The figures I am quoting are from the <i>Trade Journal</i> which all the members here get.  It is the most dismal reading that an Irishman or Irishwoman can conceive.  Senators will find in the present issue a set of figures which are the result of the Government's policy with regard to our exports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I could tell the Senator all about that.  In the first five months of this year the fall in the value of the total external trade of the country is more than 50 per cent.  I am not speaking of the whole time since the present Government came into power.  The adverse balance for the five months, January to May, is £1,437,666 in excess of the total export trade of this country.  The total external trade of the country for the first five months of this year fell to £12,085,506.  That is the external trade alone.  The fall in the total external trade compared with 1931 was £38,136,181&mdash;the drop in exports alone being £22,714,283.  These figures speak volumes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quirke said something about production in the country.  What is it for?  Some time ago a witty man down the country was told off the Fianna Fáil platform that the cattle were to be turned off the grass and men put there instead.  His comment was: &ldquo;God bless us, have we come to that now, that we have to go out and eat the grass?  God help us, is that what we are coming to?&rdquo;  That story is absolutely true.  I do not wish to delay the House very long over these figures. I am sorry that Senator Johnson is not present.  Last week, on the Finance Bill, he challenged me to say where money could be saved out of this enormous expenditure.  To show where <Col N="1871" /> it could be saved I would have to take a run through a great many of the items.  What I am primarily concerned with is the position of the farming community, but as I was challenged on this matter by Senator Johnson I will give him a few items where the money could be saved.  Senator Johnson's words were something to this effect&mdash; that he would not stand over any reduction in expenditure if it meant taking the bread out of the mouths of the poor.  Neither would any of us.  None of us here would stand for that.  But this Government has reached office on the cry of the poor; it has reached office and place by exploiting the poor.  They now occupy the places they are occupying thanks to their exploiting the poor.  The poor got the impression that this is the most marvellous Government in the world, perhaps, because they got meat a little cheaper. The people whose votes they secure on this cry cannot see ahead.  They are impervious to reason.  They only look at a few things.  A few days ago, a man out of work down in Waterford proved that he gets more money through being unemployed than if he were at work. That is because of the unemployment system.  In every way, the poor are being given the impression that they have to thank the Government for these things; they cannot look ahead. When they wake up, of course, it will be a different matter.  They may wake up in time to save themselves and the country.</P>
    <P>I will just run through a few little items in this book of Estimates where money could be saved without inflicting any hardships on the poor.  In fact, I have here items where money could be saved and a lot of demoralisation could be avoided at the same time.  An injustice is being done to many of the people who have to find this money.  I will take the items as they come.  There is, first of all, the Property Losses Compensation Act. That Act came into operation recently. Huge sums were paid to people who were supposed to have lost during the Civil War.  These were people who were on the side of the Party led by <Col N="1872" /> Mr. de Valera in the revolt or rebellion which cost this country £35,000,000 or £36,000,000.  I know cases that came under my notice where people have been paid compensation for the food they gave to their own sons who were fighting on the side of the Irregulars.  I know cases of frightful abuse under this head.  I know people who have got compensation who were not at all genuine losers.  They have been compensated for what they never lost.  To illustrate, I will mention the case of a man known to me personally. I am fully familiar with his case.  His son was out with the Irregulars.  He came home once a week, perhaps under cover of night.  During the rest of the week he lived on the farmers around.  He lived well on them and deprived many of them of what they could not well afford.  When he came home he brought with him, perhaps, a couple of fellows and stayed for the night.  I know that man got £15 compensation for what he was supposed to have lost.  I have made out a long list of such cases.  I have gone through them.  A most marvellous fraud was perpetrated in compensating people who went out in rebellion against the country and against its Government.  Compensating such people is immoral and wrong.  It was never yet done in any country in the world that the people who went out in rebellion on the losing side were compensated.</P>
    <P>Then there is the Secret Service Vote.  In this we see an increase of £15,000 over last year.  That Vote was £10,000 last year and now it is £25,000.  What is happening to the country that so large an increase is required for the Secret Service Vote? We were told by Mr. de Valera when the Oath Bill was going through the Oireachtas that once it was passed there was going to be peace in the country and no more trouble or opposition. The fact is that these people are irreconcilable&mdash;more irreconcilable than ever.  The passing of that Bill has done no good to the country.  It has done a great deal of harm by raising a great deal of prejudice against this country abroad.  Anybody who accuses me of being a pro-Britisher <Col N="1873" /> or anything else but pro-Irish is making a charge that is not true.  I deny any such thing.  There was never anything in the Oath which would cause any harm or injure in any way the people who took it. Thomas Davis once said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  But I have been challenged to show where savings could be effected.  Now, on the Gárda Síochána Vote there has been an increase of £70,460 over last year.  We know why the Army Vote has been increased.  It is increased in order to raise a political Army in this country for reasons that are plain.  Then there is the increase in the Vote for Agriculture. I am asked where could savings be made there?  Well, the only recommendation one could make in that matter is that the whole service could be scrapped altogether, for the Department is a hindrance instead of a help to agriculture.  When the late Government was in office we heard a great deal of criticism about garden parties. But we had a garden party two days ago in the Albert College.  That was given for the benefit of people who were called farmers.  I would like to hear a definition of these farmers.  All that Vote with its subsidies and bounties could be scrapped altogether without any injury to farmers.</P>
      <P>Then there is the matter of wireless broadcasting, and here I want to make a protest against using the broadcasting station for political propaganda. That is a disgraceful thing.  I now come to the repayment of the Dáil Eireann Loan.  That is an unnecessary burden on the taxpayers of the country. I could go over a great many other things and pick out almost at random items in which the money is practically thrown away by the Government; it could almost as well be thrown into Dublin Bay as used in the way in which it is used.  If that money were saved, it would not take one penny out of the mouths of the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned something about commissions being set up.  Some of these were, of course, necessary, but what <Col N="1874" /> I want to complain about is that the money that pays these people who sit on these commissions is contributed by the taxpayer and ought to be expended on people who are competent to do the work for which they are appointed.  I know of one glaring case&mdash;I will not mention the commission&mdash;where a man, a defeated T.D., was appointed to a position on a commission that required considerable financial knowledge.  That same man has the education of, we will say, an agricultural labourer.  He went to a national country school till he was about 14 years of age, and he is by no means an intelligent man.  That was a job, purely and simply, and I could give many others.  These commissions have been used to compensate people for being defeated in an election or to buy the support of other people. Instead of putting properly qualified people on them, the money of the taxpayers is used to appoint people whom this Government wishes to favour.</P>

      <P>I suppose the same could be said about the beet factories. After all, the subsidy to the beet <Col N="1875" /> factories is Government money subscribed by the taxpayers of the country and the most scandalous victimisation has taken place in regard to the filling of positions in connection with the new beet factories.  Men who have had years of experience as loading agents and other positions of that kind through the country have been either thrown out or the positions made worth so little that they are practically of no use at all to them.  New men who know nothing about it are being put in.  I have been told by very reliable people, and have seen it published in the papers, that the staff in the new beet factories has been recruited from Fianna Fáil followers to an altogether unjust extent.  Of course, a few little trifles are thrown to the others.  That is the spirit that comes out in all the dealings of the Government and you can see it in the appointments since the late elections.  That does not come under the Appropriation Bill.  That is all I have got to say.  There are many other things one could speak about but that is a general outline.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is on account of the very hot weather that I got rather tired of the subjects discussed for the last couple of hours and I think we might very well progress in regard to the lengthy matters we have before us.  I note that Vote No. 25 amounts to £900,000 and Vote No. 76 to £250,000, making a total of £1,150,000.  Those are both, I take it, in relief of rates on land.  The amount of these rates has gone up, I think, but in spite of that the distribution of rate charges is carried out in such a way that many farmers find their rates nearly doubled.  The reason for that is, of course, because the whole system of distribution of charges for rates has been changed.  Instead of being charged on the land itself, it is mostly charged on the people working on the land.  At all events, the relief is on account of that.  The object, of course, of that is good and I do not say it is not good.  The object is to create tillage, which we all desire, but when you go into the question you find that it is very hard on some farmers.  If the <Col N="1876" /> whole of Ireland were one flat piece of land, all of which could be tilled, I dare say it would work out pretty well, but that is not the case at all.  Some parts of the land can be tilled and other parts cannot be tilled.  Some parts are nothing but rock with a little grass in between, here and there. Some of it is unsuitable for tillage of any sort and these people have to use their land for what it is fitted for and in some cases it is fitted only for sheep and goats, and in some places for cattle.  These people get only a very small reduction whereas other people who till the land get very large reductions in their rates.</P>
      <P>Yesterday we had a good deal of talk about equality and justification and so on, but here is a case where I think it is unfair to these people that they should get no relief in their rates, not because of any fault of theirs but merely because their land is not suitable for tillage.  Anybody who has been down in Clare knows that a great part of the country is nothing but rocks with grass in between.  It is good for sheep grazing as the grazing is rather sweet and good, but no plough can plough it.  So it is with other parts of the country.  I have been told of the case of one person's land, and since last year the rates have doubled because he gets no relief to speak of. I do not think that is proper or wise. I think those people who use each piece of land for what is suitable, one for tillage and another for grazing and so on, should be treated equally instead of having their rates raised because they do not get any allowance.  They have been nearly doubled since last year.  I must apologise to the Minister for not having mentioned this matter to him in advance and I cannot expect him to answer the points I have raised, but he can answer them when the matter comes up again.  I think it is an important matter and the Minister should consider what can be done.  I do not think it necessary to say anything further.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to continue generally the discussion on the so-called economic war, but there are one or two matters of administration to which I should like to call the attention of the House.  I cannot resist the temptation to express a certain amount of satisfaction at the frank and candid speech of Senator Comyn.  Generally when we have a debate, every aspect of a question is seen through coloured Party glasses. If you see things through the Fianna Fáil Party glasses, everything is excellent; but if you see them through the glasses of the Opposition Party, they are hopeless and absolutely bad.  That is what we usually have.  We had Senator Comyn to-day quite frankly admitting that things were not satisfactory as far as the farmers went. The Senator said that quite candidly. It is true that he has great faith&mdash; unfortunately some of us have not got it&mdash;that as soon as the Government had time to survey the situation and to bring forward measures of amelioration, things will be all right.  The Senator said that he was not able to say how that would be done but he felt that they would be all right.  His speech was a candid one, such as we have not often heard here and if the Senator were in the House now, I should like to congratulate him on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject I want to refer to is one that I have called attention to previously and Ministers have stated that they would carefully consider it. However, nothing has been done.  Yet I am convinced that it would be in their own interests, and in the interests of the country generally, if they would deal with the position.  I refer to licences.  I am not opposed to the granting of licences under the present tariff system.  Licences for free imports have to be given to a very large number of persons.  They are given principally to manufacturers, but sometimes to others for special reasons.  As I have had some <Col N="1878" /> experience of firms which had to ask for licences, I want to say quite frankly, that with the exception of a few complaints, they have been dealt with with reasonable expedition.  I have no complaint to make that they were dealt with unfairly, or that there was any political bias, but all over the city you have whispers that So-and-so got a licence because he was in the Fianna Fáil Party; and whispers that So-and-so got a licence which could not have been granted but for some other reason.  When these rumours are investigated it is found that there is no truth in them. There is a whole mass of whispers and the whole system has got into disrepute because of secrecy.</P>
    <P>My suggestion to the Government is, if they did not publish a long list of names in the official journal, that after a period of three months a list of the licences granted should be available for anyone to see on reasonable application being made, either to the Department of Industry and Commerce or to the Department of Finance.  That would be open and above board and there could be no charge of unfairness.  I am not making such charge.  I have no reason for making it.  With the industrial policy that this country has undertaken, and with high tariffs, you must have licences.  I want those licences to be given in a way that no Party or interest can question the whole system or suggest that anything is being done unfairly.  I maintain that the policy of secrecy is bad, and that it is having a bad effect.  I believe the whole system is bad.  I want to keep business out of politics. Ministers promised to look into the matter and saw no fundamental objection to doing so, but nothing has been done.  I urge the Government to say whether there is any real reason why there must be a policy of secrecy for licences.</P>
    <P>I should like to get some more information from the Minister.  We have been sent copies of two international conventions during the last few days.  One deals with the suppression of counterfeit currency, of which I know very little, but I was <Col N="1879" /> surprised that we were not a party to it.  There is no reason why we should not be.</P>

      <P>They have not come before this House formally yet.  I am particularly glad that second convention, dealing with films of an educational character, is to be adopted.  I presume it will mean that a Finance Bill will be introduced to extend the definition of educational films.  I think that is desirable.  I have several times advocated the widening of the scope, in order that films&mdash;not those used by institutions or schools&mdash;which would educate public opinion in internationalism and on questions affecting the League of Nations, should be allowed in free.  They would not pay sufficiently well for public exhibition if they were subject to a high duty. I think quite a number of them would be shown here if they could come in free of duty.  I am particularly glad that it is the intention to ratify these conventions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one or two matters to refer to.  One is, perhaps, a little more important than it may seem to be, from the point of view of the tourist industry, dealing with the examination of passengers' luggage at ports of entry.  Whilst on the whole nobody can reasonably complain of the manner in which Customs officers deal with passengers' luggage, there are times when they seem to lose their heads, and give a very unhappy display of surveillance that is absolutely unnecessary and uncalled for. On one occasion recently, during a tremendous rush of passengers in connection with the Sweepstakes, when the majority of the people were coming only for the week-end, and some only for a day, the extent to which they were inconvenienced at Dun Laoghaire was absolutely uncalled for.  It <Col N="1880" /> showed exceedingly bad tact, and generally was something that was inclined to discourage people coming through that port if they could avoid it.  I had personal experience recently when meeting some friends from England who were coming to spend a holiday here for four weeks.  As a rule, ladies carry a supply of clothing, and that is quite understandable.  These ladies would not be allowed to pass through the barrier, and their trunks would not be marked until they had shown their return tickets to England. I think that was quite an unnecessary procedure.  On the same occasion it seemed to me that the luggage of the passengers was rummaged and tossed about to an extent that was entirely unnecessary.  It took friends of mine a good while to try to gather up their property and to put it back again into the bags, which were perhaps a bit crowded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also noticed that when passing through the barriers, if passengers carried a light rug or a light showerproof on their arms, it was always taken off and examined.  I passed through many frontiers in my time, and I never knew that to happen except at our ports of entry.  Perhaps it is a necessary procedure. I think it is hardly necessary that every little item should be scrutinised in that way.  It gives one the impression of entering a South American Republic or some Balkan State.  The amount of contraband that would be discovered in that way would at best be an absolutely negligible quantity.  It is not because of the amount discovered that there is any value attached to customs examination. It is the idea in the minds of the passengers that they may be discovered that keeps them from smuggling.  Here, where we have so many people coming in, whom he want to make welcome even for the commercial value of their visit, I think we should be a little more generous in the manner in which we treat them, particularly during the tourist season.  Probably there is a disposition on the part of certain customs officers to win admiration, and possibly promotion, because of the fact that they discovered a couple of petty attempts at smuggling.  Promotion should not <Col N="1881" /> be encouraged along those lines in a country which wants to encourage the tourist traffic.  I do hope that the customs authorities will give instructions that a reasonable amount of consideration will be extended to visitors to this country during the tourist season at all events.  There is no excuse at all in my opinion for some of the officiousness that is displayed.</P>
    <P>There is another very small item of interest in connection with broadcasting. I was listening on last Christmas Day to what was known as a British Empire broadcast.  It was a link-up of the capitals of the various parts of the British Dominions including the Free State.  I thought it rather remarkable that the Free State was the one Dominion that did not use its national language in that broadcast.  Every other State, including Scotland and Wales, and even French Canada, South Africa, New Zealand&mdash;we had the Maori language&mdash;and India, used its national language.  The one exception was the gentleman who was acting on behalf of the Irish Free State.  His name was mentioned to me, and if the name was correctly given to me, I believe he is an excellent Irish speaker. We had not one line of Irish music or of an Irish song, while each of the other Dominions gave exhibitions of its national language, its music, and its songs.  We ought either to be in that or out of it.  If we are to be in it, I suggest that we might try to do a little more justice to our own country than was done last Christmas Day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to say very much about the general economic policy of the Government.  Like Senator Douglas I appreciated very much the speech of Senator Comyn in which he stated that his Party were alive to the position of the farmers and that the Government ought to do something to improve it.  Might I suggest to the Government that there is only one thing they can possibly do to improve the position of the farmers and that is to try and cultivate better relations with Britain, which is the only market our farmers have got?  If the Government are anxious to improve the position of the farmer, they <Col N="1882" /> will, first, try to improve our foreign relations, our relation towards the King, towards the King's representative and in regard to Dominion status generally?  I cannot help feeling that if the Government showed any disposition for a settlement on the question of the annuities, if they were to accept the spirit of the Constitution and were to come into line with the other Dominions at a round table conference and were to say to Britain: &ldquo;We shall give you privileges on our market with regard to your heavy industries if you will give us privileges as regards our meat on your market,&rdquo; something could be done.  But if this attitude of isolation, this attitude of insult towards the Sovereign is maintained, nothing can be done.  I hope the Minister will realise now that the British have their pride just as much as we have ours.  When the Government places itself in the position in which insult is frequently offered to the British, you cannot expect any improvement in the relations between the two countries.  It is quite impossible to expect that improvement under present conditions, which is a violation of the spirit of the Commonwealth. Unless that spirit is observed I am afraid the farmers will never be able to get rid of their cattle except by means of subsidies, and that is only feeding the industry with a bit of its own tail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to matters of domestic interest, I should like, first of all, to refer to the question of arrears of annuities and the deductions made in respect of them from grants to local authorities.  I have divided the annuities roughly into two periods.  There came a period about the last gale of 1922 and the first gale of 1923 when no annuities were payable at all.  Would the Minister tell us whether all deductions on account of arrears, which really arose prior to the non-payment period, have now been made good?  With regard to the deductions subsequent to the non-payment period, does the old system still apply?  I say that the Minister should have accepted the suggestion previously made in this House and should have done away with this <Col N="1883" /> cumbersome system of deduction. That system could have application only to the British period as an indirect means of collection.  It would be far better to let the local authorities know exactly where they stand. They should not be made responsible for the collection of annuities for the central Government.  The local authorities really have no responsibility in the matter.  They cannot collect the annuities.  They are only made the whipping boy in the matter. In my opinion they will have interminable difficulty in knowing where they stand if they are penalised for the non-payment of annuities for the collection of which they are not responsible.  It is not yet too late for the Minister to try to think out some system by which the chronic confusion which has always existed will be obviated.</P>
    <P>There is another small matter which I suggest ought to be some concern of the Government and that is the terrible scandal of the litter one sees scattered around the country.  Travelling around the coastal borough one sees this litter all the way from Booterstown and nothing seems to be done about it.  All round Kingstown one finds the same conditions.  We really do not get a good example even in Stephen's Green, for which the Government itself is responsible.  I know that it is difficult to do very much by direct action but I think that if the Government went to work, asked the schools to assist them in the matter, showed that they were really in earnest about it, and arranged for a certain amount of publicity, much improvement could be effected.  The local authorities could also give very valuable assistance.  After all, local authorities are being coerced by the Local Government Department in many directions and why they should not be made do their duty in this matter also I cannot see.  I feel that it would be possible, by the employment of plain clothes detectives if necessary, to discover the offenders and to bring prosecutions.  I only hope that the Guards will take serious notice of this scandal in future.  It is a terrible reproach <Col N="1884" /> if the amenities of this fine city are allowed to be spoiled in that way.</P>
    <P>One other matter on which I wish to comment has reference to the Civil Service Commission which is now sitting. Recently a resolution was passed by the Joint Irish Post Office Workers' Union and the Civil Service Clerical Association deciding to take no further part in the deliberations of the Brennan Commission in view of the contents of the interim report signed by the majority of the members of that commission.  That interim report dealt with the question of arbitration. One does not object to fair criticism in these matters but I have been a member of the commission and I am speaking to a certain extent on behalf of other members.  May I hope that Senator Johnson, who is also a member, may speak in regard to this matter?  As I say, one does not object to a fair criticism of the findings, but the resolution passed contained these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the obvious bias displayed by the majority of the members of the commission against arbitration, this meeting records its complete lack of faith in the impartiality of the commission, and resolves to take no part in its deliberations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Norton, a responsible member of the Dáil, was present at the meeting and obviously associated himself with the resolution and spoke in regard to it.  One would not be so much disposed to take notice of statements of that kind made by irresponsible people, but I do not think that in this case, seeing that a person occupying Deputy Norton's responsible position was present, it should pass unnoticed.  It is not that the members of the commission personally mind but it appears to be in the interest of the Government that that sort of thing should not be sanctioned or tolerated.  It is hard enough to get people to give their services for a commission lasting for such a long period&mdash;this commission has been going on for two years now &mdash;but people certainly will not serve on these commissions if they are going to be told by irresponsible bodies that <Col N="1885" /> they have been actuated by bias and partiality.  I do not ask the Minister to take any definite action in the matter but I ask him to dissociate himself on behalf of the Government from references of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer, for a moment, to the speech made by Senator Comyn.  He placed the position of the farming community very well, and directed attention to the loss in the capital value of the farmers' cattle stock, caused by an artificial reduction in prices.  I want to ask the Minister why it was thought necessary to differentiate between manufacturers' exports from this country, and the farmers' exports of fat cattle.  Why was the full amount of the special duties paid by this Government in respect of manufactured articles, and why did they not do the same thing in connection with the exports of the farmer's manufacture, namely, his fat cattle and beef?  Senator Comyn spoke of the condition of the farming community being ever present to the mind of the Minister.  I believe the situation demands that it should be ever present to the minds of the Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin, the position in the country is quite unknown, because in Dublin, as I see it, there is a spurious, transient prosperity brought about by the expenditure of a tremendous amount of borrowed capital which is used, of course, in the necessary production of houses and so on.  But these particular houses are not an economic proposition.  They are subsidised very heavily, and the cost of building is maintained by these artificial subsidies of the Government through borrowed moneys.  The whole prosperity would seem to be artificial and transient, and cannot be carried on if at the same time the purchasing power of the community is depreciated and if the returns from the export of agricultural produce are diminished.  Where you have the whole £4,000,000 cattle stock of the country depreciated in value to the extent of the difference between the special duties and bounties and the price received by the exporter and where that particular amount is taken from the purchasing power of the <Col N="1886" /> majority of the people the difference of that particular loss in the purchasing power of the people will be reflected in everything else.  It ought to be the immediate duty of the Government in office to see that such a state of affairs is rectified as soon as possible. Senator Sir John Keane says the best way to rectify that state of things would be to settle our quarrel with Britain.  I, with a very great inclination towards the question of rectification, believe that on this point the British Minister is antagonistic to our viewpoint of the dispute.  I believe that not a little of the success of the Fianna Fáil Party in the recent election was due to the speech of Sir Neville Chamberlain when talking about this question of the dispute between ourselves and Britain.  At all events the dispute with Britain exists, and I see no way of helping the farmer unless you raise the price of his products. The Government have done that in the case of butter and some other small articles.  They helped a few farmers in wheat growing and they also helped the beet growers and turf cutters.  But there is no real way to help the farming community unless you raise the price of the cattle stock and that can only be done by a settlement of the economic war, or an advance towards that position that you accept in connection with manufactured articles, and do not accept, in regard to the articles manufactured by the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>Following Senator Wilson's remarks, I notice that the British people, at the present moment, are considering the question of a grant to the producers of cattle.  As far as my personal knowledge is concerned, I cannot find out how, as a producer of beef for sale, I can get anything for my fat cattle, or have any right whatever to export cattle abroad.  I had some fat cattle only three or four months ago ready for sale&mdash;perhaps it is hardly fair to bring before the Minister for Finance a matter appertaining to the Minister for Agriculture.  I wrote to the Department of Agriculture and said I had some fat cattle for sale and that <Col N="1887" /> I should like to get an export licence. I did not get an answer for quite a long time, two or three weeks.  Then I got a postcard written in Irish.  I wrote back a polite letter to the Secretary pointing out that I had no Irish, and that if he could get someone who knew English in his office to send me a translation I should be very glad.  The gist of the letter I received &mdash;and it took nearly six weeks, in which time the cattle had to be sold because they were getting too fat&mdash;was that unless I had, during the year before, in that particular month, exported cattle I could not get a licence to send my cattle out now. Can anyone imagine any industry that could be carried on on these lines?  It amounted to this: that the Agricultural Department could not give me a licence to export cattle in June or July, 1934, because in the same months, 1933, I had not exported cattle.  Such a system, to my mind, would amount to the departmental destruction of industry by regulation.  What the British are trying to do is this: the British bounty is to go to the producer of the beast if sold.  There is no such regulation in this country, or at least if there is, I have not been able to get it.  I have been quite unable to get an order from the Department of Agriculture giving me permission to send my cattle abroad for sale.  I have the letter here and it states that unless I exported cattle a year ago in that same month they could not give me a licence.  I have some more fat cattle ready now for sale.  I did not export any cattle last year, so that I cannot export any cattle this year.  What am I to do?  Sell them on the Dublin markets at whatever price I can get? That is all very well.  You can do that, but somebody gets the bounty.  The question is, who gets it?  I certainly do not get it.  The producer of the beast does not know, in a huge number of cases, to whom the bounty paid on his beasts goes.  He certainly does not get it.  Why it is so I do not know.  Senator Douglas said there was trouble over licences of various sorts, and that he thought a list should be <Col N="1888" /> published.  In my opinion, the same thing ought to apply to the cattle trade.  There should be a list published of the licences issued for the export of cattle so that everyone could see it.  We should know who are getting these export licences, and whether the bounty is going to the people who are producing the cattle.  So far as my experience goes, the producer is not getting the bounty.</P>

      <P>It might be better if I were to take, first of all, the charge made, I think, by Senator Miss Browne in regard to the manner in which compensation is being awarded under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1933.  The Senator in that case stated that she knew some person, whose son was in a column, who was awarded £15 compensation, and she wished, I think, the House to understand that there was something wrong, something corrupt, something altogether unjustifiable in the fact that this man had received £15 compensation.  The fact of the matter is that the person in whose favour the judge gave a decree or made a report had to prove his claim in court before the Circuit Court Judge for the district, and the attack which Senator Miss Browne has made was not upon my administration as Minister for Finance, but upon the judge in the discharge of his judicial functions in court.</P>

      <P>That is a matter which has already been determined by the two Houses of the Oireachtas: by this House without any difference of opinion with the Dáil, and has been determined, I think, wisely and well, because it seemed to me that there was a fundamental injustice in the Act of 1923 or 1924 under which people who were alleged to have had sympathy with the republicans of that time were deprived of their right to compensation if their property was destroyed or if it was taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> There were some other matters referred to by Senator Douglas, Senator O'Farrell and Senator Sir John Keane with which perhaps I might also deal at this stage.  Senator Douglas asked whether it was not advisable that a list of licences should be published. While I agree that such a procedure would be desirable, I would say in regard to the Department of Industry and Commerce, which would be the Department primarily responsible for making such a publication, that it has been working under extreme pressure. There is a pronounced shortage of staff in the Department, due to the coming into operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act and to the fact that there have been resignations in the case of some of the senior officials, so that generally the Department is considerably under-manned, particularly in the higher grades.  That is a matter which is causing the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the one hand, and myself on the other, a great deal of concern. While I could not undertake on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that a list of licences would be published at an early date, I agree that it is exceedingly undesirable that rumours of the sort referred to by Senator Douglas&mdash;rumours which, as the Senator himself has been good enough to tell the House, are without foundation&mdash;should be broadcast through the city.  I think it is desirable in the interests of everyone that everything that can be done to prevent that should be done.  I will undertake to bring the matter under the direct attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and endeavour to secure at as early a date as possible the publication of a list of licences granted either by him or by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>On the question of the examination of passenger luggage to which Senator O'Farrell referred, I should like to say that I am afraid that, until our people realise that smuggling is a serious offence and that the Government are determined to take all steps which they possibly can to prevent it, it will be necessary for the rigorous search that is at present being conducted along the frontier and at the various ports to be maintained. <Col N="1890" /> That search has been productive of good results.  Very flagrant cases of smuggling have been detected.  If any Senator has any doubt as to whether such an examination is necessary I would refer him to any shop specialising in the more expensive garments for ladies in the City of Dublin.  We have received complaints from people who are engaged in business in this city, particularly those conducting the more fashionable shops here, pointing out that they pay rent and rates and give employment, and at the same time that it was quite easy for their customers to take a day excursion across the water, collect a parcel at Holyhead and smuggle in here very valuable and very expensive clothes.  I think ladies take a delight in getting things through the Customs.  Very often they do it as a matter of sport because it would seem to me that the amount of duty which they succeed in evading, as compared with the original price of the garment or article, is in some cases comparatively trifling.  They seem to like taking a chance in the matter, and until we have convinced them that the game is not worth the candle and that the chance is not worth taking, I am afraid that the present rigorous examination will have to be conducted.</P>
    <P>I should not like it to go as the opinion of any member of the Seanad or of the Dáil to the officers of the Customs service that the proper way to secure promotion in the Customs service is not by acting rigorously, strictly, efficiently and effectively to prevent smuggling into this country.  I quite agree that Customs officials need not be over-officious, and that these searches can be conducted with tact.  At the same time, that does not mean that if they are conducted in such a way as to cause the minimum of inconvenience to the individual concerned, it will be any barrier to promotion, or any impediment to promotion, in the case of a Customs officer in the service to which he belongs.  Customs officers are appointed to prevent smuggling, and the more efficiently and effectively <Col N="1891" /> they do that the more we are satisfied and the brighter too are their prospects of promotion likely to be.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane asked me whether all arrears belonging to the pre-suspension period, I think he said, had been made good.  I presume by that he means to ask whether all the grants withheld from county councils in respect of arrears which accrued prior to 1932 had been made good.  No; that is not the position.  The position is that, as a result of the Supplementary Agricultural Grant, which was embodied in the Supplementary Estimate passed in the Dáil recently, and is included in the present Appropriation Bill, we are releasing to the county councils as an advance to the Guarantee Fund a sum of £300,000 in anticipation of the collection of the arrears which have been funded over a period of 40 years and which occurred prior to 1932.  There still remains in respect of these funded arrears outstanding something between £200,000 and £250,000.  I should like to point out that this is only an advance to the Guarantee Fund, so that we may be able to release certain of the local taxation and other grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not have been collected.  I do not know whether the Senator would wish me to enlarge on that point, but Deputy Cosgrave in the other House pointed out that during the ten years our predecessors had been in office, while they had succeeded in reducing the amount of land annuity arrears from about £800,000 down to a figure of £300,000, they had never been able to get below that £300,000. I say that that £300,000, outstanding over ten years, was a bad debt which the local authorities had not the remotest prospect of collecting and <Col N="1892" /> that the right thing to do was to write it off.  We have written off that £300,000, and what remains is about £500,000 or £560,000.  In respect of that £560,000, we are making this year an advance of £300,000 to the Guarantee Fund so as to enable the local authorities to reduce their overdrafts with their treasurers.</P>
      <P>On the question of litter, to which the Senator also referred, I think that, with the exception of those parks, which are under the control of the office of Public Works, we have very little power.  The local authorities, I think, have power to make by-laws in regard to these matters and, of course, the enforcement of the by-laws rests with them.  I will draw the attention of the Minister for Local Government to the point which the Senator raised, and ask him to do what he can to ensure either that by-laws are made to deal with the evil or, if such by-laws already exist, to see that they are enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also referred to a statement reflecting on the Civil Service Commission of Inquiry.  I am glad that the Senator gave me the opportunity of making a statement on that subject.  It will be remembered that in 1932 the Government came to the conclusion, in consequence of some expressions of dissatisfaction by organised bodies of civil servants about their official employment, that it would be well that the whole subject of the efficiency, general standing, pay and other conditions of service would be inquired into by a commission of independent persons.  In particular, the Government desired to have the views of the commission as to the methods by which arbitration could best be applied to the settlement of questions relating to pay and other conditions of service.  The commission were asked to report on this first and the report was made last February. For the purpose of making this report, the commission had to take evidence on practically every phase of Civil Service employment which came under their terms of reference.  I am aware that they went most exhaustively into these matters and, in particular, into every aspect of the question of arbitration, on which they heard the views <Col N="1893" /> of official witnesses and of the representatives of the Service organisations, including those by which the resolutions to which Senator Sir John Keane referred have been passed.  Thirty witnesses were examined and the commission devoted 21 days to the hearing of evidence and the consideration of the report on arbitration.</P>
    <P>It must be clear to everyone, therefore, that the commission examined the problem with great patience and great care.  Until my attention was called to the resolutions referred to by Senator Sir John Keane, no suggestion of which I am aware that the commission had gone outside their terms of reference or had shown partiality in dealing with the subject of arbitration had come from any quarter up to the time report was received, and since then no suggestion of any kind was made to me that a full and fair hearing was not given to all persons entitled to be heard or who asked to be heard in evidence that the commission were travelling outside their terms of reference.  This commission, moreover, was presided over by a chairman of great experience in that capacity, who, in addition, has a wide knowledge of the Civil Service, enabling him to appreciate in a particularly high degree the bearing of the questions with which the commission had to deal in making the interim report on arbitration.</P>
    <P>Since the report has been received it has been presented to the Oireachtas and published and has been referred to the staff organisations of the Civil Service for their detailed views which, however, have not been received.  I am sure, however, that any person who, with an open mind, reads the report will agree that the commission have performed their task with thoroughness and impartiality and a desire to give the best help they could towards a solution of a difficult problem.  It gives me pleasure, although the inquiry into the remainder of their terms of reference has yet to be completed, to express my appreciation of the labours and of the services they gave quite gratuitously and at what must have been a considerable sacrifice of time and convenience <Col N="1894" /> on the part of individual members.  I feel that it is only due that I should say that in regard to the labours of this commission which, as Senator Sir John Keane has stated, have extended over a period of almost two years, labours which certain expressions of opinion have shown are thankless, but which, so far as I am concerned, at any rate, are appreciated and valued.</P>
    <P>Senator Jameson referred to the difficulty which he had in procuring a licence for the sale of certain cattle which he had fattened.  There, of course, the difficulty was not of the Minister for Agriculture's making, because, after all, the restrictions have been imposed by Great Britain, and the only thing we can do is to see that, as licences have to be given, they will be given to the people who are best entitled.  As the quotas were undoubtedly based upon our exports in the year preceding this, I am afraid that the licences have to be confined to the people who helped to make the quotas, that is, to the people who exported in the year before this.  I am afraid there is no other way out of it. It may be quite true that the person who was not in a position to export last year is under some disadvantage in so far as he will be compelled to sell his cattle in the Dublin market for home consumption and not for export. That is a position which has been causing the Minister for Agriculture a great deal of concern.  It is a position which, I understand, he will endeavour to rectify in the forthcoming Cattle Bill.  Whether the steps to be taken under that Bill will be effective or not, time will tell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The real trouble is that no ordinary producer of cattle in my position can ever get a licence.  That is the gist of the complaint.  It is a difficulty with which the Minister for Agriculture ought to deal.  I drew attention to the proposal of the British Government to give bounties to the home producers of cattle for sale in Great Britain.  The producer of the cattle is to get the British money, but it is not the producer of the cattle who gets the bounties which the Irish Government give.</P>

      <P>Possibly, the new machinery for the organisation and control of the cattle trade, which will be embodied in the forthcoming Cattle Bill, will do a great deal to relieve the producer of the disadvantages under which he, admittedly, labours at present, whoever may profit by these disadvantages.</P>
      <P>I had better come back to the general question raised in the debate.  In the first place, I should express my regret that so very serious a subject, on which a debate at any time might be very helpful if conducted on a proper, scientific basis, with a desire to elucidate the facts, to make clear the difficulties, and see in what way the difficulties might be overcome, was handled in a rather vague and general fashion.  I do not think that anything could be more characteristic of the general tone of the debate than the opening statement of Senator Counihan himself, that having read the Bill and looked at the estimates on which the Bill is based, he had come to the conclusion that more than half the adult population were in receipt of grants from the State in the form of pensions and other allowances for non-productive work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pensions and salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Senator, thinking that was a happy phrase, launched it at us without examining it or its implications.  The <Col N="1896" /> adult population of the State, if we regard that section as consisting of people over 21 years of age, is more than 1,700,000.  Half of that would be, at least, 850,000 persons.  What is the number of individuals in receipt of Government pay or pensions?  The total number of members of the Gárda and Army and of national teachers and civil servants is about 25,000.  Old age pensioners would number about 119,000. Persons in receipt of unemployment assistance would number about 50,000. The total would, therefore, be about 194,000 persons, many of whom render productive work.  Does the Senator think that the Gárda does not fulfil a very useful function, that he does not contribute to productive work?  Does the Senator think that the teachers or the civil servants, who have in many cases the supervision and control of the great industries of this country, are not as much engaged in productive work as the people who are the hewers of wood and the drawers of water?  The only people in receipt of pensions or pay under the Appropriation Accounts who are not engaged in productive work are the old age pensioners, numbering about 119,000, and the temporarily unemployed, numbering about 50,000.  I do not put these figures forward with any pretence to scientific exactness, but they are approximately correct.  With 194,000 persons in receipt of pensions or pay under the Appropriation Accounts out of an adult population of 1,700,000, one appreciates how ridiculous it is to say that more than half the adult population is living on pensions or pay for non-productive work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator went on to make reference to Mayo.  He referred to a statement I had made, that in a certain year&mdash;this was, I think, how he put it &mdash;99 per cent. of the annuities and 92 per cent. of the rates had been paid in Mayo.  If that is how I am reported in the Debates, I should like to make a correction, because there has been an inversion of the figures.  Ninety-nine per cent. of the rates and over 92 per cent. of the annuities in Mayo had been paid on the last occasion on which I had an opportunity of seeing the figures, but these figures related to the financial <Col N="1897" /> year which closed on the 31st March, 1934.  The Senator went on to say that that was proof that there was no conspiracy in regard to the non-payment of rates, because everybody who could be described as a farmer in Mayo was on the side of the Senator's Party.  In that connection, I should like to point out that it is rather unfortunate that, with the unanimous support of the farming community of Mayo, the Senator's Party was not able to secure a majority on the Mayo County Council.  Senator Comyn referred to the position in North Clare where, out of six seats, the Fianna Fáil Party secured six quotas, though they had put up only five candidates. They could, therefore, have filled all the six seats in North Clare, indicating that those who supported the policy for which Senator Counihan stands were not able to secure one-seventh of the votes.  I am quite certain that the farming mentality of Mayo does not differ very much from the farming mentality of North Clare.  The Senator, I am sure, does not want us to conclude that only one-seventh of the householders of North Clare are farmers and that the remainder of the population follow some occupation other than farming.  However, I do not think that the Senator was correct when he said that the overwhelming majority of the farmers in Mayo were supporters of his policy and that, because they paid, there was no evidence of a conspiracy or attempt at conspiracy to prevent the payment of rates or annuities.  I do not want to enlarge on this subject unduly but I should like to refer the Senator to statements made by Deputies of the Senator's Party on public platforms, and not denied, which would indicate that there had been such a conspiracy. There was, at any rate, a general incitement on the part of leading members of the Senator's Party urging people that they should not pay rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I want to say that the determined policy of the United Ireland Party is <Col N="1898" /> that there is to be no such thing as non-payment of rates or annuities. We have been told over and over again at Party meetings by our advisers that we are not to recommend anybody, not to advise anybody in private or in public life, to refuse to pay rates or annuities.  The Minister knows perfectly well that what he is saying now is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, Senator Miss Browne.  I would like to make another point.  I might mention that it is not to carry on anything in the nature of a polemical discussion that I raise these matters.  I am merely anxious that the Seanad should appreciate the point of view of a person who is not a farmer, but who sometimes comes in contact with farmers, and how his outlook on the present situation may possibly be coloured by what is said to him.  As <Col N="1899" /> the Senator said, I know a farmer personally in South Tipperary and he told me&mdash;and I thought I was being told the truth&mdash;that his position at the end of the year 1933 was better than it was in 1932 and was better than it was in 1931.  The Senator asks me what class of a farmer he was.  I know he is a farmer with £50 valuation. They are people who work the farm well.  They are a very industrious family and very intelligent people. They work the farm in the ordinary way that the South Tipperary farmers work their land.  They breed and rear cattle and make and sell their own butter.  In 1933 they grew wheat&mdash;I do not know how many acres&mdash;in a purely experimental way.  This year they propose to grow beet.  They rear turkeys and poultry.  That farmer told me they had a very good year in 1933.  That is all I can say.  I have indicated to the Senator as well as I can the type of farming which they undertook.</P>
      <P>I will leave that and come to the kernel of the whole position and that is in what way is the present plight of the Irish farmer inevitable and in what way has it been accentuated by the dispute between ourselves and Great Britain as to the non-payment of the annuities.  In that connection I do not think any person who is anxious to help the nation to pull along in the present position is entitled to disregard the statements made by responsible people in Great Britain and by responsible organs of the Press in Great Britain.  The first thing I should like to point out is that the British Minister of Agriculture, speaking in the House of Commons on the 15th February last &mdash;and that is not too remote to have a bearing on the present situation&mdash;disclaimed most emphatically that the quota restrictions were imposed for a political purpose or that in imposing them he wished to bring undue pressure on us to settle the land annuity dispute upon British terms.  I will quote his own words.  This is a quotation from the newspapers:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In the British House of Commons, Mr. Walter Elliott, Minister for Agriculture, moving that the House approve the Cattle Import <Col N="1900" /> Regulation Order of 1933, which reduces the imports of fat stock from the Free State by 50 per cent., said that if the Government had not restricted Free State exports in December it was absolutely certain that there would have been a catastrophic decline in the price of British home produced live stock.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was proved absolutely false since, and it was so admitted by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The quotation goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government were accused of endangering the relations between Britain and the Free State.  The measure was not dictated by any desires of political expediency but by stern facts of economic necessity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what the Minister of Agriculture said.  The Senator has declared that that statement has been proved to be false since and was admitted to be by the Minister.  I presume he refers to the Minister of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection I think we are entitled to take into consideration the statement made by Mr. Baldwin and referred to by Senator Dowdall.  It appeared in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> of Monday, June 25th.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There were two or three problems which hitherto had defeated all attempts to solve them.  The potato problem was a difficult one, but he thought they were through the worst of that.  Live stock had, indeed, been a difficulty.  Two years ago there came a complete collapse in world prices, perhaps a greater collapse than there was of wheat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senators will observe, not a complete collapse in prices in the Free State. He does not limit the extent of the depression to the Free State.  He says a complete collapse in world prices, and he goes on:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Action had to be taken very quickly and so by a voluntary agreement the imports of chilled beef and frozen meat of all kinds were cut <Col N="1901" /> down.  It was a curious thing that so far as mutton and lamb were concerned the steps they took were successful beyond their hopes.  But that had not been the case with cattle.  That had been a real difficulty and was causing great anxiety in all those parts of the country that relied principally upon the raising of fat stock.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan in his interruption stated that the British Minister of Agriculture had admitted that something was not true.  The first of the two things the British Minister said was that if it had not been for the restrictions there would have been a catastrophic decline in prices.  The second thing he said was that the restrictions had not been imposed upon the Free State for political purposes. To which of these does the Senator refer when he says the Minister admitted the statement was not true? If it is the first of them, there is Mr. Baldwin's more recent statement emphasising that there had been a collapse and that steps the British had taken, even in December of last year, had not been successful in repairing that collapse and had not even succeeded in maintaining prices.  The other statement which Mr. Elliott made was that the restrictions had not been imposed for any political purposes.  I have not seen any retraction of that.  On the contrary, I have seen a confirmation of it in the statement to which Senator Wilson referred, the statement made by Mr. Neville Chamberlain, that even if the dispute about the land annuities were terminated tomorrow these restrictions and these import duties would possibly continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>

I am merely putting the facts before the <Col N="1902" /> Senator in the hope that he will consider them calmly and quietly when he goes home, and that other people, to whose notice these facts are brought, will also consider them, so that we may realise, once and for all, that the land annuities, while, possibly, they may have given the British an opportunity for taking the steps which they would have taken sooner or later, have very little bearing at the present moment on the position of the cattle trade.</P>

Are we taking part in any of the negotiations that are going on?  If we are doing so, it is practical politics if somebody is trying to get a bigger quota for us as compared with the Argentine or any other country.  Is our case being pushed irrespective of the economic war and are we fighting for a quota?</P>

The Irish Free State High Commissioner in London has been present at the conference which has been taking place between the British Minister of Agriculture and the British Secretary for the Dominions on the one hand and the exporters of cattle and meat to Great Britain on the other, in connection with the whole question of the cattle restrictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that I would like the Minister to make more clear.  After all, he says, even if this question between the two countries were settled, England would still continue to quota our market.  After all, we are one of the largest consumers England has, and the Argentine is a very small consumer of England's products.  Out of 600,000 tons, apparently, our quota, at best, is only about 6 per cent.  If a settlement were come to, is it not quite possible that England would be very glad, instead of reducing the consumption that she at present takes from Ireland or that she ever took, rather to increase it?</P>

      <P>I can only deal with what they themselves have said in this regard.  I was dealing with the point that the restrictions had been imposed, not for a political reason, but for an economic reason; that they had been occasioned mainly by the fall in world prices of meat which had hit the British home producer particularly hard.  What occasioned the fall in prices?  There was world depression, which meant that, possibly, people had turned away from meat to other and cheaper foods; but, so far as Great Britain is concerned, there are two very eminent authorities on this matter. One is Mr. Baldwin, who represents and has represented for a considerable number of years, an overwhelmingly agricultural constituency&mdash;the constituency of Worcester, I think&mdash;and he, in the course of the speech to which I have already referred, dealing with the case of the cattle, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That had been a real difficulty and was causing great anxiety in all those parts of the country that relied principally upon the raising of fat stock.  They had to remember that tastes were changing.  There was no doubt that there was little demand for beef in this country...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was referring to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;... and there was no doubt that <Col N="1904" /> the modern housewife demanded a smaller joint than was principally produced in the trade at present in England.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, the trade for which all our stores are bred, and there we have the change in taste to take into account. I may leave that for a moment, however, to refer to an article in <i>The Times</i> on the same date, in which this passage occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is no wonder then that there has been a further reduction in the value of fat cattle during the past year.  Another adverse factor has been the tendency of public taste to turn from roast beef to lamb, veal and cooked meats.  Most butchers will say that beef is now a smaller proportion of their sales than it was five or ten years ago.  In these circumstances, the market cannot stand the present heavy rate of importation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we come to the real kernel of the matter, because it is quite clear that the present low price on the British market is due to a change in public taste in Great Britain and to the fact, as <i>The Times</i> admits, and it is probably the most authoritative organ of public opinion in regard to this matter, that the public taste is changing from roast beef to lamb, veal and cooked meats.  This change in taste has got nothing whatsoever to do with the land annuities, and, whether we pay the land annuities or not, the British would have to take steps to deal with that change in taste, and the step they propose to take in order to deal with it is to shut out more and more the foreigner from the British market and to preserve that declining market&mdash;because that is what it now is &mdash;for their home producers.</P>

      <P>Yes, including the parts of the Commonwealth, but even they can claim no special exemption in this matter because&mdash;once again I am quoting from <i>The Times</i> of Monday, June 25th, 1934:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Both Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Elliott have made it clear that <Col N="1905" /> further steps are to be taken to safeguard the interests of the beef producer, and it is expected that the Government's proposals will be announced before Parliament rises next month.  The matter is urgent and the time is ripe for action. Prices for beef cattle have been drifting from bad to worse despite the Ottawa agreements, which, so far as meat is concerned, will have run their time on June 30th.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is a clear indication that as soon as the agreements expire, the Dominions' exports to Great Britain as well as the rest are going to come under the axe, and that the only question which remains is the extent to which they will be cut down.  The other vital element in this matter is the interest which Great Britain has in the Dominions on the one hand and in other producing countries outside the Commonwealth on the other hand, and which of these is the greater.</P>

      <P>I have seen recently a statistical calculation as to the value of the British investments in the Argentine.  They are stated to be worth not less than £500,000,000 invested in railways, in cattle farms, in ships, but every single investment depending for its security and for its dividends upon the trade of the Argentine.  What investment has Great Britain in this country commensurate with the £500,000,000 she has invested in the Argentine?  What investment has she in Canada, Australia, New Zealand or in any one of the Dominions that is half as much as that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, trade is a give-and-take bargain, but the interest on that £500,000,000 must be met out of the profits of the Argentine meat industry, and if it does not pay that interest in money and in kind&mdash;in money and in the export of cattle to Great Britain, and if Great Britain does not take payment in kind, which is to say mainly cattle imported into Great Britain from the Argentine, then she has to forgo her dividends altogether. <Col N="1906" /> The point I am making is this&mdash;and it does not matter what our political relations with Great Britain are&mdash;when she looks at this position as a whole, we and the Dominions will have a hard struggle to maintain our position in the British market against Argentine meat; and if anybody is to go to the wall it will be the Dominions rather than the Argentine trade.  I say that because, as we have often been told here, the British, when they come to consider matters of this kind, look at them in a commonsense way, without permitting any sentiment and without allowing politics to enter into a business question.</P>

      <P>Under the Argentine Agreement the Argentine trade is protected, but, since the Ottawa Agreement expired on June 30th, the Commonwealth position is unprotected and we, with the other members of the Commonwealth, have to face that position, and have got to take steps to reorganise our cattle trade.  One of the steps we have to take here is to meet, first of all, a total decline in the consumption of meat in Great Britain, and, secondly, the fact that they are looking there for smaller beasts.  In any event, in relation to the whole of this matter, we must remember that so long as the British are concerned to maintain the home market for their own producers, while we may have our share reduced, we, at the same time, are the only country that can supply them with the raw material to maintain their beef production. We enjoy that advantage irrespective of what our political relations with Great Britain may be, and, as we have already been told, the British, when they come to consider these matters, look at them in a practical, commonsense way.  They look at them in a practical way and, I think, with a great deal more foresight than we do.  They take a much longer view than is taken here by some people in the country who think we can get out of this difficulty by making <Col N="1907" /> the quickest and most short-sighted bargain so long as it is some sort of a settlement.</P>
      <P>We have a special peculiar relation to Great Britain of strategic importance. We are a very vital element in their food supply.  If they eliminate us I do not see how they are going to face the vicissitudes of the future with any security or assurance.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane urged that we should cultivate better relations with Great Britain, in order to bring this dispute to an end.  He states that for this purpose we should make the full acceptance of the Commonwealth position.  I think we ought to rid ourselves of old prejudices and old obsessions with regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government is only representative of the majority of the people and the whole history of this country, not merely for the past year or two years or the past ten years but for all the generations that have gone before us is this: that even though it may entail great economic suffering, the mass of the people are not prepared for the full acceptance of the Commonwealth in the way in which Senator Sir John Keane, and others who think like him, conceive it.  I think that is the fundamental fact which we cannot leave out of consideration when dealing with this matter, and which no Party in this House or in the country can afford to leave out of consideration in dealing with the matter.  The one thing we have to do is for all of us to align ourselves with the majority of the people in this regard and stand upon the fundamental principle that our people must be free to choose for themselves what their relations with the Commonwealth are to be. And in order that they should make that choice freely, in order that there should be no doubt about the freedom of choice, perhaps the best way to settle it is to put them in the position of complete independence with regard to the Commonwealth and then let the people of Great Britain, on the one hand and we, on the other, negotiate as to what our future relations are to be.  If there was some approach to that position on the part of the people <Col N="1908" /> who differ from the present Government, we should all press that freedom of choice should be given to us and that we should get an unequivocal answer to the request which President de Valera addressed to the Secretary for the Dominions in December last in regard to it, that if to that request we demand that we get an unequivocal reply stating that if we exercise the choice of going out of the Commonwealth, we shall not be subjected to economic or military coercion, then that there would be some possibility of getting a settlement which would be a lasting settlement and which would be as satisfactory for the people on the other side as for us.</P>

    <Title>University College, Dublin, Bill, 1934&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Seanad is probably aware, the present State endowment of University College, Dublin, for the general purposes of the College is £82,000 per annum.  There is, in addition, payable to the College for the purposes of the Faculty of General Agriculture, an annual sum, not exceeding £24,984.</P>
      <P>In November of 1931 the then Minister for Finance, on behalf of the Executive Council, gave an under taking to a deputation from University College, Dublin, that the Government would provide, within a maximum of £3,000 per annum, the salaries and extra outlay falling on the College in the reorganisation and expansion of the Department of Modern Irish.  The substance of this under taking was subsequently confirmed by the present Government.  This Bill is introduced to give effect to that confirmation.</P>
      <P>I may say that as a consequence of the discussion which took place in regard to the undertaking the College authorities have agreed to make arangements to bring a knowledge of spoken Irish to a satisfactory standard in the case of students of the College who desire to be admitted to degrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> The Academic Council have adopted the proposal providing that in future no student of the College will be admitted to degrees in Arts, Commerce, Science or Agricultural Science until he or she has passed such oral examination in Irish as will ensure that he or she can speak Irish correctly and (2) that no student will be admitted to a degree in the professional faculties of Medicine, Engineering, Dentistry and Architecture until he or she has passed such oral examination in Irish as will ensure that the student can carry on a conversation in Irish on simple topics. As students in the Faculty of Law must first take an Arts degree, they must, accordingly, fulfil the conditions for Art students.  I should like to point out that exemption from these conditions may be necessary in the case of a small number of foreign students. They, accordingly, will be made.  The House may observe that the preamble to the Bill recites the fact that the governing body has agreed to make such provisions.  The preamble, however, has no executive effect but places on record the facts and circumstances in which the Bill has origin and serves as a recognition of the steps taken by the governing body of the college to increase the use of Irish in the curriculum.  As I have already said, the undertaking in which this Bill has its origin was given by my predecessor in November, 1931, was confirmed by the present Government and this measure is introduced in fulfilment of these pledges.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the motion.  Perhaps I am one of the few people here, if there be any other, who have been through this agitation on the subject of Irish in the University from the beginning&mdash;I should say the Cathaoirleach, too.  I remember I was on the Coiste Gnotha of the Gaelic League some years ago, when the question of establishing a University College in this country arose.  It was late at night and we discussed the matter at length.  We passed a resolution, which we had very little hope of succeeding in at the time, that we should not recognise <Col N="1910" /> the University unless Irish was a compulsory subject.  I remember leaving the room that night thinking that it was very fine to be brave in these matters but I did not quite know how we were going to carry it out. I am talking in rather an historical way.  Two or three days afterwards, it happened that a certain very respected Jesuit wrote an article in the paper saying that to propose such a thing as compulsory Irish in the University was perfect madness and that it was impossible to carry it out. That was the more remarkable because he was himself an advocate of Irish, generally speaking.  The matter began to spread through the country and for several months it was almost the only subject considered in Ireland.  It took the fancy of the country and there was correspondence in the newspapers about it and the people thought of almost nothing else.  The next thing that happened was an assemblage of the Archbishops and the Committee of Bishops who passed a resolution stating that anyone who proposed such a motion as compulsory Irish in the University was&mdash;I forget the term used but, at any rate, was not a good citizen and probably not a good Catholic.  Amongst those people was myself and I found that I was spoken of very badly by a great many people who had been my friends and all sorts of crimes were attributed to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pursued our subject without faltering in spite of all these animosities. I remember that a Minister who was over here at the time said that he did not think the Irish people were such fools as to adopt such a ridiculous motion.  They were all against us but we fought our battle right through. We did not mind what the Bishops said or what anybody said and the longer we fought, the better we got on. Finally, a meeting of the Senate of the University took place at which this question was considered, and a curious thing happened when it came to a vote.  The Senate was divided evenly into two sections, for and against.  The Chancellor of the University at the time was Archbishop Walsh, who had headed the resolution of the Bishops which said that it was ridiculous and improper to propose <Col N="1911" /> such a thing as compulsory Irish in the University.  It came to a division and he was asked to give his casting vote and in spite of what he had said before, in the resolution of the Bishops, he voted in favour of compulsory Irish.  I mention those facts because they are matters of history and everybody does not remember them.</P>
    <P>We have now taken another step. Not only is Irish to be compulsory for the young people entering the University, but it is practically necessary for the whole University.  That shows how the motion has moved on from being a hopeless case into being practically admitted by everyone in this country at present.  I do not expect that there will be any objection to the money which is being expended for this purpose.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1915" /> This division of the old constituencies and the splitting up of counties is very unpopular amongst the voters of these areas.  The Schedule which we are proposing leaves the constituencies practically as they were for the past ten years and I may say that during the last two elections, those constituencies worked very well for the Government Party.  I cannot see why they should be so anxious to make this change in them.  In working out this Schedule, we have tried to give equal representation to every constituency and it works out at about 20,000 of the population for every member.  In only one constituency, Longford-Westmeath, it works out at 24,000 of the population per member.  We have preserved the historical boundaries of each county, and, where necessary, we have put two counties into one constituency.  In the Schedule of the Bill as it stands there are 15 three-member constituencies, but in our Schedule there are only four three-member constituencies and six four-member constituencies.  The proposal in the Bill to cut down constituencies to such an extent that you have so many three and four-member constituencies looks very like gerrymandering. At all events, it will do away with any effects which proportional representation might have at elections, and will deprive minorities of any voice in the making of laws and regulations.  I hope the Seanad will adopt the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three reasons why the amendment is preferable to the Schedule put forward by the Ministry. The amendment maintains the entity of historical counties.  There is no such thing as cutting out Carlow, as the Bill proposes, and substituting a hybrid, especially like Athlone-Longford, or taking a piece off Galway and putting it into Clare, and a bit off Cork and putting it into Waterford.  All that is avoided in the amendment.  I do not believe there is any gerrymandering in the Bill, but there is an attempt by the Minister to produce constituencies in which there are 20,000 voters.  Undue emphasis is placed on the words in the Constitution on that point, neglecting <Col N="1916" /> the fact that the Constitution implicitly held that historical boundaries were the premier and the vital thing, rather than the exact number of heads.  The wording of the Constitution is that &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; that standard should be kept to.  There is a variation in the proposed Schedule of 20,000 odd in the case of Limerick to 24,000 odd in Clare.  I maintain that there is not such a very great difference, and that that result is in accordance with the Constitution, and maintains the boundaries of the counties. It is agreed that proportional representation is beneficial to the country, but we know that in a large constituency the success of a minority representation is inherent as against the position in a small constituency.  I was a candidate in both classes of constituencies. In 1922 I was elected in Kildare-Wicklow and later Wicklow, once or twice, and although I had a strong body of people at my back I was elected on a minority vote.  A minority with such strength has a right under proportional representation to a representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure no one can suggest that the proposed schedule can in any way give rise to gerrymandering.  I do not believe that the Minister's attempt is a gerrymandering one.  I believe he was obsessed with the idea of getting exactly 20,000 voters in constituencies. A man in the country considers that his voting power should be greater than that of a town dweller.  I know that that will not be agreed to generally, and I do not want to discuss the question here, as it is open to argument. I remember that when I was an elector in Africa in the early days, the voting strength of a farmer was about six times the voting strength of an elector in an urban area.  The position I would like to see here is that there should not be this lip-service to proportional representation.  If we are going to have proportional representation let us have it on a scale that will give the best results.  That is the reason that we are against having unwieldy constituencies. If they are not unwieldy, minorities will see that their adherents come forward, and the best results will be secured.  I hope the Minister will accept the <Col N="1917" /> amendment, and in that way do away with the slashing of the boundaries of old historical counties.  If possible he should try to reconcile the fact that the Ministry are insisting in games, at all events, on the rivalry of one county with another.  In the Bill they are slashing up Carlow and putting bits of other counties here and there, producing a hotch-potch.  As that was not what was intended by the Constitution, I hope the House will support the amendment, as being preferable, and one that will produce the best results for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  There are two serious objections to the Schedule in the Bill. The first is that it splits up counties in at least six cases, and annihilates as a political entity Carlow altogether. The second serious objection is that it doubles the number of three and four-member constituencies.  As to the splitting up of counties, that seems to me to be a wanton proceeding.  I am not going to talk about sentiment, which is very natural, as no county likes to have its identity altered. Splitting up of counties in this way is actually injurious.  These counties are ancient political units and have grown to have their own peculiar local interests.  If you split up a county, take away part of it and add it to another county, you introduce the broken part of that county into a unit where there are different local interests.  The same occurs <i>vice versa.</i> I should like if the Minister would tell us exactly why these counties have been split up in this way.  It cannot have been for the mere purpose of getting a sort of equality in the number of electors that there will be in each.  The amendment has that result, I think, even more perfectly than the Schedule in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have got the figures of the number of population per proposed member. In the schedule that we propose to substitute for the Schedule of the Bill, the largest number per member is 23,776 and the smallest number 20,145.  The figures, roughly, are 21,000, 20,000, 22,000, and up to 23,000.  Therefore, as far as the equality in the number of <Col N="1918" /> population to each member is concerned, the Schedule in the amendment is quite as reasonable as the Schedule in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The more serious objection of the two is the objection that the Schedule to the Bill doubles the number of three and four-member constituencies.  In the first place, in my opinion it is absolutely unconstitutional.  Article 26 of the Constitution declares that the members of the Dáil shall be elected by proportional representation.  Proportional representation does not work so as to have its proper effect in three-member constituencies.  It works imperfectly even in four-member constituencies. In a three-member constituency the only Parties who get their fair share of representation are the large Parties in the country.  The real minority is not protected at all by proportional representation in a three-member constituency.  In a four-member constituency it does not work quite as badly, but even there the system does not work so as to have its proper effect.  By this Bill the Government has just doubled the number of three and four-member constituencies.  There are at present eight three-member constituencies. In the Bill there are 14, that is six more three-member constituencies in which the real minority will have no chance at all.  As to the four-member constituencies, there are at present three.  In the Bill there are eight.  In the Bill there are 22 small constituencies as against 11 existing at present.  That is, the Government have just doubled the number.  That is, in my opinion, a breach of the spirit of the Constitution.  It is the kind of breach that is really more dangerous and more injurious than an actual breach of the letter of the Constitution which can be dealt with by the courts.  I am sure the House will listen with interest to the explanation which the Minister will give us of the reasons, first, for mutilating the counties, and secondly, for increasing the number of three and four-member constituencies, especially the three-member constituencies.</P>

      <P>It is very pleasant to come to discuss a measure which really does not involve Party politics.  Before <Col N="1919" /> I say what I have to say, I should like to express regret&mdash;I do not know who is responsible for it&mdash;that it has become necessary to reduce by this measure the number of members in the Dáil. It cannot be on the score of economy. The saving of £7,000 a year, or whatever the amount may be that 15 members would cost, is no justification for disfranchising a great number of people and it gives a mean flavour, in my opinion, to the entire body which we represent.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>A lot of people are under the impression that it is.  I for one do not think that in every respect it is perfect.  If it is not too late, I would urge on the Minister that, by agreement, it might be found possible to retain the number of members at present in the Dáil.  I would point out that I am not at all personally interested in this matter.  I assure you I have not the least notion of going forward in any constituency myself.  It does not make the least difference to me, but I do think it very probable that by reducing the membership it is more than likely that three or four very valuable additions to the Dáil might be left out of the Assembly.  I thoroughly endorse everything Senator Brown has said.  I think if we are to have proportional representation that the larger the constituencies, or the greater the number of members in each constituency, the better chance of representation every interest would have. However, it was not to speak of that that I intruded in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main purpose is to protest against the proposal that portion of the County Cork should be summarily snatched from us and handed over to another county.  I may tell you that that particular portion of the County Cork has probably the most authentic history of any portion of the county. We all know that tobacco, whether it was good or bad for the country, was first smoked in Youghal.  We all know, <Col N="1920" /> equally, that the first potato&mdash;whether potatoes have been a success or not in this country I am not prepared to say&mdash;ever grown in Ireland was grown in Youghal.  Youghal, being in Cork, we felt a little bit of pleasure and pride in being able to assert that in our county two very important experiments were successfully carried out which have since affected the whole progress of the world.  Now we are going to hand over that portion of the constituency to another county.  What is the effect of that?  It is as if they were going to put us in with the County Kerry.  A friend of mine reminded me that we built a pass between Cork and Kerry recently and on that pass there is a huge stone. That stone is known in the locality as &ldquo;the coffin stone,&rdquo; because in the old days if a Kerryman died in Cork his body would be taken by Corkmen to that stone.  If a Corkman died in Kerry the Kerrymen reciprocated the compliment.  The inhabitants of either county were not particularly enamoured of the inhabitants of the other.  Therefore, it is only reasonable&mdash;I am sorry my friend Senator O'Sullivan is not here to bear me out&mdash;that if you tack on to County Kerry a small angle of the County Cork, or if you tack on to County Waterford a small angle of the County Cork, that any man going forward in the interests of the people of Cork will not succeed in getting votes from those in other counties.  I admit, straightway, there is no gerrymandering in this Bill.  Everyone realises that no one in a county could forecast how the people are going to vote.  I do not say it is for any special purpose that these changes are made, but I do say that the old historical boundaries of the counties should be maintained. While you may mix up one entire county with another entire county, I think it is absolutely wrong to amputate portion of one county and tack it on to another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have acted in a strictly constitutional manner in introducing this Bill.  The Constitution compels the Government to introduce such a measure as this. The Bill, as introduced by the Minister <Col N="1921" /> for Local Government, in my opinion, was a far better Bill than the Bill as it now stands.  It was no fault of the Department of Local Government that the members of the Dáil mutilated this Bill, and made it, in a good many respects, most illogical.  The Minister's original Bill went very deeply into the subject, and dealt with it on a commonsense basis; but owing to the action of the different parties in the Dáil, the Bill sent up to the Seanad is very illogical.  They have left some large counties intact, but they have carved other counties up.  They divided the constituency of Dublin North City into two, and left Dublin South City intact. The whole thing is a hotch-potch for which neither the Government nor the Minister in charge is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real fact we have to consider is this: that the arrangement of the constituencies to elect their representatives to the Dáil is primarily a matter for the members of the Dáil itself.  I do not think it ought to be the function of the Seanad to attempt to interfere with whatever decisions have been arrived at by the Dáil on this matter.  I admit that some of the decisions arrived at by the Dáil could not be sustained, from any logical point of view.  There is no use talking about historical boundaries in connection with this question.  The Government were compelled, under the Constitution, to produce a Bill, and they have done it to the best of their ability.  I think it is going back to the parish pump idea to suggest that one fellow, looking from one side of a bridge, has not the same outlook on affairs as his neighbour upon the other side of the bridge.  Then there is talk about people being disfranchised by this Bill.  No one is disfranchised. Everyone who had a vote before will continue to have a vote now.  They will have the same right to vote for the election of their representative.  The representation may be changed, but it is not the Government, or the Ministry, that makes that change.  The Constitution compels them to make that change. Senator Jameson shakes his head at that, but if he reads the Constitution he will see that the Government are compelled to alter the representation of the constituencies.  I do not say <Col N="1922" /> they were compelled to do it in the way it is done under this Bill, but they were compelled to introduce a measure of this kind.  It was the members of the Dáil who altered the measure and sent it before us in its present shape. If Senators compare the Bill as originally drafted and presented by the Minister for Local Government, on behalf of the Ministry, they will find very radical changes have been made in it as compared with the original Bill. I repeat that I think it is not one of the functions of this Assembly to alter what has been done by the Dáil in regard to this Bill.  It is primarily a matter for the Dáil.  They have sent up the Bill to this House, and I think it is not our function to alter it.  I understand the farmers' representatives in the Dáil took the point of view that Senator Wilson has taken here, and said that every agriculturist in the country should have six votes to one for every town dweller.  I do not know how that would be received here.  I hope we are far away from the stage that one agriculturist in the country would be considered as good as six city men.  As a city man I never will admit that, and I never will be prepared to say that the agriculturist should have six votes against one for the manual worker in the town.</P>
    <P>Senator Brown's main argument was against the increase in the number of three and four member constituencies. The basis of his argument, in that respect, was that you cannot apply proportional representation in its fuller sense to these constituencies.  It is an extraordinary thing, but it is nevertheless an historical fact, that in three-member constituencies, proportional representation has been maintained better than in the larger member constituencies. That is perfectly true.  If Senators examine the constituencies in the country and look at the results, from 1922 onward, they will find that three-member constituencies gave the best results as far as proportional representation is concerned.  Personally, I would prefer five-member constituencies if that could be arranged. But I cannot see any force in the argument of Senator Brown that you cannot have fair play in regard to proportional <Col N="1923" /> representation in three-member constituencies, especially if you take into consideration this important fact, that a minority of 26 per cent. in three-member constituencies cannot be kept out of representation.  That is, undoubtedly, true.  A minority of 26 per cent. of the electorate in any three-member constituency cannot be kept out of the representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-six per cent. is a reasonable minority, I say, to have representation.  You cannot provide representation for every 10 or 15 per cent. of the population.  But when 26 per cent. of the population can get representation, I think that is going a long way to meet the claim of proportional representation.  I said before, on Second Reading, and I say again now, in my opinion, if it were possible five-member constituencies would be best, but in all the circumstances, I am satisfied, from observation and knowledge of what happened at the elections in this country, in recent years, that it is not true to say that three-member constituencies do not give fair play to proportional representation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always a certain amount of sympathy with those who make historical references here, but in connection with the historical references made on this Bill I should like to point out that none of the Counties, as we know them, is of Gaelic origin.  They have nothing to do with ancient Ireland.  Take the King's County and the Queen's County.  They were established in Tudor times.  Some of the others were lopped off from the original tribal system and established as counties.  If Senators want to go back at all, why not go back to the baronies.  Many of these baronies have lapsed during the last few years.  I suggest that we should do away with the divisions that were made for their own purposes and their own objects by the Tudors and others who came into this country from over the water.  Why should we fix our system on what they did?  Let us establish it according to the old Gaelic arrangement.  I do not <Col N="1924" /> see that very much is going to be gained by the proposal in the amendment. What we really want is good government&mdash;to get elected the best Government that we can for the sake of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I put my name down as supporting this amendment, not because I consider myself an expert and able to argue that every single detail in it could not be improved, but because its general principles seem to be a definite improvement on the general principles in the Schedule that came to us from the Dáil.  I should like, first of all, to deal with the general argument of Senator Farren. He seems to think that the form of the constituencies, the number of members, the general question of fair play and a satisfactory method of election are primarily matters for the Dáil, and that, therefore, we should not interfere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator says that the alteration of the constituencies is primarily a matter for the members of the Dáil.  It is on that that I want emphatically to join issue with him. An alteration of the constituencies could easily mean an alteration in the representation of the people.  Senator Colonel Moore is, to my mind, perfectly right when he says that the exact details of this are relatively unimportant: that what is wanted are constituencies which will give us good government. Now that good government is primarily a matter for the Dáil I do not accept for one moment.  I should go further and say that the arrangement of the constituencies is precisely one of the matters on which the Dáil is scarcely fit to form an absolutely fair opinion.  If Senator Farren will go through the Dáil debates&mdash;I did not read them all myself, but I did read some of them&mdash;I think he will find that my impression is not very far wrong. The impression that I got was this: that when you wanted to carve up a constituency all the members for that constituency, of both Parties, voted against it, but the other members of the House combined were able to form <Col N="1925" /> a sufficient majority to do it over their heads.  Therefore, if anybody says that the members of the Dáil are the people who are primarily interested in this, I do not accept that for a moment. I think that with more reason one might say that the members for a particular constituency were primarily interested.  If you take that view you will find it almost impossible, except in very few cases, judging by the discussion that went on in the Dáil, to justify the Schedule that has come to us.</P>
      <P>I do not think that this ought to be a Party matter at all, one on which you should have fights between the two Houses or anything of that kind.  I do think it is just the kind of measure when you have a Second Chamber which is not, in the personal sense, primarily interested in it&mdash;it is equally interested in it with the Dáil from the point of view of getting satisfactory constituencies&mdash;that we ought to examine carefully and see if we cannot produce something better, something more consistent that may possibly meet with the general collective approval of the Dáil.  As regards this measure, both the supporters and the opponents of the present majority in the Dáil seem to me to be agreed in suggesting that the Dáil has not come very creditably out of it on the Committee and Report Stages.  I do not know if this measure had originated in the Seanad, each Senator being allowed to follow his own way in changing each particular constituency, new scheme or method, that we would have done any better than the Dáil.  You would have some very extraordinary things carried as regards some constituencies and nothing done in the case of others.  I am afraid we would not have done much better than the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that in this new Schedule we have something which in principle is a very definite improvement on the Bill.  In general I agree with the arguments used by Senator Brown.  I would like to develop them a little bit further because this is a matter on which I feel rather strongly.  Senator Farren said that every person would still have a vote, and that there was no disfranchisement.  Of course, that is true.  He said that the people <Col N="1926" /> would have the same chance in every case as before.  That is only what I should call quarter true, because, as was very well illustrated in his own case by Senator Wilson, a small minority may have a very fair chance of getting one member in a constituency of seven, but if that constituency be divided up into a three-member and a four-member constituency, that small minority gets no chance at all unless the one-eighth, which would be sufficient in the case of a seven-member constituency, all happen to reside in either the new three-member or the new four-member constituency.</P>
    <P>There is nothing that would be further from my mind than to suggest that we have, or ought to have in any sense, a religious minority which would act politically in this country.  I have been, leaving out actual present day affairs, in sympathy with the majority politically since I was a young man. From the religious point of view I am in a tiny little minority of about 2,500 persons, people who could not, even if they wanted to, act politically &mdash;I am glad to say they do not&mdash;and who could not get representation under any of these schemes.  It happens that a considerable number of people who compose the religious minority have an outlook, or imagine they have an outlook, based on traditions in the past, and it is to my mind essential, in the interests of good government, that we should get elected to the Dáil some small proportion of those people.  It is important from the point of view of good government in the Twenty-Six Counties, and to my mind, from the point of view of ultimately ending Partition, it is essential.</P>
    <P>What does this new scheme do? There is one constituency in which, by accident, that minority happens to be fairly strong.  That is in the County Dublin.  In the County Dublin, even if they stood alone, which I hope they they never will and ought not to do, if they decided to put up Independent members they have the chance of one and probably of two seats.  Otherwise, this minority is spread all over the country <Col N="1927" /> in small numbers.  Taking them as a whole, they are certainly entitled to and ought to get a few members in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Under this Schedule, with the one exception of County Dublin, I cannot see that they will be likely to get a member anywhere.  Why?  Senator Farren stated that 26 per cent. is magnificent.  But 26 per cent. is not sufficient, because you do not get 26 per cent. of this minority, except in the one place I have mentioned, living together.  Under the system we have at present in many constituencies all you require is one-eighth.  I maintain that if you change from one-eighth to one-fourth in many places you are definitely reducing the chances of a minority getting representation.  If I were spokesman here for either of the two big main Parties, and if my one concern was to get a good, strong, pledge-bound representation of members of whoever happened to be in the majority, I would not only support the Bill, in so far as it has three-member constituencies, but would object to the few seven or eight-member constituencies introduced more or less accidentally in the Dáil.  But, as Senators know, that is not my point of view.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, whether by design or accident, or with some other object in view, the Government have introduced a schedule which will really take away definitely from the value of proportional representation to minorities. I do not suggest that we will not have proportional representation.  As far as the three big Parties are concerned&mdash;if there are only three&mdash;if they represent every point of view in the country, then three-member constituencies are all right.  You can get a proportional result as between the three large Parties, but the smallest of them will be rather worse, because they will have so to arrange their members that they will have one-fourth, plus one, in each constituency.</P>
    <P>I believe there is another aspect of this question.  We are probably going to have in this country, in the main, two large parties with, I suppose, the Labour Party, at any rate for some <Col N="1928" /> time, considerably smaller.  Inside these parties, to my mind, it is desirable that there should be a measure of proportional representation.  While I think it should be possible to have a few independent members, if they have sufficient to get one-eighth in certain large constituencies, in the main what I want to see is that the constituencies will be large enough, so that each of the bigger parties will have a chance of electing three or four at least.  By that means they are far more likely to have one of the three or four representing, say, a minority in religion or some other point of view, even inside their own party.  If you have three-member constituencies, and if, as would be the case in practically every constituency here, no one party had a chance of getting more than two, then they will choose two representing the biggest interests in their party, and ignore the smaller interests.  I am not accusing any party of anything.  I am only dealing with what is the natural effect. I, therefore, hold very strongly that if you are going to have these smaller minorities represented in the Dáil you must not go to three and four-member constituencies, particularly three-member constituencies, and that the more large constituencies you have the better.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with the effect of that on the Schedule in a moment.  I want to connect this up.  Whether it be deliberate policy on the part of the Government, or whether it was accidental, I do not know.  I am not making any charges.  I am only dealing with the effect.  The fact is that practically at the same time we have three proposals before us.  One is to abolish the Seanad, which contains some representatives of a minority. The next is to abolish University representation, which has always ensured some minority representation.  At the same time you come here and change your schedule to make it scarcely possible to have any of that minority representation in the Dáil.  I should like if the President were here to make a personal appeal to him that that is not only a serious mistake, but that it is quite contrary to everything he has told us.  Even on this very question of <Col N="1929" /> the Seanad, in his Fifth Reading speech in the Dáil, he said that he did not believe that &ldquo;a Second Chamber is justifiable at all, particularly when we have a system of proportional representation such as we have here.&rdquo;  Then the Government comes along with a Bill which takes away the value of that proportional representation for the smaller minorities.  In this country you have got, and will have, a considerable number of people who do represent a small minority.</P>
    <P>All I am pleading for is some constituencies with seven or eight members&mdash;the more you can have conveniently the better&mdash;in which one-eighth or one-ninth, if they vote together, will get a chance of representation. I maintain that it is only by such means you can ensure having that minority representation.  If you cut away University representation, abolish the Seanad, practically do away with minority representation in the Dáil, and then say: &ldquo;This is part of our policy to try and end partition,&rdquo; I say it is ridiculous.  I plead with the Government, whether they take this Schedule or not, as a matter of national policy, and not any question of Party at all, to consider what the effect of their Schedule would be if they insist upon it in the form in which it has come here.  Senator Farren said quite correctly that it was illogical and inconsistent. But the very illogicalities in it are the improvements, from the point of view of minority representation made in the Dáil, due to the fact that certain members did not want to see their constituencies cut in two.</P>
    <P>It may be said that in this Schedule which has been introduced in the names of some other Senators and myself there are some three-member constituencies. That is true.  I have a very clear recollection of discussions which took place at the very earliest period of the State.  I was not, of course, a member of the Government, but on the Constitution Committee one heard a great deal of discussion, and the question of the effective working of proportional representation was considered.  It was then generally recognised that to get the best value out of proportional representation <Col N="1930" /> there should be no constituencies with less than five members.  It was also felt, however, that it was better to take the definite recognised boundaries in the country, and that, at the sacrifice of having all constituencies of five members or more, it was better to keep to the county boundaries.  Senator Moore reminds us that the county boundaries really came from England and that we ought to go back to the baronies.</P>
    <P>If this Government proposed to have a new set of counties, with a new set of boundaries and different county councils, I am quite prepared to consider it.  It may be an improvement&mdash; I do not know, as I have not seen the proposals.  But what this is doing is leaving the different counties for the purpose of local government and taking bits of them and adding them to other constituencies for the purpose of Parliamentary Government.  That, to my mind, will create a certain amount of muddle.  You may have it to a small extent at the moment, but not to anything like the extent you will have if the Bill passes in its present form, under which a person will be voting in Carlow for the purpose of a local government election and in Wexford, or whatever the new constituency will be, for the purpose of a Parliamentary election.  That, to my mind, is bad. Not only that, but if you read the debates in the Dáil you will find that it did not meet with the approval of Deputies.  A few Deputies approved of it, but, generally speaking, when it came to their own areas that they knew, they did not like it or want it. I suggest that this amendment should not be discussed in a Party fashion at all.  If necessary, let it be considered further on Report and let us keep to this Schedule, so far as possible. I want to emphasise one or two things.  This Schedule accepts the principle of the Bill as introduced by the Government.  It accepts the number of members proposed by the Government. I should be inclined to agree that the number is very largely a matter for the Dáil.  It endeavours, taking into consideration the debates in the other House, to get better and more logical constituencies.  It particularly adopts <Col N="1931" /> the principle of keeping to counties and, last but not least, it keeps as many of the larger constituencies as possible in order to get the maximum amount of representation for minorities. These are the principles on which I suggest this House should send the Bill to the Dáil, with a view to giving them an opportunity for further consideration. The amendment should be considered by this House without any reference to the question of gerrymandering or otherwise.  I am so ignorant that I should not know a gerrymandering Schedule if some Senator brought it here.  If one were inside the machine, he might know.  A very well-known expert in the early days said to me&mdash;I was rather against the three-member constituencies at the beginning&mdash;&ldquo;I advise you to keep to the counties.  If all your Parties keep to the counties, no Party can be accused of gerrymandering at any time.  You will avoid that charge by keeping to the one fixed boundary.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much surprised to hear Senator Brown refer to the Bill in such terms as being &ldquo;absolutely unconstitutional.&rdquo;  I do not know whether he really intended to use those words.  I had some doubt, because a little later he spoke of the Schedule as being a breach of the spirit of the Constitution and I could understand him trying to defend the latter.  I cannot understand the phrase &ldquo;absolutely unconstitutional&rdquo;, especially coming from a lawyer.  I might have excused it coming from any back bencher.  I have a notion, after hearing a good deal of talk about the proportional representation clause in the Constitution, that there is a misapprehension as to what that involves. It is not at all necessary, in fulfilment of Article 26, which provides that members shall be elected on principles of proportional representation, that the method of applying these principles shall be by the single transferable vote. The Constitution may be fulfilled by any method of obtaining proportional representation and there are many other methods besides the single transferable <Col N="1932" /> vote.  I think it would be well if Senators would remember that fact. The Bill, of course, presumes the continuance of the single transferable vote method.</P>
      <P>For my part I am quite prepared to say that the Bill is not logical or sound from any standpoint of consistency. But I think whatever is alleged against the Schedule in that regard can be alleged with equal strength against the scheme that is proposed in the amendment.  The question before the Seanad is, which of these schemes is preferable?  I think the majority of those who have spoken up to the moment have not had very much direct experience in the fighting of constituencies for the Dáil.  I think that is a matter that should weigh with Senators in discussing these alternatives. If we were endeavouring to secure a perfectly straight and orderly scheme, I would go blunty for a five-member constituency as a maximum and almost as a minimum.  I think I would concentrate on the five-member constituency as being the best compromise to satisfy two desirable conditions, (1) having a fair method of obtaining proportional representation and (2) having regard to the compactness of the constituencies and the desirability of taking account of the difficulties of contesting elections, particularly for minorities.</P>
      <P>I draw attention to the fact that the amendment proposes to give us 25 areas.  The Schedule of the Bill proposes to give us 34 areas.  From the point of view of minorities, I would say without any question whatever there is a better chance of political minorities securing election in the 34 smaller areas than in the 25 larger areas.  Taking the amendment and comparing it with the Schedule of the Bill, Senator Douglas expressed his preference for the five-member constituency.</P>

      <P>For at least five members as compared with three and four.  In the amendment we have four five-member constituencies and in the Bill we have eight.  In the amendment we have six four-member <Col N="1933" /> constituencies and four three-member constituencies.  In the Bill we have 15 three-member constituencies.  As I look at it, it is going to be a matter of choice and the convenience of parties fighting elections, and particularly for small parties fighting elections, as to whether it is more advantageous to have ten constituencies returning seven, eight and nine members or 15 constituencies returning three members.  That is about the choice that is before minority parties.  Having had a little experience of fighting a large constituency, not so large in area, but large in numbers, and having had a little experience also in fighting the larger constituencies both in numbers and in area, I am, frankly, in favour of the smaller constituency.  For the convenience of people engaged in the elections that is a very important factor to be considered in discussing these alternatives.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas laid stress upon &ldquo;the minority.&rdquo;  I was disappointed and astonished to hear Senator Douglas argue as he did, as though the minority in question was a single religious minority.  This Bill is not dealing with the representation of religious.  It is a political measure dealing with political organisations and political ideas and if we are going to speak of proportional representation surely the last thing that any member of the religious minority in this country should advocate is that the proportion should be in relation to the numerical strength of the religious sects or organisations or faiths?  If there is one thing more than another that ought to be avoided, it is to assume that a religious minority is always and ever of a single political faith.  I take it that the principle of proportional representation has as its purpose the securing of representation of political minorities and securing that wherever a minority arises in any particular issue or interest it may have a reasonable chance of being represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take these ten areas in the amendment, the seven, eight and nine-member constituencies, which is the proposal of the amendment&mdash;I would put it to any ex-Deputy, now a Senator, who <Col N="1934" /> has had experience of conducting elections, and particularly if he was one of a minority party in those elections, how much greater is the difficulty of securing a quota in a large constituency of that kind than in a smaller constituency.  The small minority Parties cannot work the constituencies.  They cannot reach the people, the expense of doing so is so very much greater, and they are far more likely to secure the return of a minority member in a smaller constituency because they can concentrate. That is my experience and it is my belief.  Because of that, I am against the large seven, eight and nine-member constituencies.  I may say that there is some point in it if you take Dublin County or Dublin North City or Dublin South City, where you have a large numerical constituency and a small area, but the amendment does not deal only with those small areas.  It takes County Galway and makes one constituency of it.  It takes County Donegal and makes one constituency of it.  It unites Wexford and Waterford, and if you look at the extent of that constituency that would have to be covered by a small minority Party trying to get one member returned, I think you will find that the chances would be lessened rather than increased for minority representation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is illogical in many respects. The amendment also is illogical in some respects, but we are presented in the amendment with a single new Schedule and we have to take it as it stands. I should say, definitely, speaking as one of a minority politically, that the chances of selection in 35 constituencies most of them being small in area, are greater than the chances of that minority getting representation in the smaller number of areas with the large constituencies.  As between those two schemes, I should certainly favour the scheme in the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very glad that he is piloting this Bill through the Seanad. Personally, I would prefer, when there is any alteration of boundaries in question, to get back to the old historic boundaries.  Senator Colonel Moore talked about the baronies to-day, but there are more historic boundaries in this country than those of the baronies. There is the old clan system, and there are the boundaries of the dioceses of Ireland.  I do object to any chopping off.  If the Government wanted to get back to the old boundaries, whether baronies or dioceses, I would agree with it, but when they start to chop off a piece of one county and throw it over to another county I am going to disagree. Senator Comyn, on the last day&mdash;I am glad he is present&mdash;told us that this was a domestic question for the Dáil, and that we should not interfere with it.  It is a very domestic question for me.  My father happens to be a Carlow man, and I may tell you all that if I allow County Carlow to be carved up in the way it is intended in this Bill, my father will disown me, and I do not want that.  I am not going to have it.  He stood by me many times when he did not agree with me.  He never let me down, and I am not going to let him down when he objects to his county being carved up.  The nickname on the Carlow people down there is the &ldquo;scallion eaters.&rdquo;  One part of the county is thrown into the &ldquo;short grass&rdquo; of Kildare and another part is thrown to the &ldquo;goat suckers&rdquo; of Wicklow.  Another portion, an ancient barony, is thrown over to&mdash;only that Senator Miss Browne is present I would tell you the nickname of that county&mdash;but, at any rate, to Wexford. I do not agree with it, and I think that amalgamation of Wexford and Waterford is much better than carving up the County Carlow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I am a Mayo man myself, and I think the County Mayo is a perfectly good constituency under proportional <Col N="1936" /> representation to which to elect Deputies.  This Bill proposes to divide it, and it divides it in an extraordinary way.  The part of Mayo in which I was born was always South Mayo for Parliamentary purposes&mdash;South-west if you like&mdash;but it is going to be put into North Mayo now.  Why?  It is really a very domestic question for me as to why I should protest against it.  The amendment proposes that the County Mayo should be left in one.</P>

      <P>Senators all know the shape of County Roscommon on the map.  The Bill proposes to cut the tail off Roscommon.  That is really what it does.  The Minister knows Roscommon as well as I do.  Well, I am not going to stand for that, and I am sure that the Minister will not stand for that either.  Why is it done?  The Constitution says that you must have one representative for every 25,000 people &mdash;for not less than 20,000 and not more than 30,000.  The amendment is, I think, the fairest thing that can be done under the circumstances.  The lowest is County Limerick with 20,049 to each member, and the highest is Longford-Westmeath with 24,166.  If we leave things as they are in the Bill, North Mayo, in which I am largely interested, would have one representative for 26,283.  That is not fair, and I think that the Government, when they were planning the Bill, did not do the thing as they should have done it.  They allowed pieces to be chopped off here and there.  They allowed Youghal to be thrown over the other side of the border and they allowed places in Sligo to be thrown over to Leitrim.  They allowed places in the County Galway to be thrown over to Clare, and I think that is unfair.  The only trouble or difficulty I see about the whole of it is in putting Waterford and Wexford in as one constituency. It is one constituency from Gorey to the end of Waterford.  After all the trouble we had at the elections, railways torn up, roads blocked with trees and so on, there is one thing to be said for the amalgamation of Wexford and Waterford, and it is this, that you can <Col N="1937" /> go there by the coast or you can get there by Hook or by Crook.</P>

      <P>I approve of this Schedule in the amendment.  I prefer it to the Schedule in the Bill because it does not cut at the counties.  I am not at all enamoured of Wexford being thrown in with Waterford.  The only thing that makes me agree with it is that as far as I can see it is the only arrangement that can be made with regard to those two constituencies.  In order to arrive at a proper number of Deputies it was necessary to do so. However, I must say that those two counties, Waterford and Wexford, could scarcely be more different.  Historically, they are totally different.  In temperament the people are very different.  But it is the best arrangement that can be arrived at.  With regard to those old chieftains' districts, like Clonmore, I would say that they are utterly out of the question.  The barony is the nearest thing to the old Irish Tuath.  The chieftains' kingdoms, those ancient Irish kingdoms, would now be entirely out of the question. Counties may be an English invention, but they are certainly the most convenient and the best possible divisions of the country under modern circumstances. We cannot go back to the early Christain times.  Some of the counties are more important from the historical point of view than the old chieftains' Tuath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point on which it appears to me I was clearly misunderstood by Senator Johnson, and I want to put it right.  I did not mean to say that the minorities in this country coincide entirely with religious lines.  I do not think I said that, and I did not mean to say it.  I never favoured anything of the kind.  I thought I made that clear to the House. All my life I have endeavoured to fight <Col N="1938" /> against that attitude, but I do say that unfortunately in some parts of this country they do go along those lines. When I said that I was thinking of the Six Counties.  There they do go along those lines.  I was pointing out the danger that if, as a result of our new system we did not get minority rights, the effect would be very bad in the Six Counties.  I have always done my best as an individual to stand against and fight against bringing religious questions into political matters.  In that I think I have the sympathy of people like Senator Johnson, but in this matter I notice that he differs in opinion from me.  He says that a small Party can manage a small constituency better than a large one.  How can you manage a constituency when in that constituency there is not enough to get a quota?  It would be an absolute waste of time if there is not a possibility of getting a quota.  The constituency which you can manage under such circumstances is of no use to you.  You may be able to get one-eighth, but unless you get one-fourth you have no quota.  By minorities I mean not religious minorities.  I mean people who are more or less on the side of the other big Parties, but who are not prepared to go the whole hog.  They take up an independent position.  I do not know how far that is the case in the Fianna Fáil Party, but I do know it must apply to a certain extent as far as the other large Party is concerned. A considerable number of people of whom I am one are in general sympathy with that Party, but they are not prepared to go the whole hog with them.  There are quite enough people holding that point of view to entitle them to a representation of four or five seats, certainly to two or three seats, but they are spread all over the country.  With the exception of the one constituency of the County Dublin they could not get a quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Johnson is looking at this thing from the point of view of the Labour Party.  But the Labour Party is an organised Party, and finds it easy to work a small constituency. What I am speaking of are minorities who will not be organised as a Party, minorities who would exert a certain <Col N="1939" /> amount of influence where the constituency was large and where a big Party would have a chance of electing four or five members.  In that case a member of such a Party would be likely to get elected as a member of one of the bigger Parties&mdash;but as a member of that Party who might have a slightly different point of view from his colleagues. I think now when the Seanad is being abolished and when University representation is being abolished, there is a great danger that you will have a Dáil the complexion of which will leave out a section of opinion in this country, a section which will never have a majority and which ought not to have a majority, but which ought to be represented in the Parliament of this country.  That is the danger I see in this Bill, and that is what I would like to guard against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have been proven to have misunderstood Senator Douglas's inferences.  My misunderstanding was due to my knowledge of the attitude he has adopted for many years.  I think Senator Douglas has a way of looking at things differing from my way of looking at things.  I assume that an election campaign or preelection campaign&mdash;that is to say the propaganda which goes on between elections&mdash;is aimed at changing opinions, and from that point of view I argue that the smaller constituency is better for the small Party or the small minority.  Senator Douglas appears to deal with this matter from the point of view that Parties are static and never change.  In that case, there is no possibility of agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree that this Schedule is any improvement at all on the Schedule in the Bill.  As a matter of fact, I think it is very much worse.  Miss Browne has touched on one point.  I do not see how there can be any excuse for the suggestion to amalgamate Waterford and Wexford. I think anybody who knows anything about the geography of the country knows that in order to get by land from Wexford to Waterford, one has to travel about 14 miles.  One can go by rail across the Barrow but, as Senator Staines says, if the roads and <Col N="1940" /> bridges are broken you can go by sea. There is certainly no case in the world for amalgamating these two constituencies. I quite agree with what Senator Johnson has said, that, although on the face of it it might appear that the small constituency did not give representation to minorities to the same extent as the large constituency, that is, one returning eight or nine members, in actual practice the reverse has proved to be the case.  I think I know most of the constituencies very well.  Take the case of Monaghan. For a good period there were three different Parties represented there. There were three members elected and each Party got representation from 1927 down to the last election.  County Louth, which also returns three members, before Mr. Coburn joined the Fine Gael Party and when he was an Independent, returned three members of different Parties.  In County Kildare, at the present time, and, I am almost certain, since 1923, each of the three Parties, one of them being the rather small Labour Party, got representation, and I think Wicklow is the same.  At one time, North Cork used to return three members to the Dáil, and up to the June Election of 1927, one of each Party was returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, the real test, I submit, of proportional representation is the result.  Theoretically, it would appear that minorities ought to get representatation in the big constituencies, but it does not work out like that.  In Donegal, there is a minority representative returned and also in County Dublin, but in all the other big constituencies it has not been so.  I think, therefore, that that argument falls to the ground.  As every one knows, the Government were compelled, by Article 26 of the Constitution, to revise the constituencies on the basis of the last census and when the time came for doing that, they decided, acting on their experience of some years past, that, in the best interests of the country, no constituency ought to return more than five members.  That was what we set out to do, but we found it impossible to have them all five-member constituencies and it is <Col N="1941" /> quite obvious that those people in this House who expressed the wish to have five-member constituencies have also found it impossible.  They have produced only four in this Schedule whereas in the Bill there are eight.  I think that is a very good point in favour of the Schedule in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Dáil did not see its way to pass the Bill as introduced.  They amended three constituencies, leaving them with seven members each, but that was not the Minister's fault.  He had to accept what the Dáil gave him, and if he had had his way, as I say, no constituency would have returned more than five members.  In the five-member constituencies, just as in the three-member constituencies I think it is true to say that the minority does get representation.  I could, if the House wishes, go over the constituencies, but I do not think it is necessary.  Anybody who cares to look at the constituencies will find that the Labour Party, which is a small organised Party, has got representation in Wexford and Leix-Offaly.  In Dublin City, where we have eight-member and seven-member constituencies, they have no representation at all.  In Galway, with nine members, the small Party has no representation.  In Kerry, they have no representation and, since the last election, none in Tipperary.  The same applies to Sligo-Leitrim and Donegal. I repeat that it is only by the working out of a system you can decide whether it carries out the intention of the people who brought in that particular system and I maintain that, in practice, it certainly has been so.  For that reason I think there is no case for these large constituencies and it is quite obvious that that is what is proposed here.</P>
    <P>There is one big change proposed. That is in County Mayo.  This very big area has been two constituencies since 1923, and I do not know whether Senator Staines realised that when he was speaking.  It is proposed here to amalgamate these two constituencies, and I do not think that anyone seriously intends that we should do that, A great point was made about cutting across county boundaries.  I represent the constituency <Col N="1942" /> of Roscommon and, under the Local Government Act of 1898, part of Mayo was put into Roscommon&mdash;the Ballaghaderreen-Edmondstown district. Formerly, that was in County Mayo, and it has been in Roscommon ever since.  I have found no great trouble with regard to it, and the people do not mind it in the least.  At the other end of the county, Athlone borders my constituency, and I admit that if I had my own personal way, I should not have cut South Roscommon into two, because it was always the part of the county that returned me.  I know that the part that has been taken into the Athlone constituency was at one time the No. 2 Rural District of Athlone.  Athlone was the administrative area in the old rural district days, and similarly with regard to part of Westmeath.  It was the administrative unit and was in existence as such since 1838, long before the present administrative County of Roscommon was formed, which, as I say, was only in 1898.  I do not think, therefore, that there is very much point in the talk of cutting up constituencies and taking a bit of this county and putting it into that county.  As Senator Farren has said, it does not follow that because a man votes in a different constituency he is going to regard his neighbour as a foreigner.</P>
    <P>This revision has to be carried out under the terms of this Article of the Constitution, and there is no reference in that Article to county areas at all. It simply refers to the population of the Free State and sets out that there shall be not less than 20,000 and not more than 30,000 of the population per member.  I have a list of the constituencies here which gives the average number for each constituency per member, and in no case does it reach 24,000 per member, although it comes pretty near it in a couple of cases. There is one constituency in which, as a result of an amendment, the figure is brought up to 25,000 per member, but that was done by agreement of all Parties.  That is South Dublin.  In the original Bill, in or about 23,000 odd was the maximum, and it went down in one case&mdash;County Limerick&mdash;to 20,000 <Col N="1943" /> odd&mdash;just on the very margin.  Apart from that, there was a very fair attempt to give proper representation, and I do not think there is any improvement whatever in this proposed Schedule.  I am glad that the debate has been conducted in a really non-Party way.  I did not expect it; I thought we should be accused of all sorts of attempts of gerrymandering, but that has not been the case.  I certainly must say that I appreciate that, but I do not see how anyone could expect the Government to accept a Schedule which contains such anomalies as are in this.  A very important thing from the point of view of administration has been done in respect of this proposed Schedule.  The new Dublin City area has been completely ignored, and it is suggested that it be put back into the county and one more member added to the county, making it a nine-member constituency. I do not think that could be seriously meant at all.  The Government could not possibly accept it.  In regard to Cork County, the basis of the Schedule in the Bill was a proposal initiated by the Cork County Council itself.  They requested the Minister for Local Government to divide Cork County into three health districts.  It was on that basis the new constituencies were formed.  Cork City is an urban area now, and the rural area is put in the other end of the county, which is quite proper and consistent.  Senator Brown said that, in his opinion, the Bill was going against the spirit of the Constitution by practically departing from the principle of proportional representation. I do not think that has been done.  Senator Douglas did not agree with him.  As far as I remember, the latter Senator admitted that the principle of proportional representation was maintained for minority Parties.  I do not see how the other groups could possibly expect to get many seats.  It is not to be imagined that people belonging to small units will be concertrated in one constituency.  They will be all over the country, and could not reach the 25 per cent. plus one necessary to have a member returned in a three-member constituency.  If <Col N="1944" /> they do not get that number I do not see that they have any claim to representation. They could ally themselves with, or get into some of the big Parties so as to have their views considered. That is the case at present, where people do not accept everything in the programmes of Parties they support. If they want representation in the Dáil, and find that they cannot get 25 per cent., the best thing for them to do is to swallow as much as they can of the political tenets of the other political Parties.  I cannot make a better suggestion.</P>

On the other hand, in Monaghan and Cavan, which return three and four members, respectively, Independent members were elected.  I imagine those were the types of representative Senator Douglas was thinking of.  Senator Johnson has probably given the reason&mdash;that small Parties find it easier to do their work in small constituencies. I have touched upon the main points that were raised, and in my opinion the amendment would make the Schedule worse than the one in the Bill, and I hope the Seanad will reject it.</P>

      <P>It has been said that as the Schedule has been passed by the Dáil the Seanad should not interfere with it.  Did the Dáil agree to it of its own free will?  We have had it from the Minister that if he had his way he would not have his constituency of Roscommon split up.  That shows that the Dáil would not agree to have the constituencies split up if it had a free will.  That is proof that there was not free will in agreeing to the Schedule.  Senator Johnson points out that minorities have a greater chance of getting representation in small constituencies than in larger ones.  I do not think anyone who understands proportional representation will agree with that.  The larger the constituency the greater chance there is of representation for the minority.  The Minister <Col N="1945" /> pointed out that if some constituencies were split they belonged, for poor law purposes, to the administrative portion of other counties.  He said that the Athlone portion which is taken from Roscommon and put into Longford-Westmeath, belonged for poor law purposes to Westmeath.  I can point to Garristown district in County Dublin, which belongs for poor law purposes to another county, and <Col N="1946" /> although the rates were many shillings in the £ less than they were in County Dublin, for sentimental reasons the people came into County Dublin and agreed to pay 3/- in the £ more on their rates.  There is a place where sentiment counted.  The Minister says it does not count.  It does count, and the people in that district sacrificed a good deal to be in their own county.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to delete Article 27 of the Constitution. It is really a corollary to the Bill we have been discussing in Committee. When the time for revising the constituencies arrived every constituency was looked into, and the Government could find no reason why the Universities should get special consideration. First of all, in principle, they could see no reason why things that apply to Universities should not also apply equally well to other institutions and organisations.  It could not be claimed, as it stands, that University representation is educational representation, because many of the graduates who are voters on the register may not be concerned with education at all. They may be engineers or journalists <Col N="1948" /> or engaged in any other walk of life. In at least one University the candidates are selected by political organisations, and are definitely allied to political parties.  They are selected as ordinary political representatives; there is no question of their being educational representatives at all.  When the time arrives when we are to have a corporate State, about which we hear so much, there may be a case for University representation as well as representation for vocational bodies, trade unions and others; but until that time arrives I do not see that any case can be made for special University representation.</P>
      <P>At the present time there are six University representatives.  That means one twenty-fifth of the whole Dáil.  The number of representatives has been fixed as three for each University and that has no reference whatever to the size of the register.  There might be very few people on the register, and yet three members would be returned.  I have seen a statement as to what the voting power of a University graduate may be in relation to the ordinary elector.  That may be a very valuable figure.  It depends on how many people may care to register as University electors.  Really when a person is registered as a University elector his name ought not to be on the register for another constituency.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of that but I have not said they voted.  I said it is very difficult to check the registers in the case of University voters. I did not say they voted in other constituencies as well.</P>
      <P>Another big objection is that people who have practically severed all connection with this country can vote by post.  Some friend may write and say to them &ldquo;We want you to vote for certain people&rdquo; and very probably they will do so.  No other citizen has any such right.  If an ordinary voter is not resident in his constituency, on a certain date, he is automatically put off the register.  But these University voters can settle down in any country they like and still have the right to vote.  I cannot see any justification for that.  The big objection I see to University representation, and which the Government saw, is that it is giving representation to particular institutions when there is no case for such representation. If a University man wishes to enter the Dáil, there is nothing to prevent him.  Such people can go to the different constituencies and join the existing political Parties or, if they have personality enough, they can go up as independent candidates.  If elected they will be just as much representative of their University as those elected for the Universities at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that candidates in one University now are selected by political organisations.  Even in Trinity College, at the last election, there was an attempt made to nominate a political candidate, but there was a miscarriage. I can see no justification for this <Col N="1950" /> special representation at all.  There is no such thing as a vocational system of representation yet.  When that comes about it will be time enough to give Universities special representation.</P>

      <P>I hope the Seanad will not agree to this Bill being read a second time.  The Bill provides for the deletion from the Constitution of Article 27 which entitles each University in Saorstát Eireann to elect three representatives to Dáil Eireann.  The proposal to alter the Constitution by abolishing the representation of the Universities in the Dáil is one of the most retrograde proposals that have ever come before this House.  The reasons given by the Vice-President for making this proposal were on two main grounds. First, representation in the Dáil is in general regulated by a population formula.  This formula does not apply to the University constituencies, the number of whose representatives are fixed by the Constitution.  Secondly, if the Dáil, elected on an adult suffrage register according to the principles of proportional representation, is to include a special representation of a particular interest elected on a different basis it can only be because there is clear evidence that that particular interest has a peculiar national importance and cannot otherwise secure representation.</P>
      <P>I think it will be evident to everyone in this House that the first reason does not apply as it is not a question of limiting the number of representatives of the Universities, but the deletion of representation altogether. The second reason is that there should be evidence that the particular interest has a peculiar national importance and cannot otherwise secure representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vice-President evidently overlooks the fact that the Universities were given the right to elect representatives because they occupied positions of peculiar national importance. It may be good tactics to try and place the Universities in the position that they are trying to get representation in the Dáil, whereas <Col N="1951" /> this Bill is for the purpose of taking from the Universities what they have already got.  One of the Universities has enjoyed the privilege of sending representatives to Parliament for over 300 years.  Surely we, who have such a great regard for ancient institutions, should hesitate before taking away a right with such long and honourable associations?  The other University obtains its right to parliamentary representation through the agitation which was started in 1917 by the then Chancellor of the University, Archbishop Walsh, one of the greatest and most far-seeing Archbishops this country has ever had.  In 1917 he called public attention to the fact that there was a Redistribution Bill then before the British House of Commons, and that no representation was being given to the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Archbishop stressed the necessity of having the University represented in Parliament, not as an act of grace, but as a national right.  He also stated that he had no desire to take from Dublin University the ancient privilege of representation which that venerable institution had enjoyed for over 300 years.  A public meeting in University College was called to consider the matter.  It was large, influential, and enthusiastic.  It was pointed out that there were many reasons why they had a right to claim University representation.  It has been stated that Sinn Féin in 1918 accepted University representation as part of their programme.  The proposal was also supported by the whole Irish Party.  After strenuous negotiations it was agreed to give the National University parliamentary representation in the British House of Commons. If ever there was a mandate for any particular object, surely there was a mandate for parliamentary representation, not only in the interests of the University, but in the best interests of the national life of the country? It was stated in the Dáil that the late President Arthur Griffith and the late Vice-President Kevin O'Higgins gave a promise that there would be University representation in the Oireachtas.  Then when the Constitution <Col N="1952" /> was under consideration in the Dáil in 1922, the question of including University representation was left to an open vote of the Dáil, and it was decided by an almost unanimous vote to give the two Universities the right to elect three members each.  The action of the Dáil giving parliamentary representation to the two Universities will stand out for all time as a broadminded act of statesmanship.</P>
    <P>I cannot help admiring the liberal lines of justice and fair play on which the Constitution was drawn.  It was drawn in no niggardly spirit, and the Government had good reason to be proud of their work.  It is generally agreed that the University representatives in the Dáil have at all times realised their full responsibilities, and have taken a keen and helpful interest in the work of the Dáil.  Their colleagues have given them credit for their public spirit, and for their valuable contributions to debate, and have added that the Dáil and the nation would be the poorer if they were excluded.  This being so, why inflict this indignity upon the Universities and their representatives? Without going into details regarding the many important measures these representatives have initiated and assisted in carrying through, I might mention one Bill which was initiated and carried through by one of the University representatives which has been of enormous benefit to the sick, and that practically saved the whole voluntary hospital system.  I need not refer to the many illustrious Irishmen who have been educated in Trinity College who have brought honour and prestige to Ireland.  There are graduates of both Universities occupying important positions in all parts of the world.  These men take the greatest possible interest in all that affects Ireland, and especially their Universities.  If they have been carrying on good work for Ireland, how will they like their Universities to be degraded?</P>
    <P>Before such a large and radical change should be proposed, the people in all parts of the country should have an opportunity of considering the reasons for and against such a <Col N="1953" /> change.  They have had no such opportunity, not even the electors of the Universities have had this matter brought before them by those who appealed to them for their votes.  I will vote against this Bill being read a second time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister who is in charge of the Bill in this House, because it is not his Bill.  No doubt, he is responsible, as other members of the Executive Council are, for the policy of this Bill.  It is not his Bill, and that, I think, must be his excuse for the manner in which he introduced it to this House, but I am entirely willing to excuse it on that ground. The only real argument, I think, that the Minister put forward in support of the Second Reading of the Bill was that in this country we had not yet arrived at vocational representation. Now, that is an entire misapprehension of the real nature of University representation in this country.  It does not represent a class of University professors or teachers; it represents a certain state of mind which is of immense importance in the political life of any country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would rather deal with this question and reply to the two main arguments which were put forward in the other House by the Vice-President. The first main argument put forward by him was that University representation is out of all proportion to numbers. The Minister in charge of the Bill here was not able to give the numbers. I am taking the numbers that I have from the speech of the Vice-President in the other House.  In Dublin University there is one member for about 1,100 electors&mdash;about 1,100 voters on the register.  In the National University there is one member for about 1,500 voters, and in the rest of the country there is one member for 11,000 voters, and, therefore, University representation has got to go.  Now, that is a purely arithmetical argument, and it proceeds on the basis of counting heads.  It is based on the assumption that, for the purpose of Parliamentary representation, all heads are equal.  Now, Sir, for the purposes of <Col N="1954" /> Parliamentary representation all heads are not equal.  I do not wish to be misunderstood. The 11,000 ordinary voters in the country who are represented by only one member in the Dáil have never had the chance of being equal for reasons that are due to our unhappy history in this country.  The ordinary voters in this country are less educated and less experienced in political matters than perhaps in any other modern democratic State.  It is not their fault. It is due to their history for two or three generations.  Down to the time when the British ceased to govern this country there were practically only two questions before the ordinary elector in this country.</P>
    <P>There was the question of Home Rule and there was the question of the land.  He has got self-government; absolute free self-government, and every tenant in the Free State is now either the actual owner or the potential owner of his land.  The two questions which he understood and voted on for generations are gone and, politically speaking, as far as political experience is concerned, he is at large.  That explains a peculiarity in our political life, in so far as it is vocal, because our people, judging by what they shout, are people who follow persons rather than principles.  It is &ldquo;Up Dev,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up O'Duffy,&rdquo; or up somebody else, without any real understanding, I submit, of the principles which ought to underlie a cry like that.</P>
    <P>There is something that men and women acquire in the University which gives them a special quality of mind, and a quality of mind which ought to be represented in a democratic Parliament.  It does not come from the dead knowledge that they acquire in the University.  It comes from the mixing for some years, and at an impressionable age, with men and women of different minds and with different points of view.  But, as that quality of mind is represented in the Dáil by one member for 1,100, and the other qualities of mind have only one member for eleven thousand, University representation has got to go, and it has got to go in the country which wants it most.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1955" /> It is symptomatic of the mind of the present Government that the abolition of University representation synchronises with the abolition of this House.  They both develop a quality of mind for which the President of the Executive Council has no use; for service in this House develops much the same quality of mind as a University. We are small enough to know each other well.  There is little or no bitterness here.  There is a recognition that to all questions there is another side.  They say that every country gets the Government that it deserves. When the Seanad and University representation are abolished in this country, this country will have the Government it deserves.</P>
    <P>The second main argument of the Vice-President in the other House was that University representation is undemocratic. There is no word in the dictionary more abused, more misused, than the word democratic.  Does any thoughtful man imagine that he is living at this moment in the Irish Free State in a democratic country?  If he does, he is wrong.  He is living under a dictatorship, and he is living under a dictatorship of the worst class, because it is posing as a Parliamentary Government. I agree that if our present Government is democratic, University representation is undemocratic.  In a true democracy every element of the nation would have its proper share of representation, and Universities would probably have a large share; but even if they only had a small share it might well be the little leaven that would leaven the whole lump.</P>
    <P>I maintain that in a true democracy there would be University representation. I take it that for practical purposes there is no truer democracy, no more real democracy, than the Government of Great Britain.  For hundreds of years it had representation in Parliament of the two great Universities; it had two members returned for each.  The growth of University education there has increased to such an extent that there are now 17 Universities in Great Britain, represented in Parliament by 12 members.  That is the way the really democratic nation treats its <Col N="1956" /> University representation, and it is because that is going to be denied in this country that I intend to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I confess that on this particular Bill I have no strong views, but I have been absolutely amazed at the speech delivered by Senator Brown.  He said Universities develop a certain quality of mind.  They do. He has gone back to the time before the establishment of the Free State and commented on the lack of political education of the people of this country. To some extent it was true that the two main issues were, as he said, Home Rule and the land.  Other matters, however, attracted the attention of the people also, but in a lesser degree. Let us go back, however, and study the quality of mind of University representation in those days.  From the time of the Union up to 1920, approximately 120 years, we had University representation for Trinity College and, with two exceptions, during all that time the representation was the stepping-stone to high legal office or to the Bench. One of the exceptions was Hely-Hutchinson, of whom I think it was Peel said, that if you gave him England for his estate he would ask for the Isle of Man for a kitchen garden; and the other honourable exception was the Rt. Hon. W.H. Lecky.  If that is the quality of mind University representation stands for, it is time to abolish it, and the anti-democratic government which Senator Brown defines, with all its faults and the counting of heads, is something to be desired as preferable.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to say very much on this Bill.  To me the measure is one of straight decision between yes and no. But I, too, like Senator Dowdall, was somewhat amazed, not so much at the opinions expressed by Senator Brown, as his method of expression.  If I might say so, his technique this afternoon was somewhat less subtle and more direct than we have been accustomed to from him.  The principle behind the introduction of this Constitution (Amendment) Bill is, I think, definitely sound and on a democratic basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1957" /> Senator Brown went to some trouble to assume a superiority complex for himself, his colleagues and his friends in the universities.  I do not differentiate between one university and another.  I submit there is very little justification for representation in all we have known nationally, economically or spiritually of what has emerged from either university up to the present.  I am prepared, without any admission of inferiority, to stand by the average standard of political insight, political acumen and political judgment of our people against that of any people I know.  I have experience of democratic forms of government in countries other than this country.  I have heard newspaper men from all parts of the world comment on the extraordinary political intelligence of the Irish people and on their grasp of the public problems presented to them. Their extraordinary knowledge and judgment in this respect, irrespective of how they may vote, have been frequently commented upon.  I venture to think that that knowledge is more common amongst the people of Ireland, taken as a whole, than it is amongst those within the portals of Trinity College.  There is a very definite reason for that.  It is not a question of inherent ability.  It is not a question of the segregation of minds of one class or another.  It is a question of interest.  What, after all, is the average student's interest when he goes to Trinity?  His definite aim is an imperial career.</P>
    <P>Senator Brown has referred to various distinguished graduates who have emerged from that institution and cast lustre on the Irish people. I submit that nothing in political thought which has emerged from Trinity College, with a couple of exceptions, has cast any credit on this nation as a whole.  What have we got? We have invariably got the anti-Irish political leader.  Go to Trinity College to-day.  There is a reasonable leavening of sound republican thought there now but, taking it as a whole, it stands, as it stood when established, for the Elizabethan idea and the imperial idea.  All the expressions of opinion we have had in this assembly <Col N="1958" /> show that it stands for the same thing still.  One thing emerges&mdash;that that type of mind will refuse to accept the fact that the Irish people want to be free and that they do not want to be imperialistic or connected with the Empire.  That aim is steadily resisted now, as Trinity has always resisted it. That is apart from the democratic principle involved.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Senator Brown that he is making a very rash assumption if he is going to decry the political intelligence and the political mentality of the people.  Even if it were so, there are very sound historical reasons why it should happen and these reasons are found most in the direction and guidance given in the same institution.  We know the great statesmen&mdash;some of them are alive still&mdash;who have emerged from that institution.  We know the damage they did in this country.  We know their mentality to-day.  They made Trinity College a stepping stone to preferment by means of the anti-Irish prejudice on the other side of the Channel.  That is the history of Trinity.  When the records of Trinity are analysed, it will be found to have been a most successful stepping stone to political preferment outside this country against the interests of this country.  I want to enter an emphatic protest against the assumption, which is completely at variance with the facts, that our people lack intelligence in political matters.</P>
    <P>I had a very distinguished representative of one of the world's greatest newspapers here in 1918.  He had travelled over Russia; he had been all through the different headquarter centres of the Great War; he had gone through Britain, and he then came here to see the onslaughts that were being made on the people.  What was his view?  In no country in the world, he said, had he seen such political acumen and judgment displayed as were displayed by the people in this country. The Irish people do not need any defence from me against anything Senator Brown may say, but it is, I think, important that one protest, at least, should go on record against the claim that Trinity College, or University representation, gave us distinguished <Col N="1959" /> Irishmen.  However, they may have been distinguished for service to the Empire elsewhere, they certainly were not regarded as distinguished here.</P>

      <P>I recognise that a Bill like this can be defended by a great number of theoretical and doctrinaire arguments.  I recognise, too, that if we had a different sort of Seanad, instead of one which is to be abolished if the Government has its way, there would be a great deal to be said for having the University representatives in the Seanad.  However, the proposal is not to transfer them to the Seanad but simply to eliminate them. I am not concerned with the history of University representation.  So far as I am concerned, the history of university representation begins with the Free State.  The original draft of the Constitution did not provide for University representation.  The reason that the section now proposed to be deleted was inserted was that, during the discussions on the Constitution, the great body of the members of the Dáil were impressed with the help they got from those who were present in that Assembly as representatives of the Universities.  I am not saying too much when I say that they were impressed, particularly, by the help they got from one of the Trinity representatives, who is now Mr. Justice Fitzgibbon.  The feeling that developed amongst Deputies and that led to the insertion of the section was simply this: that, in addition to having the people represented in the Dáil, it is necessary that the Dáil should be an effective body and that outstanding men should find it moderately easy to get into it.  It is all very well to have 153 representatives of the people, but if these 153 representatives all happened to be of mediocre ability, it would be a bad <Col N="1960" /> Dáil.  I do not say that you are going to get geniuses from the universities. I am not as much impressed as Senator Brown is with the effects of University education so far as my observation of people has gone.  It is, however, clear that men who would be very desirable members of the Dáil would get elected by University constituencies when they would not be elected otherwise.  There are men whom it would be very desirable to have in the Dáil and who would go forward for University constituencies but who would not very readily go forward for the ordinary constituency and stand all the slander, all the buffeting and all the unpleasantness associated with ordinary electioneering. It is, perhaps, a very good thing that we have not too many sensitive people affected by the vulgar abuse and the unpleasantness associated with electioneering but, on the other hand, I do not think that it is a good thing to make a thick hide a necessary qualification for membership of the Parliament of the nation.  If you abolish University representation, its meaning is that nobody who was not born naturally with a thick hide or who has not acquired it as a result of a lot of buffeting, need go up. University constituencies, in my opinion, have justified themselves thoroughly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to distinguish between individuals, but I think this may be said, that we have had in the Dáil, nearly since its initiation, two outstanding men, one from each of the Universities, who have given enormous help in the work of the Dáil, whose presence has been invaluable and neither of whom would have been there but for the existence of the University constituencies. I do not want to say that the other University members did not give extremely valuable service; but I think there are two men who would be recognised as outstanding.  There is Professor Thrift from Trinity College who has taken a very impartial and independent stand on everything; who has intervened always helpfully.  I do not think anybody who has any experience of the Dáil will deny that Professor Thrift has been one of the most <Col N="1961" /> useful and one of the most valuable members of the House.  I do not see how Professor Thrift could have entered the Dáil if there had been no University constituency.  I take the other man who could have entered the Dáil even if there were no University constituency but who, as a matter of fact, I know would not have entered the Dáil and could not, in the first instance, have been induced to go forward for any ordinary constituency, and that is Mr. McGilligan.  I think the Dáil would have been very much poorer without the ability and the knowledge and devotion of Mr. McGilligan.  As I have said, he could not have been, in the first instance, induced to enter the Dáil if there had not been a University constituency.</P>
    <P>That is only an experience over a period of ten years, but my own feeling is that over a longer period the same sort of experience would repeat itself and we would find valuable members entering the Dáil through University constituencies, who would otherwise not become members at all.  We have not such a surplusage of outstanding men that we can afford to ignore that fact.  The standard of the Dáil, the value of the Dáil, is not determined at all by the average ability of its 153 members.  Its value to the country, its standing, is determined by the number of first-rate members in it.  I do not think it is desirable to eliminate a means of getting first-rate men.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the people who vote for the University constituency, although they have left the country.  It is true that the general mass of emigrants do not vote once they have left the country, and I do not think any arrangements could be made to enable them to vote.  On the other hand, we have our well-trained emigrants, our emigrants who are likely to be able to attain position and influence opinion in the countries to which they go, who could on certain occasions be of help to this country, whose continuing interest will always be helpful to it, whose return to the country, on retirement, is a thing that ought to be welcomed, and I think it is a good thing that this particular class of emigrant should have their touch <Col N="1962" /> maintained with the country through their University representatives.</P>
    <P>I do not think the half-a-dozen University members distort the proportional character of the Dáil to any appreciable extent, and I think the practical advantages far outweigh any theoretical or doctrinaire argument that may be advanced.  I do not think there is any use at all raking up what Senator Connolly raked up about the record of Trinity College during 100 years or so.  I have criticised Trinity College as much as anybody, and I would be prepared to criticise it again on such an issue as was before the House the other day; but I do not think the historical references are really relevant to the present issue.</P>

Senator Connolly talked about the political interests of the people.  It is very good to have a wide political interest, but I think it is also very good to have a number of Deputies whose interests are not too political and who will not be perhaps so narrow and even so partisan on certain occasions.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that this is the most painful and, perhaps, the most humiliating Bill that has ever come before the House.  It is easy to recognise the mentality that lies behind it.  One almost hangs one's head in shame when listening to such a speech as Senator Connolly delivered here this evening.  It represented the narrow, bigoted mind that cannot recognise that anything good has ever come out of an institution like Trinity College.  He says that one or two people, possibly, have come out of that institution who have not been perhaps as bad as the rest.  The names of Thomas Davis, Edmund Burke, and Robert Emmet mean nothing to his mind, because his is a Communist mind.  That is the reason.  He is not a Nationalist in the sense that has been understood in Ireland, and he is one of a number.  It is absolutely painful to think what is before this country. What is the vision before the minds of these people?  No doubt a dictator with a mob behind him.  That is democracy&mdash;that is what it has come to.  Arthur Griffith had a marvellous mind, one of the clearest and noblest minds of recent times.  He had the broadest outlook, the purest National outlook.  When the Treaty was signed his very first act was to give an assurance to the minority in Ireland that they would get fair play amongst their own countrymen.  He was a disciple of Thomas Davis, one of the noblest men that have ever come out of any University.  If Trinity only produced Thomas Davis it would be a great thing for that institution to have done, but a whole galaxy of patriots have come out of that institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticisms are being levelled at Trinity.  We know quite well that the aim behind this Bill is to wipe out a few more of the Opposition to the present Government.  We give a lot of lip service to learning, and we do a lot of boasting about saints and scholars. We have had too much of that kind of talk and too little of respect for learning in this country, too little respect for scholarship and culture which are at a very low ebb indeed in this country at the present time.  Now we want to take away from the national Parliament <Col N="1964" /> the attainments which members of both Universities bring to it; attainments which it is impossible that the ordinary member can have, unless with a very few exceptions.  Apart from the cultural outlook, the University mind would have a steadying effect in a Parliament such as this where political passions rise to the top so often.  For that reason, University representatives would be a terrible national loss.  The whole tendency of the Government policy, it is painful to think, is not to look at the national honour, not to look at what people from the outside will regard as greatness in a country.  The whole trend of legislation here is to make a political advantage at the expense of everything&mdash;right, justice or anything else&mdash;no matter what comes into it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be particularly bitter, but I am pained beyond measure and humiliated at the mentality behind this Bill which is before us here this evening.  We hear all this talk about democracy.  We hate the very name of it.  It has been dragged into the mud in Ireland to such an extent that the very mention of democracy here has become a national disgrace&mdash;the travesty of it that we are having here at the present time.  What has it done to this country&mdash;not democracy, but the travesty of it&mdash;but to drag the national honour into the mud before the eyes of the world?  I am against this Bill.  I believe that every right-minded person in the country is against it, and I sincerely hope, with Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger, that the Seanad will refuse it a second hearing. While we are here we can do something to keep out the flood of disgrace that is coming on this country.  I am old enough to remember the outlook of the generation before me.  I belonged to what, I suppose, would be considered the advanced thought before the Treaty, and I believe that if the men&mdash;the patriots&mdash;who visioned a national and free Ireland could have grasped what would have come about in a free Ireland&mdash;what we are tending towards now&mdash;they never would have lifted a finger to make this a self-governing country.  Their ideas were totally opposed to the flood of thought <Col N="1965" /> that is coming upon us now and what it means.  It is not the national outlook. It has never been the national outlook in Ireland.  It is tending to lower the country in every way.  Not to mention the economic situation&mdash;we have had enough of that&mdash;nationally and spiritually in every way the character of the people is being changed for the worse.  The worst passions of the people are being brought out, and the mentality behind this Bill is responsible for that.</P>
    <P>It is difficult, without becoming very personal or bitter, to explain what I have in my mind, but I believe people understand it very well.  We always prided ourselves on looking forward to a national culture some time.  What have we done?  Mention a few isolated happenings in this country.  Take the destruction of the Record Office.  I referred to that here before.  That was the most disgraceful and the most barbarous act that has ever happened in any country that could be called civilised in any sense of the word.</P>

It is the blackest thing in the whole history of this country.  They cared nothing about what that meant. What did they care?  Nothing.  They have never made the slightest apology for it.  They boasted about it.  The Minister for Defence boasted about it here last week.  They gloried in it. What do you expect but a Bill of this kind from people with that mentality? Nothing matters to them&mdash;the national honour or anything else&mdash;as long as they can remain where they are.  And that spirit is coming down from the top. I say that this Bill is a disgrace, and I hope that the Seanad will throw it out.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to discuss this Bill from the point of view of any narrow theory of democracy.  If it is any help to Senator Connolly or to the Minister I will make him a present of the fact that, in my opinion, <Col N="1966" /> on a bare theory of democracy, if nothing else matters, they can get the best of the abstract argument.  You can always argue that, provided a constituency which has a relatively small number of voters is undemocratic in relation to the others; and I do not propose to spend the time of the House trying to prove that, if pure democratic theory is the only thing that matters in the Government of the country, then the Government are right and I am wrong.  I have spoken already at some length on the question of the representation of minorities in connection with another Bill.  The Minister did not agree with me that minorities could be in a better position under the scheme that I favoured than under his.  But he did not deny the probabilities that in only one or two constituencies would they have any particular chance of representation. He said very frankly and honestly that he thought he saw nothing else for it but for them to come into one of the larger Parties and swallow&mdash;I think he used the word swallow&mdash;</P>

I cannot support the general attitude of the Government in this matter, or their attitude both in the Revision of Constituencies Bill and their attitude towards this House.  I have not had the privilege of University education.  I cannot claim any of the special advantages that some of my friends beside me, or some of those opposite me, may claim.  Therefore, I cannot in any way attempt in my own person to prove the value of University education in the Oireachtas. My father could not afford to send the whole of a large family to the University.  Some of my family got there, others did not.  I was one of those who did not.</P>

      <P>I am therefore not as much impressed as some others by the arguments with regard to quality of mind.  But I do believe that this matter should be looked at not from the narrow party standpoint, but from the position of the country as it stands.  I want you to look back to the circumstances when it was decided to include University representation in the Oireachtas.  I have a very clear recollection of differences of opinion on the Constitution Committee, and I think I may say from memory that the majority of us were against it at any rate for the Dáil.  We looked at it from the matter of pure theory.  I believe it was ultimately accepted by the Dáil not because of any particular theory or quality of mind, not because of any sudden departure from democracy, but because it was believed that with University representation there would be representation for the dissatisfied minority who up to that time had fought against self-government, and that those would be introduced into the Parliament.  I believe it was for that purpose that it succeeded.</P>
      <P>I, with Senator Brown, was astonished at Senator Dowdall.  He was no more astonished than I was at his brief reference here.  He used as an argument in favour of this Bill&mdash;on which he has an open mind&mdash;the fact that Trinity College had been used as a means of political advancement in the past.  He used that, when we have had clear experience that whatever Trinity College may have done by means of its representation in the past, it brought into the Dáil and into the public life of this country after we got self-government several members, some of whom were called old Unionists and some of whom were not.  It brought contact between the old University and the new Parliament.  It brought men in who, I say without any hesitation whatever, were absolutely loyal to the new State of which they were members.  Senator Dowdall's argument is used even after all that has been departed from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to misrepresent Senator Dowdall.  I now see better than before what his object was. But I still think that dealing with the immediate problem before us the fact is that members were got into the Dáil who became perfectly loyal and assisted a large number of other people to accept loyally the new State.  That in itself justified University representation. What is the present position? You may say I am harping back to the position, but I feel it keenly.  You propose to abolish this House in which there is a certain minority representation. Next, you propose to have smaller constituencies, and you propose at the same time to take away University representation, which, whatever be its merits, got into this Parliament a few people who were in touch with the minority, and not only were in touch with the minority, but were in touch with an institution in this country which is attended by a very considerable number of people from the Six Counties.  It is one of the places in which there has been no partition, and the only argument for all that is the abstract theory of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you want to cut out these six members on the pure theory I ask you is it worth it?  I ask the President for the sake of getting these six members out is it worth it?  These six will not always represent a particular point of view.  The present balance is four to two against with no certainty that it will continue that way. Is it worth it to leave your Dáil with scarcely any representatives at all of a particular section of the people? You are getting out these men who have been giving loyal and valued services to the State.  I have many friends in the Dáil in both Parties. I do not profess to know all the members. But I cannot say that I know of any man who has been there for any length of time who is of a different opinion as to the value to the Dáil of Professors Thrift and the late Sir James Craig.  I found the same view from the members of both Parties who have been in the Dáil for a little time <Col N="1969" /> as I found from the old members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>
    <P>The first meeting that I ever attended in Trinity College was a meeting for the establishment of a Gaelic society.  I went there to attend a meeting with my brother who was joint honorary secretary with a young Protestant Divinity student from the North of Ireland.  At that meeting we were non-political, but I do not think there was any of us who was not a strong nationalist.  I make you a present of the fact that the society was suppressed, though afterwards it was revived.  I have a very clear recollection of attending the meetings of that Gaelic society.  The present Deputy Kelly used to come to the meetings sometimes and I found he was the one man in the Government Party who had the courage to stand out against this Bill.  Those of us who were nationalists had one thing of which we had an absolute conviction and that was that when this country got self-government the minority would be won over to confidence in the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>When the first Dáil was created you did not stand too strictly on the pure theory of democracy.  You departed a little from it, if you like, in order to get representation for the two universities. I felt then that our prophecy was being fulfilled, and when the then President nominated some persons in this House with some of whom I have been associated in the last 12 years, we felt that the same principle was being carried out.  What do we get now in these three Bills?  The Government have taken steps every one of which is in the opposite direction to what we all hoped for from them.  And that is coming under a Government headed by President de Valera, the one man who stood out against that sort of thing.  He gave us assurances that no matter how strong it was nationally, every effort would be made and sacrifices would be made&mdash;he used the word &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo;&mdash;to try to get into the Government people who represented the minority.  I am not pleading for the minority and I am not appealing for myself, for I do not belong in that way to the minority.  I have always been a <Col N="1970" /> Nationalist.  But I do wish to see that the steady progress that was going on of winning the confidence of the old classes who used to be called Unionists should be continued.</P>
    <P>I say that that progress which has taken place for the last few years, and which is now being rudely shaken, was a definite step towards ending partition. I am convinced of that.  This Bill, to my mind, ought to be opposed by this House because it is a retrograde step and not because of any abstract political theory.  It is late and I do not want to take a great deal of time, but I think it is very unfortunate that Senator Connolly made the references he did make and introduced Trinity College, which had been introduced by nobody else.  He said that he wanted to protest against the claim that Trinity College gave men of value to this country.  I want to answer him with the words of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, because he will probably be more impressed by what Mr. O'Kelly said than by anything I could say here.  Mr. O'Kelly said:</P>
    <P>While on the subject of Trinity College, I may say that I endorse what my colleague and namesake, Deputy Kelly, said with regard to Trinity College and Dublin University. I stand in the same position as he, and I have honour and respect for what has been done by graduates of Trinity College to help national feeling and national sentiment, and to bring honour and credit to this country.  All that has been done in that direction by men whom we all know and all sides, whatever their views may have been with regard to these men in the past, honour them to-day.  Trinity College, being the Alma Mater of these men, naturally shares in the glory and honour that attaches to these men, although I do not agree that it was because of the inspiration of Trinity College or Dublin University that these men were as national or as patriotic as their lives showed them to be afterwards. All honour and glory to the college that produced them, and let credit be given to the college for whatever share is due to the teachings that <Col N="1971" /> made them such decent and patriotic Irishmen as they were.</P>
    <P>That is a very different spirit of reference from that which we had from my friend, Senator Connolly, to-day.  When he made his references, I felt that it was only right to read that extract from Mr. O'Kelly, if it was only in defence of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>We have also had the somewhat unfortunate controversy between the references made by Senator Brown and Senator Connolly, with regard to the mentality of the voters in this country.  Personally, I find myself in agreement with both of them, because I think they meant something quite different.  I believe Senator Connolly was quite right when he spoke of the acuteness of mind of most people in this country towards politics.  I believe that Senator Brown was trying to convey that there is a need in this country for trained minds that will be applied to politics, and which you have not got in the ordinary politician, and by people who are keenly interested in politics in this country.  Go down and talk to the people in the country about the land annuities or some other of these popular issues and you will be surprised at how much they know, whether they are right or not.  Go and explain the question of the value of a democratic Constitution; go and speak to them about constitutional questions and you will find that they have never been explained and that they do not understand them.  The political leaders have not gone to the trouble of understanding them themselves, and the people have not been taught.</P>

      <P>I agree with both Senator Brown and Senator Connolly so far as these matters are concerned, but if you want to get at what is in my mind, when I make a contrast between the two types of mentality, I suggest that you take the debate in the Dáil on the Final Stage of this Bill and read the speeches of two members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;Mrs. Concannon and Deputy Corry.</P>

      <P>I did not hear either of them.  One is a University representative and the other is a different type of representative.  They both spoke on the same side.  If you want to see what we mean, read those two speeches. They are both for the Bill, but you will see what, to my mind, is as great a difference as the difference between day and night.  I want the type of mind that can make the speech&mdash;though I disagree with it&mdash;that Mrs.  cannon made.  I have read it and I believe that you are more likely to get some of that through having some University representatives than by cutting them out altogether.</P>
      <P>I do not know what exactly is behind the Government in this move.  Their political opponents tell them that it is designed purely to get two more votes for their Party.  They tell us that it is nothing of the kind, but they are enormously impressed by the great value of a theoretic democratic principle. I leave it to the House to choose which is the reason.  All I say to that is that I am sorry, and very sorry, they got this sudden enthusiasm for this theoretic democratic principle at the same time as they were cutting out other minority representation, and I suggest that when you take the country altogether, it is an extremely bad policy and not a policy that we ought to support.</P>

      <P>The only speech made in favour of the retention in the Constitution of this reference to University representation, Article 27, is that of Senator Brown because he based his claim upon the quality of mind&mdash;I think he meant the quality of the voters and not the quality of the representatives&mdash;in University constituencies and on the outstanding superiority, as voters and as citizens, of those who had gone through the University course as compared with the rest of the community.  He bases the case for retaining their position in the Constitution, as part of the fundamental law of the State, that their privileges as voters who have gone through the University, being so far superior to the rest of the community in quality of mind, shall be free from <Col N="1973" /> any attack by any legislature except by way of constitutional amendment. My experience gives no support to the claim that Senator Brown has made, as to the quality of the voters in those constituencies as compared with the quality of voters in other constituencies.  I do not think, in fact, that in the choice they have made, they have proved themselves so consistently superior to the rest of the voting community.</P>
      <P>Senator Brown made some reference to the Universities and this House and suggested that, shall I say, the quality of mind in the two bodies was somewhat comparable.  I wonder whether that is consistent with the fact that in one of the Universities in question the voters have been collected up, schooled and brought into one or other political camp, just the same as the voters in any other constituency?  They have not exercised any particular choice in the selection of their representatives as voters.  A little political group may have made selections with judgment and concern, but the voters troop into the camp just the same as in any other constituency.  In this respect you cannot claim that the quality of mind of the voters in that constituency is so different from, or superior to, that of other constituencies.  I am inclined to think, having observed the conduct of debates in the other House, when the Senator speaks of the absence of bitterness and so on, that a larger proportion of the con centrated bitterness one reads of emanates from University representatives, and people who have gone through these colleges, than from the Party member who has not had that privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brown says because the quality of the University voter is superior the Constitution should provide&mdash;whatever else may be provided by a Franchise Bill&mdash;that the Universities should have special representation. Senator Blythe and Senator Douglas take a different line.  Their argument is distinctly based upon the expediency of University representation in the circumstances of this country at this time.  I think that argument would be very appropriate <Col N="1974" /> to a Bill for the revision of the constituencies.  If I might make a suggestion, I should very much like to support a proposal to delete Article 27 from the Constitution, and put it in some other form into a Revision of Constituencies Bill for, let us say, five years.  I think it could be maintained that it would be advisable as a matter of simple expediency, to retain a certain amount of University representation for a period of, say, five or ten years&mdash;I do not mind how long.  But I would do that with the clear understanding that it is simply part of the ordinary business of arranging constituencies to secure representation in the Dáil, and not as a constitutional right or part of the fundamental law.  I do not think there is any justification for the claim that the quality of the votes justifies, on that account, their special selection as being entitled by constitutional right to representation in Parliament.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion in the Dáil I noticed that Deputy McGilligan took the same line that Senator Brown took.  He dissented from the sugges tion made, that the claim for representation was for representation of educational interests.  It was because their training was in the direction of producing superior citizens&mdash;I do not want to use the word &ldquo;superior&rdquo; in any invidious sense&mdash;that University training gave better quality citizenship. So that Deputy McGilligan and Senator Brown appear to be of one mind as to the basic idea which is behind this constitutional provision for University representation.  It would seem to me, however, that if graduates of Universities are entitled to representation being specially provided for them, because of training in citizenship and in affairs, a better case could be made for a special constituency representing, let us say, those who have had five years' experience of local government, with responsibility and contact with affairs, public needs and requirements and with practical difficulties. This would provide a stronger case for representation because of training in citizenship.</P>
    <P>I think a much higher case could be made for that than for University <Col N="1975" /> representation.  One could pick out University graduates, and other than University graduates, who have attained proficiency in special walks of life, but it has been disowned that there is any question of vocational representation as educationists.  I am very glad that claim has not been made, because it is quite false and foolish. We are left then with two propositions, one is that University training gives special qualities to the voter which justifies that voter being provided by constitutional law with separate representation; the other is, that in the circumstances of the time it is advisable that University graduates should have representation in the Dáil.  That could be done much better, if it is to be done, through an Electoral Bill.  I have no argument in principle in favour of that. I can see advantages from the point of view of the expediencies of the moment, expediencies that would last, perhaps, for the next five, seven or ten years.  I would even go so far as to suggest to the Minister that he should think that over as a proposition and see if it would not commend itself to him in deference to the representations made.</P>
    <P>I am distinctly in agreement that for the five years I was in the Dáil, University representatives played a valuable part in the affairs of that House, much more valuable during that period than since.  I think one or two&mdash;one, shall I say&mdash;has in recent times played a very bad part, one of the most dangerous and destructive parts, in the work of that House, and in the work of the country.  He has forgotten, and I think thrown away the high character as a statesman that he won during the first five or seven years of his period <Col N="1976" /> of office.  However, that is by the way, merely to show that even University graduates and University representatives have not always such a quality of mind as to warrant special provision being made for them in the Constitution.</P>
