      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators are, no doubt, aware, the Government have decided to embark upon an experimental development of the industrial alcohol industry in the Saorstát.  The industrial alcohol industry has been established in a number of countries and various agricultural products are used for the purpose of producing the alcohol.  It can, in fact, be produced from any vegetable product, but those most frequently used are potatoes, beet, and sometimes corn.  There is a market for industrial alcohol as such &mdash;a market in industry&mdash;but not any very substantial market in this country at present.  In order to encourage its production and to confer upon the agricultural communities the benefits arising from its production, various Governments have adopted a system of requiring the compulsory admixture of home-produced industrial alcohol with imported petrol for motor fuel purposes.  It was the experience of those countries which decided us to examine the matter here and, following that examination, to engage upon a certain experimental development, because we found it impossible to arrive at any firm conclusion as to the possibilities of the industry here from a mere examination of data or the position in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was accordingly decided to erect a number of small distilleries capable of producing between them about 600,000 gallons of industrial alcohol and to base our calculations as to <Col N="212" /> whether there should be a larger scale development of the industry in this country upon the experience gained from the operations of these distilleries. The total quantity of alcohol to be produced under this scheme is, of course, a very small proportion of the amount of petrol used for fuel purposes at the present time.  Deducting from the quantity I have mentioned the amount of industrial alcohol that can be sold as such, replacing the alcohol at present imported, and the possibility of securing an increased use of it following various industrial developments here, the amount available for admixture with petrol for motor fuel purposes will be not more than 1½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The original intention was to establish this group of distilleries in the North Louth and adjoining areas because of the difficulties experienced by farmers in that area, which, as Senators are aware, is a scheduled black scab area, in disposing of potatoes under the present circumstances. Certain modifications of the original decision have had to be made. It was intended to have five small distilleries, capable of dealing with about 7,000 tons of potatoes each per annum, with one central refining plant.  It has now been provisionally decided to have two distilleries in the area I mentioned and two in County Donegal, one distillery in each case being of a somewhat larger size than originally contemplated, that is, capable of dealing with 10,000 tons of potatoes per annum instead of 7,000 tons.</P>
    <P>The distillery which will be established in the Cooley area will, we anticipate, be capable of dealing with the entire potato crop in that area. There will be another distillery somewhere in County Monaghan, although it is not yet definitely certain that the supply of potatoes which will be required to operate that distillery will be regularly available from that county.  The other two will be in County Donegal.  The peculiarity of North Louth and Donegal in respect of potato growing is that these areas have always grown potatoes for export and have apparently been <Col N="213" /> satisfied to continue growing potatoes, even though they have secured in the past substantially lower prices than farmers secured elsewhere, or would grow potatoes for elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give any firm indication of the price at which the alcohol will be available.  That will depend upon a number of factors which are at present unknown.  One of the principal factors is the starch content of the potatoes which can be grown here.  We have, of course, tested the starch content of various varieties of potatoes grown and we have got widely different results.  In some cases the starch content was as low as 6 per cent. and in other cases it was as high as 22 per cent.  It is hoped we will be able to secure, in the areas in which these distilleries will be established, a supply of potatoes with a starch content averaging about 18 per cent.  If potatoes can be secured with that starch content and at a price not less than the price which has been prevailing in these areas for potatoes during the past few years then, taking into account the present prices payable for the other products necessary, such as barley and coal, and also the prevailing rate of wages, we should be able to make the alcohol available to the petrol importers or refiners at a price possibly less, but certainly not more than, 2/- per gallon.</P>
    <P>That will depend upon the possibility of disposing of the by-product of the alcohol, which is called wash and which is used extensively on the Continent as a cattle food, at a price equivalent to a halfpenny a gallon.  It is the intention during the experimental period to have the State purchase the wash from the distilleries at that price and either dispose of it to the farmers by sale, or else dispose of it free.  So far as the industrial alcohol scheme is concerned, we are guaranteeing in respect of it that the price of the alcohol will not be increased by reason of difficulties in disposing of the by-product.  The Dáil has voted the necessary money to acquire land, erect buildings and purchase machinery. It is proposed to operate this experimental development as a purely State scheme.  The various matters <Col N="214" /> in connection with it will be-carried out by the Minister for Industry and Commerce directly, advised by a Committee, provision for which is made in the Bill.  The money required in the initial stages has been voted and certain progress has been made in the preparation of plans, the location of sites, the formation of the Committee and the examination of other problems likely to arise.  The matter could not proceed further in the absence of legislation, because it is necessary to confer on the Minister powers to acquire land to erect the distilleries, to sell the alcohol and so forth, and particularly powers to enter into a contract with a firm of technical experts in order to secure their advice and assistance throughout the operation of the experimental scheme.  That is the main purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is the operative section and it empowers the Minister to do all the things set out in the first sub-section&mdash;that is, to acquire land, to purchase, hire, or otherwise provide machinery, to purchase raw materials, to enter into contracts and so forth. Sub-section (2) indicates the nature of the agreement we contemplate making. It provides that the contractors shall prepare the plans, supervise the purchase and erection of the machinery, enter into certain undertakings as to the efficiency of the plant they erect, appoint for the period for which they will be under guarantee the managing director and the biological engineers and so forth.  It is necessary to give the contractors that power, because they will be required to guarantee the efficiency of the machinery. If the machinery should prove to be less efficient than they indicate, then certain penalties will be payable by them, and in order to enable them to ensure that the machinery will give the best results they must have the right, for a period at least, to nominate the persons responsible for its operation.  The skeleton contract also provides for the training of Saorstát citizens in the various technical processes of the industry.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill is similar to corresponding parts in other Bills of this <Col N="215" /> nature and it provides for the compulsory acquisition of land, the payment of compensation and power to operate transport works which may be necessary in connection with the scheme.  Part 4 of the Bill makes provision to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to require the petrol importers, and refiners, to purchase the industrial alcohol available from the distilleries in whatever quantity it may be available and at whatever price may be fixed.  Provision is made for the establishment of an Industrial Alcohol Advisory Board. That board has been constituted of certain officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce, an officer of the Department of Agriculture and certain Irish experts in chemical matters.  They have consented to act with the managing director appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Bill on the nomination of the contractors.</P>
    <P>The financial provisions are quite simple.  It is proposed that every year there should be voted from the Exchequer all the moneys required in connection with the operation of the distilleries and that all the sums received in respect of them should be paid into the Exchequer, so that the fullest possible financial control over the whole business is retained for the Dáil.  Various doubts have been expressed about the wisdom of proceeding with this development mainly because the price at which industrial alcohol is available in other countries, where similar schemes are operated, appears to be high.  It is not possible to find out with any degree of certainly what is the actual cost of producing industrial alcohol in other countries.  The only information we have got is the price actually fixed, the price at which petrol monopolies are required to purchase it.  That varies from one country to another, the lowest being 1/6 and the highest 3/6 per gallon.  There may be, and probably there are, various factors which will reduce the price in one case below the actual production cost and increase it in other cases above the production cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what amount is involved?  He mentioned that the Dáil has voted the necessary finance for the initial expenditure, but he did not state the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £100,000.  It is contemplated the actual cost of the distilleries&mdash;erecting buildings, purchasing plant, etc.&mdash;will be about £60,000, and that the acquisition of land and the construction of roadways and perhaps railways will absorb some of the balance.  Provision is also included in that sum for working capital for the present year.  I do not know how far we are likely to get in the present year.  I do not think it will be possible to get more than one of the distilleries established because of the period of the year. Probably there will be one in the Cooley area that will deal with some portion of this year's potato crop, although I understand the conditions in the market are such that there will be no difficulty of disposing of that crop.  There has been throughout the Continent a considerable shortage of potatoes, and in Germany the import duties on potatoes have been reduced in order to maintain the home supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual employment that will be given under the scheme is not very substantial.  The number of people to be employed in each distillery will not be more than ten or 12.  The main benefit will be to the agricultural community and the town in which the distillery is located.  The whole thing is only experimental.  I want to stress that.  I cannot give anything in the nature of a definite programme such as is made out in connection with any industrial policy that may be undertaken, for instance in regard to the sugar beet scheme. We do not know what the result will be.  We hope it will be good.  Certain persons who have gone into the matter are optimistic that it will be possible to produce industrial alcohol here under better conditions than elsewhere. <Col N="217" /> On the other hand, it may prove a complete failure and not worth establishing to an extent beyond the experimental stage. That has all to be determined. The various factors I have mentioned, the average starch content that can be realised, the period of the year in which the factories can be operated, the possible commercial market for by-products, and the possibility of developing the ordinary commercial market for alcohol have all to be determined. The effect of the experiment upon the price of petrol will be negligible. The very small addition of alcohol to petrol required under the Bill, cannot have any substantial effect upon the price, having regard to the fact that alcohol will not be liable to the tax petrol is liable to.  We feel that that should be indicated.  People here complain of our petrol tax of 8d. per gallon.  I took the precaution of finding out what the tax was in other countries and I find that ours is one of the lowest in the world.  In some countries it is 2/- per gallon.  I do not suppose that we shall ever raise our tax to that figure.</P>

      <P>What is it in America?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In America it is not very high.  It is best expressed in this way. About one-third of what the consumer pays in America is the tax.  Here it is 8d. out of 1/7; and it will not be necessary to increase the tax on petrol because of this development.  In fact, with the various projects in contemplation and various developments taking place, we may have motor fuel cheaper here than in other countries. If that is so, no burden will fall upon the people from the operation of this measure which I commend to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us, so far as I can gather, that this is a pure experiment, and in the latter portion of his observations he indicated he was not very clear as to what the result of the experiment would be&mdash;whether it would be a success or a failure.  He <Col N="218" /> was certainly doubtful, if we succeeded in producing industrial alcohol, at what price it could be sold to the purchaser. I am not going to pretend I am an authority on this, or that I have anything more than a superficial knowledge of the subject.  The only point I put forward is that this experiment is going to cost £100,000.  It seems to be an adventure into the unknown, judging from the speech of the Minister. It is going to involve the setting up of four distilleries.  I would like to know is an exhaustive experiment such as the Minister contemplates necessary to be embarked upon.  And is it necessary to incur the expenditure of erecting four factories?  Could an experiment which would be equally complete not be tried on a smaller scale in view of the uncertainty indicated by the Minister as to what the outcome of such an experiment may be?  I read a report of the discussion in the Dáil and I noted the figures given and I ask the Minister would not an experiment much less expensive prove equally conclusive so far as a matter of this kind is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to follow up what Senator Milroy has just said. The Minister has given us a very fair account of the Bill and its proposals, and they would seem from what he told us to be water-tight.  On the other hand, he touched very lightly upon what the cost will be and upon what the result of the experience of other countries in this matter has been.  I think before we finally decide upon the matter the House should be made aware of the results of certain experiments, and what actually occurred in other countries engaged in the production of industrial alcohol.  The Minister has mentioned the fact that the production of this industrial alcohol has been brought about almost entirely for the benefit of the agrarian interest, and where the agrarian interest is very strong.  Experience has shown that little would have been heard of alcoholic motor fuels had it not been for the political pressure exercised by agrarian interests.  Where agrarian interests are powerful, whether in continental <Col N="219" /> Europe, South Africa and Australia, the Argentine or the United States, a domestic alcohol agitation is always active.  Leaving that and coming to the manufacture in other countries of industrial alcohol, it has been found to be an uneconomic commercial proposition.  There is no question, I believe, on that score.  Granted that is the case, then we have to look about to see how the loss can be made as small as possible.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, the British Government set up a Fuel Research Board, which went very closely into the subject of all fuels for power purposes. Several reports were issued by the board and are available now.  One of these reports specially dealt with the subject of fuel research in connection with the motor industry, and in that report they went exhaustively into the different materials which could be used for the production of alcohol.  It came down to practically three possible raw materials which would be suitable for Ireland for this purpose &mdash; potatoes, mangolds and sugar beet.  Of the three, the most economic material was, undoubtedly, the potato.  This, however, is what they reported at the end of their experiments&mdash;I am reading from the report of the British Fuel Research Board:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is very unlikely that potatoes can be grown at a price which would make it possible to obtain alcohol from them for use as an alternative to petrol at anything approaching its present price. Stated briefly, one ton of potatoes produced 20 gallons of power alcohol, so that every pound sterling it costs to grow a ton of potatoes is equivalent to one shilling on a gallon of alcohol for the raw material only.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would put a shilling on to the price of the imperial gallon of alcohol.  I do not know whether farmers in this country would care to grow potatoes at £1 a ton.  Perhaps my friend, Senator Wilson, would be able to tell us whether it is an economic proposition to grow potatoes at £1 a ton. <Col N="220" /> It may be so, but I can hardly think that he would, and even if he could, the price of the spirit produced by his patriotic endeavours would be prohibitive in cost.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, in a report on agricultural conditions in the Saorstát, recently reported that the lowest price for potatoes then ranged between £4 and £8 a ton.  If £4 a ton had to be paid for the raw material for the production of alcohol, that would at once put 4/- on each gallon of alcohol produced.  Excluding Revenue duties&mdash;that is to say, the Excise duties&mdash;some recent comparative prices of petrol and power alcohol per imperial gallon in the following countries have been ascertained to be as follows:&mdash;In Germany, the cost of petrol 4d. a gallon, and of alcohol, produced principally from potatoes, 41d.; in Czecho-Slovakia, petrol 3¾., and alcohol 35d.; in Hungary, petrol 4¼., and alcohol 30d.; in Italy, petrol 4¼., and alcohol 26d.  When it comes then to the use of these substances, the duty in the one case and the subsidy in the other &mdash;because there must be a subsidy for the production of the alcohol&mdash;level up the price to the consumer; but it should not be forgotten that in both cases&mdash;and more particularly in the case of alcohol&mdash;the taxpayer really pays the bill.</P>
    <P>Then, again, the figures in connection with alcohol as a State enterprise are amazing.  Take the case of France. In 1932, some two million hectolitres of power alcohol distilled from sugar beet cost the State 566,000,000 francs. An estimate recently published by the United States Secretary of Agriculture disclosed that the cost of producing power alcohol from maize, and making obligatory a ten per cent. blend with petrol, placed an extra burden on the consumer of about 575,000,000 dollars. Those are stupendous figures for the production of alcohol for use as a fuel.</P>
    <P>In my remarks, I have endeavoured to explain to the House, as far as I have been able to make out, that past experience has shown that the production of alcohol as a motor fuel, although it may, to some extent, relieve unemployment by tillage and agriculture <Col N="221" /> and the production of the raw material which it involves, still can never be looked upon as an economic proposition and that the cost must be borne by the State; that is to say, by the taxpayer.  I feel, however, that no great harm can be done by undertaking a limited experiment in the Saorstát as proposed by the Bill, always provided that until the practical results of the venture are known, the expenditure will be kept within strictly experimental limits. The Minister has told us that this undertaking is going to be an experimental one.  If that is so, as I say, I think that no harm may be done and it may be of considerable use.  If the expenditure is kept within experimental limits and is reasonably carried out in that way we will know what the results are likely to be.  I consider that £100,000 is nothing here or there for the purposes of experimenting and I do not consider it an unreasonable sum, but I hold that no large grants should be asked for and no heavy expenditure made until the results of these experiments are known.  If anybody is interested in the subject, I might add that they can obtain much information from the reports published by the Fuel Research Board on Fuel for Motor Transport.  The reports are available and are extremely interesting. The researches they undertook are very interesting indeed and the reports give very valuable information.</P>
    <P>There is another subject that has not been touched upon by the Minister very much, and that is the admixture of the alcohol produced with petrol. People who go in for motoring will probably be able to speak of that.  I understand that it has not been an unqualified success and the proportions in which the mixture has been fixed by different countries vary very much&mdash;I believe, from ten per cent. to thirty per cent.  I do not know what particular percentage has been found to be the best, but I have reason to believe that people who motor a great deal, and who understand the use of these fuels for motoring purposes, do not welcome the admixture of alcohol and petrol.  It may involve a considerable outlay and expense in the production <Col N="222" /> of engines that are suitable for any mixture of that description.  However, that is a matter for people who are more qualified than I to speak on the subject and who know more about the internal combustion engine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the House is very much indebted to Senator Guinness for the very fair and helpful speech which he made on this subject.  It is true to say that the Minister has introduced this measure with very great moderation, and I think he might, if he chose, have adopted a much more hopeful and confident tone in relation to this question of industrial alcohol.  The subject does not begin and end with the question of price.  The manufacture of alcohol from potatoes, beet, sugar or mangolds will have a very beneficial indirect effect upon the agricultural community.  Potatoes are a crop in regard to which you cannot say beforehand whether you will have a bumper harvest or not.  Sometimes potatoes are scarce and at other times they are so plentiful that the farmer does not know what to do with them. That happened, the year before last There was a tremendous crop of potatoes in the country and, I think as a result, they were down as low as 1½d. per stone.  That is the £1 a ton referred to by Senator Guinness.</P>
      <P>Senators must remember that when the price of potatoes is spoken of it is the price of selected potatoes&mdash;the big ones.  The potatoes useful as human food are the potatoes spoken of.  But there are small potatoes, and I think these can be used in the manufacture of industrial alcohol.  Another very important consideration, and one in which I would defer to the opinion of Senator Guinness, is this&mdash;the wash from the distillery is a very useful food for cattle.  It is a kind of food which is specially useful for cows in those parts of the country where potatoes are grown.  I have in mind a place where a factory, even an experimental factory, would be of the greatest advantage to the people of the area.</P>

When you want a lead in Ireland you go to Clare, but when you want to start a factory you do not go there, because we never ask for anything.  It is not in County Clare but it is a place in the County Galway, not far removed from Clare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure my friend has heard of &ldquo;Old Kinvara and the Old Plaid Shawl.&rdquo;  It is there I am going to suggest that the Minister should establish one of his experimental factories and for this reason&mdash;it so happens that at the present time that district in County Galway seems to be suffering very much indeed.  I am told that around the little seaport of Kinvara&mdash;a very good port too&mdash;the people are very poor indeed.  It is an area around which potatoes are grown, and potatoes of a description of absolutely the very best for the manufacture of alcohol because the starch content of the potatoes in that district is very high indeed.  Senator Milroy will understand what I mean when I say that they are &ldquo;floury&rdquo; potatoes&mdash; potatoes with the highest content of starch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment now. My friend Senator Johnson says that potatoes with a high starch content are the worst.  I happen to have some knowledge of the distilling of what was called patent spirits.  Of course that is not alcohol of the description that is manufactured in the distilleries in the City of Dublin.  But it is called patent spirit because it was made in a patent still.  My recollection is that when the prices of materials were something about the same as they are now, it was possible to turn out patent spirits&mdash;that is this spirit&mdash;at 1/3 a gallon.  It used to be done at that figure when the prices of materials were somewhat the same as now.  Therefore when the Minister mentions 2/- a gallon I think <Col N="224" /> he is rather conservative in his estimate. I am thankful to Senator Guinness for the statement which he made upon this subject and also for the fact that he does not discourage this and because he is in favour of experimental distilleries being set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Guinness mentioned 2/3 a gallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he did.  He is going on figures.  Senator Guinness gave us exact figures and I accept every statement he has made on this subject.  He said that in Germany petrol was 4d. a gallon and this industrial alcohol was 41 pence a gallon. In Czecho-Slovakia it is 35 pence a gallon for industrial alcohol and in Italy industrial alcohol costs 26 pence a gallon. Now Italy is a country which is not suitable for the growth of potatoes. Of the three countries&mdash;Germany, Hungary and Italy&mdash;Italy is the country which is least suitable for the production of potatoes.  For that reason I say that if the cost of the alcohol is high in Germany or Prussia&mdash;a good potato producing country&mdash;and in Czecho-Slovakia where potatoes will grow in great abundance, what I submit is that there must be some special reason for it.  I believe there was a famine of potatoes in some of these areas last year and the year before. This year, I understand, there is a famine of potatoes in Germany and that is probably the reason why the import duties are withdrawn.  Senator Johnson may be able to enlighten you further on these subjects.  But my objection&mdash;and it is an objection to the scheme so far as we have heard it&mdash;is that of all these factories, and there are five, two are in Louth.  I do not object to that.  There is to be one in Monaghan and two in Donegal.  Why should there not be at least one in the Province of Connaught or in the Province of Munster?</P>

      <P>I am entitled to give my opinion from my knowledge of these matters and I do submit when one is considering the advantage to agriculture of the by-products that every consideration should be taken into account in the matter of the manufacture of industrial alcohol in this country.  This thing will be a success.  For that reason, I do make a suggestion to the Minister, because the Minister has said that his plans are not definite and that they are still subject to variations.  I do make the suggestion to the Minister that one of these experimental distilleries should be established in the South of Connaught in the area around Kinvara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a complaint to make on this Bill which I have made before.  I should like to throw out a suggestion for the Minister's consideration that, whenever Bills of this kind are brought forward, it would be very helpful to either House if the Minister would adopt the practice of other countries and produce something in the nature of an explanatory White Paper giving the basis of calculation of the cost and a general explanation, over which one could ponder, of the intentions and purposes of these Bills. That applies particularly to Bills where statistics are involved which cannot be examined on a Second Reading statement.  Such procedure would, in my view, certainly lessen the burden thrown on Ministers in either House, <Col N="226" /> because all the questions that inevitably arise would probably be forestalled by the White Paper circulated. I throw out that suggestion, and regret that it has not been adopted in the case of this Bill as it was in the case of one or two other Bills.  It has never been adopted as a general procedure.</P>
      <P>I think it is very desirable that the Minister should be encouraged to enter into experiments for the development of industrial activities arising directly out of agriculture. I take it this is part of a general policy, I think an inevitable policy, to divert the products of agriculture to industrial purposes instead of trying to export them to markets that are being closed.  If we take the Cooley area as one illustration, and the Donegal area as another, the necessity for some outlet for agricultural produce is forced on the mind of the Ministry.  This is one of the methods for finding an alternative use for agricultural products.  I think it is very desirable that the Minister should be encouraged to experiment in such directions.  This is not an experiment that is entirely new.  I think Senator Milroy is slightly under a misapprehension in appearing to think that it is an experiment on the technical or scientific side.  I take it that the experiment is rather on the agricultural side, as to whether produce can be obtained in anything like the quantities and the right quality from these districts to make it reasonably economical&mdash;that is to say, that the cost will not be overwhelming by using potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the reason that these northern counties have been chosen for the experiment is because the other industrial agricultural process&mdash;the beet sugar factories&mdash;had been allocated to the south and the west. That is a very good reason, I think, for giving the north a chance in respect to this particular experiment. Apart from that the northern counties have specialised in potato production. But I am a little bit at a loss on one point.  Perhaps the Minister, from the knowledge acquired by reading up this subject, would be able to explain the difference between myself and <Col N="227" /> Senator Comyn.  I have an idea&mdash; where I got it from I cannot state&mdash; that the potatoes that are suitable for and that are specially desired for use as human food&mdash;the light, floury potato that the Senator speaks of as being specially favoured by the people in Kinvara and district&mdash;is not the potato that is most useful for the production of industrial alcohol, and that the Continental potatoes are soapy, thick and unpleasant for human food.  Those are the potatoes that are mostly grown for this purpose. If that is so, then it will require, I take it, a selection of a special seed for this purpose, just as special seeds are required for the production of the best quality of sugar beet.  I should like to know whether the Minister is contemplating any change in the seeds in use in these areas.</P>
    <P>Further, there is a statement that I am not able to reconcile with the figures from the agricultural statistics &mdash;that is as to the average crops of potatoes of the kind we have been used to producing for food, animal and human.  The annual average yields up to 1926 very seldom reached six tons to the acre and were generally round about four and five tons to the acre.  The quinquennial averages are generally round about four to five tons per acre in recent years.  In the earlier years of the last century&mdash; the middle of the last century&mdash;the yield was down to two and three tons per acre on the average.  That is the average yield of course and it may be that in Monaghan and Donegal the averages are higher in the case of potatoes that usually have been grown there.  The Minister will probably be able to tell us whether, in any of the selected parts where the particular kind of potatoes that will be useful for this purpose have been grown, much higher averages have been obtained than five or six tons per acre.  I notice that eight tons per acre has been mentioned and even higher than eight tons per acre.  That may be possible but I am doubtful whether it is likely to average as high as that until there is a new variety of potatoes sown for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> When one comes to deal with the variety of potatoes and the yield then one can make some estimate of the possibilities of the return to agriculture and that I assume is really the question that has to be answered &mdash;what kind of return is going to be given to the grower of the produce, recognising, of course, that the petrol user, on the one hand, and possibly to same degree the taxpayer&mdash;most certainly the petrol user&mdash;is going to pay the cost which this experiment as to the future successful use of alcohol will entail.  I think it is a desirable experiment.  I think it is a desirable that it should be tested over areas in different parts of the country.  I do not think the cost that is indicated is very high.  Many industrial organisations would be very willing to experiment to the extent of £100,000 if there was a fair prospect of a successful outcome, so that we need not grumble at the projected cost.  I think it would have been desirable if we had more precise information as to the possibilities of this scheme laid before us apart from the Minister's speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, my friend seems to suggest that I said that the potatoes in the neighbourhood of Kinvara, where they specialise in potato growing, were floury potatoes.  He seemed to argue that, because they are floury, the starch content is low.  That is not the case at all.  Soapiness in potatoes will result from the class of manure used.  If you use seaweed, you are sure to have soapy potatoes.  I do know that the sugar content of all crops in that area is higher than in any other part of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Comyn, I have only one objection to this Bill. That is, that, so far as I heard, no factory is to be reserved for Tipperary. The Minister has, of course, the right to alter his decision as to where the factories will be, and I am sure that he will not forget that there is such a place on the map as Tipperary, whatever about Clare.  I think that Senator Comyn, in his remarks about the manufacture of alcohol in Clare, could have <Col N="229" /> given us far more information than he did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Senator was only trying to protect Clare from the reputation of being a bootlegging county.  I believe that this is a very necessary measure.  For a considerable time, I have been urging various Ministers to make an effort to get back to horses as against automobiles&mdash;to develop the use of horses so as to encourage the horse trade and the agricultural industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a great number of people like Senator Counihan who, when we talk on the lines I have suggested, speak of &ldquo;putting back the clock.&rdquo;  I am prepared to meet any criticism so far as putting back the clock is concerned because I believe that the only alternative to putting back the clock or getting back to horses is the proposal contained in this Bill&mdash; to provide some, at least, of the requirements of the automobile trade within the country.  Month after month, an increasing amount of money has been leaving the country for the running of automobiles.  In my opinion, we could not continue along those lines and keep on paying out this money indefinitely.  I should welcome any measure like this, designed to keep some of that money at home and devote it to some more useful purpose than that to which it has hitherto been devoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out, it is not expected that this Bill will absorb a great number of the unemployed. But I suggest that a considerable amount of employment will be given where it is most necessary&mdash;in the rural areas.  The argument has been used that the price of potatoes for this purpose will be low.  I can assure the House that the rural districts would be fighting for one of these factories if they had any chance of getting it and would be quite ready to grow the potatoes at the price suggested.  The price of potatoes may not be as good as it has been in years <Col N="230" /> gone by.  But when we take into consideration that other agricultural products have fallen in price, it is reasonable to suggest that potatoes can be grown, even at the price suggested in this measure, perhaps more economically than many other agricultural products.  There is not much necessity to go into the figures as to the tonnage per acre that can be grown.  We all know that, in the case of early potatoes, the crop is far lighter than it is for other classes.  We also know that, in districts where they go in for the extensive feeding of potatoes to pigs, they can produce a crop of potatoes which would give the tonnage contemplated by this measure &mdash;eight tons per acre.  I believe that, with experiments, a greater yield than that could be got.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that this Bill represents an experiment.  Senator Comyn says it is not an experiment. I am inclined to agree, more or less, with Senator Comyn, because this industry has been tried in other countries and has proved successful. What can be done in other countries, so far as the potato crop is concerned, can certainly be done here.  I notice that power is given under one section of the Bill to acquire land compulsorily. I suppose, before we finish, Senator Counihan, as the champion of liberty, will get up and attack that section.  If I might make a suggestion to the Minister, it would be that he should consider seriously the taking over of some of the derelict holdings in the country for the purpose of providing potatoes for this experiment, as he described it.  We have heard that potatoes cannot be grown economically in some parts of the country.  It is quite possible that we shall have some kind of campaign to prevent farmers growing potatoes.  I think it is a very sane proposition to put to the Minister that he should take over derelict holdings for the growing of the necessary potatoes.  The land is there and is not being used.  We cannot, so far, make alcohol or anything else out of the grass.  The Minister should take over these derelict holdings, take men off the unemployment assistance lists and put them to work in producing the <Col N="231" /> necessary potatoes.  In that way the necessary raw material for this industrial alcohol could be produced on economic lines.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to have serious doubts as to the advisability of having an admixture of industrial alcohol in petrol.  During the war, when petrol was at a prohibitive price and was hard to get at any price, several people will remember that motors were run in this country practically altogether on paraffin.  I myself ran a car for a considerable number of years solely on paraffin.  I merely used petrol for starting the car.  When it was heated, it ran very well, indeed, on paraffin. Though I have never tried it, I am quite sure that this industrial alcohol will be far superior to paraffin and that the admixture suggested by the Minister will have no detrimental effect whatever.  I believe that this measure will do a considerable amount of good in the country.  When the Minister has tried this experiment, as he calls it, for a year or two years, with four or five factories, I am sure that we shall have factories in Clare, Tipperary and several other places where the people are very anxious to have factories at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this is an experiment and inasmuch as the amount of money involved is comparatively small, judging by the lavish way money is being spent, I suppose we cannot object to this Bill.  However, I do feel, like Senator Johnson, that we might have been told more about the proposal.  I feel sure that the Minister has called in advisers and has had reports on this subject from technical people and I think that he should have taken us into his confidence and made these reports available.  On the occasion of the introduction of the Shannon Scheme, we saw the reports of the experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to know if the Minister has considered the question of operating this experiment through concessionaires.  I know that Senator Quirke and Senator Comyn would not like that suggestion.  But if I were going into this proposition, I should <Col N="232" /> seriously consider calling in people like Imperial Chemicals and saying &ldquo;You are doing this class of work, or a class of work allied to it, all the time.  You have highly-paid chemists and experts whom, perhaps, a small State like this could not afford to employ.  At what will you operate an experiment of this kind for us?&rdquo;  I am sure that you would get better results in that way than in the way proposed by this Bill. The scheme would also be free from political trammels which, I am sure, the Minister knows any State scheme involves.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to say whether he has considered that.  I fail to see why an experiment on the scale indicated is necessary.  Surely the quality of the potatoes is a matter of analysis.  Why should not one of these distilleries alone be sufficient instead of establishing four?  I do not want to be sinister in my suggestion, but I cannot help feeling that there is a certain amount of political flag-wagging in this and of saying to people, &ldquo;You are all going to get one,&rdquo; although I observe that Tipperary and Clare are still not provided for.  The sum involved in this is £100,000.  Perhaps it is cheap at the price in order to get experience, although in face of the figures given by Senator Guinness I should be inclined to doubt whether it is worth going on with at all.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that I think is important as well as practical in dealing with a Bill of this kind.  It was the statement of the Minister that the financial provisions were simple.  I suggest that they are too simple.  There are no accounts going to be published.  We are to be given just the total sum of money put into this and the surplus coming out of it.  I am sure the Minister will have regard to the suggestion that there should be a profit and loss account published.  If there is nothing coming out of it, what does anybody know except that there has been a loss.  I think that the House and the public ought to know the measure of the loss and what it is costing. I think that we ought to have in the <Col N="233" /> case of all State schemes a profit and loss account.  In the Bill dealing with the slaughter of cattle, power is taken by the Minister to publish a profit and loss account and to issue a balance sheet and all the rest of it in connection with any enterprise that he may engage in.  I submit that in this case there should be a profit and loss account published as well as the usual returns.  I intend to put down an amendment to that effect for the Committee Stage of the Bill.  There is one other matter that I would like the Minister to bear in mind.  Frankly, I am terribly afraid of the sort of spirit running through the speeches of Senator Quirke and Senator Comyn, that these uneconomic schemes will be foisted on the country merely on account of their national value and regardless altogether of their cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Senator has misunderstood me.  My suggestion was this: that where a man had a farm which he held himself and could not make pay, a farm which was of no use to him so that he could not pay his land annuities or his rates, and that alongside of it you had the Government paying men home assistance, you should relieve him of his farm and the Government of the necessity of paying people home assistance and unemployment money by putting those people to work on that farm to produce potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite satisfactory for my purposes.  It confirms the point that I was trying to make that all these schemes should be influenced by their direct advantages. Anyone who had to make a living out of a scheme such as this naturally would not have regard for a moment to such considerations as the Senator has just mentioned.  There is a danger of the State getting into schemes of various kinds and supporting itself with that class of argument about derelict farms and mixing them up with the relief of unemployment and so on. <Col N="234" /> I feel there is a great danger that these schemes are being pushed forward on an unsound basis on account of political sentiment and their indirect effect on employment and so on.  I would ask the Minister to have regard to this, that we do not get this alcohol foisted on us as the tobacco scheme has been. It should not be foisted on us without some independent report and investigation.</P>
      <P>I know from experience as an ordinary traveller in France that while you can buy the mixture there the stuff is certainly inferior and involves additional expense in the upkeep of a car. You have to pay a higher price for it than for petrol.  I hope the Minister will meet us to this extent, that before he considers forcing the mixture on the public he will have a full investigation made by an independent body like the Fuel Research Board or the Automobile Association so that we may know what the effect of the use of it on the upkeep of different classes of cars is likely to be.  If we do use it, having that report before us, we shall at least be using it with our eyes open.  What I am afraid of is that the whole tendency of this policy is to force on us in the national interest the second best. I do not think it is fair to the people who can afford to buy the better article and wish to get value for their money. I do not think it is fair to force them to buy the second best, or to make them pay an inordinate price for what they want.  If power is going to be taken to force this mixture on the public, then the Minister should take steps to get an independent report of experiments carried out with it, and let the public know what they are getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the debate that took place in the Dáil on this Bill, and as far as I can gather, the figures that the Minister gave here to-day are not quite the same as the figures he gave in the Dáil.  He said there that he was counting on using 25,000 tons of potatoes between all the distilleries, and that the price of the potatoes would be 35/- per ton.  Senator Guinness pointed out that unless the alcohol is to be produced at an entirely uneconomic price to the users, the price for <Col N="235" /> the potatoes cannot be more than £1 a ton.  I think that before the House agrees to pass this Bill it should have a great deal more information about this mixture.  At the moment we are very much in the dark about it. Senator Sir John Keane said that we are being rushed into this.  I fear that we are being kept deliberately in the dark.  This is to be another experiment at the expense of the taxpayers. Senator Quirke said that the experiments carried out in other countries had proved that the production of industrial alcohol had been made a great success.  That is not so at all. The experiments carried out in other countries were not a success but a failure.  The Minister was asked in the Dáil why he did not pay some attention to an article that appeared in <i>Studies.</i>  It was written by a professor in Cork University, who had carried out experiments over a period of 18 years.  At the end of that time he came to this conclusion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My first impulse was to judge the whole product as so unfeasible as not to warrant further consideration. My opinion was based not on any doubt regarding the scientific aspect of the problem, which is perfectly straightforward, but on the cost of the product.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister seems not to have considered that at all.  When he was questioned about it he would not say whether he had given any attention to that article or not.</P>

      <P>Senator Guinness made a most valuable contribution to the debate on this Bill.  He told us of <Col N="236" /> what had happened in other countries in regard to the growing of potatoes. The Minister, in support of the Bill, is basing his arguments on a very high starch content&mdash;18 per cent&mdash;in the potatoes and of getting eight tons to the acre.  My father specialised for many years in the growing of potatoes. He purchased the most expensive manures and pursued the highest type of cultivation, and yet he rarely reached eight tons to the acre.  If a man gets five tons he is very well satisfied.</P>

      <P>No potatoes can be grown with any success unless with good cultivation and expensive manures.  These manures the farmers are not buying, as can be seen by the amount sold by the factories, for the best of all reasons&mdash;that they have not the money to buy them.  The acreage under potatoes is down by 2,000 this year as the result of poor prices and the inability of the farmers to buy manures.  One of the reasons why farmers took up the growing of beet at the very uneconomic price of 30/- per ton was that the factory advances £5 per acre for the buying of manures.  That is very attractive.  Otherwise, farmers would not be able to grow beet&mdash;could not do it&mdash;because they have no ready money and their credit is gone.  Will the Minister tell us if these distilleries when established will advance the money to the growers of potatoes to enable them to buy manure, as the Carlow beet factory has done from the beginning?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for fertilisers. The manures necessary for potatoes and beet are very expensive&mdash;the most expensive kinds of manure, like sulphate of ammonia and nitrate of soda. All these very expensive manures are necessary to produce anything like an economic crop.  The wonder is that the acreage has not gone down by a great deal more than 2,000.  Senator Comyn made an extraordinary statement about the effect of seaweed on potatoes.  I live in a district where for centuries seaweed has been used as a top-dressing in the cultivation of potatoes before the land is ploughed. This particular place produces even in wet seasons an exceptionally good floury potato.  The valuable constituent in seaweed is the potash, which is necessary for potatoes.  It is also used in the cultivation of beet, but it is not so necessary.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Johnson is right about the type of potato&mdash;that a totally different type of potato will have to be grown for this.  I am not sure about this, but I think he is right about the soapy kind being the most valuable for the starch content.  With regard to the wash, I wonder will that be taken.  Of course a halfpenny per gallon is very small if these figures turn out all right.  It happens that a large amount of molasses pulp is available to the farmers from the beet factory and it is being given back to the farmers free, except for the cost of carriage.  Many farmers will not use it themselves and there will be a large amount of it on the market.  The Beet Growers' Association is undertaking the marketing of it.  I certainly prefer that to this wash for dairy cows, as it is a very valuable food for them.  It is not so good for fattening cattle, but it is particularly good for dairy cows. I wonder, therefore, if there will be a market for this wash.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister take up this offer of Senator Quirke's?  We would be delighted to see him doing it.  It will relieve the State of the cost of unemployment assistance and we shall see how he makes it pay.  He has tried all his experiments on the dog so far, otherwise the farmer.  This is another fantastic thing at the expense of the taxpayer and the consumer, if it ever materialises.  Instead of the system which had evolved out of the long experience of the farmers we must have all these side issues to divert the people's minds and catch their votes for a little longer, as long as it will last.</P>

      <P>I cannot see any reason why Senator Comyn and Senator Quirke should get so excited over this Bill.  Every speaker up to the present has approved of the experiment which the Minister proposes to carry out for the production of <Col N="239" /> industrial alcohol.  The only objection raised was that the amount might not be so large.  That was only raised by Senator Milroy.  I agree with Senator Milroy.  We all approve of the experiment, but I think that it could be carried out and tested for a lesser amount than £100,000.  I do not know anything about the production of alcohol, either industrial or otherwise, but I know something about potatoes and cattle and pigs.</P>
      <P>I was very much struck by the figures given by Senator Guinness, who stated that potatoes should be bought at £1 per ton to produce alcohol at 1/- a gallon.  Anything more than 1/- per gallon for alcohol at first cost would be prohibitive.  It is being imported at present at 4d. per gallon, I think.  Potatoes are worth more than £1 per ton for feeding cattle and pigs.  Of course, it all depends on the price of other foodstuffs, but in normal times the Department of Agriculture reckon potatoes to be worth £2 per ton as a food for pigs.  That, of course, depends on the price of corn, Indian meal, cake and other foodstuffs being normal.  In some cases they would be worth more, according to the price which the other foodstuffs would be making.  That should be taken into consideration by the Minister when he is finally deciding on establishing these factories for the production of industrial alcohol.  A good deal has been said about the potatoes which are suitable for the production of industrial alcohol.  I think that could be settled by a greater expert than Senator Comyn.  The amount of potatoes produced per acre would average about eight tons.  If all the potatoes which Senator Comyn says will be used by the factories are taken into consideration, we could produce possibly nine tons to the acre.  That is a consideration.  We must take into account the cost of producing an acre of potatoes.</P>

      <P>No, a statute acre.  A lot will depend on the price of labour. <Col N="240" /> In a normal year an acre will produce eight tons, but an acre will not produce that quantity this year.  The price of potatoes differs in accordance with the return of the crop.  In a good year you will have, perhaps, more than twice the return as in a year that would not be so suitable. I think Senator Wilson will agree with that statement, and he knows more about potato production than any other Senator.  The cost of producing potatoes was reckoned some years ago at £25 an Irish acre.  For a statute acre the cost of production would be £15.  If you can get labour in County Tipperary at 15/- a week the cost of production would not be so much.  At the normal rate, paying a living wage, the cost of production would be £15.</P>

      <P>I was surprised to hear Senators discussing acres of potatoes when it is evident it is the man with the small area of potatoes whom the Government are seeking to subsidise. It would be much fairer, if they want votes, to subsidise Jameson to give a gallon of good alcohol in return for them.  It might make up in some measure for the loss of such a great industry as that of Messrs.  Guinness, largely through the economic excursions of the Government.  I understand one alcohol-producing plant is to be in a Minister's constituency in order to get rid of the scab potatoes there. It would be a sorry thing if every member of the Government had to have an industrial plant of a similar type manufacturing support for him. Donegal and Louth are to be the sites of these stills.  What is to be done when the industrial alcohol is made? There is no petrol engine that will use it.  What is to be done with the land when it is reduced in value by the <Col N="241" /> production of large quantities of potatoes? So far as I can see, the whole thing will not be economical.  It will reduce things to an impossible stage, because it cannot be made pay.</P>
      <P>There was an experiment carried out once and it may be of interest if I refer to it.  It was not run by this Government or by the last Government; it was run by a Government almost as philanthropically minded. There was a little wood near Mount Bellew.  It was an excellent wood and they thought it would make wonderful boxes for transporting things about. They needed a steam engine.  They sent down the steam engine, and a year afterwards they sent down an inspector.  When he arrived the wood had disappeared and there were no boxes.  He asked the people in the district what had happened, and they told him that it took all the wood to keep the engine going.  In this instance you will have your potatoes and your alcohol, but you will get no industrial return.</P>

      <P>In the Cooley area of Louth potatoes have been produced for generations in a very luxuriant and abundant manner.  At the moment there is no market for these people in which to sell their potatoes, because it is a black scab area.  They are not allowed to sell them here.  These people will not feed pigs.  This problem has been considered for several years past. I think it is an excellent idea if the Government put a factory there and utilise the potatoes for producing industrial alcohol.  I believe that it is in that area the experiment will have its greatest chance of success.  There are any amount of potatoes sold in County Dublin for 1/- a cwt.  Where a man has 20 acres of potatoes all the small ones are sold at 1/-.  Year after year small potatoes are sold in County Dublin to pig feeders at that price. The other potatoes fetch from 2/6 to 6/- a cwt.  I do not see why any farmer should object to this proposition.  As Senator Quirke said, hitherto we had to supply oats and hay to the horses and now that is altered by the introduction of the engine.  If we can feed the engine we will be probably getting <Col N="242" /> back to where we were before.  If you can supply the engine with motive power from the land, I think that is all in the right direction.  As regards the high starch content in our potatoes we may be able to improve it and perhaps give employment at not too costly a price to the State.  The fact is that we are consuming our own products and we are not importing. There is a good deal to be said for the experiment and, as a farmer, I am not going to oppose anything that will give work and at the same time have a chance of success.</P>

      <P>I have here figures showing the yield of potatoes per acre in Great Britain and Ireland for several years.  It is contained in the Third Memorandum of the Fuel and Motor Transport pamphlet issued by the Research Board.  In England, between the years 1914 and 1923, the average yield per acre was 5.7 tons; in Ireland, between the years 1917 and 1923, the average yield per acre was 4.90 tons per statute acre.  The report says that the average yield where potatoes were specially planted for many years for the production of industrial alcohol was somewhere about five tons per statute acre.  It is notable that the average yield in Ireland was only 4.90, which is lower than that of Great Britain.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister whether he has any information to give regarding the production of yeast from potatoes.  Many distillers producing alcohol have found yeast is more profitable than alcohol.  Alcohol is regarded, in some cases, as a by-product, whereas the yeast pays for the concern and the capital.  I wonder whether the Minister has any information upon that subject.  Another point upon which I would like some information is this: Distilleries will only be in use for a certain time of the year for industrial alcohol purposes.  Would it be possible to use them in the off-season for producing alcohol from other substances, possibly corn, and also producing yeast?</P>

      <P>Various matters have been raised in the course of this discussion which have a direct bearing on the matter we are considering.  A number of other matters raised were of questionable relevancy although they may have had some bearing upon the matter.  I have been asked if we could not undertake those experiments on a smaller scale than is contemplated, having regard to the fact that it is an experiment and that its results may not be satisfactory. That would not be possible. The scale on which we have undertaken experiments is the smallest that offers any prospect of success.  It is true that we are operating a number of separate distilleries, and that each will have for its purpose a separate unit, but they are all combined in one scheme in so far as consideration has to be given to one dehydrating plant where the product is finally prepared for use.  The alternative was to have one distillery and dehydrating plant dealing with about 28,000 tons of potatoes, as against four or five distilleries dealing with comparatively small quantities of potatoes but each associated with a dehydrating plant dealing with the production of all.  Certain views have been pronounced, obviously with the view of prejudicing this experiment by the quotation from garbled statements or articles written in certain periodicals.  These garbled statements were quoted here apparently from the <Col N="244" /> quotations made in the Dáil.  The quotations made in the Dáil were very unscrupulous and I assume that those who used the quotations here did not read the original articles in question but were confined in their quotations to the Dáil reports.  Otherwise they would have given honest quotations.  Senators will be glad to hear that the person who wrote the article from which quotations were made is a member of our advisory committee, and is at present visiting Germany and other countries where industrial alcohol is produced.  In his last article he has expressed the opinion that he is satisfied that we can make industrial alcohol in this country much better than any other country in Europe.</P>

      <P>I am not responsible for any report being made public, but he has consented to act as a member of our advisory committee.  I suggest to Senator Miss Browne that she should read the article in <i>Studies.</i>  In this case she puts herself in the position of those people in the Dáil who gave quotations by which they were obviously trying to deceive the House as to what the opinion of the writer was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the scheme will be, roughly, £100,000.  That will be the initial cost, but in subsequent years it is anticipated that revenue will meet outgoings and that no extra sum will fall upon the Exchequer.  There will be appropriations-in-aid resulting from the sale of the products and the one will balance the other.  It will be easy to do that inasmuch as we will have the power to compel the petrol refiners to purchase the spirit and use it.  The Minister will have to account for the cost of the scheme to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who will make annual reports upon the receipts and expenditure and upon any matters that may arise out of the receipts and expenditure of the scheme.  In addition, Section 17 of the Bill requires the Minister for Industry and Commerce to submit an annual report to <Col N="245" /> the Oireachtas, and, of course, it will be open to the Dáil to require full information concerning the scheme when the annual Vote comes up.  It has been urged in various quarters that we should have devised another scheme than that contemplated in the Bill, and established a statutory board with funds under its own control, which could act independently of the Dáil and not be under the supervision that the scheme will be as it is now proposed to be operated.  At a later stage, if the experiment is successful, and it is desired to extend these factories, we may contemplate setting up a board, such as the Electricity Supply Board; but at present we think it is better to have direct Ministerial control and responsibility.  We considered the possibility of having the work undertaken by concessionaires, but we thought it better not.  Any firm such as that mentioned by Senator Sir John Keane would require guarantees and experiments would have to be conducted within a certain time to secure against loss of all kinds. The particular manner in which we have undertaken to develop is likely to prove the cheapest upon the Exchequer whether the scheme is a success or a failure.</P>
    <P>Senator Guinness gave us certain figures and said that the calculation of the committee whose report he quoted from was that the relation between the price paid for potatoes and the price at which industrial alcohol could be produced for sale was £1 per ton in relation to 1/- per gallon. I do not contest that figure at all. In fact, I think that if we succeed in maintaining it, the experiment will have been successful.  In other words, if we can sell industrial alcohol at 2/- a gallon, paying £2 a ton for potatoes, the experiment will have been more successful than my opening remarks would indicate.  Whether that will prove to be so or not is what we are trying to find out.</P>
    <P>It is true that the production of industrial alcohol is not economic in the strict sense, any more than the production of beet sugar from beet is economic in the strict sense.  However, it has been adopted by many countries <Col N="246" /> from the broad point of view of national economic development and, perhaps, also for purposes of national defence.  What we have to bear in mind is that in the development of such enterprises the whole trend has been to take into account other considerations than those of the accountant in determining whether projects of this nature should be embarked upon, and the sole purpose of the experiment was to find out whether the sum of all the benefits to be derived outweighs the financial disadvantage involved.  There are, of course, commercial uses for industrial alcohol which appear to be increasing.  Senator Comyn, however, seemed to give an indication that this industrial alcohol might have a use which we did not contemplate, when he bracketed it with patent still whiskey.  This industrial alcohol, as such, is not capable of human consumption, I understand, although it has been alleged that certain of the liqueurs for which high prices are paid consist merely of industrial alcohol with a little flavouring.</P>
    <P>Whether potatoes with a high starch content are floury or not, or have other distinctive qualities, I do not know.  My experience has been that the appearance of the potato was due to the art of the cook, but I profess to be entirely ignorant about potatoes &mdash;how they are grown or how one determines the starch content from their appearance.  In fact, if Senator Miss Browne assured me that they were grown on trees I would not have the courage to contradict her.  Certain statements have been made about the yield of the potatoes per acre. Certain people, who have gone into the matter with considerable care, have expressed and always have expressed considerable doubt as to the accuracy of our statistics in relation to yields per acre and whether or not the average figure which is published in the book of statistics is the correct average figure or not.  It is liable to lead people into wrong conclusions. The fact is that we have got to consider not what is the over-all average for Ireland in relation to this industry, but the yields which have been attained and are being attained <Col N="247" /> in the areas where these distilleries are going to operate.  Senators will know that I gave in the Dáil the figures for 1932 which was a fairly good year in those areas.  In County Louth the average yield as shown in the statistics was ten tons per acre and in County Donegal 10.3 tons per acre.  It is quite possible that the actual yield may have been higher than these figures would indicate.  It is correct that one must be very careful in arriving at conclusions based on these figures, or on the average prices as published.</P>
    <P>Industrial alcohol distillers can use all the produce taken out of the ground, whether suitable for human consumption or not&mdash;big potatoes or small potatoes&mdash;but these average prices are only related to potatoes suitable for sale for human consumption. The price also varies from year to year, of course.  One can never tell what the yield is going to be, and the season, the acreage sown, and all the rest of it, fix the price, because there are a number of factors which make it a crop, the price of which can fluctuate very considerably from year to year.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Browne, however, apparently assumed that the low price which potatoes are fetching now, and are likely to fetch, is due in some way to the Government.  Of course I know that certain Senators feel that they must blame the Government for all faults, but I would like to inform Senator Miss Browne what the average prices of potatoes were in the two areas where we propose to establish those distilleries during the year when the best of all possible Governments was in office here.  In 1929 the average price obtained by growers in the Cooley area for selected potatoes was 17/6 a ton.</P>

The price obtained in Donegal in 1932 for various varieties of potatoes was as follows: For a variety known as Up-to-Date the price averaged between 17/6 and 33/4.  One was the lowest price and the other the highest price.  For Kerr's Pink the price averaged the same, and in the case of Arran Banner the price was from 15/- to 25/-.  In 1933 the prices were somewhat higher, but the average price was well below 35/- in each case for each variety.</P>

I mention these figures to indicate that there is no reason to anticipate that at the price I have mentioned any difficulty will be experienced in obtaining a supply.  We have no reason to think that it will not be possible to get farmers to grow very willingly all the potatoes we require at the price we contemplate paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Gogarty said that we will get the potatoes and the alcohol but that we will not get an industrial return.  I wrote that down when he said it and I have been trying to find out its sense or meaning since. The Senator is supposed to be a wit and, as one Senator laughed at what he said, I presume that statement must be witty but I do not know what it means.  He also implied that the whole purpose of the scheme was to buy votes and suggested that we could buy the vote of any farmer by giving him a gallon of whiskey. Senator Milroy laughed at that particular remark, so I presume that also was witty.  That is the type of remark that used to be made about 50 years ago.  I think that Senator Gogarty has the copyright of that particular type of slander against the Irish people.  We do not mind him abusing the Government but we object to him abusing the country and the people.  However, nobody takes him seriously.  In case they do take him seriously, I suggest that he or other Senators should not bring in the names of industrial concerns for <Col N="249" /> the purpose of scoring off the Government. Senator Gogarty said that the firm of Guinness, which is and will continue to be of very great importance to this country, had decided to change its methods of production because of the activities of the Government.  I would point out to him and other Senators that that statement is not true and that it has not been made by members of the firm and that the making of such statements by him might react against the interests of that firm and consequently against the interests of the country.  I think that we might keep remarks of that kind out of the sphere of political controversy that Senator Gogarty engages in.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that I cannot say what the effects of this particular scheme on the successful development of the Drumm battery will be.  As far as that goes, I see where some French engineer has succeeded in developing power out of sea water at a nominal cost, but if we were to go on the assumption that because somebody might find a better or cheaper method of producing an article we should not embark on certain industrial enterprises, there would be no progress.</P>
    <P>You have got to take these risks and it is quite possible the French engineer may find some flaw in this system.  On the other hand, the development of the Drumm battery can take place without any diminution whatever in the consumption of petrol here.  It has certain definite characteristics and it provides for and can cater for transport of a definite kind.  But unless it is developed considerably beyond its present stage and unless some new factor comes into the picture, it is not likely to be able to replace entirely the ordinary combustion engine now used for transport purposes.  Senator Sir Coey Bigger asks certain questions which I would not like to attempt to answer because this is a matter which we undertake by way of experiment. What the outcome of that experiment is I do not know, and I would not like to offer information, particularly in this case, upon matters on which my personal information would not be of any <Col N="250" /> value.  But we are hoping that the development of this and similar industries which involve the employment of chemists will create possibilities of production and development of various kinds that have not been explored up to the present.  It has been the general characteristic of all chemical industries that their ultimate and full development cannot be forecasted, because new developments and new possibilities of production are being created every day, and it is not at all impossible that the development of this industry in the experimental stage which we contemplate, even though it may not be fully successful on the basis that we contemplate operating, may nevertheless have a future for it upon other bases which may emerge at some moment.</P>

      <P>I just want to say that it is not quite fair for the Minister to take as an example the Cooley district. Some Senator said that they would sell potatoes there at any price because they will not feed pigs with them.  In my county, Wexford, which is one of the greatest pig feeding counties in the country, no farmer would ever think of offering or selling potatoes at 15/- or 17/- or at even £1 a ton.  I know that in Wexford potatoes were shipped at from £3 to £4 a ton.  Even at the present price of pigs, potatoes would be the cheapest food, but we would not sell them to anybody at £1 a ton.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to extend the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1932.  That Act, as Senators will remember, was introduced in order to give some measure of control over the entry of foreign owned firms into industry in this country.  In fact, it was designed to give the barest minimum of control, and, as it came into operation, it became apparent that some greater measure of control would be necessary in time, particularly as various methods of evading the obligations of that Act were, in due course, invented and put into operation.  When that Act was in process of enactment by the Oireachtas, many members of both Houses had considerable doubts as to the wisdom of conferring upon the Minister the powers which it proposed to confer, and various amendments were proposed, both in the Dáil and the Seanad, designed to remove what members of each House believed to be dangers arising out of the form of the measure. Experience gained in the past two years has shown that the existence of these powers was very necessary and, in fact, a number of those who were most diffident about the Act of 1932 have since been associated with demands addressed to the Government that the Act should be amended and made more restrictive and that the powers of the Government should be made more effective.  That is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators who have glanced through the Bill will, no doubt, be intimidated by the form of it.  It is drafted in a manner which makes it not very easy to follow, but its purpose is quite simple.  The operative section is Section 9.  Section 9 replaces Section 2 of the Principal Act and is, in the main, similar to Section 2 of the original Act.  The main change which <Col N="253" /> it effects is that after the 2nd July, 1934, it shall not be lawful for any company to engage in manufacturing enterprise in this country unless not merely 51 per cent. of its issued shares are owned by nationals of the Saorstát, but also unless two-thirds of any class of shares carrying voting rights are similarly owned.  That is the principal, in fact, the only change effected by that section. The other provisions of the section are designed to secure the position of companies or firms engaged in manufacturing businesses at the moment.  Certain foreign-owned firms were entitled under the 1932 Act to engage in business without a licence because they were in existence before the 1st June, 1932, and were engaged in the same businesses, or businesses which were a reasonable extension of the previous businesses.  The position of these firms is safeguarded by various paragraphs of the section.  Similarly, firms which operated under a licence granted under the 1932 Act are secured in their position.  The validity of their licence is maintained.  They are entitled to continue to operate and to engage in any reasonable extension of the business for which they were licensed.</P>
    <P>There is one other change to which I should make reference.  We are changing the definition of a national of Saorstát Eireann for the purpose of this legislation.  The term as used throughout this Bill is not &ldquo;national of Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; but &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; and that &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; is a person born in the Saorstát or a person who has been resident here for five years before 2nd July, 1934.  Under the previous Bill a national of Saorstát Eireann was a person who had been born here or a person resident here for five years.  The difference is that whereas, under the previous Bill, a person could start this five years' residence at any time, and at the end of that period become a national for the purposes of the Act&mdash; the number of such persons is absolutely indefinite&mdash;in future, the number of persons who will qualify under the five years' residence clause will be confined to those who have been in the <Col N="254" /> country before the 2nd July, 1934. Non-nationals seeking to establish a business here after that date cannot become qualified because of that particular provision.  It was a mistake, I think, in the drafting of the original Bill that the five years was made a continuing five years in that sense.</P>
    <P>Power is given to revoke a licence given under this Bill, or a licence already issued under the 1932 Act where the licensee has not started to perform the process licensed within a certain time.  One of the difficulties we came up against was that certain firms applied for a licence to engage in a particular process here.  When they got the licence they did not proceed to manufacture the goods which they had been licensed to manufacture and the Department were in the difficulty that they could not issue a similar licence to other firms because, in these circumstances, we might have an undue number of foreign firms in the same business, to the detriment of Irish firms in the business, At the same time, we could not actually compel the original licensee to go ahead with the process.  Now, we are proposing to take power requiring him to do so or, in the alternative, to cancel the licence.  There are fairly elaborate provisions in that respect, but they are easily understandable. Section 13 is designed to enable information to be obtained by the Department from individuals and bodies corporate on matters arising under the Bill&mdash;particulars as to the value and ownership of the shares and so forth.  I do not think there will be any difficulty arising out of that section for any member of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>One entirely new part of the Bill is Part 3.  We have been pressed from time to time by various trade and commercial organisations, and also by various labour organisations, to take power to limit the number of persons who might engage in any particular business so as to eliminate uneconomic competition which might bring about a depression in wages and various other undesirable results.  We have not quite taken that power but we have considered that it is desirable, in <Col N="255" /> relation to certain commodities, to limit those engaged in their manufacture irrespective of nationality.  The commodities we have in mind are those that are not now being produced here at all and in respect to which there are various factors which make it unlikely that anybody will engage in their production, except they are given greater security than might be available in the ordinary way.  There are two such circumstances which occur to anybody who considers the matter. One is where the whole of the market of the Saorstát is only capable of supporting one economic unit of production.  In such circumstances, it would be very difficult to induce any firm to engage in the production of that commodity and to risk the capital involved in the establishment of the unit unless they were given reasonable security&mdash;not a monopoly, because this Bill does not propose to confer monopolies, but power to ensure that no additional unit will be established except there is some reason for introducing competition or that there is room for the new unit without involving undue competition.</P>
    <P>There is also the case where it is considered desirable that new industries should be established in districts where employment is urgently needed.  We have, for example, been endeavouring to induce various firms proposing to engage in new industries to establish their factories in western or southern parts of the country.  One of the arguments always put forward by persons to whom such a proposal was made was that when they had established their factories in these districts, some other firm making the same goods might resist our pressure, establish a factory in Dublin or some other populous centre, thus getting a competitive advantage over the firm that had established factories on our suggestion in these other districts, and that, consequently, they could not take the risk of that.</P>
    <P>If this portion of the Bill be enacted, we will have power, in such circumstances, to afford this measure of protection to any firm that acts upon our request and establishes <Col N="256" /> itself in a particular portion of the country&mdash;that any other firm proposing to engage in the same business would be required to establish itself in a similar location and so not have any undue competitive advantage.  I do not say that the powers proposed to be given in this section will be used for that purpose very frequently because I do not contemplate that many orders affecting reserved commodities under the provisions of this section will be required.  It is only where it would be necessary to regulate output that that would be done.  There are various industries which will never be established here unless either separate legislation bearing upon them is enacted or the provisions of this Bill are available to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for the time being, to impose in these cases a certain degree of, shall I say, rationalisation or, at all events, regularisation of output. The enactment of this Part of this measure is being awaited before various projects proposed from time to time can be even considered, much less brought into operation.  Any firm which engages in the production of a reserved commodity does so under certain definite conditions.  In the case of one particular commodity in which we thought that an application for a reserved-commodity order would be made, the firm, having considered the matter, decided that it would prefer to go ahead without the order rather than accept the conditions which would be imposed if the order were made.  I should like to emphasise that these conditions will be imposed in every case where an order is made reserving a commodity.  The conditions cover the location of the factory, the employment of Irish people, the use of Irish materials in the factory, fixation of maximum and minimum output, limitation of price, limitation of the external capital invested and so forth, all of which are set out in Section 22.  It will be seen by anybody glancing over the list of conditions that may be attached to a licence granted under that Part of the Bill that any firm proposing to engage in the production of a reserved commodity will do <Col N="257" /> so under public control of a very definite character.</P>
    <P>The only criticism of this Bill seriously advanced from any quarter relates to this part of the Bill, and is mainly directed to protecting the interests of persons now engaged in the production of commodities in respect of which a reserved commodity order may in future be made.  I did not contemplate that position at all.  The Bill says that no order can be made except in relation to a class of goods which are not being made to any substantial extent in the Saorstát.  The cause of the difficulty in the minds of certain people was that phrase &ldquo;to any substantial extent.&rdquo;  That was put in as a sort of qualifying phrase to prevent difficulty arising where we wanted to reserve a particular commodity and we found that somebody, in a small way or on an experimental basis, was producing that particular class of goods. Our intention is that no reserved commodity order shall be made except to secure the establishment of an entirely new industry&mdash;that it should relate only to goods not being made here now for the purpose of getting them made here. If anybody can suggest a form of words to make that clearer than it is in the Bill, I am prepared to consider it.  The suggestion that there should be compensation for firms engaged in the production of these goods, if an order is made and they do not get a licence, is wide of the mark because our aim is to secure that it will not be possible to make an order at all if there is any firm actually engaged in the production of the particular class of goods in question. If there are firms engaged at the moment in the production of any class of goods here, it is obviously not necessary to make an order in order to secure the production of those goods. The sole reason that that part of the Bill was framed and that it is proposed to the Seanad it should be enacted is to secure the establishment here of industries which, we believe, would not otherwise be brought into the country at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which, I think, could give rise to a very useful and comprehensive discussion upon the <Col N="258" /> industrial phase of our economic life in the Saorstát.  It is regrettable that a Bill of such moment should be brought before us at the fag-end of a session. The sponsoring of the Second Stage of this Bill might have been utilised by the Minister to deal with something more than the mere technicalities or mechanism of the Bill.  He says that the major criticism in respect of the Bill has been directed towards Part 3. Speaking in reference to that part of the Bill, might I say that much more useful consideration of the proposals could have been obtained if that part had been brought before the Oireachtas as a separate Bill.  That could have been done without any disadvantage to the Minister's point of view and without any disconnection between that part and other parts of the Bill.  Part 3 of the Bill raises economic issues, industrial issues, and aspects of Ministerial policy that have not hitherto formed part of Ministerial proposals.  The consideration of this part of the Bill is likely to be diminished, to a certain extent, by the consideration of the Bill as a whole.  If this part had been produced as a separate Bill, it would receive, I think, much more exhaustive analysis than it would in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from Part 3, the Bill deals, if I am not mistaken, with the question of creating obstacles to external capital interfering with the development of enterprise backed by national capital. I think that is a good thing, and I have only a tentative and contingent criticism to offer in regard to that. The fundamental consideration that animates my mind in regard to these matters is that it is of vital importance for this State to retain, so far as it is possible, its natural growth of population, and that no matter how perfect or how scientific the development of the agricultural industry may be it will be inadequate to secure that.  If the State is to retain its most valuable asset, that is the natural growth of its human population, it will have to supplement its agricultural resources by industrial development.  Otherwise, I see no hope whatever of the future of this country being stable, economic and well balanced, providing for the natural, <Col N="259" /> normal, and progressive development of human life here.</P>
    <P>Assume that there is that natural development, there is a stage reached when proposals such as the present are, I think, in good order and well worthy of consideration.  At the moment the consideration to my mind, in regard to this Bill, is this: have we reached that stage yet?  I say that we want to ensure such industrial development as will supplement our agricultural potentialities and the retention of our population.  That is the immediate consideration.  Have we secured that stimulated condition of native enterprise to secure that end, and are we at the stage at which we can put obstacles in the way of securing the introduction of external capital to help us in the industrial animation that will enable us to retain our population? The Minister is probably better informed on that subject than I am. Personally, I am aware that this Bill is supported by a volume of industrial opinion outside that cannot be discounted, but I am not at all sure that we have reached the stage when it is the highest degree of statesmanship to create obstacles in the way of the introduction of external capital for the purposes of industrial development. At any rate, it would have been interesting and would, I think, have been a necessary part of the Minister's sponsoring of this Bill to have informed us as to what is the extent from the State point of view, of industrial development on the basis of native capital and enterprise, and what is the extent also of the menace to native enterprise from the introduction of external capital, because I take it that it is by reason of some such menace threatening native enterprise that the necessity for this Bill arises.  If no such menace is present, then what is the justification for the proposals in the Bill which will have the effect of restraining, at this stage, the introduction of external capital for industrial development?</P>
    <P>These considerations are intended more as interrogations than as a criticism of the Bill, because in regard <Col N="260" /> to the desirability of industrial development I do not think there is any wide abyss between the position of the Minister and myself.  I certainly have no intention of trying to do anything that would in the slightest degree thwart any move to promote economic industrial development.  But there must be some reasons for the introduction of these provisions in the Bill, and I think we are entitled to know them.  The Bill, apart from Part 3, is designed to create obstacles in the path of the introduction of external capital for industrial development here, and I deduce from that that there has been a jeopardising of the possibilities of enterprise based upon native capital.  Therefore, I think we are entitled to know what exactly is the position in respect to that.  I hope that the Minister, when he is concluding, will tell us.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that Part 3 of the Bill was the only part against which any real criticism had been directed.  I think it is not to be wondered at that serious considerations should have arisen so far as that part of the Bill is concerned.  It deals with the question of creating monopolies.  It seems to me that the proposals contained in that part of the Bill could, with very great advantage, have been embodied in a separate Bill, when we could have considered them quite apart from the matters dealt with in the other parts of this Bill.  I do not want to delay the House at any great length.  I find this in sub-section (4) of Section 16&mdash;</P>
    <P>No order under this section shall come into force unless and until a resolution has been passed by Dáil Eireann approving of such order.</P>
    <P>I think the political soul of the Minister is at rivalry with the economic soul of the Minister in that sub-section, because in it he has been anticipating the demise of the Upper House.  I take it that there is collective responsibility for the proposals that emanate from that august assembly, the Executive Council.  Yesterday we were dealing with the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill.  Sub-section (2) of Section 4 of that Bill provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> Every regulation made by the Minister under this or any other section of this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat annulling such regulation, such regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such regulation.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we were legislating, with a recognition by the Executive Council that there are two Houses of the Oireachtas.  To-day we are asked to legislate on the assumption that one of these Houses is here only on conditions of tolerance, and that before the legislation that we are asked to enact to-day becomes law we shall have ceased and passed away.  I think the Minister is unduly optimistic with regard to that.  John Mitchel said that the spirit of Irish nationality would outlive the British Empire, and paraphrasing that, I venture to say that the institution called Seanad Eireann shall outlive the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce ought to accommodate himself to the restrictions which the Minister for Agriculture has accepted, and to acquiesce in an amendment which will read &ldquo;No order shall come into force until such has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  As a matter of fact, I thought the Minister for Industry and Commerce would acquiesce, because in the Dáil, when referring to this matter, he said that he had no doubt the Bill would leave the Seanad amended in the sense I mention, and that then he would consider it in the lower House.  The Minister did not say the lower House, but I think that is the appropriate way to refer to it. Apart from the facetious aspect, the divergence of opinion between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture, Part 3 is of sufficient importance to <Col N="262" /> warrant that there should be no precipitate haste in the granting of licences, or in the granting of such monopolies as are foreshadowed.  The securing of the sanction of both Houses will help to stabilise judgement in these matters, and will in no way weaken the decisions that will eventually have to be arrived at.  The granting of monopolies is a matter that requires very mature judgment, and very careful consideration.  I do not think there is any necessity to recapitulate the considerations bearing upon that which were presented to the Minister in the Dáil.  They were considerations of weight, and though they came from the Opposition Benches, the Minister must have appreciated their value, by recognising that time may make a change in the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  He may not be always in office.  He is not gifted with the attribute of political immortality. Somebody else may occupy his position, and considerations may arise for the making of some particular commodity a reserved commodity.  He may then be very anxious that full consideration should be given to all aspects of a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under such circumstances, he would be glad that at this stage of the Bill he agreed to the insertion of an amendment necessitating the sanction of both Houses to an order making a commodity a reserved commodity.  I believe any order so classified will have the merit of meticulous and scrupulous examination by the Oireachtas.  The days of monopolies should be gone except for very special considerations. I agree with the Minister that there are considerations, in order to secure the production of a certain commodity in this State, whereby some concessions might be necessary but, once you have such powers in a Statute, there is no question about it there is all the possibility of abuse of such power.  I have not the slightest intention of suggesting that any would arise under the present Government, but we have to safeguard against such contingencies as might arise.  I am stressing this matter because I do not want to have to argue it at length on the Committee Stage.  I am expressing <Col N="263" /> hope that when the Minister replies I may expect from him acquiescence in the suggestion I have made, so that it will not be necessary later to move such an amendment as I have forecasted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I look upon Part 3 as the main part of the Bill, and the principles embodied in it were, in fact, discussed exhaustively on the Cement Act.  What seems to me to be involved here is that the principles embodied in the Cement Act shall be extended, when desired, by the Executive Council and subject to the sanction, shall I say, of whatever Houses of the Oireachtas may exist at the time.  The Bill now before us, Part 3 at any rate, is intended to avoid the necessity of bringing in a duplication of the Cement Act altered according to circumstances on every occasion when it is desired that there should be a special provision made by enactment. This would enable the Government to know beforehand if any proposal arises as to the establishment of a factory for the making of, say, electric bulbs or other commodities which would require expensive plant &mdash;I do not know if electric bulbs would require an expensive plant&mdash; but any such proposal could be considered, without having to wait until the Oireachtas had approved the principle.  It seems to me not to be unreasonable that the main lines of such procedure should be laid by a specific Act, and that if a definite proposal comes forward it should come forward to the House by way of an order for approval, and only if approval is given should the reservation be made.  As far as I can see, without very close examination, the main lines of Part 3 of the Bill are built pretty well on the design of the previous Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill, on the other hand, as the Minister pointed out, is very largely a repetition, with some amendments, of the original Control of Manufactures Act of 1932, and the amendments, as he pointed out, are intended to stop gaps.  As far as I can gather, there appears to be a number of people in the world whose <Col N="264" /> special business it is to examine Acts of Parliament with a view to finding loopholes and then inducing people to take advantage of those loopholes and make financial profit out of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>For reward, which makes it worse, but at the expense of the community, or certainly with the object of evading and over-riding the intentions of the legislature.  One is reminded of the annals of criminology and of a criminal and a detective trying to counteract the activities of each other, each trying to be cleverer than his enemy.  So it seems to me that you have a body of people seeking for a means of evading, for profit, certain Acts of Parliament and, on the other hand, the Minister and his legal advisers, and particularly the draftsman, having to discover how to fill the gaps that have inadvertently been allowed to pass by the observation of the Oireachtas in passing the Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case in question, the Minister has pointed out that paragraph (f) of Section 9 was the main change in the Principal Act, apart from the question of dates.  One would be surprised to think that it was necessary to insert such an amendment.  Most people thought the original Act was watertight enough.  The intention certainly was that it should not be lawful for a new public company to be established except that &ldquo;such business is, at the time such thing is done, owned by a body corporate the issued shares of which are at that time to an extent exceeding one half (in nominal value) <Col N="265" /> thereof in the beneficial ownership of a person who is or of two or more persons each of whom is at that time either a national of Saorstát Eireann or a body corporate the issued shares of which are at that time to an extent exceeding one half (in nominal value) thereof in the beneficial ownership of nationals of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; Obviously the whole scheme of that Act was to ensure that the control of manufactures should be in the hands of nationals in this country.  But you have evidence in the public Press and, I suppose in all the quarters where financial persons mostly congregate, of a very clever evasion of that intention in the flotation of a company which was to all appearance satisfying the requirements of the Act, but in effect evading it completely; beneficial ownership, and certainly the control, while nominally fulfilling the clause, being clearly and definitely in the hands of people outside this country, while the business of the Oireachtas for several years past has been directed to obviate the danger which such outside ownership would involve.  I am referring to the flour business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase has a very distinct and clear legal meaning.  I am not going to purport to say what are the various judicial interpretations attached to it from time to time, but its meaning is quite clear&mdash;that the full benefit of the ownership must attach to the individual who claims the ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the fact that the beneficial ownership is in the hands of Irish nationals is only part of the intention.  You may have Free State nationals getting whatever benefit there may be out of the business within this country, whereas the control of that business is in the hands of people who have no interest in the country's welfare, in fact who may control that business in the interests of outside countries and outside undertakings. One thought that that was being prevented by the Control of <Col N="266" /> Manufactures Act, 1932, whereas the history of the last two or three years has shown that the Act of 1932 was ineffective in preventing such a thing happening.  So it appears to me that paragraph (f) of Section 9 is intended to meet that defect.  I think it is a pitiable thing to have to confess that a section of the public for whom the ordinary man in the street is expected to have respect and to look up to as being rather above the average level of integrity and honesty should be engaged in the business of trying to subvert&mdash;to conspire with others for the purpose of subverting the intentions of the Legislature in matters of this kind.</P>

Whether it is succeeding or not as a business concern I am not concerned.  But it clearly was engaged in an attempt&mdash;shall I say in a conspiracy?&mdash;to evade and avoid the obligations which this Legislature intended should be imposed upon it.</P>

      <P>Presumably it did. That is why the present amending Bill is required.  I am drawing attention to the fact that such amendments are found necessary from time to time because there are people seeking deliberately, by finding out loopholes, to evade the obligations which the Legislature has put upon such persons. I do not think that Part 2 carries very much more than that stopping of a gap and the Minister has indicated that the other change that is made is in regard only to dates.  I do not think that is very serious.  In the main I believe that Part 3 of the Bill is the part which <Col N="267" /> is of chief importance and that is embodying principles which have already been accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Senator Johnson thought it necessary to use the particularly biting language which he had used in reference to the exercise of legal rights by people in this country. It is customary, you know, for well-meaning philosophers to make strictures from time to time upon people who are fairly adroit, fairly skilful in the conduct of business.  But what does Senator Johnson mean when he refers to people who are subverting the intentions of the Legislature?  Who can subvert the intentions of the Legislature if these intentions are properly expressed?  Who knows the intentions of the Legislature except the man who construes those intentions from the statute as passed?  The public have to construe laws, not by trying to define what was in the mind of Senator Johnson, but by looking at the Act of Parliament itself and judging what it means, according to the mind of the ordinary sensible man who reads it.</P>
      <P>Lawyers are sometimes blamed, businessmen are sometimes blamed, but the real offender in all these cases where laws have not been found sufficiently precise is the ingenious client.  The ingenious client is the person responsible for all the mischief and the ingenious client might be Senator Johnson just as well as anybody else.  Of course he always illuminates a subject which he touches and his speech to-day has been very useful in regard to the problem which is dealt with in Section 9 of this Bill. I hope the Minister has effectually dealt with it.  So far as I can see from the section, he has gone as far, I think, as human judgment can go, or human skill can go; but still there are these two words, &ldquo;beneficial ownership,&rdquo; which have been referred to by my friend Senator Milroy.</P>

      <P>I wonder what would happen in a case like this?  Suppose I were asked by a person who is not a <Col N="268" /> qualified person to allow my name to be used as the owner of a number of shares, say, 90 per cent. of the shares in a company carrying on business here, and suppose that he was prepared to trust me and that after two, three or five years it was found that I really was not the owner, what would happen in regard to the transactions that had taken place during those years?  Nothing could happen under the terms of this Bill and I think it is desirable that it should be so. Legislation could be so framed that a person who was willing to trust a national of this country, a qualified person, with his money, should lose his money in case the subterfuge&mdash;I will not call it a fraud&mdash;were discovered.  I think that would be too drastic.  The only parallel I can find for legislation of this kind and to an attempt at evasion of this type of legislation, occurred just more than 200 years ago when a number of Catholics who owned property agreed with Protestants that the Protestant in each case should hold himself forth as the nominal owner of the property, while in point of fact the Catholic was the beneficial owner.  That happened in a great many cases and I am glad to have this opportunity of saying that the trust which the Catholic people placed on their Protestant neighbours was scarcely ever misplaced and that the Protestant neighbours were in all cases absolutely loyal to the trust.  I see that Senator Miss Browne for once agrees with me.  Having said so much on that point, I think in regard to Section 9 that the Minister has gone as far as it is desirable to go at the present time.</P>

      <P>What I say does not explain beneficial ownership.  The explanation of beneficial ownership is this: that the share must be held by the person, not in trust for any other <Col N="269" /> person, for his sole absolute use and benefit.  That is the meaning of beneficial ownership.  Is that clear?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose you give me £100 to invest in a company in this country in my name.  Now, the statute says that if it is in my name it shall be in my beneficial ownership.  That is, I am assumed to be the owner of the money, to be the person entitled to receive every money benefit such as dividends and to spend the dividends. In case I owned the money and judgment was got against him these shares could be used to satisfy him on that. It means that.  It does not mean this. If you should fall out and it was proved that you lent £100 I think if you came into court and said &ldquo;I gave him £100, in his own name, true enough, by that section of the Act of Parliament, he should be the beneficial owner in order to carry on the business but still the money is mine.&rdquo;  I think the court in that case would declare that you were entitled to the money.</P>
      <P>I pass from Section 9 and I come to Part 3 which interests me more.  This is in regard to the restriction of manufacture of certain commodities called reserved commodities.  I am very glad the Minister has introduced legislation. A few concrete examples will bring a thing more clearly to the mind than any number of general statements. It is a fact that industrial enterprise is necessary in this country, as Senator Milroy said in his very moderate and statesmanlike speech here to-day.  His speech was very moderate, unusually moderate, and statesmanlike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Unusually statesmanlike?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="270" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Unusually statesmanlike. I mean that exactly as I have expressed it and I think it is accepted as a compliment.  I do not mean to be offensive of course.  It is desirable that we should have industrial enterprise in the West of Ireland.  I have often thought that people who contemplated investing their capital in enterprises in this country are very reluctant to go outside what I may call the ambit of the City of Dublin.  They say we will not go in for heavy industries on the Shannon or the Fergus or on Galway Bay or Clew Bay. We will keep near the centres of population.</P>
      <P>Next, they say, what about costs of transport?  You cannot expect us to go to the West.  We will establish industries anywhere on the East coast but you cannot expect us to go to the West because there will be no great competition for our products. I, for one, think we shall have failed, and this Government will have failed, unless it can succeed in establishing heavy industries in the West of Ireland.  I certainly hope the Government will succeed and I am sure they will succeed.  We must have them in the West of Ireland before this Government can write the word success at the foot of their plans.  In order to do that it is necessary that they should go to the extent of absolutely reserving manufacture of certain commodities not manufactured in this country or not manufactured to any substantial extent at the present time.  Therefore I agree with the provisions of Section 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said &ldquo;that these manufactures which I reserve will be subject to conditions and very severe conditions.&rdquo;  He said that these conditions are very severe.  Perhaps a manufacturer may come along and say: &ldquo;Oh, no; I will not operate under these conditions at all; I would rather be free.&rdquo;  I am afraid that some of the conditions contained in Section 22 are altogether too severe, paragraph (g), for instance, dealing with the maximum price, paragraph (h) dealing with the nature and quality of such reserved commodities, and paragraph (i) dealing with the mode of manufacture. <Col N="271" /> There are other conditions dealing with the employment of nationals, the quality of the material to be purchased, and the extent of the capital invested&mdash;&ldquo;the business carried on under such licence is from time to time to be owned by nationals of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although a professional man I have some contact here and there with business, both in this country and in Great Britain, and I know that what business men value most is freedom. Restrictions on the manufacture of commodities are probably resented to a much greater extent than they ought to be; that is human nature. The manufacturers should be as free as possible.  I think some of these restrictions are too severe.  That is my individual opinion.  This matter has been considered by the Department of Industry and Commerce and by the Minister himself.  I do not put my opinion against his, but I think these conditions are certainly severe.  I will not say unduly severe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening remarks the Minister told us this Bill was introduced to supplement the Act of 1932; he told us that it had been found necessary to do so as loopholes had been found and taken advantage of in the previous Act.  He used the word &ldquo;evasion.&rdquo;  It has been talked about a good deal since the Minister introduced this Bill.  Personally, I think it is incorrect to use that word. Evasion implies something illegal.  If advantage had been taken of the terms of the Act by manufacturers in either introducing their goods or developing their business in accordance with the law although perhaps contrary to the spirit of the Government's intention, but within the terms of the Act, I do not think you could call what has been done evasion.  They have simply complied with the law. They may be clever and ingenious, but I think it would be rather unfair to say that they behaved improperly.  If they had behaved illegally they naturally would have been pulled up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, when he is replying, to tell us whether <Col N="272" /> there has been much of this, as he describes it, evasion, because if there has been it would lead one to think that the original measure had not been very popular amongst manufacturers, and it would be interesting to know whether that has been the experience of the Government.  If that is the case, then it would rather go to show that if it was not popular there would be considerable difficulty in getting people to undertake manufactures in the country, which it would be desirable to have here, with the requirements of the Act staring them in the face.  Then there is the question of what companies come within the purview of the Act.  It is mainly in connection with the clauses under which it is necessary that 51 per cent. of the issue of shares should be held by nationals of the Saorstát.  Is that rule to be applicable to old established businesses?  I shall give the names of the businesses I have in mind, because I think it would be desirable to have this matter definitely decided.</P>

Another issue was referred to by Senator Johnson, that of Messrs. Rank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, very well, I shall not press that.  There is one matter, however, which is rather connected in a way and unconnected in another way.  In the last couple of days, we have had two or three amending Acts &mdash;one in connection with the Cereals Bill, and another is this one here to-day. The result of these amending Acts will be that legislation and Acts in connection with them will be very confusing and complicated.  Would it be possible to codify them in any shape or form and issue them in the form of an Act which would be comprehensive in regard to all that is required and at the same time would not be full of references?  There was one here yesterday in which there is a page of references and I think that it would be a matter of very great difficulty for anybody who has to use the Bill to try to construe it.  I am sure that Senator Comyn will be able to give us his view on that matter as to whether he would prefer to refer to two or three Acts when some question would come before him or whether he would prefer to have a codified Act.  If it were possible to have some such thing done I think it would be very desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must all admire the optimism and persistence of the Minister.  For the past two years he has been slogging steadily <Col N="274" /> away at this policy of national intensification and making speeches all over the country showing the advances that have been made, but he has never really come down to brass tacks.  He has never given us, in the form of returns, or even in the form of speeches, a categorical account of what has been achieved.  In some cases&mdash;I do not say without provocation&mdash;he has almost resorted to flippancies, such as where he said: &ldquo;They are springing up so quickly that if I gave you an account of their development to-day, it would be out of date to-morrow.&rdquo;  That, I think, is a fairly accurate description of what he said in the Dáil on one occasion.  We have been promised a directory of trades, but we did not get it.  I think also that we were promised, either by the Minister or one of his colleagues, some sort of a <i>vade mecum</i> of these intolerable duties, but we did not get it. You cannot examine all these things apart from the general policy.</P>
      <P>I say this with a certain amount of levity, I admit, but I will make this sporting suggestion to the Minister: let him disguise himself&mdash;put on a false beard or something like that&mdash; and come with me around the town for a day and talk to various shopkeepers and others so that he may realise what is going on.  From the very nature of his office, naturally, the Minister, no doubt, is surrounded with files and papers of all kinds and with buffers in the form of civil servants between himself and reality, and I do not think that he knows for a moment what is really happening.  Only this morning I was in a certain business house&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I said to the proprietor: &ldquo;Are you bothered with these regulations?&rdquo;  He said to me: &ldquo;Of course we are.  We cannot get our stationery manufactured at home and we have to import it; but, as things are, two months is not an unreasonable period for us to be haggling with the North Wall and filling up forms and so on before we can get our materials.&rdquo;  That is what he said to me.  Take those tin plate <Col N="275" /> restrictions, for example.  You see these little samples of kitchen ware, cheap articles, all of which have to be made by expensive machinery and which could not be made in this country&mdash;all caught by the duty which is put on merely to enable certain rough classes of tin plate articles to be made at home.  I could mention many more but it would only weary the House if I even approached the fringe of the question.  Does the Minister realise all the petty annoyances that are imposed day by day on the business community?  I do not suppose he does.  What is the attitude of the business community?  The average man says that it does not pay him to fall out with the Government. There is an extraordinarily cynical attitude adopted by the average business man in this connection.  I, perhaps, come across it in a way that other members of the House do not. The cynical attitude of the average business man is: &ldquo;We will make hay while the sun shines.  We are going with soft words to the Minister to get all we can and we are not going to expose what we consider the unsound features of his policy so long as we can entrench ourselves and back ourselves up with the consumer.&rdquo;  That is the effect of the whole of the Minister's economic policy of which this is a part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Minister will say that these are our old die-hard Free Trade ideas coming through.  He will say: &ldquo;You are too old to learn and to realise that this new economic policy contains the salvation of the world; all other countries are doing it and we are only following along their lines.&rdquo;  All I can say to that is that what is happening in the world is not very encouraging.  In England it is not being done to anything like that extent, and the only other country is Italy&mdash;and even then its finances are not so good&mdash;where very exceptional circumstances prevail.  You have the same position in Central Europe where this sort of thing is going on; all along the line it is deplorable.  This is not a justification for this policy of exclusiveness.  I want to turn for a <Col N="276" /> moment to the astonishing speech made by Senator Johnson.  I wonder if the Senator were really talking with his tongue in his cheek when he made that speech.  Would he suggest that as a Trade Union official he never examined Bills to find in them loopholes in favour of his Party or his organisation? If he did not examine those Bills to find loopholes he would not be a competent official.  Every Party examines Bills to see what loopholes exist in them.  This is not a new discovery.</P>
    <P>Is not the whole code of income tax based on trying to stop evasion?  Is not a large portion of the Companies Acts devoted to trying to stop evasion by one-man companies?  If you are to place these burdens and restrictions upon citizens, hamper their business and offer rewards at the expense of the consumer to shelter a privileged few what do you expect?  This is now going on.  The few behind the shelter will, human nature being what it is, take all the advantages they can out of their privileged position.  They will get all the benefits they can. When Senator Johnson descends from his philosophic heights and comes down to reality he will be able to make some useful contribution to legislation.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear no protest from Senator Johnson as to the whole principle involved in this legislation. Possibly that was decided by the Act of 1932, which this is only seeking to amend.  Now Senator Johnson is an avowed opponent of capital, but he is now consolidating capital in its worst form.  He is giving limited capital privileges in a small community.  The real safeguard for the community and for capital is to allow capital to operate freely.  If you allow capital to come freely into business, then you will have protection for the consumer; but if you restrict the operations of capital in a small community you will consolidate the very worst features of capital.  When, in course of time, we will see the harm that will ensue from this legislation, I tell Senator Johnson that he and his Party will not be able to escape their share of the guilt.</P>
    <P>I, as an avowed capitalist, deplore <Col N="277" /> these restrictions.  I have not prepared my speech on this Bill because my interest has become almost academic.  One is disgusted with this legislation.  I am opposed to the whole principle of it.  When the previous Bill was going through the Oireachtas I did forecast that there would be wholesale evasion.  That was proved to be the case.  If Senator Johnson only knew as I do the integrity of certain people who take advantage of that evasion he would be rather inclined to qualify the remarks he made.  People of the highest integrity are now coming in and taking advantage of the loopholes in this Act.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that if Senator Johnson himself were in my position he would act as he suggests I ought to act.  I will leave it at this&mdash; that when one is opposed to a measure one is not bound to do anything in the way of helping towards its improvement. Opposed as one is to this whole policy what can one do but accept it with resignation?  The Minister seems to be perfectly satisfied.  He tells us that everything is going on well, but he gives us no information.  Here we are old-fashioned economists and we have to turn to certain well-known statistics.  I hold here in my hand a document which shows that for the last ten years our export trade has fallen from £46,000,000 to £18,000,000.  Our import trade has fallen too but not to that extent.  In the past year while our exports have fallen by £2,000,000 our imports have risen, so that on a total turnover of £57,000,000 our adverse trade balance is as high as it was when our total trade turnover was £104,000,000.  These are figures which speak for themselves.</P>
      <P>Against these things we have got nothing but a sort of optimistic statement from the Minister that everything is going on well; that new factories are being established, and that everybody is happy.  I cannot follow that.  I feel as many others that things are not as the Minister would have us believe, and that the business community naturally are not complaining because they know it would be no good.  They know that it will do no good to them to get the Minister's back up.  What can they do? They have got to submit to this legislation and like wise men, human nature being what it is, they are prepared to take all the advantage they can out of the privileged position that these things confer upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What one must feel sorry for is the consumer and his position.  As time goes on and as the purchasing power of the consumer decreases, owing to the position of the agricultural community, these things will be felt more and more.  The country will find these people entrenched in a privileged position.  They will find vested interests of which it will be impossible to get rid.  These interests will be so <Col N="279" /> powerful that no political party can get rid of them.  Let me give one instance.  I do not know the names and the Minister may say that this instance.  I am about to give is imagination.  It is a question of this kind: a person comes along to the Minister and says &ldquo;I can make a certain article of clothing speciality; if you put on a duty on that I will start a factory here in any place where you wish to manufacture that article.  I will get Irish capital together and in the meantime allow me to operate on an import licence.&rdquo; You will have things of that kind.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong in the instance I am giving.  What is the position?  The factory starts. They are making a special article.  As improvement comes along in outside factories that factory will have no inducement to produce an improved article.  It will have a monopoly of that article.  What inducement is there to give the public better value?  What inducement is there on the part of that firm to take advantage of new processing and improvement in their method of manufacture and in the cheapening of the price?  I hope the Minister will not say that he is getting the Prices Tribunal to investigate the quality and the prices charged.  What will happen is that that article and process will become sterotyped.  The only possible form of competition will be from nationals who might think it worth while to go into competition.  It is quite conceivable, knowing that that requires elaborate machinery and a great deal of capital, that it would never be worth while even for these people to go into competition for the limited trade that the small population of the country offers.  So you get a condition where industry becomes stagnant and stereotyped, largely because you entrench production in a small community.  That is a thoroughly bad prospect.  It may look all right from the point of view of statistics and the Minister may regard it with complete satisfaction.  I, as a capitalist, am now speaking against capitalism in the form in which the Minister wishes to introduce it.  The <Col N="280" /> person who is going to suffer is the consumer.  The amenities of life and civilisation, as we know it, will also suffer.  I know that I shall be told that this is an academic question and that the Minister is going to have his way, but I still believe that it is all wrong.  I deplore the day when these chickens will come home to roost.</P>

      <P>I very seldom inflict myself on the Seanad and there is a very good reason for that.  Anything I might say would probably be taken as coming from the Government. I want to state now, that what I have to say on this Bill, is purely my own personal view.  I am not at all enamoured of this Bill.  Owing to certain circumstances, I have had to take a personal and keen interest in the meaning of the different provisions of the Bill.  Through these circumstances, I have got an impression of the Bill which seems to be altogether different from the general impression.  Senator Sir John Keane seems to think that it would be better for us to allow British or any foreign capital to come in here without any restriction.  We know that any foreign corporation coming in here would be much more powerful than the small Irish manufacturing concerns with which it would be in competition, and we are very naturally anxious to safeguard the mere Irish&mdash;the 100 per cent.  Irish&mdash; from the activities of firms and corporations of that sort.  I do not quite see why Senator Sir John Keane is so keen&mdash;to make a pun, not deliberately, but on the spur of the moment &mdash;in objecting to the restrictions which, he says, are imposed by this Bill.  Is this Bill a restriction on the foreigner coming in here?  Is it not rather a safeguard for him?  We say to the Englishman: &ldquo;Listen here, we Irish are great sportsmen; we do not like to take advantage of a poor Englishman coming in here on his own.  We insist on his having allies here, as he had in most of his military fights for the last 700 years, to help him to lick his opponents.&rdquo;  That is, in effect, what this Bill says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only that, but we are quite concerned about the amount of capital <Col N="281" /> he is going to risk.  We will not allow him to risk more than one-third.  I admit that to all appearances he is to have a bit less control, but where is the restriction?  You certainly are not going to get the continental foreigner to come in, because he does not know anybody here.  He will naturally feel that, if he comes in here he will be confronted by people who know their business as well as he does and by men who will see that the firm is run for the benefit of the Irish nation; but, under this Bill, the British will not be stopped at all, as far as I can see. If anything, it is a help to them.  They can come in knowing the officials with whom they are to deal and knowing the people who were already engaged in that business.  They will see to it that they are not the people whom they will ask to join up with them or, if they join up with them, they will see that they are left a voice that is very weak.  In that way we shall have firms starting to compete with the mere Irish.  Not only that, but no Irish firm under these circumstances will take the risk of coming into the field.  It would not be a risk; it would be suicide, and I have definite cases in my mind on which I build that opinion.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill is very little use. The suggestion seems to be that we want to restrict the foreigner in coming in but I think we should get down to something positive to assist Irish industrialists.  I do not speak as one who is in any way expert or deeply versed in these matters, but, like the commonsense man of whom Senator Comyn spoke, who has to interpret all these laws as best he can, I think that an industrial committee might be set up whose business it would be to take positive action, not mere passive action such as, for example, the Prices Commission can only take.  We should have some positive committee which would invite ideas from people who are interested in industrial revival, particularly in regard to definite industries that people may have in their minds. These people might be given advice and put in touch with others who could assist them and even suggest <Col N="282" /> variations in the law, if necessary. They would then know where they stood.</P>
    <P>I have actually come across, in the last few days, a T.D., a member of our own Party, who met some of his own constituents during the holidays. These men heard about this Bill, not that they had read it&mdash;probably they could not understand it, if they had read it&mdash;but they had a general feeling that we were in for a great industrial revival.  They said to their T.D.: &ldquo;We have a little money and we are quite anxious to have an industry going in our constituency. What about going to see the Minister and some officials in regard to the matter?&rdquo;  I met the T.D. afterwards and I asked him how they got on and he said: &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I was surprised at the reception we got.&rdquo;  They were told by the officials: &ldquo;We do not know anything about this at all, it is not our business.&rdquo; These men went home and they do not now believe there is going to be any industrial revival.  I know that is a wrong impression but somehow or other when I try to get down to practical business&mdash;although I must say I have always received the greatest consideration from officials&mdash; I find myself in the same street.</P>
    <P>This Bill, I think, instead of being a Bill to exclude the British, more or less invites them.  I will say, of course, that the Bill is better than no Bill at all.  In the words of the old saying, &ldquo;When all fruit fails, welcome haws.&rdquo; But even as the Bill stands, a British firm can control 33? per cent. of the capital.  I understand that in France only 20 per cent. is allowed to be controlled by an outside firm, and in France industry is on a much more solid footing than in this country. Here, where native industry is not yet on its feet, a foreign firm is allowed to control 33? per cent. of the capital invested.  That 33? per cent. will exercise a tremendous influence.  The owners of it will see that the owners of the other two-thirds are so scattered that they cannot speak with a single voice.  Furthermore, if any of the Irish shareholders think that the firm is going on well, and that it should start <Col N="283" /> an export trade, the foreign element will probably put difficulties in the way of starting an export trade.  They will probably point out that they can only get a certain price for the products when exported, or something else will probably go wrong, and the Irish shareholders will have to keep quiet.</P>
    <P>As regards that word &ldquo;export,&rdquo; what English firm is going to come here and curtail its own home activities by exporting from here?  If they come over here they make sure that the home firm is not going to suffer thereby.  I have in mind a case that will illustrate that point better than mere argument.  The Ford car, which is assembled here, costs, model for model, about £50 more than the Ford car produced by the parent firm in England.  I have asked people connected with that business to explain that difference in price, but they could not do so.  They could see no reason why there should be such a disparity in price.</P>
    <P>Having met English business men and gone into certain matters recently, I have come to the conclusion that the reason is that the price charged for the component parts&mdash;in other words, the raw material&mdash;is exactly what the car would have cost if the car had been completed and sent over here.  In other words, the parent firm is not only at no loss in connection with the industry here, but is at an advantage. That sort of industry is going to be of no great value to Ireland.  A foreigner will look around when about to start an industry here and will say: &ldquo;I want to hold the grip I have on this market. If we do not come in, some Irish firm will come in.  While we shall allow the Irish shareholders to have a good commercial return on their shares, we can secure that the advantage will still be with us.&rdquo;  Where raw material is to be imported, it is only natural to expect that the parent firm will be the firm that will sell the raw material to the Irish firm.  They will sell at their own price.  The Irish firm may demur and say that they want to make sure that the price is a competitive one.  The parent firm will say: &ldquo;You can ask <Col N="284" /> continental firms to compete.&rdquo;  That sounds very fair, but how will it work out in practice?  The continental firm will send in a quotation once and no matter what the price may be the parent firm will get the contract.  The continental firm will send in a quotation a second time and the parent firm will get it still.  After that, is the continental firm going to be fooled further? Then the prices will go up and you will have a repetition of the Ford car business, if what I have stated be correct.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about issuing reserved commodity orders only in cases where the industry was not going in this country and was not likely to be established here because it would be uneconomic to have more than one unit of production.  That is a bit astonishing, for certain reasons.  Why not give that reservation to an Irish firm if they look for such a thing?  It is all very fine to say: &ldquo;We want to avoid this monopoly business; we do not want to appear to give our own people monopolies.&rdquo; But if the only alternative is to give an English firm what is virtually a monopoly, what use is that to us?  In the particular case I am thinking of, the industry was not going in this country. It was deliberately intended that British firms would not come in.  They refused to come in and I understand that this refusal is on the Minister's files.  A number of Irishmen decided that there was an opportunity for the starting of this industry.  They tried to start it and they were told that British firms could come in under this Bill. They had only to get a few Irishmen to provide two-thirds of the voting power. That firm is coming in now.  It refused to come in previously and it is coming in now only because an Irish firm said it would start.</P>
    <P>This legislation is all very fine but it is our own people who seem to get the kick.  &ldquo;Those whom the Lord loveth He chastiseth.&rdquo;  I think that the Bill should be constructed differently. It is most unfortunate that I should have to get up and say this but why pull the wool over our own eyes?  We know that the Minister's heart is in the right place.  We know that he has got a brain that can accumulate all <Col N="285" /> sorts of data, sort them out and handle them.  I have no doubt that if he got down to something positive, we should get on like a house on fire.</P>

      <P>With regard to Senator Robinson's observations, I should like to say that, while it is the function of the Department of Industry and Commerce to father industrial development, it is not undertaking to mother it as well.  Irish industrialists have got to be prepared to take whatever risks there are in investing their capital in industrial development.  If they want to have nothing but gilt-edged security, if they want everything handed to them on a silver salver without any risk whatever involved, I think we had better stop this attempt to get industrial development by Irish money.  We are loading the dice in favour of the Irish firm.  We are giving the Irish firm reasonable protection and we are not going to give it more.  As regards Senator Robinson's anecdote concerning certain Deputies, if any persons come to my Department with a report that they have money they want to invest and desire advice as to what they should invest it in, they will get no such advice.  We shall not take the responsibility of advising people as to what industry they should put their money in.  My advice to them would be to put it into the industry they know.  If they do not know any industry, then they had better risk it in Hospitals Sweepstakes tickets or something of that kind, which will be an easier way of losing it than putting it into an industry they know nothing about.  When Deputies or others ask Senator Robinson for advice as to the industry in which they should invest their hard earned savings, I suggest to him that he should tell them to invest in an industry they know something about and, if they do not know anything about any industry, then not to touch any of them.  That is advice which he might well give to those who approach him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing of particular importance bearing upon the measure arose in the debate.  Senator Sir John Keane gave us a résumé of his antiquated and old <Col N="286" /> fashioned ideas on economics.  We have had that before and I do not think that any purpose would be served by exposing the fallacies behind the Senator's theories.</P>

      <P>Senator Guinness asked if we had much evidence of evasion of the intentions of the earlier Act. There were, so far as we know, no evasions of the provisions of the earlier Act.  Certain firms may, however, be evading the Act and getting away with it.  Attempts were made to evade the intentions of the Act.  I do not say that a large number of these attempts were successful.  In fact, I think that only in three cases, at the outside, did firms establish themselves in industry here in circumstances which we would have prevented their doing so if we had had the power.  The effect of even these two or three cases upon industrial development generally was that the average body of investors were slow and reluctant to subscribe to the shares of companies formed to engage in any industrial enterprise when they felt that it was possible for these companies to be brought up against very intense opposition by highly capitalised outside firms. Although that timidity on behalf of investors is, I think, rapidly disappearing, nevertheless it is necessary to secure that position so that the intentions of the Government can be given full effect to before it will be finally removed and a public issue of shares for industrial purposes here can be made with a reasonable guarantee of success if the project is a good one. Senators will have noticed that the most recent industrial issues were very well taken up, and that there is in that regard a much better position than existed some time ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has a certain responsibility in connection with the loan, but it cannot undertake responsibility in respect of the issue of shares by a private concern.  It is only from hearsay that we ourselves know what the results are in the case of private concerns.  As regards the points raised by Senator Milroy, these were all debated, more or less, at considerable length on the main Act, and, in fact, the acceptance of it by the Oireachtas indicated approval of the principle of regulation.  We are only by this Bill improving, as we consider, upon the method of regulation.  In the main, I think it is correct to say that industrial development is taking place here with Saorstát capital.  External firms coming into industry here generally get a bit more publicity than native firms, but by far the greater portion of the capital invested in industrial concerns here is owned by Saorstát residents, and the tendency of the times would appear to be moving towards an increase in that proportion.  Even where foreign firms are sometimes associated with industrial enterprises here&mdash;and it is often very desirable to have them associated with them because of the technical knowledge and experience required&mdash; the tendency is to induce as large a subscription of local capital as possible, and I think that is all to the good.  The menace to which Senator Milroy referred&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding, I should like to explain. The phrase the Minister has used suggests that I implied that there was a menace.  The point that I put was this: was there a menace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no menace really of the whole of the industrial life of the country being controlled from outside in the sense that the capital invested in industrial enterprises would be foreign owned.  There is the menace to which I referred, that local investors will not take the risk of going into industry here unless they <Col N="288" /> are given reasonable security against the possibility of having all their capital lost in an intense trade war with much stronger foreign competitors. That is a situation that exists with us and that does not necessarily exist in other countries.  We are a small country in the early stages of our industrial development, side by side a much larger country that is highly industrialised, producing most of the things that we require here and in every way fully equipped to compete against our products in our own market.</P>
      <P>That situation does not exist in the case of other countries in Europe in relation to Great Britain.  Because of the existence of that situation, having regard, of course, to the fact that there are very direct links between two countries that have been politically associated under one Government for a long number of years, it is necessary for us to have legislation of a type not contemplated elsewhere except perhaps in a country like Mexico, which is up against a somewhat similar situation as regards the United States.  Canada is finding in relation to the United States exactly the same development that we are finding here in relation to Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Part 3 of the Bill, the purpose of it is to secure that we can have in relation to particular industries the degree of regulation which, as Senator Johnson explained, we have taken by a specific Act in relation to the cement industry.  In fact Part 3 of the Bill is a reproduction of the relevant sections of the Cement Act, with the words &ldquo;reserved commodity&rdquo; to be put in wherever the word &ldquo;cement&rdquo; occurred. The intention is to secure that we will have the power to bring a particular industry subject to regulation, in a manner which will be much simpler than would be involved in the preparation of a new Bill and of its introduction and passage through the Dáil and Seanad.  As this Bill stands we propose that that power may be secured by order made under a certain procedure, involving the publication of certain notices and the consideration <Col N="289" /> of any objections that may be made by members of the public concerned.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands a vote of approval by the Dáil is all that is required to make the order effective. The reason for that I explained on a previous occasion when a similar proposal was put into another Bill.  Here the Government has to enter into negotiations very frequently on matters relating to industrial development to be carried over a long number of years and of improvements in industrial organisation.  The Government under our Constitution is only required to have the support and confidence of a majority of the Dáil.  It is not required constitutionally to have the confidence of a majority of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not desirable that it should?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Very desirable, I agree. In fact it is very extraordinary that it has not under present circumstances. Under the Constitution all that is required is that the Government should have the confidence of a majority of the Dáil.  If it ceases to have the confidence of the Dáil it must go out of office.  It cannot dissolve the Dáil.  In these circumstances we think it desirable that the Government should be empowered to enter into negotiations knowing that in making an order it can feel certain of getting that order approved so long as it retains the confidence of a majority of that one House which, under the Constitution, it is required to have.  That is a matter, of course, we can argue further on the Committee Stage.  No doubt I will have some difficulty in convincing members of the Seanad to accept my view in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which the Government have brought forward at the request of the Limerick Corporation, who wished to have in Limerick the system of city government, which is already in operation in Dublin, Cork and Dún Laoghaire.  Whilst the Bill was going through the Dáil it was considered by the corporation and approved.  The system of government for which the Bill provides is that which associates a city manager with an elected council. The functions reserved to the council are prescribed in the Bill and all other functions of the corporation are to be exercised by the city manager.</P>
      <P>The new council will consist of 15 members of whom four will be aldermen. They will be elected not by wards but by the electors of the whole city which forms one electoral area. I may say the existing council is composed of 40 members representing eight wards.  The council will elect a mayor whose duties and privileges will be the same as at present.  The council will have power to make the rate, borrow money, make by-laws, bring permissive Acts into force by resolution, promote legislation, appoint representatives on public bodies, and subject to the usual provisions, appoint, suspend or remove the manager.  There is a provision by which the powers of the council can if necessary be extended by an order of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> The Local Appointments Commissioners will be asked to recommend a suitable person as city manager.  The manager will act as town clerk, that office not having been filled when a vacancy occurred.  A temporary manager can be appointed by the Minister to hold office until a permanent appointment is made.  The manager will have the same duty as in Dublin of furnishing information to the mayor, attending meetings, advising the council, planning works which the council wish to have executed and controlling and supervising the staff. He will act by signed orders, of which a record will be kept.</P>
    <P>All the existing separate funds will be merged in a new consolidated fund which is called the municipal fund.  A new consolidated rate will take the place of the existing Improvement Rate, Borough Rate, Water Rate, General Purposes Rates and Poor Rate. The Contract Water Rate will remain. In order to preserve the existing partial exemption of land as nearly as possible we propose a flat municipal rate on three-fifths of the valuation of arable land or meadow within the city. Vacant premises will be rated as in Dublin&mdash;that is, the rates will be assessed on the owner but there will be power to make a refund of half if the house cannot be let to a suitable tenant or is unoccupied for repairs or alterations.</P>
    <P>Poor relief has been one of the principal factors which has increased local taxation in Limerick.  When the Poor Law Unions were abolished the parts of Limerick Union that were in the counties of Limerick and Clare were separated from the city, which was left with a workhouse and staff much larger than it needed and the area of charge was restricted to the city.  Limerick County, is not yet disposed towards anything in the nature of a joint scheme, and so it happens Limerick remains the only county borough which is not united with part of the adjoining county for poor relief purposes.</P>
    <P>The Poor Law authority in Limerick is called the board of health, which is composed wholly of members of the <Col N="292" /> council.  It is proposed to dissolve this body altogether and have its duties carried out by the City Manager.  The difficulties of administering poor relief as well as the expenditure under this head will be diminished owing to the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act. The Gas Committee under the Limerick Corporation Act, 1878, and the Tuberculosis Committee will also be abolished.  In Limerick the gas undertaking is the property of the corporation. At an inquiry held in 1932 it was found that the management and financial position of the undertaking were far from satisfactory.  The powers of the committee will be exercised by the manager.  The Bill does not extend the boundaries of the city, but it provides machinery by which an application by the corporation for extension can be examined and a provisional order obtained.  Before such extension can take place a local inquiry will have to be held and a provisional order made and confirmed by an Act.</P>
    <P>The position of the officers and servants of the corporation will remain unchanged, except that they will be under the control and supervision of the manager.  The superannuation of employees who are not classed as officers is also dealt with by provisions designed to meet the cases of old employees who are past their labour and who cannot be pensioned under the law as it stands.  Employees, if they have 20 years' service, are given the benefit of the provisions of Section 53 of the Local Government Act of 1925 and this power can be exercised within a period of two years or longer if the Minister, on the application of the corporation, extends the period. For the purposes of the Local Government Act, 1925, as applied, employees of the gas undertaking will be allowed to reckon their period of employment as employment by the corporation.</P>
    <P>The Bill follows fairly closely the precedents already established, especially the Dublin Act of 1930.  It is, as I have said, promoted at the wish of the corporation and is the solution which they desire of their problem of administration.</P>

      <P>The principle of this Bill is to provide service pensions for Volunteers who had active service in Easter Week or the Black-and-Tan war and who fought in the I.R.A. during the civil war. The scale of pensions is the same as that granted to the officers and men who obtained pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924. Since the introduction and passage of this Bill in the Dáil representations were made to the Government by a number of members of Fianna Fáil, and by other organisations, that men who had 1916 service only, or who had Black-and-Tan war service only, should also be granted pensions and that the Bill should be amended.  That plea was also supported by a number of the Opposition Party in the Dáil, and the Government decided that the Bill should be amended so as to meet the plea, and to provide that those who had 1916 service only should be granted pensions and also that Volunteers who served during the Black-and-Tan war, whose service was continuous for the period April to July, '21, should be also granted pensions. Accordingly, an amendment was drafted and has been circulated in the name of Senator Seamus Robinson to make provision for persons in those two classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years the policy of Fianna Fáil was to abolish the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.  Some time ago, however, representations were made to the Government pointing out that it would be unfair to withdraw the 1924 pensions.  Many arguments were put forward, which the Executive Council felt were just, and after careful consideration they decided that as all the other contracts made by the previous Government with the various sections of the community were being <Col N="294" /> kept, the pensions awarded under the 1924 Act should be continued and at the same time immediate steps should be taken to secure that those who fought with the I.R.A. in the civil war should in future be given equal treatment.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions both as regard the grant and the amount of pensions under this Bill to the members of the I.R.A. are the same as those provided for under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.  To qualify for a pension an applicant must show that he had military service subsequent to the 1st July, 1922, as well as service in Easter Week or throughout either of the periods 1st April, 1920, to the 31st March, 1921, or from the 1st April, 1921, to 11th July, 1921.  Applicants who secure a service certificate will be awarded a pension on the basis of their rank on the 11th July, 1921, or on the 1st July, 1922, whichever is the higher.</P>
    <P>The two new classes being brought in, in view of the amendment that has been circulated, will be granted pensions according to the rank they held on the first day of their service during Easter Week or the last day of their service during the Black and Tan war, whichever is the higher.</P>
    <P>A difficulty arises in grading the ranks in the I.R.A. so as to make them comparable with the ranks of the standing army.  The I.R.A. was organised on a territorial basis, each parish or village had its company of Volunteers and each district its battalion. These units were called companies or battalions in many parts of the country even though there were not sufficient men in a company to make a section or a half-section in a standing army.  In the case of my old division there were a few companies which had only from 12 to 20 men each, while in other companies there were as many as 150 men.  In order to arrive at a grading which will make the ranks of the various units of the I.R.A. comparable one with another and with those of a standing army, it has been found necessary to incorporate the rules for the grading of ranks which will be found in the First Schedule to the Bill.  These rules ensure that a <Col N="295" /> company officer will not be graded as captain unless there were 60 men or more in his company and that a battalion O/C will not be graded as commandant unless there were 300 men or more in his battalion.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the ranks are designated A, B, C, D, and E.  Rank A corresponds to a rank higher than that of Major-General in the 1924 Act; Rank B, to Colonel or Major-General; Rank C, to Commandant or Major; Rank D, to Lieutenant or Captain; Rank E, to Private or Non-commissioned Officer.  The rate of pension corresponds to the equivalent ranks under the 1924 Act.</P>
    <P>The duties performed under the 1924 Act by the Board of Assessors in the finding of rank and service will be performed under this Bill by a referee, who will be assisted by a committee of four persons as set out in Clause 6 of the Bill and provision is made that the referee will have power to compel attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.  The provision in the Military Service Pensions Act, 1925, as to the power of the Executive Council to revoke a military service pension granted under the 1924 Act has been incorporated in the Bill as regards pensions to be granted under the Bill (Clause 12).</P>
    <P>Clause 13, following a similar provision in the 1924 Act (Section 3 (6)), enables the Minister, both as regards pensions under the 1924 Act and under this Bill, to request the referee to review a report on which the certificate and pension were based on the ground that evidence not available prior to the making of such report has since become available, and in accordance with the report of the referee to withdraw or reduce any such pension that may be granted.  It may be taken that such request to the referee to review cases of pensions already granted will not be made unless there is fairly strong evidence that there was fraud or misrepresentation.  It is estimated that as the number of men who become entitled to pensions under this Bill is roughly twice the number who have already been awarded pensions under the 1924 Act, the annual cost of the <Col N="296" /> Bill will amount to £360,000.  The two additional clauses which are being brought in in the amendment circulated will add roughly another £40,000.  It is impossible to give a close estimate of the probable cost, but I believe that £400,000 is an outside figure, and that the annual cost will be well under that amount and cover all the classes provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Bill, but if I do it is because we have been notified about an amendment, which, of course, it is not in order to discuss on Second Reading. The position is that the previous Administration gave pensions to men who had pre-Truce service and who fought in the National Army to uphold the State.  This Administration comes along and brings in a Bill to give pensions to people who had pre-Truce service but who fought to disrupt the State.  I do not object to that.  The people of this country have elected this Government and I presume that the people who sent the Government here agree with them.  It is none of my business then to object.  But what I cannot understand is this: we have people who took the right and people who took the left and when this Bill is passed they all will have pensions.  But the sensible men who fought in the Insurrection of 1916, who fought in the Black-and-Tan war, the men who had the sense when the civil war came along to stand aside and say: &ldquo;We will take neither side&rdquo; were being left out until the Government were forced to include them in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having gone so far, I appeal to the Minister to do the thing decently.  I will not ask him to do it generously, but to do it decently and justly.  The great omission I see in this Bill, even taking into account the amendment which it is proposed to insert, is that in this age of chivalry, this age of the equality of the sexes, the Cumann-na-mBan are not included.  The Cumann-na-mBan fought in Easter Week just as well as the Volunteers, the Hibernian Rifles, the Fianna Eireann, and the Citizen Army.  They fought as well and they are as well entitled to pensions. I shall probably bring in an amendment <Col N="297" /> to include them.  I suppose I shall have to put in definitions.  I shall have to delete the word &ldquo;male&rdquo; in Section 3.  With the equality of the sexes at the present day, I think it is a terrible thing to put in &ldquo;male person&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is another very small section that I should like the Minister to bear in mind.  This is an Act to amend and extend the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924 to 1930.  Under the 1924 Act, and probably under some of the other Acts, there were certain dates fixed by which applications should be put in.  I have not any particular case in mind, but I know that at that time some people were in Canada and some in the United States and their applications were not in in time and they did not get the pensions.  They were entitled to them and the Act of 1924 applied to them.  I shall have to ask Senator Comyn to help me out in this, as I am not a legal man, but I think these people would be entitled to apply under this Bill.  Of course, it will exclude their Army service because they did not apply under the 1924 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3, paragraphs (a) and (b) says that the Act applies to every male person who served in the forces and gives certain dates, etc.  Paragraph (c), however, says:</P>
    <P>Who is not a person to whom the Act of 1924 applies.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Applies&rdquo; is the word I do not like. I am quite satisfied that what the Government have in mind is people who are benefiting under the 1924 Act, but I think that when the Act was passed it applied to everybody who was eligible to apply for a pension. It certainly would apply to them up to a certain date, and the question arises whether it applied to them afterwards, they not having applied for a pension.  I do not like the word &ldquo;applies&rdquo; there and I should like Senator Comyn's help.  I imagine that the referee would have to rule out all the men whom the 1924 Act applied to, whether actually getting pensions or not and that would be unfair.  I should like to see an amendment inserted to cover these few men, as I understand they are a very small <Col N="298" /> number, who were eligible under the 1924 Act and that they should be allowed to apply under this Act.  All I want is to be fair and just to everybody. I shall probably put in an amendment to have them included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably it will save time on the Committee Stage to raise two points touching the amendments of which I have given notice.  I am not dealing with the general principle of the Bill, but for the purpose of facilitating later procedure it might be advisable that I should touch upon these two points.  Under Section 8 it is provided that the Minister shall refer applications to the referee.  A referee is to be appointed under this Bill with two advisers in place of the Board of Assessors under the old Bill. Every application shall be referred to the referee, who shall report as to whether the applicant is or is not a person to whom the Act applies and, if the applicant is a person to whom the Act applies, then the referee shall report on the service periods, the grade of rank and on such other matters as may be prescribed.  The prescription is to be by the Minister. I do not quite understand what might be involved in that.  It seems to me to leave it open for the Minister to make regulations prescribing what the referee shall report upon, which conceivably might defeat the intentions of the legislature and then the referee's report will be a private document with everything more or less secluded from public observation.  This prescription seems to me to be a dangerous provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (5) of the same section it sets out that where a report has been made by the referee under this section on an application for a service certificate, the Minister may, on the ground that evidence not available prior to the making of the report has since become available, request the referee to review such report.  That is more or less a repetition of what was in earlier legislation.  I will draw attention to the fact that the Minister will not know what evidence was available to the referee because, according to earlier decisions by the old Board of Assessors and, presumably, <Col N="299" /> those decisions having been supported by the Minister, the documents are in the possession of the board and are not available even for the Minister.  The Minister will not know what evidence was before the referee and therefore will not know what was available and what new evidence has come forward.  There is no real review possible.  That raises the question involved in the second amendment I put forward.  I do not intend to argue that case now, because it would delay the House perhaps too long and it would be better not to prejudice the later discussion.  The points I have raised will at least give the Minister an idea of what the amendments I have put down are driving at and will enable him to be prepared to meet the arguments.</P>

      <P>It is only right that some voice should be raised in defence of the unfortunate taxpayers.  They are being called upon to bear many heavy burdens in the carrying out of this Government's policy.  We have already dealt with a Bill which will mean a burden of £600,000 and to-day we had another measure which will cost at least £100,000.  This Bill now proposes additional heavy expenditure on the people of the State.  I do not object to any servant of the State who, in defence of the State, risked his life when he joined the forces to protect the State, being compensated in some way.  What I do object to is paying pensions to a certain number of men, many of them misled by their leaders, who went out in open rebellion against the vast majority of the people.  They have already cost the taxpayers of this State the awful sum of £36,000,000.  I do not believe even that will be sufficient to pay for the damage done.  I think it is a terrible thing, and it certainly is not the practice of civilised countries, to pension men who fought against their own country like the men who went into rebellion during the civil war.  I wish to register an objection to this proposal on behalf of the unfortunate people who have to pay.</P>

      <P>I thought when Senator <Col N="300" /> Miss Browne began her speech that she was going to be perfectly reasonable. I wish she had concluded her speech after the first or second sentence.  If she had done so, her speech would have been perfect.  I think that the State never suffers by doing what is just.  I think it was just to reward the men who fought for the liberty of their country in the many generations that have passed. Many men have risen to defend their country in the past and they failed to achieve that object.  In our time something has been achieved.  It is just and right that the men who went out and gave their time, their health and their energies for their country should get a reasonable reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what you said and I, for one, thoroughly agree with Senator Miss Browne.  I also agree with Senator Staines as regards the amendment which the Minister has indicated and which will allow some reward to the men who defended the liberty of their country between 1916 and 1921.  It is only right that they should get a reward for their services, whether they took part in the civil war or not.  That is the intention of this Government.  The last Government gave pensions to the men who fought for their country and who, as some people will say, then fought against their country.  This Government, in its original measure, proposed to give pensions to the men who fought for their country and who continued to fight for their country to the end&mdash;that is what we say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure everybody will agree with the amendment indicated by the Minister and I am very glad to see that it has met with general approval in the country.  It provides that the men who fought for their country and who refused to fight against their country later are to get a pension for the work they did.  This amendment has not been introduced as a result of pressure from Senator Staines or anybody else.  I believe that it was introduced because it has been borne in upon the <Col N="301" /> Minister's mind that it is a fair thing to do.</P>
    <P>Senator Staines has appealed to me to construe a portion of Section 3, which sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>This Act applies to every male person&mdash;(c) who is not a person to whom the Act of 1924 applies.</P>
    <P>Now, I would not like to refuse any request made to me by Senator Staines, but because I happen to be a barrister I do not think it is fair to call upon me to construe Acts of Parliament before they are passed.  At the same time, I should say at a hazard that the meaning of it is that any person who could get a pension under the 1924 Act will not get a pension under this Act.  That is the meaning of it.  Of course the Senator sitting beside Senator Staines&mdash;Senator Duggan&mdash;is better able to express an opinion on that question than I am. Senator Staines referred to other amendments.  I would call attention to the fact that this is a measure, the passing of which will involve the payment of money, and I rather think that a Financial Resolution would be necessary to cover any amendment, the adoption of which resulted in an increase of the financial burdens.  I feel very happy that this measure of justice has been received with approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">

      <P>Does this Bill take in men of whom there are a considerable number who did not take up arms until 1922?  Does it include men of military age before 1922 but who did not take up arms before that date? It was to those that my previous remarks had reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a suggestion to the Minister which I hope he will consider I think this State, be it good or bad, is largely due to the efforts of the men of 1916.  I think everybody will be impressed with the resolution and bravery of these men who took up arms at that time against the might of the British Empire. <Col N="302" /> These men had not in mind any idea of reward or of pensions.  They were a comparatively small body.  I think they should be specially honoured if it was only by some token presented them by the State.  In the case of men who were executed, or who have since passed away this token of honour should be presented to their families. Some distinguishing mark should be given in recognition of their services. We must remember that they were a small force within this country at that time, and I venture to say that at one period, if some of the people in this country could lay hands upon them their punishment would be much more severe at the hands of the natives than at those of the foreigners.  In allocating pensions some discrimination should be made in respect of these men.  Some token of honour that future generations and the descendants of those men would cherish should be made to them and their families. They certainly played an outstanding part in modern Irish history.  I think the point of bringing in men who fought the Tans and refused to fight their own people, is a wise and a proper one.  I am glad to know that the Government are about to accept such an amendment.  I am sure the suggestion I make would meet with the whole-hearted approval of the best people in this country, that is to specially honour the men who took up arms in 1916.  With regard to pensions in the case of such men, I think there ought to be a flat rate without any discrimination as to officers and men, and that the recognition and reward which it is proposed to give should be the same in both cases.</P>

      <P>Most of the points raised in this discussion are points that can be dealt with in the Committee Stage.  The historically inaccurate statement made by Senator Staines can also be dealt with at a later stage.  Senator Foran raised an interesting point in his speech, that is the issue of plaques or medals to those who took part in the 1916 war.  That matter is under consideration.  One of the big difficulties was to have certificates on which medals or plaques <Col N="303" /> could be issued.  This Bill will provide a certified list of all who took part in all the different wars.  Then if it is decided to issue plaques or medals to those people the necessary provision can be made.  Certainly, a list upon which medals would be issued will be available.</P>

      <P>(2)  That the Seanad further recommends that the Government, with a view to preventing developments likely to provoke disorder, should appoint an impartial tribunal to consider and report whether, in fairness to the farmers of the Saorstát, the collection of land annuities should not be suspended.</P>
