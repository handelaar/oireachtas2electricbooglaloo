    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As Senators will see, the Central Fund Bill is in the usual stereotyped form. Section 1 authorises the issue out of the Central Fund of the sum of £2,181,000, and its application towards making good the supply granted for the service of the financial year which is just closing.  This sum represents the total of the original and such Supplementary Estimates taken for the current year as were not covered by the Appropriation Act of 1933. Section 2 makes provision in respect of the grant of £10,569,000 which has been granted by the Dáil on the Vote on Account; and Section 3 is the usual clause empowering the Minister for Finance to borrow up to the amount of £12,742,000 which is the total of the two sums referred to.  As is customary, the sum required to be provided under Section 2 of the Bill is something in excess of one-third of the total Estimates for the Supply Services, the total cost of which for the coming financial year will be £29,709,000.  It may be taken that the cost of the Central Fund services for the coming year will be about £5,700,000, making a total for all services for which provision will have to be made in the coming year of about £35,400,000.  I should like to emphasise that a large part of this expenditure will be for works of a capital nature, the loan charges on which will be, to a large extent, self-liquidating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal Votes upon which the increases occur are: the Old Age Pension Vote which accounts for an increase <Col N="646" /> of over £125,000 on the amount provided last year; the Local Loans Fund where there is an increase of £2,050,000 over last year; the provision for public works and buildings which accounts for an increase of over £113,000, almost half of which is represented by increased provision for new schools and colleges; the Department of Agriculture which has an increase of £127,000, of which £90,000 is in respect of the new scheme for the purchase of oats with a view to stabilising the price of that product; primary education on which there is an increase of £98,000, largely occasioned by the increase of £294,000 in the amount to be provided for the national teachers' pensions, off-set by a decrease of £226,000 in the amount to be provided for national teachers' salaries; unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance where there is an increase of £1,303,000 as a result of providing the sum of £1,500,000 required for the purposes of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.  This is off-set to some extent by increased appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>On the Vote of £350,000 for relief schemes there is an apparent decrease as compared with last year of £200,000.  It will be remembered that last year the original Estimate for this service was £150,000.  Subsequently, the amount voted for the service was brought up by two Supplementary Estimates to £550,000.  On the Land Commission Vote there is an apparent decrease of £1,526,000 due, mainly, to the elimination of two items; one of £795,000, and one of £1,403,000 which were provided last year from the Central Fund to enable certain payments to be made to the Land Bond Fund and to relieve the Guarantee Fund in respect of a deficiency in the amount of the annuities collected.  These items, between them, total approximately £2,200,000.  After making allowance for their elimination from the total of last year's Estimate there is a substantial increase of over £671,000 in the provision which is being made for the Land Commission which is, of course, in anticipation of the operations <Col N="647" /> which will be initiated under the Land Act of 1933.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid misunderstanding, I think it is desirable that I should point out that, over and above what was provided last year for the relief of rates on agricultural land, an additional amount of £220,000 will be granted this year, making the total amount to be provided in the coming financial year for this service £1,970,000 as compared with the £1,948,000 which was provided for the year 1931-32; that is, the year ended 31st March, 1932.  No Vote for this additional amount appears on the Estimates, but as was the case last year the provision will be made by way of Supplementary Estimate which will be introduced in the Dáil after the Oireachtas has passed the necessary legislation to enable this additional grant to be made.</P>
    <P>These are the principal items which account for the increase in the estimated cost of Supply Services for next year.  These and some minor adjustments on other Votes bring the total amount required for Supply above the sum total of the original and Supplementary Estimates for last year by £1,790,000, and above the corresponding Estimates for 1931-32 by £6,779,000.  As I have already indicated, a considerable portion of the increase is represented by capital expenditure on works of a reproductive nature.  As an instance, I might mention the Vote for the Local Loans Fund which amounts to £4,200,000. This, together with the sum of approximately £330,000 that will be brought into the fund either in repayments of advances therefrom or interest upon these advances, will make a total of £4,500,000, which will be spent almost mainly on housing projects.  I might passingly refer also to the increased expenditure upon afforestation and to the proposed expenditure upon experiments in the manufacture of industrial alcohol.  As to the remainder of the increase it is almost wholly accounted for by the increased provision which is being made for old age pensions consequent upon the operation of the Old Age <Col N="648" /> Pensions Act, 1932, and to the provision which is being made under the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1933 for the relief of distress occasioned by unemployment.  In connection with this last mentioned provision, I should like to emphasise that the Government do not regard the provision of relief in this form as the best solution of the problem presented by the unemployed.  On the contrary, they are having fully investigated the possibility of undertaking public works of a remunerative nature by which expenditure on wages will be substituted for expenditure on unemployment relief.</P>
    <P>As the House no doubt understands, this Vote on Account is merely of a preliminary nature and all the considerations involved in the Government's programme will come up for fuller discussion on the Finance Bill and on the Appropriation Bill which will follow the Budget statement which may be anticipated in May next.  The House will then have the opportunity of hearing not merely an account of the expenditure which the Government proposes to undertake, but also the manner in which that expenditure will have to be provided for. I understand that the House has been good enough to indicate that it would take all the stages of this Bill to-day and it is desirable that it should, in order that the Bill may become law before the end of the financial year, and that the necessity for the Oireachtas to sit during Holy Week will be obviated.</P>

      <P>The policy of the present Government has left a lot of people in my part of the country with nothing to do.  Although I have not yet signed up on the unemployment register, I found myself the week before last with more leisure than I knew what to do with although I might describe myself as an industrialist. Accordingly, I devoted the greater part of the day to the pursuit of £2,000,000 economy which the Minister and his colleagues led the simple people of Donegal&mdash;of whom I am one &mdash;into believing would come as a thunder-clap once they were safely enthroned in Merrion Street.  My pursuit <Col N="649" /> was in vain.  The £2,000,000 saving was too elusive for me.  Instead of a saving of £2,000,000, I found myself counting up millions of additional expenditure by this Government which made the welkin ring with their hoarse cries of economy at two general elections and is now making the welkin respond to a sweet chorus of prosperity. Indeed, one would think, to borrow the language of the immortal Mr. Dooley, that &ldquo;the defeat of economy be prosperity was wan of the raysults of the election.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual expenditure on Supply Services in the year 1931-32, before the advent of the economisers, was £21,617,500.  For this year the economisers estimate their expenditure on supplies at £27,918,715.  That was a little jump of £6,000,000 odd, as the Minister has told us.  For the coming year they estimate their expenditure on Supply Services at £29,709,707&mdash;an increase of £2,000,000 on top of the £6,000,000.  The change of Government from extravagance, as it was called, to economy, as it is called, has cost the country £8,000,000 in two years in respect of Supply Services.  Having, as a result of a deliberate and set policy of Spartan economy, run up the nation's bill by £8,000,000, I wonder what miracles of extravagance the Government would have accomplished if they set out to be a little generous! As I said, I was disappointed in my search for the elusive £2,000,000 saving. So I sought consolation for my disappointment in a perusal of the Dáil Debates of a few years ago.  I spent a wet afternoon reading the speeches of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues when they were filling the rôle of Scrooge and I was really amazed at the enlightenment which I received.  I had intended to cull one of these speeches from the Official Report and repeat it here verbatim. It would constitute a more telling indictment of the policy of the present Government, as disclosed in this Bill, than I could hope to formulate. I thought, however, that this method of attack might be unduly embarrassing to the Minister, so I shall trouble the Seanad with only a few counts of the indictment which Ministers <Col N="650" /> have formulated against themselves. The Minister for Finance may recollect these emphatic words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We now see the Deputy in office. But we can remember the Deputy out of office and we can recollect how at great length he pleaded in this House the ever argued and always lost cause of the taxpayer. If ever a man burned with a passionate zeal for economy it was the Deputy.  Alas, the Deputy has become one of the tax spenders.  It is sad and chastening to reflect how office may corrupt even the best of men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Has office corrupted our Minister for Finance?  He was at one time an incorrigible miser as far as public moneys were concerned.  Now, he steps in to us with a Bill based on an expenditure of over £29,000,000.  There is an old Latin maxim, <i>Corruptio optimi pessima est</i>!  The corruption of the best is productive of the worst. The incorruptible miser when expenditure was £25,000,000 has in office developed into a reckless profligate.  He squanders not in thousands but in millions.</P>
    <P>One of the minor economists of Fianna Fáil was accustomed to demonstrate to us&mdash;when the courts were not sitting&mdash;how the British Government ran the whole country at a lesser cost than the Cosgrave Government ran 26 counties.  This Fianna Fáil economist&mdash;true to type&mdash;was a gentleman who, when in the British Parliament, voted for all the Lloyd George Budgets which trebled the taxation of this country.  I am wondering what his thesis is, in connection with the cost of Government by Fianna Fáil. Since, however, he has added to the economies of the public purse by accepting a job worth £1,700 a year, we have been deprived of his expert financial assistance.  So I am compelled to revert to the Minister for Finance in my search for instruction. The Minister said in the other House in March, 1931:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the trade for the year 1929 there was an adverse balance of £5,790,000 which we are unable to pay for out of the produce of our labour because our Government <Col N="651" /> takes too much from us.  It is rather a significant fact if you consider the amount paid away in the ultimate financial settlement for which the Minister for Finance was originally responsible, that it is enough almost to meet our adverse trade balance. If we were able to retain in this country the moneys paid away under that agreement we would be solvent from year to year and our position would certainly be much better off than it is.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have retained these moneys during the past two years and how much better off are we?  Our adverse trade balance of £5,790,000, as then stated by the Minister-to-be, has been swollen to £16,000,000, and our total external trade has shrunk from £108,000,000 to £55,000,000.  That is what the opportunist policy adumbrated by Deputy MacEntee in the speech I have quoted has yielded the country.</P>
    <P>Let me pass for a moment to that bright professor of optimism, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He is now the Mark Tapley of the Cabinet. He fails to see the cloud because of the silver lining.  But his optimism is newborn. It is only when our total expenditure borders on £40,000,000 that Mr. Lemass rises to the giddy heights of optimism.  When our expenditure was £26,000,000&mdash;a mere fleabite as the Minister for Finance would say&mdash;Mr. Lemass was a glum and gloomy pessimist. Here is what he then said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we are going to solve the problem of unemployment, if we are going to remove the cause of depression in agriculture, if we are going to give Irish industry a chance, we must reduce the burden of taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The way in which Mr. Lemass and his friends now proceed &ldquo;to give industry a chance&rdquo; is by shovelling on millions to the burden of the taxpayer.  In fact the bigger the bill the more exuberant becomes the optimism of Mr. Lemass.</P>
    <P>And the same applies to the unemployment figures.  Unemployment, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, reached its peak point a couple of months ago.  But the <Col N="652" /> peculiarity about this Fianna Fáil peak point is that it has been steadily climbing ever since.  Nevertheless, Mr. Lemass, who critically examined the Cosgrave expenditure of £25,000,000 in the Dáil in 1930 was not as cheerful a person as the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He then pointed out that the number of persons in receipt of outdoor relief had increased in two years from 16.7 per thousand to 19.9 per thousand, and he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If 2 per cent. of the people of this State have to be maintained out of public charity does it not indicate that the prosperity about which we hear so much at Cumann na nGaedheal meetings is largely illusory?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last November the number in receipt of home assistance, which is the current euphemism for outdoor relief, was 131,000 as against 59,352 in 1929.  It takes a great deal of optimism to counteract an increase of over 100 per cent. in the number of persons in receipt of public charity, but I have no doubt that the Minister will assure us that the greater the number of home assistance recipients the more prosperous we are.</P>
    <P>In order to vary the monotony of pessimism may I give you another quotation from the Minister for Finance. Speaking on the Vote on Account in 1931 and after painting the condition of the country in the darkest hues, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I know if President Cosgrave were here he would tell us how prosperous the country is.  The President is a confirmed believer in auto-suggestion. He is the Mary-Make-Believe of Irish politics.  He lives in a world of unreality, moving about from place to place surrounded by a handful of prosperous people.  He believes that the whole condition of this country is prosperous.  If he had to go to the country as we go week after week&mdash;not to meet prominent people&mdash;not to meet a few prosperous business people in every town&mdash;but to meet the mass of the people whom we see Sunday after Sunday coming out of country churches&mdash;those who have to toil and moil from morning to night&mdash;and ask them their opinion whether they enjoyed prosperity, he <Col N="653" /> would know, as we know, that there is more hardship and more want at present than there has been at any time during the present generation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was hardship and want when our register of unemployment had about 30,000 names and when our home assistance lists numbered 50,000.  Now that unemployment has increased to 100,000 and home assistance recipients number 133,000 we are enjoying a spell of profuse prosperity.  I wish the Minister would act on the advice he gave a couple of years ago.  If he pays a visit to my county he will moderate his views as to the teeming abundance of the good things which the people are enjoying under a Fianna Fáil Administration. And let me remind the Minister that the purchase of chronometers is not a test of the prosperity of the farmers as he seems to think.  The importation of clocks and watches could be readily explained.  The people are counting the minutes until they get an opportunity of enriching private life with the presence of the Fianna Fáil Ministers.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I would recommend Ministers to do a little research work, just as I have been doing, into their own history.  As a beginning let them read from their own speeches of a few years ago, if they are not too nauseating to them.  For instance, let the Minister for Finance read the speech he made on the Central Fund Bill, 1930, when he was deprecating increased taxation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Last year our total export trade amounted to £46,061,000.  That represented the gross out-turn of this community, and all that out-turn had to be sold in a very competitive market.  It is possible that during the coming year competition in that market will be further intensified, but there is an added factor to be taken into consideration, viz., that during the coming year that market will be a rapidly falling one and, therefore, one in which the producers' margin of profit will tend continuously to diminish.  In these unfavourable conditions and in face of diminishing profits, what will happen if the Minister imposes further taxation upon the producers of <Col N="654" /> this country?  It will represent an increase in the cost of production for which the producer cannot seek to compensate himself by asking higher prices.  He will be between two fires &mdash;I had almost said between two thieves&mdash;his competitors abroad and the Minister's tax-gatherers at home. What will happen?  He will either give up the ghost and cease to produce, or he will endeavour to reduce the immediate, but not the ultimate, cost of production by decreasing wages, by declining to make proper provision for the maintenance and development of his plant and industry and by reducing his personal expenditure.  By ceasing to produce he directly creates unemployment and becomes unemployed himself. By reducing wages he reduces the purchasing power of his employees, and by failing to maintain and develop his own concern he creates unemployment in all the ancillary industries which depend upon his.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Minister might profitably read that speech again, and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce could also read what he said when the Central Fund Bill, 1931, was being discussed, when he expressed his alarm at what he termed &ldquo;the definite diminution of our wealth-producing capacity.&rdquo;  One of the principal causes, according to Mr. Lemass, was that our cattle population had considerably decreased during the previous ten years.  Now, under Fianna Fáil's beneficent rule, the cattle population has so immoderately increased that Mr. Lemass proposes to slaughter them in order, I presume, to improve our wealth-producing capacity.  The most dazzling gem in the Central Fund Bill debate of 1931 was the contribution of President de Valera, in which he proved beyond doubt that an actual increase in the Estimates of £138,646 was, owing to depression and a fall in agricultural prices, really an increase of £6,000,000.  As this was so characteristically de Valerian I hope the Seanad will excuse me if I read it verbatim:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We find, as I have said at the outset, that the Estimates, as introduced <Col N="655" /> this year, show an actual increase of £138,646.  That is not a fair picture of the situation at all, because in the interval we know that the value of money, as shown by the cost of living indices, or the wholesale prices which the farmer gets for his produce, has appreciated.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to all these indices we find that the actual increase is very much greater, and the burden on the community is very much greater than is indicated by that increase.  So that instead of cutting down, the fact is that the cost of all these services is gone up, and, with increased cost in other directions, one would have expected that the Minister for Finance would not ignore directions in which substantial savings could be made.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Between January, 1930, and January, 1931, there was 7.3 per cent. fall in the cost of living.  If we take that into account and make a corresponding reduction in the Estimates as introduced last year, the reduction would amount to £1,728,000, or, in other words, this year's Estimate represents an increase of that amount.  There was a 19.6 per cent. fall in wholesale prices between January, 1930, and January, 1931.  If we make a corresponding reduction in the Estimate as introduced last year we find that this year's Estimate represents an increase of £4,460,000 odd.  There is a 16.2 per cent. fall in the index of wholesale food prices.  Taking that figure, we find that the Estimates represent an advance of £3,667,000 odd.  If we take into account the decrease in the price of the produce which the farmer, who is our largest taxpayer, has to dispose of&mdash;take the fall in the price of fat cattle in the Dublin market between March, 1930, and March, 1931&mdash;we find that it represents to him&mdash;the person who has to sell cattle in order to provide for taxation&mdash;an increase of £3,362,000 odd.  If we take fat sheep similarly this year as compared with March, 1930, we find there is a fall of 27.5 per cent., and it would represent <Col N="656" /> a total increase to him of over £6,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for Finance would apply the President's arithmetic to the present estimate, or, alternatively, turn them into gold ounces.  In the same speech the President said that the offices of the various Departments were overstaffed with civil servants, whose numbers should be reduced, and he advocated £1,000 a year as the maximum salary for Ministers and civil servants.  He pointed out that to the workers and farmers, from whom the bulk of the taxation came, salaries of £1,000 a year seemed a fabulous sum. Now, the President has increased the number of civil servants in almost every Department of the State, and he does not think even £1,500 a year a fabulous sum to give in addition to his pension, to a distinguished professor of pedagogy recently appointed to a public position.  The President seems to have a weakness for pensioners, as one of the first things he did when he took office was to appoint a pensioner brother of a distinguished public functionary of this State to a public position worth £1,000 a year, plus his pension of £700.  The Labour Party that stands for one man one job never uttered a protest.  These things show how utterly sincere was all the talk of economy by Fianna Fáil before they secured office.  They were almost eloquent then.  Nobody was more eloquent than the President about the iniquity of a poor country like&mdash;ours spending £1,600,000 on a police force, and a similar sum on the Army.</P>
    <P>In the speech from which I have just quoted, President de Valera declared that a saving of £600,000 could be effected on each of these Estimates, or £1,200,000 for both.  Now he and his Government have increased the cost of both, and, in the case of the Army, they are spending £250,000 a year more, on what is practically a new army.  But the most sinister increase of all is the increase in the Vote for Secret Service for which £25,000 is now estimated. When I saw this jump from £2,000 actual expenditure to £25,000 in the Secret Service Vote I came to the conclusion that the Minister for Finance had been visiting the cinemas, and had <Col N="657" /> been suddenly struck with the idea of dotting the Continent with a bevy of beautiful Irish spies, who would steal the dispatch cases from unsuspecting diplomats, or perhaps lure foreign representatives of Britain into a disclosure of Mr. Thomas's intentions regarding the tax on stall-feds.  My speculation was strengthened by the recollection that when the Ministry set out on its policy of making Ireland Gaelic, by posturing at a cinema show in this city, the title of the film was, I think, &ldquo;Grand Hotel,&rdquo; which the Fianna Fáil newspaper described as a story of &ldquo;wine, women and crime.&rdquo; We have had the crime in plenty and I suppose a share of the wine, too. When the increased Secret Service Estimate appeared, I thought the moment had come for the introduction of the women.  However, I was amazed to find that the Minister proposes to spend the £25,000 on a new home industry&mdash;internal espionage.  The £25,000 is to be spent in spying on an organisation which the Ministry hope to outlaw.  This sum has been described by the Minister as a mere flea-bite. It may be a flea-bite to the Minister, but the Merrion Street fleas have evidently capacious jaws, and to the man in the street the sum represents the cost of 60 or 70 decent houses annually.  I think we are entitled to know what the policy of the Ministry is in connection with this huge sum, which is to be handed out to secret agents.  Is any of the money to be handed over to the gentlemen who spied on General Mulcahy in Glasgow? Are the tottering finances of Fianna Fáil clubs throughout the country to be buoyed up by donations from the Secret Service Fund for spying on political opponents?  If a Government can only exist by suborning agents to the extent of practically £1,000 per county, then its mandate is at an end, and it should do the decent thing, get out, before the populace is completely corrupted by bribes and secret donations.</P>
    <P>I notice, too, that in addition to secret information the Government is providing for public information.  We are to have an information bureau. According to the President the function of the bureau will be to let the <Col N="658" /> world know the truth.  Well, I sincerely hope not.  I found in a recent issue of the Dáil Debates sufficient admissions of outrage, murder and crime to damage our reputation for all time, if advertised to the world. Although these outrages were perpetrated against members of the Party with which I am associated, and although in most cases no arrests were made, I sincerely hope that the Press Bureau will not be used to tell the world the truth about them.  What the present administration require is a Press Bureau to keep the truth from the world.  Perhaps that will be its function.  When defending the increased figures in his Estimates in the Dáil, the Minister for Finance argued that this expenditure would be productive.  Let me quote against him an equally convincing authority:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is no counter to this argument to contend that some of the expenditure now contemplated will be productive. It cannot be immediately productive...  The benefit of it, though possibly certain, is shadowy or remote.  But the burden of it is not only certain but substantial and immediate.  Some of the heads... will be productive, but the cost of them ought to be met, not by imposing fresh taxation, but by retrenchments in regard to services which are not productive and some of which are merely parasitical.  If the Minister proposes to make further provision in regard to local loans, he ought to compensate the taxpayer for that provision by securing a corresponding economy, say, in the Gárda Síochána or in the Pensions or Superannuation Vote.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the advice of the Minister for Finance out of office.  I commend it to him, now that he is scattering millions about with so lavish a hand. But I have no hope that he will accept his own advice.  He is now Minister for Extravagance in an extravagant Government, and he will go on spending until all the resources, so carefully husbanded by his predecessors, have been dissipated.  When the crisis comes I have no doubt that President de Valera will meet it with an elaborate <Col N="659" /> explanation of his own <i>bona fides</i> and personal honesty, as remote from the issue as Kerry is from Cornwall.</P>
    <P>This Government is dispoiling the country.  If they continue for a few more years they will leave the country as bare as the rocks of my native county.  That they have been able to carry on so long is a tribute, not to themselves, but to the thrift of their predecessors.  When the store is spent the day of reckoning will come.  Those who are wasting the nation's assets, and demoralising the people in the doing of it, must take the responsibility for their actions.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that my remarks will be of a more prosaic character than those of the last speaker.  I am very much concerned with another aspect of the Bill&mdash;the growth and complexity of public expenditure and the inadequacy of the accounting system to keep pace with it.  I do not propose to raise this whole question now but it is time our method of public accountancy was overhauled and that there was a clear understanding as to the separation of capital and revenue items.  In the case of local loans, there should be a proper setting out of the interest received, which does not appear in the estimates at all.  There should be a different method of dealing with grants-in-aid and there should be some means of showing what are our outstanding liabilities at the end of the financial year.  This is not a subject that can be debated now.  It is a highly technical subject and I intend to bring it up again.  I ask the Minister seriously to consult his advisers as to whether the time has not come when there should be an examination by experts of the whole of our public accounting system, so that it would be brought up to date and be able to deal with the growing complexity of public services.  It is unsuited to this purpose at present.</P>

      <P>When Senator MacLoughlin was quoting an extract from one of the speeches of the Minister for Finance in which the Minister <Col N="660" /> referred to the then Government &ldquo;giving up the ghost,&rdquo; it struck me that to quote the speeches of Deputy MacEntee to the present Minister for Finance was like troubling Macbeth with the ghost of Banquo.  I could imagine the Minister being reminded of that episode in the still hours of the night and cowering before that accusing finger of the shade of his past as the spectre addressed him in the words in Macbeth:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Avaunt! and quit my sight.  Let the earth hide thee!</P>
      <P>Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;</P>
      <P>Thou hast no speculation in those eyes,</P>
      <P>Which thou dost glare with.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To-day, the Minister will suggest that there is no speculation in those eyes. But two or three years ago there was speculation in the eyes of Deputy MacEntee.  There was denunciation in his words and prophecy in his voice&mdash;denunciation of the extravagance of the then Ministry and prophecy of the economies which his Party would make when they came into power.  What is the position to-day? That the economiser has turned prodigal and spendthrift, that the prophet of yesterday is the callous unbeliever of to-day.</P>
      <P>Speaking of spirits, there is a saying:&mdash;&ldquo;You can call spirits from the vasty deep but will they come?&rdquo;  As to the probability of response to such invitations on the part of spirits, I cannot say anything, but I do know that we can call Senator Comyn, of 1931, to give testimony on the issues to be discussed here to-day.  Will he come?  If he does, he will appear here as a veritable Daniel come to judgment. Speaking on the Central Fund Bill here on the 25th March, 1931, Senator Comyn made these observations:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The farmer, who pays for all, is in a somewhat worse position than he was in 1914.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder is he better off to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;So far as I can judge, the prices of the commodities which he sells are about the same, or a little less, than the prices he received in 1914. <Col N="661" /> The profits of the farmer are much less than they were in 1914. Speaking in large terms, the farmer's income is the only resource of this State; yet there is no curtailment of expenditure.  There seems to be no diminution whatever in the large unproductive expenditure which is represented by this Bill and by other Bills which have passed through the Seanad.  There seems to be no lessening of speed in the race we have been running for the last eight or nine years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was simply a prelude to a more severe indictment.  Remember, that in 1931 the Estimates were £6,700,000 less than the Estimates before us at the present time.  Senator Comyn commented in this way on the Estimates for 1931:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the matter of expenditure, we are endeavouring to run parallel with the British Government, the Government of a great empire.  I suggest to the Minister that he must take a bold course and take it soon.  He must scale down his expenditure and the savings which will result from that scaling down must go towards the stopping of the decay in agriculture and the revival of other industry. I mention agriculture because it is the one industry which is capable of absorbing quickly the greatest number of young people.  I suppose the Minister has heard comments of this description both in public and private and, no doubt, he must be weary of them, but I hope that, by constant repetition, they will have some effect upon his mind....  We are living on a scale that could only be justified if our great industry of agriculture and our other industries were in a highly flourishing condition. In 1879-1880, the landlords lived just as the English landlords lived; they ran parallel with the English landlords. They broke themselves in the process, and, as the older Senators amongst us know, we had the terrible scenes of the land war.  Our Government to-day is collecting more than ever the landlords collected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government then were collecting <Col N="662" /> £6,700,000 less than the present Government proposes to collect.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They are trying to run on lines equal to the British Government. They are endeavouring to equal the British Government in everything and even to exceed the British Government where possible.  We are working on a grand scale, but I may tell the Minister confidently that this thing cannot last.  I have gone to the country and met people and I assure the Minister that the existing condition of things will not last. Something must be done in order to find employment for the young men and women, and I suggest that it can only be done by making big savings in our existing extravagant system of administration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those were the words of a man who is to-day the most effective spokesman in this House on behalf of the Government. He was dealing with Estimates of close on £7,000,000 less than the Estimates which the Minister comes here to-day to sponsor and justify.  The absence of Senator Comyn to-day shows, I think, that he would not have the heart to stand up and back the Minister in making this demand.  The argument which the Minister put forward as justifying this increase seems to be that the Government have embarked upon expensive new enterprises, or additions to enterprises commenced by their predecessors.  That is not facing the issue which the Government will have to face.  They went to the country and appealed to the electors to return them on the plea that the cost of administration could be reduced by £2,000,000 per annum without impairing the efficiency of the public services.  They did not go to the country and say that they proposed to increase, in two or three years, the expenditure of the State by £6,000,000 or £7,000,000.  They said: &ldquo;We propose to reduce expenditure by £2,000,000.&rdquo;  If, in 1932, the fortunes of the political contest had gone against the present Government Party and they had been left in the wilderness and the Cosgrave Administration, retaining power, had presented in the year 1934 an Estimate such as is presented <Col N="663" /> to-day, would Deputy MacEntee be defending that Estimate as necessary expenditure?  I venture to say that he and his Party would still be maintaining the position they took up in 1932, that the figure for that year was £2,000,000 in excess.  If this increase of £6,700,000 were presented by the Cosgrave Administration, I have no doubt that the present Minister would stand up in the Dáil and vehemently declare that the Estimate was £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 in excess of what it should be.  That is the issue that the Minister has to face.  Because the Government have embarked on certain new forms of Government activity, they cannot be allowed to run away from their declarations of 1931 and 1932.</P>
    <P>Now I want to ask the Minister if it is proposed to use the broadcasting services of this State for the purpose of Party propaganda.  If so, are the leaders of Parties other than the Government Party, to have equal facilities for broadcasting the points of view of their Party?  I take it that broadcasting the President's address to America, in connection with the St. Patrick's Day festival, was at the cost of the State.  I take it that the broadcasting service is not the property of the Fianna Fáil Party and that it is part of the State's offices.  If it is to be used by one Party, for broadcasting their propaganda point of view, then, I take it, that in fairness to the other Parties in the State, they are going to be given the same facilities in broadcasting their point of view.  The only drawback that presents itself is that if that is to happen probably the war in the air, as Senator O'Farrell predicted last week, would arrive far more quickly than was at first anticipated. On the whole, I think it would be better if Party politics and frolics were kept out of that part of the State's administration.  I want the Minister to take a note of that, and to let me know what he proposes to say either in justification of propaganda by this method for one Party, or also to inform us if it is an indication that the leaders of the other Parties are to have the same facilities in this matter. <Col N="664" /> I care not what the Government Press may say on this matter.  There is a leading article in to-day's issue of the <i>Irish Press</i> upon a matter, but I do not mind what that paper says.  I say that the President broadcasted a statement of Party policy and not a statement of national character.  If the Party in office are to use this broadcasting system for promoting propaganda then, in fairness to the citizens of the State, and in order that people abroad listening may get a clear, balanced conception of what is the political situation, the leaders of the other Parties in the State should get an opportunity of availing themselves of this means of presenting their views.</P>
    <P>Senator MacLoughlin referred to many things, but I think he omitted to refer to subsidies.  He covered the matter of the Army, the Civic Guard, the Press Bureau, and so forth.  I want to get some information on other matters.  I am glad to see the Minister here to-day and I am glad he has recovered from his recent indisposition. I hope he will not have a relapse as a result of the thunderous appeals made to him here to-day.  Perhaps the Minister might enlighten us as to the purpose of the subsidies that are mentioned here.  I think it is understood generally that they are to assist Irish agriculturists during the continuance of the economic war.  If that is the reason I am glad the Minister for Finance is here because in January, 1933, he assured his hearers that the economic war was over long ago.  He said, speaking at Bantry in January 7th, 1933:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It must be clear to every honest man in the country that the Free State have won the economic war, and that the victory as everyone will admit has been achieved with the minimum of hardship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the Minister cannot have been wrong in that statement. The king can do no wrong, and surely the Minister for Finance, with his finger on the economic pulse of the nation, could not be so deceived and misled as to make such a statement as that without knowing that he was perfectly right.  Either the Minister was <Col N="665" /> wrong then, or he is wrong now in continuing these subsidies.  As a matter of fact I think he was wrong then.  I think the Minister's whole political career, since he took the wrong turning, has been like what the Minister for Industry and Commerce once described as the economic policy of the present Government&mdash;a system of trial by error.  The unfortunate part of it is that neither the Minister for Finance, nor the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has to pay for these trials by error.  The people who have to bear the cost of these erroneous experiments and experiences are the people of the State.  The present Government got into power by the tricks of the confidence man.  I say that deliberately and advisedly, and they are, apparently, prepared to retain their power, if they have to, by the methods of the gangster.</P>
    <P>In the discussion in the Dáil the other day the Minister for Industry and Commerce seemed to resent some newspaper description of the present Government as a gangster Government. I would hardly put it that way, but I would say they are suffering from the gangster complex.  They regard power and authority here as their racket, and anyone coming between them and their purpose must be, so to speak, bumped off politically.  That is not the view of an Irish authority that is going to get us anywhere.  I have been studying closely, and with a critical eye, the outlook of the Ministry as indicated by their expressions and acts.  The conclusion I have come to is this: that they do not appreciate the fact that they are exercising the functions of Government, but that they simply seek to regard themselves as the advance guard of some kind of political movement, and that they have secured control of office as a kind of tactical advantage for that Party that is going to have the administration of affairs in Ireland.  That conception of their psychology appears to permeate the whole mind of the Ministry.  The question whether taxation is to be raised, and how it is to be spent, is gauged, not by what the country needs and can stand, but how it is to be used to secure Party advantage for that particular <Col N="666" /> Party of which they regard themselves as the custodians, and not the custodians of the nation's rights and interest.  It is a serious and sad thing that that conception of authority should exist in the mind of any seriously-minded persons in the State. I say that because I am not trying to make a cheap superficial score, but because it is in essence the condition and reality of the present Party in power to-day.  Until that conception is dropped and until people who take office realise that once they take office they cease, so far as the country's authority goes, to be the mere spokesmen of a Party and that they are the custodians of the rights of all the citizens&mdash;until they realise that they must be prepared to meet with relentless and ruthless criticism of every activity they embark upon in the State.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the Party opposite having secured power by the methods of the confidence man.  I have here an advertisement issued by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not think the present Government likes to hear about advertisements, but perhaps as this may not have been quoted before, I had better refer to it.  It declares that the trade balance jumped in 1932 from £10,000,000 to £13,000,000.  But it has jumped higher still.  The momentum of the jump was not then exhausted. The jump now is something like £16,000,000, if not more.  The trade of the country, both import and export, dropped in 1932-33 by £32,000,000. What is the justification of the Minister? I think if the Minister appeared here to-day in the manner and in the attire which he ought to appear in properly, he would come here clothed in sackcloth and ashes and he would confess that this Government have failed, in what they undertook, when they assumed office, and that he had now to announce that they were withdrawing from this office, having realised their incapacity to do what they had undertaken to do.  We have had, as the Minister confesses, an increase of close on £7,000,000 over the Estimates for 1931-32, and so far as I can see, or gauge, from the suggestions of the Minister and from his further <Col N="667" /> activities, next year's Estimates will amount to another increase and so on. When is the limit going to be reached? Senator Comyn said this thing cannot last.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said we are only at the beginning of the enterprise.  We who studied these Estimates, and who follow the cost of the various Government Departments, must realise that practically every Bill that is passed in the Oireachtas means an addition to the annual Budget of the State.  One of the defects, though not the outstanding defect, which was observable in the Minister's statement, and which I hope he will be able to deal with in his reply, is that although he gave us a brief analysis or a summary of the various expenditures, he did not show us any indication that the limit had been reached, or, if not yet, the time when it was going to be reached and when we might expect some retrenchment and some step towards that economy which was promised before the present Government secured office. I remember once the late Tom Kettle said that if the Parliament of a people spent half the year discussing its estimates it would be time well spent. Now I often thought there was a great deal of truth in that, and the more I study the Fianna Fáil finance the more I am beginning to think it is not six months but 12 months we should have to concentrate upon the Estimates presented to us.  The one thing I want to finish on is the note in Senator Comyn's speech: &ldquo;This thing cannot last.&rdquo;  There is a limit beyond which we can pass&mdash;I am not sure we have not already passed it&mdash;but the passing of it means State bankruptcy, which the present Government faces with a degree of complacency.  Their former aim was to dismantle this State.  They are now in charge of the administration of the State.  Whether their real and ultimate object is to complete the work which they set out on in the beginning, namely, to dismantle the State, I do not know, but certainly judging by their finances they seem to have made up their minds that the taxpayer and tax-gatherer will achieve <Col N="668" /> what the bomb and the petrol can failed to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. Parkinson Mr. Parkinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that in the Estimates the Minister for Agriculture looks for roughly £8,000 to endow the Veterinary College and Veterinary Research. To my mind, this is a ridiculously small sum.  I would like the Minister to look into the cost of these services in other countries, particularly in South Africa.  There the Government voted for these purposes £90,000 a year.  Over £200,000 was given in the last few years in England plus £30,000 a year for these purposes and other countries trying to improve their live-stock health and the people's health as well, are spending to-day very large sums of money, indeed, for these services.  Ours seems to me, for an agricultural country, altogether out of proportion.  I will take up the time of the House by giving a few more particulars. In the first place this is essentially an agricultural country which must, by the very nature of its soil and climate, be largely concerned in animal husbandry and all that appertains thereto.  It must on that account take steps to ensure the preservation of the health and well-being of its stock and ward off the diseases to which they are subject.  That work has both a direct and indirect bearing on public health. To produce healthy animal products is of the very essence of public health measures, and this can only be accomplished when investigation and research go hand in hand with control measures.  No progressive agricultural country can afford to neglect the research into animal diseases which are playing havoc among the animal population.  These diseases have in some cases an adverse effect on human life; they retard the prosperity of the country and naturally the health of the people, and they interfere with the economic production of healthy animal food.  Moreover, with improvements in the health of animals which may result from the fruits of research an increased value and demand will ensue for the animals intended for export. To indicate the direction in which veterinary research may have valuable results some examples may be given&mdash; tuberculosis in cattle, pigs and <Col N="669" /> poultry.  In this as in other countries, tuberculosis is common among these three species of animals and the percentage of infected animals is not by any means low.  The percentage of infected cattle is got chiefly from slaughterhouse statistics.  The Dublin public slaughterhouse statistics for cattle give the following:&mdash;Cows suffering from tuberculosis, 33 per cent.; bullocks, 9 per cent.; heifers, 6 per cent., and there is no reason to believe that is not at all unrepresentative of the conditions in the country.  The average percentage of pigs infected at the time of slaughter has been shown to be about 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the position, therefore, is two-fold.  In the first place there is the public health aspect. There is the danger of infection, particularly among children, from the drinking of milk from cows affected with tuberculosis or advanced tuberculosis and although the number of cows responsible for infection of the milk in this country is comparatively low&mdash;probably not more than 2 per cent. of the total&mdash;yet their milk will contaminate a considerably larger quantity when mixed with other milks for sale purposes.  The remaining tuberculosis cattle are potential dangers.  Some of them will come to the stage when the milk is infected. The exact percentage of people affected in this country from tuberculosis milk is not ascertained but probably it is not very short of that estimate for countries where the deaths from bovine tuberculosis have been put down as representing 6 per cent. of the total deaths from tuberculosis.  The public health aspect of tuberculosis in the other animals is also of considerable importance in view of the fact that the cooking of the flesh of these animals when prepared for food is often insufficient to destroy tubercle bacilli which may be present in infected tissues.  It is largely on that account that so much of the edible tissues of cattle and pigs are condemned in the abattoir.  The economic losses from the disease are also of very great importance, partly because of this bearing of the disease on public health.  They include the loss from death, depreciation and condition <Col N="670" /> in value, reduction in the milk supply and from the condemnation of carcases and offal at the abattoirs in the interests of public health.  Probably the latter losses are the heaviest. I have a rough estimate of the number of cattle affected with tuberculosis, but as I cannot vouch for them, it might only alarm people to be told what the probable extent of the disease is.  It might be asked how can research be initiated in connection with this disease to reduce losses and the danger of human infection.  We have the tuberculin test at hand by which the bulk of the infected animals can be identified, and if funds were available for research the disease could be eradicated.  In any case the cost of rapid extermination would be too heavy in view of the estimates of infected animals.  Research, therefore, into methods of vaccination to immunise against the disease and prevent its appearance in young animals could do much to lighten the burden in a scheme of eradication of this serious affection.  The eradication of tuberculosis in cattle would do much to lessen the disease in pigs in which the losses from condemnation in this country are not less than £6,000 annually.  Another disease of importance is contagious abortion in cattle. This is rampant in various areas and especially among the larger herds.  Its cause is known and much has been learned to demonstrate how the disease can be eradicated and the animals rendered immune.</P>
    <P>In many countries like, America, South Africa, and to some extent in Great Britain, large annual grants are given for veterinary research, and where the work has been going on for some time the fruits have been abundant and have more than justified the time and money spent.  In South Africa, as I mentioned, £90,000 is being spent on veterinary research and teaching.  The two go together.  I would like to ask the Minister for Finance to consult the Minister for Agriculture on this matter.  Anything that is going to lessen disease will add to the external value of our stock and will also help us to find better and bigger markets for the stock we have <Col N="671" /> to sell, and, therefore, I would like to ask him to consult the Departments concerned and if possible to add to this sum something more for veterinary teaching and research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow the other speakers into the various criticisms of the Bill or Budget before us, but I should like to ask the Minister to let us have definitely some explanatory figures.  I should like to know, for instance, what was the cost of running the country in 1931, deducting from it the non-recurrent charges and the capital that was spent and I want the same figures for 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1935.  What I would point out is this: in 1914 the revenue of this country was estimated at £12,000,000.  The expenditure in the country was calculated to be £14,000,000, and then the cost of old age pensions, which was really what ran up the total cost, made the adverse balance in the profit and loss account because it was not lower, I believe, than the cost of old age pensions to-day.  I think it was read out while the Senator was not here what Senator Comyn said that two or three years ago the prices then ruling were if anything rather less than in 1914.  Now, according to this Bill of costs that we have before us to-day, the gross expenditure on the Free State will be £35,000,000, whereas in 1914 that same figure for the whole of the country was only £14,000,000.  There are two very serious things to consider when we are taking these figures into account.  First of all, as Senator MacLoughlin says, it looks very much as if we are embarking on an expenditure that will really render the country insolvent, but, supposing the country is able to survive, I do not think there is one of us here who does not look forward to the day when we shall have a united Ireland.  We hope that one of these days Ireland from the centre to the sea will be one and undivided.  Well, if we have to go to negotiate with the Six Counties and it is found that we are spending £35,000,000 or probably more in running our State, I do not think that <Col N="672" /> the hard-headed business people of the North of Ireland will be very much inclined to take a favourable view of our proposal to join up and become part of this State of ours.  I think that is a very important point.  I do not want to go into all the accusations that can be hurled at the present Minister.  We know perfectly well, of course, that when we do not have to do a thing it seems a much simpler job than when we have actually to undertake it, but there are two matters which I would ask the Minister to bear in mind&mdash;first of all, that if this expenditure goes on it will almost necessarily mean that this country will become insolvent, and, secondly, that if it does become insolvent it will certainly mean that we shall have no chance of getting a peaceful settlement with the North, which is the only settlement that I look forward to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the item of £7,500 for the hiring of halls.  Are these the halls in which the new volunteer forces are going to carry out their drills and their training?  When that amount is to be spent, we ought to know the purposes for which the halls are going to be used.  We know perfectly well that they are going to be Fianna Fáil propaganda halls.  Already attention has been drawn to the number of State services that are being used for Party purposes&mdash;the broadcasting station and several others.  A large amount of money which belongs to the State is being used for Party purposes. Attention has already been called to the proposed expenditure of £25,000 for Secret Service, otherwise for spying on the Blue Shirts.  What they have to spy on or what the necessity for spying on the Blue Shirts is I cannot tell, nor can anybody connected with them.  Everything they do is above board for everyone to see.  These are two items which I should like the Minister to explain when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator MacLoughlin in the course of his long, and sometimes amusing, speech adverted to statements which were made by us prior to the change of Government in 1931-32 and asked us what we had <Col N="673" /> done to give effect to our pledges.  He asked me to justify the fact that I had admitted that the estimated expenditure on Supply Services for the coming year would exceed the total amount of money expended by our predecessors for similar services in the year 1931-32 by £6,973,000.  That is quite easy.  If we take the one item of local loans alone, the amount which was provided for the year 1931-32 was £730,000.  This year we propose to provide a sum of £4,539,000, showing an increased expenditure on local loans of £3,809,000.  For public health works of various kinds and for peat development we propose this year to provide £350,000, as against £140,000 provided by our predecessors for the same purpose in 1931-32.  In free grants for housing we propose to provide £406,000 as against £212,000 provided by our predecessors.  For the improvement of estates this year in the Land Commission Vote we are providing £250,000 as against £239,000 provided by our predecessors, and for afforestation £121,000 as against £64,000.  For the provision of milk for necessitous children, we are providing £100,000 as against nothing by our predecessors. For an experiment to ascertain whether it is practicable to introduce the manufacture of industrial alcohol into this country, we are providing £102,000 as against nothing by our predecessors. For the relief of rates on agricultural land the amount which this year we will be providing is £1,970,000 as against £1,948,000 by our predecessors.  For educational services we are providing this year £4,320,000 as against £4,336,000 provided by our predecessors.  For a wheat bounty we are providing £120,000 as against nothing by our predecessors.  These items alone, or the interest on these items, account for about £4,640,000. For unemployment assistance we are providing £1,500,000.  For old age pensions we are providing £700,000 more than was provided in 1931-32, making the total approximately £6,840,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those figures may be subject to correction, but they are merely a few items taken out at random.  I have no doubt that if I were to go through the whole of the Estimates in detail, <Col N="674" /> I could account for a very much larger amount, and I could show a very much larger increased expenditure on services which I think even Senator MacLoughlin would not categorise as undesirable and unnecessary.  That is not taking into consideration the £2,225,000 which is provided for export bounties and subsidies.  The Senator made the usual debating point about the unemployment figures.  The Senator is a business man with a long experience of business life and he knows very well that when there is a prospect of getting something for nothing, simply by putting down one's name, you will have a good many more people than are entitled to benefit putting down their names in advance in the hope that subsequent investigations will not show that they are not entitled to the relief which they claim.</P>
    <P>The present figure for the registered unemployed is undoubtedly very highly inflated.  There are many persons who are not genuinely seeking employment registering in the hope, as I have said, that they will be able to conceal their true conditions from the investigating officer.  Many others have registered, who are in possession of land and other property, and who have means of subsistence other than as wage earners. A considerable number have put down their names also, who are not in fact employable and for whom relief would have to be provided in some other way. It is only after the unemployment assistance scheme has been in operation for some appreciable time, and when the investigation staff has been at work for a reasonable period, that, for the first time in this country, we shall be able to secure figures for unemployment which are reliable, or which can carry any real weight in serious debate. I am confident when those figures are ascertained that, at any rate, it will be seen that, even without taking into consideration at all the fact that our population is increasing yearly, the position in regard to unemployment is no worse&mdash;and I am putting it at its worst&mdash;than it has been at any time since 1923.  I feel also that if we had the comparable basic figures for the years 1923-24, 1924-25 or even 1930-31, <Col N="675" /> that the present condition of affairs would show an improvement on those periods.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane asked could there not be some investigation into the present accountancy system of the State.  I am not convinced that an investigation of that sort is pressingly urgent.  I am not prepared to say that it might not be, from the point of view of the statistician and the student, desirable that such an investigation should take place but I could not agree under present circumstances, with all Government Departments working at high pressure, that such an investigation should be launched because I am not certain that the results, which would accrue from it, would justify the expenditure of very valuable time which it would necessitate.  I may also say that there is a very considerable amount of information given as to the financial condition of the Exchequer and of the State in various publications. We have very full information given in the Finance Accounts which are published each year.  We have also information in the Estimates of receipts and expenditure which are published as a White Paper.  We have a good deal of that information collated in the statistical abstract which has been published annually since 1931.  In addition, each year when the financial statement is presented to the Dáil the Minister for Finance has to justify to the Dáil his classification of expenditure into what might be described as capital or non-recurrent expenditure and recurrent expenditure which might be properly met out of taxation. I think that a study of these statements, which have been made every year since the Free State was instituted, would give any student of this subject, any student of political economy, a very true presentation of the financial condition of the State as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I should follow Senator Milroy into his barnstorming quotations from Shakespeare, but I should like to correct him in regard to one particular.  He said that the <Col N="676" /> Government in 1931-32 was collecting £7,000,000 less than the Government of to-day.  Now, I think Senator Milroy must have been under a slight misapprehension because it is not to be taken from the Estimates, which have been presented and the statement which I have made to-day, that the Government propose to collect £7,000,000 more from the taxpayers this year than was collected in 1931-32.</P>

      <P>The Senator also asked whether it was proposed to use the broadcasting system for Party purposes. I am not aware that it is the policy of the Government to use the broadcasting station for Party purposes, and I would flatly deny that the Government have ever done so.  The President's address has been referred to, and Senator Milroy has taken it that that address was made at the expense of the State.  Well, I do not think it was.  I think that address was broadcast by arrangement with certain American Broadcasting Corporations, and I feel certain that they bore any significant expense that attached.</P>

      <P>Now, at any rate. Senator Parkinson referred to the question of veterinary research.  As a matter of fact that question has been engaging the attention of the Minister for Agriculture.  While I am not in a position to say that we could do everything that has been done in other countries, I have reason to believe that it is hoped it may be possible to initiate a campaign to eradicate tubercular beasts from our herds, and as a result of that a considerable amount of veterinary research will be undertaken into this and other diseases of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crosbie put me a rather tall order when he asked me to give him a very large series of comparable figures for 1912-14, 1929, 1930 and 1931-32.  I regret that at such short notice I am not able to give him anything more than figures which are just approximate.  The total expenditure on the Supply Services for the year 1931-32 was £22,930,000 about, and on the Central Fund Services £4,582,000, making a total expenditure in the carrying out of all governmental services of £27,450,000.  That figure is to be compared with the Estimates for the coming year of £35,500,000.  In connection with that latter figure I think I ought to point out that in every year since the State started certain allowances had to be made, naturally and justifiably, for what is known as overestimation. I think one may take the sum of £35,500,000 as being an outside <Col N="678" /> figure and may assume that the actual expenditure&mdash;I am anticipating a little &mdash;will not exceed £35,000,000.

      <P>I have given the most anxious consideration to the amendments to the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1934, of which Senator Blythe has given notice.  I have, of course, nothing to do with the merits of the amendments, but I have had placed before me all the arguments that could, I think, be adduced from the point of view of Parliamentary practice, both for and against their acceptance.  There are cogent arguments on both sides, but the factor which has had most weight with me is the time element and the repercussions that might ensue if the Bill did not become law by the last day of this month.</P>
      <P>I accordingly rule that the amendments are out of order, as being contrary to the principle of the Bill as read a second time.  But, in view of what I have said, I do not propose to regard my ruling as a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared, however, to allow to be moved an amendment to limit the operation of the Bill when it becomes an Act, and Senator Blythe, who has <Col N="679" /> been informed of my ruling, has intimated that he proposes to move as an amendment to Section 1 that the figures and words &ldquo;31st day of March, 1935,&rdquo; be deleted in line 19 and the figures and words &ldquo;31st day of July, 1934,&rdquo; substituted therefor.  This amendment, if carried, will limit the duration of the Act to four months instead of one year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, 1923 to 1933, shall continue in force until the 31st day of March, 1935, and shall then expire.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad, Sir, that you have stated that you do not regard your ruling on this matter as a precedent, because I think the points at issue will have to come before the Seanad again. They certainly will have to come before the Seanad again if the amendment which I now propose is agreed to.  I wish to limit the duration of this Act to the 31st July next for the purpose of having the matters in these amendments which have been ruled out of order brought before the House and a method devised by which they can be tested.  It would be better still if the Government reconsidered the matter and, when introducing the next continuing Bill, embodied in it some clauses such as I have set out in the amendments on the Order Paper.  In the early days the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act was considerably amended.  Afterwards the Bill became a mere continuing Bill, but it was always intended, both by the past Government and by the present Government, that permanent legislation should be introduced.  That, I think, was very necessary because in fact the legislation that now governs the Army was never considered in detail by the Oireachtas.  It was hurriedly passed in 1923 in the Dáil, and <Col N="680" /> if I am not mistaken I think it was disposed of in one day in the Seanad. Since that time only small portions of it have been reconsidered, and only very minor amendments have been made.</P>
    <P>It might have been possible to continue the Act again without amendment but for the action that has recently been taken by the Government. We have a volunteer force started, I suppose as a branch of the Reserve, which is to be spread all over the country for the organisation of that force.  We have had 20 men commissioned who have not had training as military officers.  As I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, I think it is a terrible and a most unfortunate thing that the Government should commission these men and should put them in charge in the various counties as administrative officers.</P>
    <P>I fear gravely that the organisation of this force, unless the Government can somehow mend its hand, holds the gravest possible menace to the future peace of this country, and for the preservation and respect of the democratic rights of its citizens.  I certainly cannot get out of my mind the belief that the intention of the Government is to make this force a Party political force, owing special allegiance to them, beyond the normal allegiance that any army should owe to the duly-constituted Government of the country.  I think it is almost sure to develop along lines that will be extremely unfortunate for the country, that young fellows who are going into it and who could quite perhaps naturally develop the right ideas, will not have an opportunity of doing so, because there will be an atmosphere of partisanship and partiality around them.  It is rumoured that not only has the Government appointed these men, who have no qualifications for the positions&mdash;but who have, shall we say, a lurid political past&mdash;as administrative officers, but it is said that there has been private canvassing through Party channels for the first recruits, so as to get men who are political partisans of the Government into the various units first to get them <Col N="681" /> trained as non-commissioned officers, and ultimately to make them officers of the Reserve.  I believe, when one sees what has been done in the case of administrative officers, it is only natural to believe that.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I regard this movement of the Government as of the gravest menace to the country. I do not know whether there is a positive intention on the part of the Government to deny the people their right to change the Government or not. At any rate they seem to prepare, by getting the instrument into their hands, to take that line, if later they decide on it.  Take these 20 men who have been commissioned, whose past, as I have said, has been a political and a partisan past.  I would deplore their being commissioned at any time.  I think if a force such as this is to be organised, it ought to be organised by officers whose outlook is as professional as possible&mdash;by capable officers with a professional outlook, and with as little interest as possible in politics.  But, if these 20 men were to be commissioned, then, if they had to be sent for two years to the military college, and if they had spent their time learning something of military forces, certainly they would get a new and much more satisfactory outlook, and while some of them might remain political partisans, I think they would have a better conception of their duties as officers of the State, and the danger of their introduction to the force would be very much reduced indeed.  The same thing applies to any other officer that it might be intended to recruit.  Personally, I think it would scarcely matter, if there were some political discrimination in the selection, because if they began to take their work seriously there would be a less dangerous element in whatever partisanship that might attach to them.  Apart from the dangers of creating a partisan army, by the line the Government has pursued, I think it is undesirable that we should begin with a low standard of qualification and of professional capacity.  It is undoubtedly a difficult thing in any sort of part-time force to keep the standard up.  The danger is that it will become entirely slovenly, and so undisciplined as to be of no value at <Col N="682" /> all from the point of view of the defence of the country.</P>
    <P>Senators have all heard the old story about the Duke of Wellington when he saw the levies that were sent out to him at one period of the Peninsular War.  They were untrained and ill-equipped. When he was asked what he thought of the new troops he said: &ldquo;I do not know what effect they will have on the enemy, but, by gad, they frighten me.&rdquo;  The sort of force that the Government has created, if it begins with this low standard, will probably not annoy any potential enemy, but would certainly be enough to frighten ordinary law-abiding citizens.  If we are to have a force along volunteer lines, we ought to make up our minds that we are going to have a good force, which is going to have a high professional standard, and that we are going to require the officers to be keen about their work. I do not think we can ever get that if we begin with these 20 administrative officers as the standard and as exemplars for future officers of the force.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence stated that these men had previous experience of fighting.  I will say nothing about that, except this, that the experience they had could be of no value to them as officers of such a force as is being created, because any warfare in which it was engaged would be carried on under radically different conditions. The guerilla fighting here was done when the British Government professed to be maintaining law and order here; when it professed to regard all the people as its people, except those actually engaged in operations against it; when its commanders, by reason of that theory, were tremendously handicapped, and when it was consequently possible for men on our side to pursue a certain line of tactics. These things would be utterly impossible if we had a foreign army, from whatever country, invading this State. In present circumstances the whole population would be enemies of that invading army, and it would not be subject at all to the handicaps to which the British forces were subjected, so that any experience these men gained in the past would be experience which <Col N="683" /> would be of no value at all.  They would require to begin right at the beginning, to study and to learn the elements of military science and art.</P>
    <P>There is just one other thing I would like to say in connection with this matter.  After all, the main purpose of a defence force of any sort is not to wage war successfully, but to prevent war taking place.  If a defence force is to prevent war taking place, it must have a reputation for efficiency and good organisation.  It seems to me that a body started as this volunteer force is being started, can never have a reputation for efficiency, and consequently can never do that thing which, above all, any defence force should do, to protect the country to which it belongs from being attacked.  It is only the second best thing to be successful in resisting attack.  I regard this whole matter of the organisation of the volunteer force as one that can only be satisfactorily arranged after due consideration, and on a basis that will meet with general acceptance from the people.  I believe it can only be built up slowly, that the attempt should only be made to do so slowly, and that the Government should begin by training the personnel to take charge of it, and to conduct the actual training of the men who will be recruited.  The Government have nothing at all to lose, unless it is doing what I said I feared it is doing, building up an armed political wing of its own.  Unless it is doing that, it has nothing to lose by taking time over this and proceeding in a business-like way.  I am moving an amendment to the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, so that the Bill will come before us, either as a continuing Bill or in permanent legislation, say in the course of a month or six weeks, and that before introducing new legislation the Government will decide to act as a Government should, decide to build up any force on the basis of efficiency, and on a basis acceptable generally to the people, and that it should altogether get away from the idea of getting partisans together and swearing them into a force so that they will not lose <Col N="684" /> their feeling of partisanship and putting arms into their hands.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Government proposes to distribute arms to these men, or to distribute arms widely through the country.  Certainly, if they do, nothing but calamity can follow from such a course, because men untrained in this way will certainly, in many cases, use the arms against neighbours, and if the arms are distributed in such a way, some neighbours will go after them and nothing but calamity can come.  I see no prospect of any good to the country on the basis of taking one section of the population, and putting arms into their hands, and organising them with their own partisan officers.  There may be differences of opinion in the Seanad as to the desirability of having such a force at all.  I am satisfied that if a force were to be organised along proper lines there would be overwhelming support for it.  Individuals and certain groups would, perhaps, disbelieve in the necessity for it but, so far as the great majority of the people are concerned, they would regard the formation of such a nonpartisan force as an asset to the country. I would like to say one other thing about this procedure of the Government.  I think the most precious thing a State can have is an army that is loyal and disciplined, with a thoroughly constitutional outlook.  Such an army is a protection to the general mass of the people from both internal and external force.</P>
    <P>It is widely believed, and widely feared, that the intention of the Government in organising this force is, not to supplement the existing Army, which is loyal and efficient, and rooted in the Constitution, but to replace that Army by this partisan army.  I certainly think the Seanad should not take any steps that would assent to any such course&mdash;if that is the intention of the Government.  It is because it is widely believed and feared that such is the intention that I put down one of the amendments which the Cathaoirleach has ruled out of order; that a man should not be promoted beyond the rank of captain until he has had five years' service as an officer.  I do <Col N="685" /> not know whether it is the intention of the Minister for Defence to make some of these men who are without knowledge&mdash;and who when commissioned were regarded as the awkward squad&mdash;colonels or major-generals.  If that is the intention, or if he takes any such course, certainly the people of the country can look out for a definite attempt on the part of this Government to deprive them of their democratic rights.  If that is not his intention he will have no objection to having these men serving a reasonable period before being promoted to high rank, and having them absorb a spirit of discipline, which requires time, and to get a professional outlook.  I think this whole matter is one which the Seanad cannot, in justice to itself, leave over for consideration for a year, and let the Government do what it likes in the meantime.  The Seanad ought to pass this amendment, and force the Government to make a clear declaration in the matter, and also, by acceptance of legislation, restore confidence to the people.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware or not, but I may tell him that there is grave alarm in the country about this proceeding. There naturally cannot be, among certain sections of the people, an attitude which would accept this Government's word in regard to democratic rights, because the members of it have, in the past, gone out in arms against majority rule.  Therefore, their words will not be trusted as the words of men who, in the past, had taken up a different attitude.  Because their words will not be trusted, they should, by their acts, inspire confidence, and their acts may not merely mean some modification of the policy which they have been recently pursuing in regard to the Army, but the acceptance of proper legislative safeguards.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Blythe's amendment.  He has said that the word of the Government cannot be trusted in this matter.  Everything I have seen and heard points to the fact that this is to be a political army.  We were told by the Minister, on the Second Reading debate, that that was not the intention of the Government at <Col N="686" /> all, that they wanted to get people of every class on these Sluagh Committees. One Sluagh Committee I know of is almost entirely composed of the Fianna Fáil club.  I referred here on Second Reading to the activities of one of these area officers from the time he came into the country to the moment he got his commission and put on his uniform.  He spoke from Fianna Fáil platforms and attended entertainments and meetings under the auspices of Fianna Fáil and I.R.A. combined.  His career as an Irregular leader was one which inspires all decent people with the greatest horror.  It was one of peculiar brutality.  I could mention incidents that happened under his leadership which would make a Christian's blood run cold&mdash;incidents of gross brutality.  I shall not inflict particulars on the House but I could give an account to anybody who wants it. I may mention that the selection of this particular man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do know that the selection of this man, without any training as an officer of the Army, is revolting to people who have always followed Fianna Fáil.  I speak only of what I know.  What Senator Blythe has said about uneasiness in people's minds with regard to this volunteer force could not be exaggerated.  The people believe that it is a political army and that the Government are going to do what they did before&mdash;make war on the majority when the majority will have voted them out of office.  People cannot be blamed for attributing that motive to the Government.  They have every reason to attribute it to them. The leopard does not change his spots and the Fianna Fáil Government are the same people as they were in 1922, when they went out in arms against the majority of the people.  They talk about majority rule now but who is <Col N="687" /> going to believe their professions? Nobody.  I support the amendment and I hope that the Seanad will adopt it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Defence is here, I do not want to labour this question.  I should like to point out, however, that when amendments were carried to Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bills, they were carried in the form of additional legislation which was embodied in the measure at the time the Continuance Bill was before the House.  This Continuance Bill has been repeated year after year.  On the Second Reading, the Minister for Defence indicated his desire to have a permanent Bill introduced, which would eliminate the need for the introduction of this Bill every year.  I do not know whether the Minister is wise in that or not.  I do not know sufficient of the technique, from the Army administration point of view, to offer an opinion on that.  I know that in other Parliaments the Army Vote comes up each year in the form of a Continuance Bill.  In some other countries it is considered that the debate on the estimate is adequate. However, I should like to point out that the idea of the volunteers is not a new idea.  I think that the ex-Minister for Finance, Senator Blythe, was himself largely responsible for encouraging the idea of the volunteers.  I believe that quite a considerable amount of money was spent in an effort to develop a volunteer corps.  I do not know how much money was spent or how many recruits were secured but I believe that the scheme was not altogether the success that the Senator hoped it would be.  I think that it is unfair to have in this House abuse and criticism of men who have contributed to the service of the country.</P>

That may be so but when that was tested, at no very distant date, the approval of the country, given in 1932, was endorsed. That was at the last election.  While we are the Government we are entitled to hold that we represent majority opinion in this country.

      <P>The Senator made it perfectly clear to those concerned that, had the British really adopted full army tactics and indulged in full military activities, guerilla warfare would not have succeeded.  I do not think that that is going to do any good to this country.  I do not think that the country will show any appreciation of the expression of such sentiments in this House.  However, that is a matter between Senator Blythe and those outside the country who will be quite conscious of what he says.  Is there any reason to suppose that we cannot expect decent citizenship and loyal service to the State from the recruits that will come into the volunteer force?  Surely we know the history of all the Army movements since the Free State was established. I think that it comes very badly from <Col N="689" /> any member of the former Executive to cast aspersions on the honesty or loyalty of any body of men who pledge themselves loyally to the service of the State.  After all, consider what would have been the position if we had adopted that attitude of mind when we came into office.  We assumed that those servants of the State, whether in the military, the police or the Civil Service would feel that they had a moral responsibility to the Government, irrespective of what Government was in power.  In the main, we have had no reason to regret that assumption. If we had approached the problems we were faced with when we came into office with the mentality that Senator Blythe has revealed, what would have been the result?  I think that it is very dangerous for any responsible person in this House to indicate that there is any reason to doubt the loyalty of any servant of the State who comes in and contracts for the performance of certain duties. There is no intention to make this volunteer force a political force.  We have had to exercise more patience and more toleration since we came into power than practically any Government in Europe had to exercise.  We have been faced with sabotage of the worst kind.  We have been threatened openly with a political army&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Blythe talks about the Seanad forcing the Government to do certain things.  That is the keystone of the whole position in this country at present&mdash;that a Seanad, created as we know it was created and in no way democratically representing the people, is to be used to force the Government to do certain things. That is a menace here at the moment. It is a menace on this type of thing and it is a menace on other things.  It is not for me to say just now that that menace is going to be met, but met it will be.  I suggest to Senators that they ought to consider very seriously <Col N="690" /> just what that position is liable to drift to.  We are going through a very difficult and delicate time, same as people in other countries are going through.  There is a considerable amount of unrest in the mentality of people generally.  There is, in one case, a move towards Communism and, in the other case, a move towards Fascism.  We want neither, and we are not seeking to do anything but what we have been democratically elected to do.  I suggest that that should be seriously considered.  I am not going to speak of the attitude of the Minister for Defence as regards the possibility of accepting such an amendment.  The Minister is here and can speak for himself. If I were in his position I would reject the amendment on the ground of precedent and on the ground of its not being seriously intended to do anything but cause obstruction.  If it is necessary to have a permanent Army Bill&mdash;according to some, it is&mdash;then let us have it, but let us remember that a permanent Army Bill is not going to be built up in three or four months. That is my view and it is for the Minister for Defence to indicate what his views are in that respect.</P>

      <P>It is rather curious that last night I was reading &ldquo;Gulliver's Travels&rdquo; and I came across a couple of passages that I might fittingly quote here.  The author was describing the inhabitants of Laputa and the passages I dropped upon are exactly exemplified by the last speaker.  I quote these passages because they have a bearing on the outlook and the attitude as expressed by the Minister. The description of the inhabitants of Laputa was that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Although they are dexterous enough upon a piece of paper in the management of the rule, the pencil and the divider, yet in the common actions and behaviour of life, I have not seen a more clumsy, awkward and unhandy people, nor so slow and perplexed in their conception upon all other subjects, except those of mathematics and music.  They are bad reasoners and vehemently given to opposition, unless when they happen to be of the right <Col N="691" /> opinion, which is seldom the case ...These people are under continual disquietudes, never enjoying a minute's peace of mind; and their disturbances proceed from causes which very little affect the rest of mortals....  In conversation they are apt to run into the same temper that boys discover, in delighting to hear terrible stories of sprites and hobgoblins, which they greedily listen to, and dare not go to bed for fear.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now let us consider the hobgoblin representations made to us of the disquietudes of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, amongst which we find the menace of some private army and the alleged menace of civil war for some time past.  There used to be a question asked until quite recently: &ldquo;Who started the civil war?&rdquo;  So far as I can see we are soon to be confronted with the question which is going to take the form of &ldquo;Who is going to start the next civil war?&rdquo;  If the facts presented to us are any indication of that, one thing seems certain and it is this: that the present Government are well aware that they are creating an atmosphere that might lead to civil war.  The Minister said that the critics of Ministers did not seem to realise that they are the Government. Speaking for myself, I say, unfortunately, I realise they are, and, I wish they would appreciate the fact themselves, that they are the Government and not merely the head men of a political party.  But the fact that they are the Government does not endow them with the attributes of infallibility which the Minister seemed to imagine was conferred upon them by their alleged mandate.  It does not render them immune to criticism.  The fact that there is this emphatic and deep criticism of certain actions of theirs, instead of being a cause of resentment in the minds of Ministers should make them pause and ask whether or not, after all, they may not be possibly wrong, and that there may be some cause for this criticism.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Lands and Fisheries did injustice to Senator <Col N="692" /> Blythe in the construction he tried to put upon his speech.  If there is one thing that Senator Blythe stressed, and which I would like to emphasise now, it is this: that if we are to have a volunteer force&mdash;and I certainly can see usefulness if a disciplined and trained body of young men were kept in the reserve, not exactly in the Army, which might in certain circumstances be required to be called up to fill up the wastage or the loss of man power in the Army&mdash;let it be a proper volunteer force.  Ministers who are responsible for the launching of this scheme should be scrupulous to see that no action of theirs, in connection with the formation of such a force, could be considered by critics as tending in any way but in that direction.  They should be scrupulous to see that no action of theirs would give the impression that they wish to create a partisan force.  Does the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, or any of their supporters, seriously suggest that the Government has been scrupulous in not doing anything that would suggest that this was going to be a partisan force?  I think it is a pity that the step was taken which has caused this criticism&mdash;that is, the appointment of the 20 officers. &ldquo;Raw recruits may chance to shoot Napoleon Bonaparté.&rdquo;  From the point of view of the Army, these men are raw recruits.  They are not the type of men, from the point of view of capacity or military achievement, of a kind of stamina and morale which is necessary.  What is the movement behind this?  Is the Minister trying his hand to see if he can get 20 raw recruits posted in the new army?  If he succeeds in that, and that that is taken as a precedent, then he might find some pretext for demobilising the officers of the regular Army who are there at present and filling up their positions with other raw recruits. There is the danger that you are not only going to give this new force a partisan bias but that you are going to strike a deadly blow at the morale of the regular Army.  Is this desirable? Is this what is wanted?  If it is not wanted, let us know what is the purpose in mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> The Minister made the plea of bringing together men who had been on different sides in the civil conflict. If that was what he wanted, why did he take these 20 raw recruits from the one side?  Surely he could have gone 50-50, and shown his desire to bring together such men, to heal the wounds of the past conflict, and to bring in a new spirit that would rise above the civil war spirit, and that would make for the complete elimination of bitterness.  But we have reason to believe that such objects as were stated by the Minister are the real objects in view.  Certainly the spirit shown by the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, and the acrimonious, bitter manner in which he tried to discuss this amendment, is not an assurance of a desire for any better spirit, but for a continuance of the acrimonious spirit carried into this force.  I want to challenge the Minister for Lands and Fisheries with regard to one statement he made.  He said they were threatened since they became a Government, with sabotage.  I want to know when, where and by whom. He made the definite statement that the present Government were threatened with sabotage.  From where did that threat come?  By whom was that threat made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Milroy has read &ldquo;Gulliver's Travels.&rdquo;  I would ask him to extend his reading further to Mommsen and to read the celebrated <Col N="694" /> passage under the heading of the catastrophe of the Celtic nation.  That was a catastrophe arising not from cirsumstances outside themselves but from the character of the people; their desire to attribute to each other the foulest motives, their delight in public meetings; their delight in interrupting meetings which caused a law to be passed&mdash;and a very proper law&mdash;more than 2,000 years ago to the effect that a hole be burned in the tail of the coat of any man interrupting a public speaker.  Now public speakers like Senator Milroy are as much responsible for disorder and disturbance as a man who takes an active part in it. I am sure Senator MacLoughlin will agree with me that a public speaker, if he wants to create a row or a disturbance at a public meeting, has nothing to do but to make some injurious attack in his observations in reference to a political opponent and especially if it be false.  Let us have no more of that sort of thing.  You will have no more of it if you read that passage that I mentioned.  I recommend Senators to read it and to read what led to the catastrophe of the Gaelic nation, that is before they got the benefits of intercourse with the Vikings who came amongst us 700 years ago.  Senator Blythe has proposed this motion.  I hope in his sober moments he does not expect that motion should be carried because I believe Senator Blythe does not wish to precipitate a dangerous situation.  I think he must have moved this motion for the purpose of calling attention to the fact that 20 guerilla leaders were given commissioned rank.  The Senator knows better than anybody in this House that if any alterations are to be made in the Army Act they ought to be made by substantive enactment, and not by an amendment of the Army Bill which must pass as a matter of course if the Army is not to be dissolved on the 1st April next&mdash;Fools' Day.  Because unless this Act is passed there is no right to enforce discipline for one moment, the soldiers could march out of barrack and officers would have no legal right to enforce discipline against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is at a very serious and <Col N="695" /> critical point that he introduces an amendment of that kind.  As he knows very well, any alterations that are necessary in the Army Act can be brought forward by substantive enactment. Senator Blythe very fairly states that for the defence of this small country a volunteer force is desirable. It is the only possible force which can effectually defend this country and the system of warfare&mdash;I commend this to Senator Milroy&mdash;the only system of warfare by which this nation can be defended is guerilla warfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for this reason, that it is in guerilla warfare the whole strength and moral force of a nation is put forth in resistance to an invader. He says that you are to pass this amendment because he does not believe and, as he says, a great many people do not believe, in the honesty of this Government.  Are you, by your vote, to let it go forth to this country that the Seanad does not believe in the honesty of the present Administration elected by the people?  Do not think for a moment that you have not a serious responsibility.  I differ in some respects from Senator Connolly when he says that we are not an elected body.  We are an elected body in a very essential sense; we are elected by the elect or, to use a simile which some of my friends will understand, the members of the Dáil are the &ldquo;feints&rdquo; and we are the pure spirits. We are the second distillation.  There should not be any disparagement of us for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time we ought not to disparage or disgrace ourselves by becoming partisans.  We ought not, by our vote, sanction a charge made here as the basis for this amendment, that this force, ostensibly recruited for the highest national purpose, for the defence of this country, is really recruited as a partisan force, to keep the present Government in power after the people have decided that they shall not be in power.  These men will be sworn.  They will be sworn to defend their country.  We never made an imputation against the police force who <Col N="696" /> were recruited by our political opponents.  They have been loyal to the State.  The Army which was recruited, and which was employed to fight against many men who are at present in the Government, is loyal to the present Government, because the present Government represents the majority of the people and is the Government, not a Party.</P>
    <P>Senator Blythe, also in the ardour of his eloquence, referred to these 20 men as ignorant men, having no training as military officers.  I do not know very many of them, but I know a good many of the guerilla leaders who have made a name for themselves and made an honourable place for their country in the annals of the world for the last 17 or 18 years.  They were guerilla leaders of the greatest ability.  Does Senator Blythe forget so soon some of the great battles that were fought in Munster?  I shall remind him of one battle, the battle of Crossbarry, where a column of 150 Irish soldiers lying beside a railway line were surprised at 2 or 3 o'clock on a Spring morning, encompassed on three sides, at a place 14 miles from Cork, 7 miles from Bandon, 11 miles from Kinsale.  They were attacked by an adequate force of Imperial soldiers led by an able and brave man.  The Irish were commanded by two men&mdash;I do not know whether they are amongst these 20 men &mdash;whose names will go down in the annals of this country as the greatest guerilla leaders perhaps that Ireland has produced.  One of them is Liam Deasy and the other, the second in command, Barry.  They, by the greatest art and consummate skill, worked out through the only bottleneck that was left and got to safety.  How did they do it? They saw that the British second in command, the captain&mdash;I do not know his name; Major Percival was the leader&mdash;a very brave man, had advanced.  He had the barrack-room training, but Deasy had the training of the guerilla leader.  The British captain was pushed back, and then again the Irish retreated, but they left a sharp shooter behind.  The English captain advanced when <Col N="697" />&ldquo;crack, crack,&rdquo; the British hero fell and the battle was over. What is more, that was the decisive battle against the British. The Government decided there and then that they were not dealing with the mere iron of young Irishmen but they were dealing with Irish iron led by hard and tempered steel.  That was one of the incidents which brought about the Truce.</P>
    <P>Will Senator Blythe say that Liam Deasy, Barry or Joe Barrett from Clare are not to get commissions as officers unless they have one year's training in an Irish military college, these superlative leaders?  Does he say that Liam Deasy is not fit to be in charge of a squad of men unless he gets two years' training from some other officer of no distinction or that he is not to go outside two miles of the Curragh Camp?  I am sure that if Senator Blythe considers these matters he will see how absurd are the arguments which he puts forward for the consideration of the Seanad.  Speaking on the matter generally, I agree with him that we should have a volunteer force.  It is the only possible force to defend the country. I should hope that that volunteer force would be recruited as a national force on a national basis and that there should be the most complete co-operation between all Parties.  Surely the time has come when the leading men who have made sacrifices for their country, should do something to prevent this eternal squabbling, this eternal misrepresentation, this eternal attribution of base and mean motives. It is unworthy of the men who have made such sacrifices for their country. Senator Blythe has made it perfectly plain that he asks you to pass this amendment as a vote of censure, as a statement on your part that you believe that the present Government is a Government of dishonest men, who are perfectly determined to use this force against their country.  It is not fair to ask you to do that, because as I have said in the beginning, I have the highest appreciation of this Seanad.  I regard it as an essentially elected body, twice elected, twice born let us say, and therefore I think you <Col N="698" /> ought not to injure or ruin your reputation by precipitating the quarrel which would naturally arise from attributing to the Government base and unworthy motives.  It would precipitate that conflict.  Senator Blythe has said that he hopes that arms will not be given to these men. I want the Seanad to understand that it is not the gun that makes an army.</P>

It is the brigading, it is the words of command, it is the orders, and the obedience to the orders, that make the army.  When you have it regimented, when you have it in squads, then you have nothing to do but to put a rifle into the soldier's hands.  You remember the wooden guns and what they led to.  If this bad feeling between us is to continue, I think it is desirable that it should be kept on harmless ground, as far as we can.  I think nobody intends to have any further conflicts in this country, nobody certainly who has been through the past two conflicts.  I am perfectly sure that Senator Blythe and those who were in high positions associated with him do not desire it. I think, therefore, that an amendment of this kind, which will be eminently calculated to intensify bad feeling and to precipitate conflict, should not be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>I am not going to talk about the merits of the amendment in so far as it turns on the organisation of the Army or the volunteer force, but I do want to support Senator Comyn in his references to the statements made by Senator Blythe and Senator Miss Browne regarding the untrustworthiness of the Government. If one wants to understand the meaning and the causes of the present discontents in this country, I think one need only read in the morning paper&mdash; if one has not heard the speeches here to-day&mdash;the last few sentences of Senator Blythe's speech, endorsed, of course&mdash;yes, of course&mdash;by Senator Miss Browne.  One does not take <Col N="699" /> much notice of the words that are repeated time and again by Senator Miss Browne, but Senator Blythe is in a different position.  I think I am right in affirming that he endorsed what he believes to be a very widespread opinion in this country: that this Government cannot be believed, that its promises are not taken as honest promises and that its assertions cannot be heeded at all.  Now if that is to be the spirit of discussion in this House, if that is the spirit in which Government activities in the country are to be understood and argued about, then it is absolutely impossible to carry on parliamentary discussion and quite impossible to think of government by democratic rule.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Ministers will deign to take part in this debate at all unless some members of the House, who usually do not support the Government, are prepared to dissociate themselves from the attitude adopted by Senator Blythe.  It is entirely futile for a Minister to take part in a discussion if it is understood beforehand that nobody believes a word of that Minister.  I simply draw attention to the impossibility of carrying on parliamentary work if leading men in the Opposition, especially one who has held the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council, can utter the language that Senator Blythe uttered to-day.</P>

      <P>I always felt it was a bad thing and did my utmost to control it.  It is one of the few vices that I have been able to master.  Senator Comyn talked about the Army and said that it would have to be dissolved on All Fools' Day if Senator Blythe's amendment were accepted.  Nothing of the kind need happen under the amendment, because the Government will have until the end of July, that is four months more, to consider the position.  Senator Comyn did not make any reference to the men who fought in 1916 and who made this State possible.  Some of them have died in the Dublin Union.  Others of them were promised by the present Government that they would be looked after, but when they meet on All Fools' Day they will be able to tell the people of this country that they have not been looked after.  The Labour Party has given its support to this Government because it was going to bring in, amongst other things, a Widows' and Orphans' Pension Bill, but on All Fools' Day, 1934, the Labour Party will know that this Bill has not been introduced; that what has been introduced is this Army Bill which gives the Minister power to mobilise a Party force, and the Government want it to be rushed through before All Fools' Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection at all to a territorial force, but it must be for all the people.  It must be open to all sections of the people; there must be no canvassing for this section or for the other section to get control of it. Senator Connolly mentioned something about this being the army of the Government.  At the formation of the Civic Guard force I said in one of the first speeches I made that the Civic Guards were to be the servants <Col N="701" /> of the people.  I did not say that they were to be the servants of the Cosgrave Government or of any other Government that might come after it, but I said they were to be the servants of the people.  I also said to them: &ldquo;Your predecessors, the R.I.C., were trained to believe that they were the masters of the people.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;You are not to be the masters of the people; you are to be the servants of the people and you are not to be the servants of any Government.&rdquo;  I object to Senator Connolly's statement.  He spoke as if the Army were the servants of the Government.  I also strongly object to a speech the Minister for Justice made at a recent function in the Depôt at the Phænix Park.  In the course of that speech he said that the Guards were the servants of the Government, but in justice to the Minister it is only fair to say that later, in the course of the same speech, he pointed out to the Guards that they were the servants of the people.</P>
    <P>Now instead of abusing each other can we not get down to this: that a Government is there to govern all the people for the benefit of the people, but do not be doing it in a Party spirit?  Senator Comyn, I think it was, who spoke about a guerilla force. He mentioned certain names.  I have as much respect for those he mentioned as the Senator has, but what good is a guerilla force if any outside country attempts to invade this country?  Why should the question of an invader arise at all?  We are a maritime country and are we going to send our fishing boat out to prevent an invader from landing in this country?  It is ridiculous to talk about guerilla warfare, and anyway, it was not the guerilla fighters who won the fight here against the English, but the people of this country who stood behind the guerilla fighters and gave the enemy no information.  They helped the fighters in every way they could.  Can we not be united, forget our partyisms, Party armies and Party guards?  I do not know how the country will stand it at all if this thing is to continue.  The Government have been entirely responsible for this. <Col N="702" /> None of the speakers on the Government side this evening mentioned a word about the treatment General O'Duffy got.  I do not want to mention his case particularly, but everybody knows about it.  They did not mention anything about the O'Connell-Hogan Official Secrets case, nor did they mention a word about Commandant Cronin, who is a prisoner to-day in Arbour Hill.  While we are sitting here he is a prisoner in Arbour Hill, and for what?  Because he would not sign a guarantee or give bail that he would keep the peace, a thing he has always done.  He is a law-abiding, peaceful citizen and simply because he refused to put that in writing he has to do his three months in Arbour Hill. How long is this kind of thing to go on?</P>

      <P>Like my old friend, Senator Staines, I had not intended speaking in this debate, but unlike Senator Staines I have a very bad temper and I very often show it.  In addressing the House on this question I labour under two shortcomings: one is that I am not capable of giving any quotations.  The desire to do so seems to be rampant here to-day.  The second shortcoming that I labour under is that I was not here for the whole of Senator Blythe's speech, but what I did hear of it enabled me to make up my mind definitely as to the action I would take on this Bill. Senator Blythe, followed by Senator Miss Browne, took up the attitude that the word of the Government could not be trusted.  I am in complete agreement with Senator Johnson as to the way in which he dealt with those remarks.  If the word of the Government cannot be trusted then there is no use in the Seanad meeting here or in considering Bills sent up to it by the Government, because if we do so we will simply be acting the part of hypocrites.  I do not know whether there is anything in the point made by Senator Comyn that if this Bill is not passed before the 1st April the Army may have to be disbanded and may no longer be a disciplined force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion the amendment moved by Senator Blythe defeats the object he wants to attain.  If it is carried it <Col N="703" /> will make the volunteer force a partisan organisation, because men will be prevented from joining it, as, undoubtedly, men were prevented joining the Army some years ago, owing to legislation that was on the Statute Book here.  When that was removed it enabled many young men to come in who otherwise would not do so.  I desire to register a strong protest against the statements made by one who was a Minister in the late Executive, and also against the statement of Senator Miss Browne, that the word of the Government could not be trusted in this matter.</P>

      <P>I suppose I should say something on this Bill as I had more experience of army life and of irregulars and volunteers than most of those present.  Senator Blythe stated that the volunteer force would be of no use unless it was trained in camps and drilled in squads by drill sergeants.  Is that really a correct statement or is it merely what occurs to a person who has not considered the matter?</P>

      <P>That was my understanding of what the Senator said and I was listening carefully.  There is no doubt that some people who have not considered the matter would say that this is contrary to experience and to historical usage.  These things have happened at all times.  Irregulars or people with no military training have often won victories over large numbers of drilled soldiers.  I will give an instance, that of South Africa. Some 100,000 British soldiers with all the implements of war were sent out there to fight against farmers, most of whom had not been drilled, but who were organised and had previous experience of what was required of them.  The war in South Africa lasted for several years and it cost the British Government millions of money. Even the end was very unsuccessful. No one can say that the people who <Col N="704" /> fought against the British in that war did not fight well and that on many occasions they did not defeat the British.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Then take the American War of Independence.  The British sent out large numbers of trained soldiers and generals to fight that war.  It lasted for three or four years, the British being opposed by farmers who were ill-trained, but the result was that the irregular volunteers who formed the American Army drove the British out of the United States. There have been many occasions when whole armies surrendered.  When the French invaded Spain they were driven out mainly by irregulars.  As some of those who led the people in South Africa were referred to, would Senator Blythe suggest that General Botha, General de Wet, or General Hertzog should be sent back after the war to be trained by some other army, seeing that they were able to teach the British a good many lessons in warfare? It would be a different thing to send them back to be trained and then not to allow them into the South African Army unless they were trained in barracks.  The fact is, that there are two, if not many, methods of warfare. Special circumstances have been satisfactory at different times, one having won as many victories as the other.  The question for this country is: shall we have such a force here? We had a trial that was not successful. There was a great deal of bloodshed on both sides.  I commanded the volunteers for a long time when they numbered about 150,000 men.  Why has Ireland been divided for 700 years? Has anybody looked back to see why? Because the old Celtic system was totally opposed to training bodies of regular soldiers, to live as soldiers and nothing else.  Trained bodies of men came into the country and built castles.  The struggle with irregulars went on for several years, there being occasional fighting.  That shows that a nation that is not prepared to defend itself will be conquered.  That is the reason Ireland was conquered by England, <Col N="705" /> Ireland having no military standpoint. How has the British Empire been formed?  I am not going to say anything against it, but the facts are that whenever any nation was not fit to defend itself an armed nation, like Great Britain or France, stepped in and annexed the country.  The Chinese did not know what war was.  They hated warfare, being a peaceful nation, and although there were three or four hundred millions of them, certain countries like England, America and others stepped in and took control for the time being.  The same thing happened in India.  The Indians were not prepared and were conquered.  Ireland will be conquered and will be annexed if she is not prepared to defend herself.  England has territorials.  Why should we not have territorials here?  Because people on the opposite benches do not happen to be in office, or for some other reason, they cannot get out of their heads the old ideas of quarrelling.  That is wrong. I do not believe in perpetual quarrels and I ask the Opposition to join with us and to get all the people into the new army.  If the spirit is good the thing can be done.  There is a conception that the few people to organise this force are to be taken from one side.  I am not saying that that is so. Suppose it is.  Did not the other side create an army and put their own people into jobs for ten years?  I do not say that they could have done otherwise.  Perhaps there was no option.  Surely the other side might now be allowed to help, even in a small way.  They have not attempted to drive out those who did not take their side.  A little sympathy, good will and toleration will probably do more for the country than fighting.  I hope the Bill will go through and that, when carried, it will be worked properly.  It is not an easy thing to do.</P>

      <P>As a brother officer of the last speaker, who also served in the British Army, I do not care to allow his statements to go unchallenged. I am not going to quarrel with him to the full length of the discussion, but the Senator asked how it was that the <Col N="706" /> British Government was so successful and how the British Empire had been built up.  I venture to suggest that, except in this country, the British Empire has been built up because it understood the art of government, which was to ensure the co-operation of the people based on justice and fair-play.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Senator, but anyone who reads the history of the occupation of India, or who reads Macaulay or Burke's description of what happened there at the time Warren Hastings went to that country, would form a totally different opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite able to deal with that, considering that only lately I was very much moved by the play &ldquo;Clive in India,&rdquo; which almost brought tears to my eyes when I thought of the greatness of the British Empire and of the injustice meted out to Clive by the financiers in India and by politicians who knew nothing of the facts.  I am not going to say any more about that, except that I can meet the Senator on that point.  With regard to his expression regarding military training, all I could gather was that it was better if we had no regular army and that, as in South Africa, the whole nation should rise in arms spontaneously if attacked.  In South Africa they were individualists.  The people knew the country and were trained marksmen, which was a great advantage. The Senator suggests that we might disband the regular army and depend on guerilla warfare.  That has nothing to do with this matter.  I am sure Senators feel that they have some right to consider this matter carefully before asking the House to take a vote which could be read as one which obstructs the Government.  I considered this matter and I cannot see that such a vote would amount to obstruction.  There is a very serious apprehension with regard to the policy of this Government in the formation of this reserve force.  The Minister for Defence justified his policy by reference to the territorial organisation of the British Army.  There is no parallel at <Col N="707" /> all.  If I am right, such liason as there might be between the military and the territorial elements in the British Army is settled by the lord lieutenants of the counties, who are outside politics and I think, partly, by county councils.  There is no parallel whatever for taking people who within the last ten years were in revolt against majority rule and bringing them in to act as administrative officers in regard to the new force, creating a situation&mdash;the Minister can tell me that I am wrong&mdash;whereby unless these newly commissioned officers approve of the recruits offering, these recruits will not be accepted.  I take it that that is virtually the position.  Every new recruit will have to be regarded as suitable by these new officers, who have not had regular military training.  It is not a question of distrusting the Government but of examining the proposals of the Government.  There seems to be a lot of feeling at the suggestion that the Government should not be trusted but it is our business to scrutinise and examine Government measures. Does Senator O'Neill suggest that the Government should be given a blank cheque, that they should be given all the powers they seek?  Our duty is to question these things and, under the normal procedure, we have not got time to do so in the present case.  I think that it is only right that we should have an opportunity to consider this whole matter because, rightly or wrongly, there are grounds for apprehension.  This proposal would enable the procedure to operate so as to allow the House time to introduce amendments after due and careful consideration. The Government will get their Army Act for three months.  They will merely have to come back in three months and have this matter further considered.  If that is so, I do not see how the House is treating the Government in a distrustful way or how it can be accused of obstructing the Government.</P>

      <P>I am as anxious as Senator Blythe is to bring forward the Army Bill which is at present in course of preparation, <Col N="708" /> but I am not prepared to agree to his amendment for two reasons.  The first reason is that I am not prepared to admit that the Seanad or the Dáil should restrict this Government any more than they restricted the previous Government in their operations in regard to the Army.  The second reason is that it would be impossible for the Department of Defence to get the Bill which is in draft through the Parliamentary draftsman's office before the three months, or even before the coming autumn.  I have been pressing the Attorney-General and the draftsman's office to deal with the Bill.  They assured me that they could not deal with it before the coming autumn.  A great part of Senator Blythe's speech amuses me, because it reveals a sour-grapes attitude.  Senator Blythe, in the amendments which he proposed here and in his speech, endeavours to prevent the Government from being successful in a policy which he tried and in which he failed&mdash;and failed after spending many thousands of pounds of the taxpayers' money.  He is at the moment having his own little private army.  He can have a captain or a commandant or a general appointed inside 24 hours, and changed after 24 hours.  But he does not want us to get the Army strengthened to the extent that neither he nor any other enemy of the Irish people can try any of their little tricks on this country. Senator Blythe left the Seanad under the impression that the area administrative officers we have appointed received no training.  That is not true. They have had more training in the military college than, at least, one-third of the present Army officers.  I am not saying that it is necessary that a large number of the officers should go through two years or even one year in the military college.  As a matter of fact, that would be waste of time for some of them, but the truth is that 19 of these area administrative officers spent over two months in the military college in the Curragh.  They are men who had training in guerilla warfare, and the military staff down there informed me that a large proportion of them were the most promising pupils they had for a long time.  However, I <Col N="709" /> am not to be taken as being against officers or all cadets doing a couple of years in the military college.  I think it would be a good thing, and it was my intention, that these men, as soon as they could be spared from their work, should spend a further period in the military college.  The position in regard to the officers at present serving is that 61 have never been through the military college.  Only 23, out of a total of 545, have done one year in the military college.  About 400 of them did six months or nine months in the military college from time to time, and it is my hope that we shall get them all through a longer period.  We cannot agree to Senator Blythe's amendment.  As I say, it would not be possible for the Parliamentary draftsman to deal with the Bill, which is at present ready, before that time.  I think that this Government is as well able to run the Army as the previous Government was.  Senator Blythe was the very man in the last Government who started the Volunteer Reserve. He has an amendment down which seeks to prevent us from commissioning an officer in the Volunteer Reserve before he has served a period of five years.  Before the Senator had a single man recruited into the Volunteer Reserve, he had commissioned the officers.</P>

      <P>The fact is that that Volunteer Reserve was started and thousands of pounds spent in order to get a couple of hundred men.  The officers were there in charge of them from the first day they went in.  Senator Blythe talked about the grave <Col N="710" /> alarm caused by this volunteer force. I am sure he was gravely alarmed, but men of good will, who want to see democratic rule, were delighted that the young men should get an opportunity of coming forward and offering their services to the Government instead of being pulled into the private armies which are at present cutting each other's throats.  I always stood, and the Fianna Fáil Party always stood, for democratic rights.  We stood for them when the people who stood against them were Senator Blythe and his friends.  They quashed the Dáil in 1922 and they quashed the Dáil courts, and if I have my way they will never get an opportunity of doing it again. We are going to see that the ordinary people will get an opportunity of ruling themselves in spite of any small, internal clique and in spite of any external majority.  The men whom I have asked to come into the volunteer force are coming in on the clear understanding that they are to serve whatever Government is elected by the people.  We are not like Senator Blythe and some of the other people who say they want one thing and do the other.  They effected a coup d'état here while mouthing about the will of the people.  Senator Blythe is mouthing about the will of the people while I know very well that he is trying to go ahead with his I.R.B. tactics again and start another secret army.</P>

      <P>Senator Milroy said that the organising of the Volunteers was a deadly blow at the morale of the regular Army.  I think that Senator Milroy was once a mutineer&mdash;Mutineer Milroy.  I am not prepared to go into his history.  In spite of the attempts by Senator Blythe and Senator Milroy to disrupt the Army and sap its morale &mdash;Senator Blythe said that the idea was not to supplement the regular Army by the Volunteers but to replace it by the Volunteers&mdash;in spite of all that, the people and the Army know that the Government is doing exactly the correct thing, both from the military and national point of view, in supplementing the regular Army by these Volunteers.  Senator Blythe tried to do that himself but failed because he could not get the young people to join. We are succeeding.  We are going to succeed, in spite of the two private armies which are trying to defeat the Government, in getting an army that will be really loyal to the Government elected by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Blythe alluded to the distribution of arms to the volunteers.  I hope the time will come here, and that before long, when we can with safety distribute arms to the volunteers in the same way as the Swiss Government distributes arms amongst its soldiers. I do not think it has arrived yet but I hope it will come before long, when people like Senator Blythe will see that they cannot try their tricks with success. The volunteers are not a party political force, as he says.  In spite of him and the United Ireland Party, we have got into a number of sluagh committees members of the United Ireland Party.  I appealed to the United Ireland Party when we were introducing the Estimate in the Dáil to co-operate in making the volunteers a success.  They voted against the Estimate for the volunteers, thereby setting a headline for their supporters <Col N="712" /> throughout the country to boycott the volunteers, when they were approached to help in organisation.  But in spite of that, members of the United Ireland Party have come forward in every district and are giving help in getting recruits of the proper type into the volunteer force.  I am delighted to say that that is a fact.  I want to say that I did my utmost to prevent the civil war and I was not in a position to carry my wishes into effect but I am a member of the present Administration, of a Government that has the same ideas as I had before the civil war, who hated the internal strife in the same way as I did, and I am glad to see that they see eye to eye with us on this volunteer question and we mean to make it a success because it is not alone the best guarantee against another civil war but the best possible guarantee against invasion by an outside Power.  I am delighted also that the young men of the country are offering their services in a way which is a great satisfaction to the Government and the Army officers who are in charge of the recruitment of the volunteers. It is not true to say that the volunteers are under the control of 20 newly-appointed officers.  I pointed out here on the last occasion that the volunteers come directly under the control of the Headquarters Staff and that associated with 20 new officers who are at present engaged in organising sluagh committees and recruitment for the volunteers, are at least 50 officers of the regular Army.  Senator Milroy asks why did we not bring in ten men from one side and ten men from the other.  We brought into the National Army 20 men who had fought against the other 500. We have brought the 20 men in to be associated with the 500.  We have associated with the work of organisation about 50 of the other side.  I think it is much better that men who saw the disasters caused by civil war should be working together in trying to get the young people into a disciplined Army and that in charge of that work should be men who know the dangers and what civil war can do.  I hope the Seanad will not agree to Senator Blythe's amendment.  There is no reason in the world for passing it.  This <Col N="713" /> Government is as capable of managing an army as the last Government was and it has proved itself to have been more capable of organising a volunteer force than ever its predecessors were.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that when the Minister is referring to myself or anybody with whom I associated, <Col N="714" /> as contemplating tricks, he is making an attack without any foundation whatsoever, and a charge which I find it difficult to believe that he is sincere in. I am afraid he is allowing political spite to bias and blind him in regard to a purely political movement which is very threatening to his Party and no doubt causes him to have occasional nightmares.  With regard to the initiation of the volunteer service units, I had something to do with it, and I would like to say there were no officers appointed in the manner which the Minister indicates.  First, it was realised that only a beginning could be made owing to the political differences, and only a few units were attempted. So far as they were concerned, the arrangements for officering them were: a certain number of young men were selected as graduates, and instead of going for drill and instruction only one night of the week they went three or four nights.  They were not selected on a political basis.  They included men who had been opposed to the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, and men who during the Treaty and civil war had been on the side of the Minister. I remember being Acting-Minister for Defence, and at the time there was some consultation with the officers on the selection board about the matter. I said that we should stretch every point possible in order to get those who were in opposition to the Government of the day, because I was anxious, so far as we might be able, that the force should be entirely on a nonpolitical basis.  If the Minister will simply do now what was attempted to be done, then he could make a great success of this volunteer force.  Instead of getting one or two representatives of the U.I.P. he could get as many as he desired, and instead of getting some recruits who might be our supporters he would get as many of them as supporters of his own Party, if he would set out to show by action and not by words that the force would be a nonpolitical force that would serve every elected Government and have no interest but the interests of the country at heart.</P>

      <P>Dáil Eireann has agreed to amendments Nos. 1 to 4 inclusive, and 7 to 24 inclusive, made by Seanad Eireann to the Workmen's Compensation Bill, 1933, and to amendment No. 5 as amended by the insertion in the proposed new sub-section (5) of Section 8, and at the end thereof, of the words &ldquo;unless such owners reside or have a place of business in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo;; it has disagreed to amendment No. 6, to which the agreement of Seanad Eireann is desired.</P>

The amendment of the Seanad gave the worker the right to proceed against the agent only.

      <P>The Seanad will recollect that an amendment was inserted, the purpose of which was to provide <Col N="717" /> that where a workman, employed by an employer in Saorstát Eireann, in connection with the employer's business in the Saorstát, was injured in an accident occurring outside the Saorstát, he would be entitled to proceed against the employer in the Saorstát courts for compensation.  It was considered at the time that the Bill as framed did not give the worker that right.  The relevant section of the Bill&mdash;Section 15 &mdash;is identical with the same section of the 1906 Act, and a similar section in the British Act.  A number of decisions in the British courts had placed upon that section the interpretation which it was assumed was operative here also. Since this Bill was before the Seanad, and before the Bill came before the Dáil, a decision was given in the Supreme Court of the Saorstát which places an interpretation on the Act different from that of the British courts.  The effect of that was to place upon the section an interpretation which secured for workers injured under the circumstances provided in the amendment the right to proceed for compensation against their employer in the Saorstát court.  The case was one which had been argued in the various courts, and the effect of the decision of the Supreme Court was to confer upon the worker the right to get compensation against his employer. In these circumstances it is clear that the amendment inserted here is not necessary.  It might have been thought desirable nevertheless to leave the amendment stand in order to reinforce the decision of the Supreme Court by the insertion of this section in the Bill. On consideration, however, it was considered better to rely upon the decision of the Supreme Court, which covers all cases that are likely to arise under the section, although it leaves undecided certain possible cases that might arise, and might at some future date be the subject of further discussion. There are, of course, in this section inserted in the Seanad provisions designed to prevent the worker getting double compensation in any circumstances.  It might have been decided to have at least allowed that portion of the amendment to stand, so that the safeguard against double compensation <Col N="718" /> being paid would be maintained. But having examined the matter with great care, and discussed every contingency that might arise, it was felt that circumstances in which double compensation would be awardable, having regard to the Supreme Court's decision, were so limited and unlikely that there was no necessity to make such provision, particularly having regard to the fact that the provision would have to be a very complicated one.  The decision which was taken in the matter was approved of in the Dáil by all authorities, and I think it was the wiser course to take. The Seanad can be assured that the position that it wished to provide has been provided by the Supreme Court, and that the amendment is not now required.</P>

      <P>I am not at all able to understand the position of the Dáil in this matter.  The argument of the Government in this matter seems to say that it is better that possible doubts should be resolved by the courts rather than by the Oireachtas.  That is to say, if there are any doubtful points likely to arise, though they were covered by the section, it is better that the procedure of the case through the courts should be gone through so that the judges may be capable of making the law in the matter.  That is a point of view I am not at all able to appreciate. Senator Comyn may, but, it seems to me, if you can do the job here it is better to do it, rather than wait for the decision of the courts which may be required to determine what the Oireachtas intended should be the law.  I am sure the Minister has reasons that I cannot see, but I think it is very much to be desired that the law should be made as far as possible by the Oireachtas and should be interpreted by the judges rather than that we should take the line that the Minister seems <Col N="719" /> to take, that when doubtful cases arise the law can be determined by the judges.  That may be very good if it could be done for nothing, but the people who are going to be involved in litigation in the courts will have to pay something.  Law cases of this kind usually cost something.  It seems a pity that the Oireachtas should not take the opportunity of determining what the law should be in these cases.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Senator Johnson has got the right end of the stick.  It seems to me that this particular case has already arisen and that a decision has been reached.  That is the decision of the Supreme Court, and that, I understand, was the deciding factor in the debate in the Dáil. If we insist on putting in this amendment, that amendment would probably lead to further litigation.  As the matter now stands, the question has been determined by the Supreme Court decision, and I think it would be better to avoid any complication which might arise by insisting on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson is the watchdog of the interests of the working man, and a very good watchdog he is, but I think in the present case it would not be desirable to insist on the insertion of the section put forward in this House.  I think we ought to agree with the Dáil for this reason.  The section was inserted originally to cover a case that was likely to arise rather frequently.  It was inserted because there was a decision of an English court which it was thought might lead to a decision of the Irish courts.  The case has come up before the Irish courts, and they have arrived at a decision which renders this section unnecessary so far as its main object is concerned.  The Minister explained, and, if I might say so, very rightly, that it is unlikely that any other question will arise in respect of any matters covered by our section.  I think it would be wrong, therefore, to legislate beforehand in respect of a case that might never arise.  There is a lot to be said for what Senator Douglas has <Col N="720" /> stated, and I wish to support him in what he has said.  The very section drafted and inserted in the Seanad might give rise to litigation, so that in order to avoid that litigation the best thing to do is not to insist on our amendment but to agree with the Dáil. The chances are a million to one that you will have no case brought before the courts, but if you insert this section, it is perfectly certain that you will have several cases.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what Senator Douglas has stated is correct.  The decision of the court covers everything that is intended to be met by this section.  Senators will remember that when the section was introduced here they disputed amongst themselves as to what the exact meaning of certain words might be.  It is, I think, likely that if the section were allowed to stand that dispute would be carried to the courts sooner or later.  We have the decision of the court which states the law exactly as we want to have it stated.  When I said that a certain type of case might not be covered, it was because the Chief Justice in his judgment stated that his decision in this case was not to be taken as covering a case where the worker was employed in the Saorstát under a contract of service, but where the service had to be performed entirely outside the Saorstát.  It is quite clear that that case is not covered by the amendment either.  It is something which must be decided at a later stage.</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (4).  To add at the end of the sub-section a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d)  a person born in Ireland in the area not now comprised in Saorstát Eireann who at the relevant time is and for not less than one month immediately preceding that time has been ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>At this late hour I shall not debate this subject at any great length.  The House knows that this amendment does not go as far as I should like to see it in regard to the definition of nationality, but the reason I have put it in this form is that I have tried to meet some of the arguments raised against me on previous occasions.  I tried to make it cover the case of persons who had either the misfortune or the good fortune to be born in the Six Counties, but who, nevertheless, reside and carry on business here.  It seems absurd that a person who was born anywhere in the Twenty-Six Counties, but who has resided since he was the age of one or two months outside Ireland can come in here and claim his full rights under the Bill, while people born in the Six Counties and who are actually residing here are penalised. A person who happened to be born in the Six Counties, but who is ordinarily resident here and has a <i>bona fide</i> business here should be treated as a national.  If such persons are resident here, then I think for the purpose of this Bill they should be treated as nationals.  I am proposing a definite residential qualification.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Senator would wait to argue the matter on the Nationality Bill, which is likely to appear before the Oireachtas at an early date.  The definition of &ldquo;national,&rdquo; which is embodied in this <Col N="722" /> Bill, was taken from the Unemployment Assistance Act, which was considered satisfactory.  I would be loth to alter it, particularly to the extent of giving rights under the Bill to a person who had been residing here for one month only.  The full implications of that would have to be considered before the change could be made.  In so far as the whole law in relation to nationality is likely to be under review shortly, I think the change should be left over for discussion until that occasion arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been waiting for that Bill for a considerable time.  I admit that the amendment would involve some change in the definition of nationality but I can produce at least four different definitions in other Bills. Therefore, it would not be very much harm to alter it again.  If the Minister, however, will promise me that he will do his best to consider the <i>bona fide</i> case of the person born in the Six Counties, to make it easy for him to carry on business here instead of making it exceptionally difficult, I shall withdraw the amendment.  I do not think the Government has yet realised that that is a case which requires careful consideration.</P>

I do not think it would be a solution.  However, I shall withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 3.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) A quota order shall not be made for the importation of any goods into Saorstát Eireann from any <Col N="723" /> country for a greater amount than 75 per cent. of the value of the goods produced or manufactured and exported from Saorstát Eireann to such country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill in this House the Minister stated that it had no connection whatever with the economic war or with the financial dispute with England.  That being so, I think that the Minister ought to accept the amendment as it will strengthen his hands in bargaining with other countries with which we may have to trade.  In looking over the trade returns for the year 1933, I find that we are still exporting 95 per cent. of our exports to Great Britain while we import from other countries nearly half the value of our imports.  I do not think that it is quite right that we should be taking from different countries thousands and, in some cases, millions of pounds worth of stuff for which we practically get no return.  I shall quote for the House a few instances of the trade which we do with these countries.  In 1933 our total exports were £19,069,000 and our total imports were £35,789,000.  Of that amount we imported £25,000,000 from Great Britain and £10,756,000 from other countries.  Our exports to Great Britain were about £18,000,000 and our exports to other countries about £1,429,000.  That is, about 95 per cent. of our total exports went to Great Britain.  That is an extraordinary fact after all we have heard from the Government and the supporters of the Government about the new markets which they were going to find for our exports.  We are still looking for the markets and the markets are no better than they were in 1931.</P>
    <P>Let me take the case of other countries from which we import goods and to which we send goods.  In 1933 we imported from Australia goods to the value of £1,541,000.  They only bought in return from us goods to the value of £11,000.  From the Argentine, in the same year, we bought goods to the value of £858,822, and they bought from us goods to the value of £14,000. From Germany we bought £1,752,269 worth of goods, and in return their <Col N="724" /> purchases from us were only value for £170,000.  From the United States our purchases were value for £1,051,000. Their purchases from us amounted to £153,000.  From Russia we purchased goods to the value of £235,000, but they did not buy as much as one shilling's worth from us.  I think the Minister should take power to see that countries from which we make very large purchases should buy something in return from us.  The object of my amendment is to strengthen the Minister's hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Counihan suggests in his amendment that the Minister will be able to get countries from which we make purchases to buy four articles from us for every three that we sell to them.  It seems to me that the Senator has greater faith in the ability of the Government than I thought he had if he thinks that they can manage that.  I think the Government would be doing extremely well, particularly in view of the figures that have been given, if they succeeded in getting countries from which we make purchases to take goods to an equal amount from us.  The amendment is, I think, unworkable.  The object of these quota Bills is that they may be used for bargaining purposes, and if under this measure the Government were able to do as well as I have just indicated then I think they would be doing extremely well.</P>

      <P>I am glad to get that admission from Senator Counihan because on another occasion he said that it would be impossible to grow wheat here.  I intend to vote for the Senator's amendment because the effect of it, if passed, will be to compel us to grow all the wheat we require.  The amendment means that we cannot deal <Col N="725" /> with the wheat-producing countries because they are not in need of anything from us.</P>

The most that we can expect from any country is: if they buy £100 worth of our goods we will take £100 worth from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

Trade could not be carried on under such conditions. What the Senator means, of course, is the reverse.  Therefore I suggest to him that he should withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the Senator might have any intention of introducing his amendment again on the Report Stage I want to point out to him that what he is proposing is entirely outside the scope of this Bill.  A quota order can only be issued in respect to a specified article or articles.  We cannot quota a whole trade.  We can make a quota order in respect to a particular article.  The effect of the order will be to limit the quantities of that article that will come into this country.  The quota order need not specify the country from which goods must be imported.  In ordinary circumstances a quota order will be designed to limit imports only, and within the quota it will be free to any person to import from any country he chooses. <Col N="726" /> It is only where a special quota is made inside the main quota that there is an obligation to import from a particular country.</P>
      <P>It is clear, therefore, that the amendment contemplates something that is entirely outside the scope of the Bill.  The acceptance of it would necessitate not merely a restriction of imports of particular goods but a restriction on the total value of goods of all kinds that might be sent from a particular country into the Saorstát. That is a power that we have not asked for.  It may be necessary to ask for it at some particular date.  I am glad to know that, should we think it well to come to the Seanad for such power, we already have the assurance of Senator Counihan's support for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is desirable, even from the point of view of the Government, that when a resolution comes before the Dáil it should be possible to amend it. I know there are certain types of resolutions which have to be passed.  Some of them, by the nature of the case, and others because of specific provisions. cannot be amended.  This is a case <Col N="727" /> where it seems to me that, at the end of the period, the Government might either want or might be persuaded in debate to agree that a certain amount of amendment was desirable in an order.  Of course, if the order is not going to be continued beyond the period of six months there will be no need to amend it, but if it is proposed to continue it for a considerable time, then I think it is highly desirable that the Dáil should have an opportunity to discuss it and put down amendments for consideration.</P>

      <P>There could not be an amendment of the Order having regard to the fact that it will have been in operation for some time before the Dáil comes to consider it.  Most Senators are aware, I think, that the preparation of descriptions of goods, either for the purpose of finance resolutions or other enactments, is a most delicate matter, and has to be very carefully considered, and quite frequently the draftsman and the advisers of the Government have themselves made mistakes in that connection. It would be undesirable that the description of goods should be liable to amendment in that manner after an Order has been made and after it has been in operation for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, power in the Bill enabling the Executive Council to make an amending Order if such should be necessary, but I think it would be undesirable and contrary, in a sense, to the scheme of the Bill, to have the power of amendment here proposed given.  The scheme of the Bill is to provide power to the Executive Council to make these prohibition orders and <Col N="728" /> to introduce, in relation to particular classes of goods, this quota system. The purpose of the section which the Senator wishes to amend is to ensure that within a reasonable time after the making of such Order and the bringing of such system into operation the Executive Council must go to the Dáil and get approval for what it has done. The Dáil is not given power to determine the duration of the quota period or the goods to be admitted in any such period.  It is only asked to approve or not approve of the decision to apply the quota system to a particular description of goods.  I think it should be confined to expressing an opinion one way or the other, having regard to the consequences of an opinion that would be adverse to the action of the Executive Council.  The detailed operation of the system, therefore, is left to the Executive Council. I think it is preferable that that should be so rather than give the Dáil power to amend, when it is probable that in large measure such a power would be of no practical importance so long as the Executive Council must command a majority in the Dáil.  In addition, it would be introducing a principle contrary to the main purpose of the Bill, which is to enable these powers to be exercised by the Executive Council within a scheme to be brought into operation by Executive action, subject to formal approval by the Dáil at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a little more in my mind than the point that has been made by the Minister.  I think the general principle of giving power to the Executive to make orders should only be given where there is no other satisfactory way of doing it; and where it is done it should be at the best only as a short cut to legislation.  I think that as a general principle in legislation of this kind, and the giving of powers to the Executive, when these powers are to be submitted to the Oireachtas that, as near as possible, they should be in a similar position to a Bill.  I am perfectly well aware that most Bills introduced into the Dáil are not amended: that at the present time, and largely in the past, they are never amended without the consent of the <Col N="729" /> particular Minister.  In a matter of this kind, I am definitely of the opinion that members who are in touch with trade ought to be able to give their opinions by putting down specific amendments.</P>
      <P>I think most members will agree with me&mdash;it has been our experience here&mdash; that you get a better debate, and that you are far more likely to get the Government to see difficulties that have arisen on specific amendments dealing with specific points than if you are simply faced with the position that you must either approve or reject a particular scheme.  I do not see why it should not be correct to move an amendment, having agreed that the Government of the day will have control in the Dáil, proposing that the period should be shorter or longer.  I agree with the Minister that the description must be technical matter for experts, but I do not agree, having got the expert description, that people like ourselves who are not experts, do not often find flaws.  I have no experience of quota orders, but I have of tariffs, and I think it is often found that things get &ldquo;caught&rdquo; that it was not the intention to include.  We hear a good deal about dictatorships, and while I am not suggesting there is any intended, some people would argue that the tendency is in that direction, and if not in dictatorship by the State, of more control through the Executive Council, so that I think it is well to amend this Bill.  I suggest that this amendment might be postponed until a later one is dealt with, when there is a possibility that the House might make some suggestion in which case my amendment would be essential.  I am arguing on the general merits of the case, that some Government might, at the last minute, find that some slight alteration should be made in a Bill.</P>

      <P>The proposal in the amendment fits in, or must be considered in relation to a good deal of the legislation which gives authority to the Minister to make orders or regulations.  I argued the case before, and I think it is desirable that this House should take a much more interest in these orders and regulations than has been the case.  In this proposal the order made must come before the Dáil.  I leave out the question of the Seanad until later.  It is peculiarly a technical problem.  The essential matter is the description of the goods. As I read it, the order is made and acted upon for a time, even if only for a week, before it is brought up for approval.  To amend it after it is made and is in operation seems to present a difficulty.  They can either disapprove, with an intimation to the Ministry that it might be approved if it were couched in different language, or amend. This seems to be a case where the order ought to be passed as it stands or not at all, because it is dealing with a technical matter and it is presumed that it has been in operation before it came before the House.  Therefore to amend it probably means to affect detrimentally the whole proceedings that have gone before.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My principal object in moving this amendment is to safeguard the rights and privileges of this House; and not allow the Ministry by a sidewind to do away with any of its rights or powers. <Col N="731" /> It is no justification for the Minister to say that this is a Money Bill.  Let the Minister effect his object in another way, without establishing the precedent of passing a resolution in the Dáil making legislation effective, without coming to the Seanad.  Every Party should support the amendment for the simple reason that it is our duty to safeguard the privileges of this House and to hand them down to our successors unimpaired.  Article XII of the Constitution says ...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the peace, order and good government of the Irish Free State is vested in the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only exception made is in Article 35 which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann shall in relation to the subject matter of Money Bills as hereinafter defined have legislative authority exclusive of Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The clause in this Bill dealing with quotas is establishing the precedent of having legislation by resolution of the Dáil without considering the Seanad. That is a proceeding to which Senators should strongly object, and the only way to do so is by supporting my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a somewhat different amendment down but I do not propose to move it, because the attitude taken up by the Minister towards the other amendment, as a way out of the difficulty, clearly makes that impracticable.  For that reason I am prepared to support Senator Counihan's amendment, although the exact form usually says &ldquo;both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;, but that is not vital.  It seems to me that this is not a Money Bill, and not a matter upon which the Government need have any fears from this House.  It will not be suggested that in matters of trade this House, at any period, seriously attempted to interfere with the recognised policy of the Executive.  There are many reasons why it should not do so.  This is the kind of thing in which a revising chamber, whether constituted as it is now, or as a consultative council, <Col N="732" /> which apparently the President would like, closely allied to trade and commerce, in which there would be members whose opinions would be valuable to the Minister, should be given an opportunity to bring forward a resolution of this kind.  On the whole, I do not think the Minister will be disposed to deny that there have been a good number of matters, even since this Government came into office, in which a certain amount of friendly assistance has been given from all sides of the House.  My contention is that this is not a money matter.  It is really legislation by means of orders instead of Acts of the Oireachtas.  We agree to legislation by means of order over matters of finance and to the need of haste and secrecy beforehand.  I know that the Minister could not do that effectively if he had to bring in a Bill. We know that there must be secrecy and that time is the essence of the matter.  I am sure no one wishes to give up the power of revision which should be ours and which we have not abused.  Senator Counihan's amendment is reasonable while this is a bi-cameral legislature.  We are not seeking powers that we have not got.  If we let this go we will really be giving up what is virtually legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I called attention to this matter before and further consideration confirms my view that this amendment or some such amendment is necessary for a number of reasons. The main reason is a constitutional one.  The making of the order, as in the section, is undoubtedly going to have a legislative or statutory effect. The growing practice here, and in other countries, of legislating by order may be defended on certain grounds. If it is defended on the ground that it is going to eliminate one of the chambers of a bi-cameral legislature, then it is going to effect a revolution indeed.  So long as we have two chambers, with the power the Constitution imposes and requires this Chamber to exercise, it is essential that any legislation which is done by order should have the sanction of this House, equally with that of Dáil Eireann.  The House should support this amendment, <Col N="733" /> or one in such a form as would bring it into conformity with the usage of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated during the discussion on the Second Reading the considerations which resulted in the Bill being drafted in the form in which it appears.  At the present time there is complete power to restrict imports of any goods by means of customs duties.  In fact that power is being exercised in respect of many classes of goods.  Under different Emergency Orders and Finance Resolutions high customs duties were imposed upon certain goods, and powers of licensing were also taken and are being exercised by the Department of Industry and Commerce and by the Department of Finance, in the manner in which it is contemplated the powers provided in this Bill will be exercised.  The main purpose of this Bill is to substitute for that system the quota system contemplated in the Bill.  This Bill is not legally a finance measure, but the effect of any orders made under it is precisely similar to the effect of prohibitive customs duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a finance measure strictly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not strictly a finance measure.  The position is that the Executive Council, desiring to restrict the imports of any classes of goods can, if the Bill is passed, proceed by one of two methods: either to operate under this Bill, or to operate under finance proposals by imposing prohibitive customs duties in the licensing clauses.  On the one hand, if it operates under this Bill it will be subject to the restrictions imposed by it and will be compelled to issue licences in accordance with the provisions set out in the different sections, and generally to confine its discretion in the manner in which the Bill provides. If it proceeds by the other method of customs duty and open licensing clause, which we have been using heretofore, the Executive Council will be subject to none of these restrictions whatever.  Under these <Col N="734" /> Emergency Orders and Finance Resolutions containing licensing clauses passed by the Dáil it is given to one Minister, or one Minister in consultation with another, to exercise an absolute discretion as to the issue of licences in respect of quantity or time or in any other way.  Under this Bill, when a quota order is made, every person eligible to be registered on the register of importers is entitled to apply for a licence and to get a licence for a quantity of the goods subject to the quota order.  Under the finance procedure now in operation, there is absolute discretion in the Minister, if he so thinks fit, to refuse one person a licence and to give it to another or to give one person a licence for all he applies for and to give another person a licence for only half what he applies for.  That is undesirable.  It is largely because we felt it was so undesirable that this measure was introduced.  I do not want to be taken as saying that that is the manner in which these powers are being exercised.  On the contrary, the powers are being exercised in a manner similar to that which is set out in the various provisions of this Bill.  It is, however, clear that occasions will arise on which an Executive Council&mdash;it does not matter what Executive Council or what Party is in power&mdash;will be tempted to proceed by way of finance measure rather than under this Bill if it anticipates any difficulty in operating the different sections of this Bill.  That is one consideration and it is a consideration which I think is not without weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to another consideration on Second Reading.  There are many industrial projects in course of formulation, all of which are dependent for fulfilment on the adoption of some measure for the regulation of imports of certain classes of goods during the initial and development stages of these projects.  A certain firm may con template engaging in the manufacture of a particular article here.  It would, probably, be necessary during the construction of the works or factory that the imports of these articles should be kept down to normal level, so that there would be no forestalling <Col N="735" /> of protective measures or stocking of imported goods in anticipation of restricted supplies from abroad. During the initial stages, after construction of the factory or works, it may be necessary to limit imports in quantity to the amount required to supplement the output of the factory until that output has been brought to the point at which it corresponds with the requirements of the country.  It is proposed to use the powers under this Bill to achieve that regulation of imports, in the first instance, and regular reduction of imports, in the second instance.  The prospect of these projects being proceeded with depends very largely on these powers being acquired.  It is true we might proceed by Finance Resolution, but the making of an order under this Bill carries with it a certain amount of security which other measures may not offer, and the persons concerned in these projects may be dubious about going ahead until it is quite clear that the position will be safeguarded for them.  They can get assurance on the question of Government policy.  They know that if Government policy is subject, in this connection, to ratification in the Dail only, the Government commands a majority in the Dáil.  It is, as I said, always going to be a matter of chance whether any Government is in a position to command a majority here.  That is in no sense a reflection on this House.  On the contrary, it might be regarded as a compliment to the House, because it was always intended that ordinary Party divisions would not operate here.  But the fact that that Order would cease to be operative, and that an industry, brought into existence, might be stripped of protection following an adverse vote here, would make those who are expected to invest their money here doubtful about proceeding until all reasonable causes of apprehension as to difficulties of that kind arising had been removed. Considerations of that kind will almost inevitably force a Government, when such issues arise, to proceed by way of Finance Resolution rather than under a Bill of this kind, if the element of doubt is maintained.  It was to prevent <Col N="736" /> that element of doubt operating that the section was drafted so as to require that the Order should be submitted for review in the Dáil only.  The Dáil is given power to hold up an Order or to refuse to pass it.  In the event of such refusal, power is given the Executive Council to make a similar Order again. If similar power is to be given to the Seanad, I do not say it will destroy the utility of the measure, but it will lessen its utility and, in various ways, necessitate proceeding by Finance Resolution rather than under this measure.  I think that that is undesirable, having regard to the various factors arising in that connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister has gone far beyond Constitutional principle and theory.  He should really have argued in favour of removing sub-section (2). On his argument, there is no reason why the quota order should be submitted to the Dáil. The Government is empowered to make an order and there must not be any risks of that order being revoked or refused.  One never knows what may happen in the Dáil.  There might even be a mutiny of the Government Party. It is a dangerous thing to suggest that people should make arrangements for starting industries here if the Dáil may, perchance, refuse to obey the Government's Whip.  But this is the Seanad and, if the Dáil has thought it well to provide that an order must have its approval, I think that every argument in favour of that course applies with equal force to the Seanad.  I am afraid that the Minister has stated a case for legislation in matters of trade and commerce by order of the Executive Council. Unless he means to stand by that, I think he should withdraw all he stated in the last few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather sorry the Minister made the speech that he did because it may be taken to have implications far beyond what he intended. It seems to me that the whole question of good faith in this country depends on the acceptance by responsible leaders of all parties that actions taken by the Government of the day which induce persons to invest money or to <Col N="737" /> enter into employment on any substantial scale cannot be suddenly stopped by another Government or thoughtlessly ended by this or the other House. If there was any doubt in people's minds that that was the recognised policy of all Parties here, then I do not think that anything the Minister said would be of much use in inducing people to put money into enterprise. Any time I have been consulted I have stated that there was no Party here likely, by hasty legislation, to take away any protection which had been given in good faith by a previous Executive.  I am very sorry that the implication from the Minister's speech should be that there was any danger of tariffs, on the strength of which industries had been started or developed, being removed by the Government or some other Government tomorrow. We know there is not.  The Minister is not going to do it.  I am satisfied that no other Party is going to do it.  If any other Government did it, it would not last long.  The serious aspect of a good many tariffs is that they cannot be withdrawn.  A great deal of care should, therefore, be taken before they are made permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister raised what, to me, was an extremely interesting point.  Nobody here has seriously opposed any of the licensing provisions attached to finance measures.  Consequently, we have not had the interesting experience of a challenge as to whether these measures were or were not Money Bills. That could have been challenged and, in my opinion&mdash;it may not be worth much&mdash;a number of the wide licensing provisions in these measures could not be included in a Money Bill because a Money Bill could not make it practicable for a Minister to do for one person what he would not do for another. I believe that before a tribunal with a legal chairman we could prove that these were not Money Bills.  This matter has been discussed but we did not challenge the decision.  I should be very glad to have such an issue decided if we were not, by so doing, to hold up any important Bill.  That is one of the reasons it has not been challenged.  I am not questioning the decision of the Ceann Comhairle but it is arguable <Col N="738" /> whether some of the Bills described as Money Bills are Money Bills.  There is a Constitutional method of settling that question.  The Minister is wrong if he assumes that what we are proposing now is fundamentally different.  I hope it will not go out that there is any Party in this House&mdash;it does not apply to the small Party I belong to, at any rate&mdash;prepared wantonly to take away what has been given in good faith for the protection of some industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that. In no part of my remarks did I indicate that the doubt that might arise in the minds of prospective industrialists would be created by the prospect of a change of Government.  No doubt, that consideration is present to the mind of anybody about to invest money.  In this particular case, it is not necessary to have a change of Government to have the fears that might be entertained realised.  An order is made. Under that order, imports are restricted and industrialists avail of the opportunity created by the restriction. The next stage is to get for the order approval from the Dáil or, if this amendment is passed, from the Dáil and Seanad.  This is an essential part of the procedure in the making of an order.  It is at that stage that any dissent from the action of the Executive Council in making the order would be expressed in the Dáil or Seanad.  If that dissent is expressed in the form of a resolution of disapproval of the making of the order, there is no question of bad faith.  Each House is doing exactly what it is entitled to do without any question of bad faith, because, on the first occasion on which it had been consulted about the matter, it has given its opinion.  Anybody who is interested in the matter can have regard to that expressed opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question raised by Senator Johnson is, of course, one which arises out of the possibility of a change of Government.  In this country, and in every other country, the possibility of a change of Government involving substantial changes in policy has the effect of deterring people from engaging in industrial, commercial or economic enterprise of one kind or another.  The <Col N="739" /> fact that people acted on the policy of this Government or took advantage of the opportunities created by that policy to invest their money in industry is due to the fact either that they assumed this Government was going to remain in office for a long period, or else that any successive Government will act in the manner suggested by Senator Douglas; that is, proceed to honour any undertakings given and preserve the position in which people have risked their resources.  I do not fear any upset in connection with that. What I do fear is that the whole period of six months, or whatever period is necessary, before the resolution can be brought for approval, will have to pass before people will take a chance of acting in the position created by the order. That may be desirable, but it might force the Executive to seek approval at an earlier date than otherwise would be done.  That is a matter that can be taken into account.  The main reason why Dáil Eireann, rather than both Houses, was inserted in the Bill was that, although this Bill was not really a Money Bill, orders made under it are, in effect, finance orders, and, therefore, so far as it was designed for protective purposes, it was analogous to a Finance Act of that kind.  With reference to the licensing powers I mentioned, and that Senator Douglas mentioned, I am not sure that we are talking about the same thing.  I am talking of the licensing provisions inserted in the schedule of the ordinary Finance Act, which provide that exemption from duties may be granted in certain circumstances.  I do not know whether it can be held that these Acts are otherwise than Finance Acts.</P>

      <P>My particular consideration on this amendment is not the effect it will have upon this Bill but that it is the thin end of the wedge to take away the powers of the Seanad. All Governments seem to want to do something about the powers of the Seanad, because they think it may <Col N="740" /> hamper them in legislation that they desire to get through.  Many people believe that the Seanad is the only real body that will safeguard the rights of the citizens.  This Government may be glad, some time or other, to have the Seanad here.  They are a Government to-day, but they may be in opposition to-morrow, and then they will be glad to have the Seanad to stand up for them.</P>

      <P>This amendment is moved entirely to meet what seems to me a flaw in the drafting of the Bill.  It seems to me that the Government ought to be in the position that if they rescinded an order and then, perhaps, find a new factory coming in, they could make an order and immediately submit to Dáil Eireann.  If the Minister has not seen this and made arrangements to meet it, perhaps the further consideration of the matter might be left over to the Report Stage.

      <P>They would have to introduce a new Bill.  If they make an order they must get approval even <Col N="742" /> though they realise the next day that they made a mistake.  If they make an order and rescind it, without that approval, they should be debarred from making a similar order until new legislation is introduced.</P>

      <P>If that is what the Government desire I have nothing more to say.  But to put them in the position in regard to an order that they made and rescinded that they must first ask the Dáil to rescind it seems to me to be Gilbertian.</P>

      <P>I do not see why the Minister is so anxious to restrict the powers of the Executive.  A case may arise where the Executive may make an order and they may think to-day that that order is wrong.  They may think, in six months time, that the order is right.  They have the power to make that order.  What is the necessity for restricting them?</P>

      <P>As my amendment No. 7, which is to add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;until a resolution approving such order has been passed by Dáil Eireann&rdquo;, is substantially on the same lines, I would like to say that the view I take is that the making of an order and the approval of an order by the Oireachtas is in effect legislation.  If we leave in a provision such as sub-section (3) we are legislating to prevent ourselves from legislating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>We are precluding ourselves from legislating except by going through the normal process of enactments.  I conceive of circumstances where the whole position may change between the original formulation of the order, let us say, and the end of that Parliament or its successors. The whole position as between this country and another may alter: the whole position of the difficulties between this country and another may alter.  By this section it is not possible to take an account of that and to make a new order.  While it is self-abnegatory of the Minister and of the Ministry to deprive itself of power, it <Col N="743" /> seems to me that they are not only depriving themselves of power but that they are depriving the Dáil and the Seanad of power.  The Dáil may pass a resolution leaving the Government to make an order in respect of a certain thing, and the Minister will say &ldquo;I cannot do it, for you have by statute deprived us of the power to make that order.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to state that as I understand it there is no definition of the very important word &ldquo;quota,&rdquo; and there is no definition of another word &ldquo;rationalisation,&rdquo; which has been bandied about in the course of the discussion.  So far as I can see, it is impossible to get a definition of either of these words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition is in Section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>No definition appears. I take it what is meant is volume of goods.  The Executive Council takes power under this Bill to limit the volume of any particular goods that may be introduced into this country. I take it that is what is meant by &ldquo;quota.&rdquo;  If I am wrong the Minister will correct me.  Coming to a particular clause we find that the register is to be prepared by the Ministry.  People will be allowed to bring in whatever goods may come in under the schedule.  That might mean <Col N="744" /> that a person trading and dealing in motor cars, if motor cars were subject to the quota order, would have to come to the Ministry for permission to import cars and that that permission might not be given to him.  Paragraph (c) says that people or bodies or corporations who come within this definition may obtain permission, shall I call it, from the Minister to import the goods they require, but paragraph (c) requires that the company shall be registered in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>The inference from that is that if a company is not registered in this country it will not get a permit for the importation of goods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I shall have to postpone my remarks.  I did not receive a copy of the amendments, so I will be pardoned for touching on the matter here.</P>
      <P>Section put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
      <P>The following amendments appeared in the name of Senator Douglas:&mdash;</P>
      <P>8. New section.  Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>7. Whenever the Executive Council has made a quota order under this Act, the Minister shall issue to any person who applies in the prescribed manner therefor a licence expressed to authorise such person to import into Saorstát Eireann during the said preliminary period any quantity of the goods to which the said quota order applies, not in excess of his normal trading requirements, which have been consigned to him and were actually in the custody of a carrying company before the time of the making of such order.</P>
      <P>9. Section 7, sub-section (2). Before paragraph (d) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) an individual who is the manager or responsible head of a <Col N="745" /> branch of a company not registered in Saorstát Eireann which has carried on business in Saorstát Eireann for not less than five consecutive years immediately preceding the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister, in regard to the first amendment to Section 7, that he is prepared to see whether he can introduce an amendment on the Report Stage which will fit in with the remarks he made on Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to both amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the second amendment, I should like to be a little more clear as the Minister's remarks on Second Reading were not quite definite.  I want to get a person who had been trading here for a considerable time, as a branch of a company outside, put in as good a position as a person who has been trading here as an individual.  I have no personal interest in this but my attention has been drawn by some people to it.  I do not know the persons affected personally but I am satisfied the facts are correct.  My attention has been drawn to cases where Northern companies have had branches operating in the Saorstát for ten or 20 years, some even longer.  It is reasonable enough when these people have been operating here that they should get the same chance as an English company can to import goods under a permit.  If the Minister is prepared to bring in an amendment to meet the case that is all I want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister see that the point raised by Senator Guinness is also met, because that seems to me, after hearing Senator Guinness speak, to be very important?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the same point as that referred to by Senator Douglas.  The one thing I want to provide is that the licence will be issued to the company and not to the individual who is manager.  I am prepared to introduce an amendment providing for the issue of a licence to a company registered and incorporated <Col N="746" /> outside the Saorstát but whose place of business is in the Saorstát and which has been engaged in the business of importing such goods for a period of five years.  I suggest that even under the existing definition the manager of a company, even though he is not a national, could qualify for a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>He might qualify for a licence but he would not be able to prove his business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>If he had been importing the same goods for five years previously, or corresponding goods, which might in the course of industrial development be needed by his company, they should not be hampered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness </NameTxt>
      <P>The point I raised was that under clause (c) if the company is not registered in Ireland it is being penalised in so far as the importation of goods is concerned.  It would really mean that a company that was not registered here would have to be registered here in order to come within that portion of the clause.</P>
