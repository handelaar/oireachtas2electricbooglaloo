      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in view of the growing policy of self-sufficiency, both in the Irish Free State and in other countries which in the past offered a market for our trade, the Seanad requests the Executive Council to set up a Commission to inquire and advise as to the best method of absorbing the excess of agricultural <Col N="154" /> produce for which an external market may no longer be available.</P>
    <P>The motion that I now rise to move is substantially the same as one I moved last May and for that reason, I hope that what I said then may be within the recollection of many members of the House and that it will not be necessary for me to repeat myself at undue length.  As regards the magnitude of the subject, I do not think there can be any doubt.  Agriculture, it is almost a platitude to repeat, is our main and, in fact, our sole primary industry.  It is, indeed, more than an industry.  It is a livelihood in the complete sense of the term.  Around agriculture revolves the family life and continuing interest totally different from that in manufacture, which closes at a certain time and when the people leave their factories they try to forget what they have been doing during the day.  It embodies, you might say, almost a complete civilization and it employs, as statistics show us, seven or nearly eight of the able-bodied employed out of every ten and anything that affects an industry of that magnitude must, of course, sooner or later, affect the whole well-being of the country.  It has hitherto grown up, you might say, spontaneously out of the dim past, as a result of necessity, owing to the ever increasing urge of people to make a livelihood.  It lacks what one calls the modern planning system, and its driving force has been, of course, profit and the getting of the best under the circumstances.  Some may say that its methods are archaic and not up-to-date, and that it lacks the all essential modern efficiency.  I say, coming from the people, out of necessity, out of their ordinary livelihood, it is right that it has that origin and that growth.  It is the outcome of our hopes and the struggle for existence.</P>
    <P>That being its history up to comparatively recent times, it has had forced upon it a very sudden and dramatic change.  This came, you might say, from two quarters.  In one respect, and the major respect, it was due to our own action.  Owing to the dispute that arose over the annuities, we suddenly find a severe restriction <Col N="155" /> in our export market.  I do not want to develop that.  We all know it and I know that the very mention of the economic war rather suggests that you are a political partisan and prejudiced against the policy of the Government. That is not my aim at all but merely to state facts.  If it was not for the economic war, our markets would be in a very different condition from what they are to-day, but there is the other factor, which is not under our own control and not of our making, and that is the tendency of all countries to follow along this path of self-sufficiency.  I think we ought to realise, in our pride on that new policy, that others can play at that game and that the reactions that come from other quarters may have a very serious effect on ourselves.  In fact, the lesson to be derived from that is that we cannot, even if we wished to do so, live in water-tight compartments, and that in trying to do so, we are only trying to encompass our own ruin in the long run.</P>
    <P>As regards the present position, opinions may differ, but I suggest that the difference of opinion is only among politicians or only among people who know little or nothing about farming. Among farmers there can only be one opinion&mdash;the industry is in a very serious position.  The farmers themselves are facing up to it with great courage.  The evil is, to a certain extent, held at a distance by artificial subsidies and palliatives of that kind, but none the less, slowly and steadily, the agricultural industry, if present conditions are allowed to continue, will bleed to death and there is a serious responsibility on the Government to face up to the problem and, I would suggest, in a totally different spirit from that in which they are facing up to it at present.  Life undoubtedly still goes on.  The agricultural industry, we all know, is one of extreme hardiness.  You do not get in agriculture the sudden collapse that you get in business.  If a business ceases to make profits and if it has no reserves, there is no alternative for it but to close down.  Agriculture, however, does not work that way. <Col N="156" /> There is always a living for those on the land to be got out of the land, but they get poorer and poorer, their profits get less and less, wages get less and less and savings get less and less, and family life gets back, steadily but slowly, to a reduced standard.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for one without inner knowledge to estimate the losses, but it would not be an over-statement to say that the loss in capital value to the farmers, over the last eighteen months, goes somewhere well over the ten million figure and the annual loss must be represented by at least four or five million pounds.  The effect of that is not dramatic and sudden like it would be in industry, but it is slowly eating into the life and welfare of the country and more especially of the agricultural community, and if it is allowed to go on, it must inevitably represent a loss of purchasing power which will affect our industries and our manufactures just as much as it does our land, and it ultimately must affect the whole budgetary position of the State finances.  Now there is, I suggest, a great danger of complacency in this matter.  I am sure the Minister himself is concerned and I think that we all agree that in the light of his own policy, he is doing his best to stay and arrest this decline, but we none the less do feel concerned when a person in the exalted position of our President says, as he said at Mallow, &ldquo;I have, so to speak, in my own mind written the live-stock industry off the slate; it is gone and we have to get on without it&rdquo;&mdash;or, perhaps, to put it in another way &ldquo;The British market is no longer any concern of ours.&rdquo;  As it is the main outlet for our live stock that attitude is, I suggest, fraught with danger to the whole country; it is not an attitude that can be the result of study.  It can only be the result, I suggest, of being dominated by a certain political doctrine&mdash;the doctrine of self-sufficiency&mdash;which has got to come whether it is feasible or not and which is totally divorced from any real close or scientific practical examination of the subject.  I think it was only yesterday or the day before that <Col N="157" /> the President again said that the farmers in this country were no worse off than the farmers in other countries. That, again, is a dangerous attitude, first of all, because, even if they are not worse off, badly off as they are, they are working speedily to ruin and that fact by itself should be sufficiently serious; but I do challenge his statement, even on a comparative examination&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Senator to quote the statement of the President, to which he refers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give it to the Senator after, but I think it is within the recollection of the House that only the day before yesterday the President, when referring to progress in the country and our gradual approach to self-sufficiency, said that the farmers were no worse off, or even if they were, they were no worse off than the farmers in any other country.  I can get the statement any time, but it is so recent and, I think, so generally published that it is not a matter about which there can be any dispute.  I have personal knowledge of the conditions respecting one estate in England, and these are the facts. The wholesale price of milk which the farmer is getting there is 10d. a gallon.  There are no rates at all and the average rent, certainly in that case, is 7/6 an acre.  These rents, I suggest, are appreciably lower than the average rates or annuities on an Irish farm.  That rent carries with it the freedom of the farmer to go when he likes.  He is not tied to his land.  He does not have the obligation of repairs; those are done by the landlord; and he has got a benefit on roughly the same lines as the wheat privileges in this country.  The farmer in Gloucestershire, which is the part of England I am referring to, badly hit as he is by the low prices of live stock, is, in my opinion, immeasurably better off than the farmer in this country.  I would say that all the farmers in England are better off than those in this country for the reason that it is a subsidiary industry in England and that by derating and other measures you can, as a sound <Col N="158" /> proposition, subsidise agriculture out of national wealth; whereas here, I suggest, the conditions are very different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a good deal from time to time about the lack of balance in our State economy.  It has always been urged by those who want to see a revival of our industries that our economy is unbalanced and that in order to get a complete civilisation you must have an industrial as well as an agricultural side.  With that I agree, but there is such a thing as tilting the balance in the wrong direction and I suggest that it is being now rapidly tilted in the wrong direction.  You have only to refer to the festivities of last week, if I may call them so, and to the optimistic hopes expressed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself and by the various speakers to find confirmation of this and the great satisfaction in their minds at the growth and development of industry here as subsidised by the State, but I was struck also by their callous indifference towards our main industry.  I could see no concern or sympathy or regard for the suffering state of agriculture in the various speeches.  Agriculture, in the long run, must provide the market for the products of those industries and unless it has the purchasing power those manufactures, in which there is such hope and pride at the moment, will inevitably suffer.  They are being built up on a false foundation and the capital put into them on the basis of the past purchasing power of the country is being put in on a grievous misunderstanding.  There will be a serious collapse if we go on building on the basis of that purchasing power if agriculture is slowly bleeding to death as it is at present.  After all, the conditions are totally different.  It is a simple matter, if you have no regard to ultimate consequences, to deal with the industrial problem.  You are producing these things for a hypothetically existing market and that is all right provided the purchasing power is maintained.  It is a comparatively simple matter to shut out competition and to provide capital, as we are doing at present, from State <Col N="159" /> resources, but it is a totally different matter to try to absorb an exportable surplus and to find an outlet for production when the market which we had in the past is grievously curtailed.  Up to a certain point, I suppose, the Government is disposed to agree that the position is serious, but I imagine that their case is that they are doing all they can in the circumstances. They are undoubtedly trying to do something.  They are doing something but can what they are doing ever be a basic remedy?  Is not what they are doing merely feeding the dog with a bit of his own fat?  The only sound basis on which any industry can rest is primary wealth production unassisted by grants or subsidies, but if you examine the entire agricultural policy of the country you will find that it assumes that there is some reserve of wealth out of which agriculture can be artificially propped up.  Take the wheat policy.  What is that?  That policy is dependent upon an increase of price to the bread consumer.  Any economist knows that you will not get finality on a proposition of that kind unless you have enormous reserves of wealth. Where are those reserves?  For a short time, of course&mdash;for a few years &mdash;by borrowing and other methods, you can evade the issue, but in the long run the result is inevitable.  Take the case of sugar.  That again is being done by a hidden tax which involves something in the neighbourhood of half a million a year to the consumer. The Carlow beet factory for ten years required some millions of pounds.  It would be proportionately the same amount now because we are going to pay less for beet than in the past. Take the case of butter.  My wife told me that in England the other day she paid 11d. a lb. for butter, and it was excellent butter.  That was in a London store.  Here it is ¼, but where is it all coming from?  It is simply the same thing as if you went and put all these sums, representing perhaps £2,000,000 or £3,000,000, on to the Budget.  It is simply a hidden tax.</P>
    <P>In another way&mdash;I admit it is not quite the same thing&mdash;you have this mixture question.  The price of oats <Col N="160" /> is being artificially kept up, or rather it is being attempted to keep it up, by artificially regulating the feeding mixtures.  It has not had the effect desired, partly because the farmers do not like it, and, rightly or wrongly, prefer their own maize mixtures.  There is also the proposal that oat flour should form a partial ingredient in our bread.  I think that is rather a better scheme than some of the others but I suggest that you will never save agriculture in the long run on a policy of that kind.  You have got to get back to the methods of the past where agriculture stood on its own legs and had freedom and where, whatever the results were, the farmers built up reserves and gave us what civilisation we had, which, I suggest, was a far better civilisation than many of the new saviours will ever put in its place.</P>
    <P>Then, again, in connection with this question of production, the difficulty at the moment appears to be that of over-production. Our foreign market is curtailed and, for the moment, farmers are holding their stock and, by means of subsidies and the other artificial remedies I have mentioned, the evil day is being postponed.  Sooner or later, however, you will have to deal with this question of over-production. As far as I can see, the policy of the Government to increase production will only aggravate the question and unless there is some serious thought brought to bear upon the question the inevitable result will be that production will have to decrease and they will even have to resort to destruction of commodities as they have done and are doing in other countries.  That may be inevitable but it certainly is not along the road to greater wealth or prosperity.  The reason I ask for some inquiry of an independent kind into this matter, and that I ask the House to agree to such an inquiry, is because it is almost impossible for politicians to look at this thing in more or less a scientific light.  All through all these remedies there is the trail of politics and votes.  There is this question of the live-stock industry declining because it is in the hands of the ranchers and of dividing the ranches among the smallholders.  I <Col N="161" /> suggest that this policy of increased production is not being considered as a purely economic question, as it should be considered in the first instance, but as a policy of creating a larger number of small holdings and appealing to the masses apart altogether from the real needs of the problem.  I feel that this whole question requires to be examined in the first instance by people who have got no concern whatever with politics and that it should be examined as a purely economic problem. What its solution is I am not prepared to suggest for the moment, but if the Government had it examined in a cold-blooded, critical spirit, apart altogether from the political pressures and exigencies of the moment, then the Government could say &ldquo;that is a good plan but, as politicians, we cannot stand over it.&rdquo;  I feel that the Government had never had clear thought brought to bear on the problem and that is why I ask for this inquiry.  If they are not able to do it that is another matter, but at least let it be examined from the point of view of economics and with the long view with regard to the budgetary position and the effect of all these hidden taxes.  Having heard these people it will then rest with the Government to say: &ldquo;No, we cannot do it&rdquo; or to modify it as the case may be.  Apart from that there is the immediate remedy embodied in Senator Counihan's amendment.  I hope Senator Counihan does not think that I am in any way hostile to his amendment, but I do not think it is an amendment to my motion but that it is rather more of an addendum.  I agree that it is of immediate necessity to try to come to terms with our chief market if that could be done straightaway. I admit that the annuities dispute has created rather an unfortunate war atmosphere, if I might so describe it, an atmosphere of antagonism which makes it difficult; but I suggest that what makes it far more difficult is the feeling of false pride.  Pride may be a virtue in some cases but as between nations it seems to be a curse.  This war spirit and the feeling that we may be accused of surrender or accused of <Col N="162" /> being defeated, I suggest, is the chief factor in preventing us from settling the question.  As a result of it we cannot go on and say: &ldquo;Look here; come along; cannot we talk over this matter?&rdquo;  Only the other day I noticed that Mr. Thomas said&mdash;I cannot quote his exact words&mdash;that the door is never closed.  To me that is a pathetic appeal.  I can see the home with the son's room as he left it and with the table always waiting for the absent member.  I can see the Biblical spirit there always and the appeal: &ldquo;If you will only come and be friends again.&rdquo; That is the true friendly spirit expressed by Mr. Thomas&mdash;that the door is never closed and, in effect, &ldquo;We are prepared at any moment to receive you back as the prodigal son and to kill the fatted calf, and to try to help you along the road to prosperity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although that appears to excite levity in the minds of some, I really feel that if we could put aside the spirit of independence for one of conciliation a great deal could be done.  For that reason I welcome the spirit although I am not concerned with the method, of Senator Counihan's amendment.  I feel that two things are wanted.  In the first place we want an inquiry to see, if we can, what is the exportable surplus, apart from the annuities, and apart from a possible agreement with England, because there is an exportable surplus which must be dealt with. At the same time I agree with the spirit embodied in the amendment that we should try to come to terms and get the markets reopened.  After all, what does the wealth of a country consist of?  Is not the whole position one of inter-trade?  Our wealth consists of the grass, the climate and the live stock in this country.  We have these to offer and to bargain, and for them the other country has manufactured goods, to be exchanged.  Is not this the rational way to approach the question: &ldquo;We have what you want and you have what we want. Let us come to terms?&rdquo;  That is the spirit.  I leave myself in the hands of <Col N="163" /> the House, which I hope will accept the spirit of both the motion and the amendment.  I hope the House will agree, in an appeal to the Government, that this question is getting deadly serious when our primary industry is bleeding to death and that the dispute can only be dealt with in the right spirit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move as an amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all after the word &ldquo;Seanad&rdquo; in line 3 and to substitute therefor the following: &ldquo;urges upon the Government the desirability of approaching the British Government with a view to the setting up of a joint commission to consider how far the economic policies of the Irish Free State and Great Britain can be reconciled to their mutual advantage and the Irish Free State restored to the preference in the British market accorded to members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with the speech of Senator Sir John Keane, although I do not agree with his motion.  I think his speech would have been more appropriate to the amendment than to the motion.  My objection to the motion is that it assumes that we have lost the British market, owing to a policy of self-sufficiency in those countries which in the past offered a market for our trade.  If we have lost the British market it is not because of a policy of self-sufficiency of agricultural produce in these countries.  That assumption is not correct.  There are no other markets for our surplus agricultural produce.  There is only one market for our surplus produce and that is Great Britain.  That market is still open to us if this Government has the commonsense to settle this dispute.  Responsible British Ministers have stated from time to time that they wish for a settlement of this dispute, and that money would not stand in the way.  No later than the last week-end Mr. Thomas stated <Col N="164" /> that the door was still open for an honourable settlement.  President de Valera, and many members of the Executive Council, have stated that they are anxious for a settlement and that they desire the goodwill and friendship of England.  Furthermore, I believe that the majority of the citizens of both countries desire a settlement, and are anxious that there should be the fullest development of unrestricted trade and good feeling. With these expressions of goodwill and a desire for a settlement of the dispute, considering the hardships and the misery that the economic war is causing in this country, as well as the loss and inconvenience it is causing to England, it is difficult to understand why some genuine attempt has not been made at a settlement before now.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for President deValera, when speaking on Government policy, to say that he is satisfied with the way the country is progressing, and that he is quite satisfied with what he has done.  Are the farmers satisfied with what has been done?  Are farmers and agricultural labourers to receive no consideration? Are farmers to continue to produce when their produce will not pay the cost of production, and which in many cases they cannot sell at any price? Are agricultural labourers to work for less than a living wage in order to provide food for people living in the towns at less than the cost of production?  Are farmers and agricultural labourers to be forever the abject slaves of the rest of the community?</P>
    <P>While I do not want to discuss the rights or wrongs of withholding payment of the land annuities from England, I would like to know what gain it has been to the country to do so.  What gain has it been to retain £5,250,000 and to make the farmers pay every shilling of that money in the way of special duties on their exports, and in addition, to pay £2,500,000 in bounties and subsidies to help to have their produce exported? Where is the benefit in having our exports of fat stock, the production of <Col N="165" /> which gave considerable employment, reduced by half?  What benefit is it to have our forward stores confiscated by the British Government if we attempt to export them?  What benefit is it to produce young cattle, fifteen months old, which is now our principal export and to sell them at £2 10/- a head which, after deducting £1 a bounty for the buyers as well as other expenses leaves only a net gain of 5/-?  What benefit is it to the country to have an adverse trade balance of £16,000,000 yearly and a reduction of our total trade since 1931 of £33,000,000?  What does the Government hope to gain by making the whole country bankrupt?  These are points I would like our Government to consider when thinking about a settlement of this dispute.</P>
    <P>I have been accused of being pro-British. I admit that I am pro-British, but I am pro-Irish first, and my principal consideration is for Ireland, and particularly Irish farmers.  I want to say that in my long connection with English businessmen I found them to be the straightest and the best citizens in the world. I cannot feel the same about the British Government.  During centuries of connection with Britain, their Government always tried to crush us. We never received any justice from them except what we fought for.  It is all very well for Mr. Thomas to make flippant professions of goodwill, and to express a desire for a settlement, but what has he done to implement his statements?  When he found that he could not get more than he claimed by his special duties on our agricultural products and live stock, he cut down our exports of fat stock, on the plea that he wished to help the British farmers.  What help is it to the British farmers to exclude 50 per cent. of our fat cattle, when the market is being flooded with Argentine meat?</P>
    <P>Did Mr. Thomas consult the Irish Government before imposing his restrictions?  Did he take into consideration our inability to pay the British demands?  Did he take into <Col N="166" /> consideration that previous to this dispute we were England's best customer; that in 1931 our imports from Britain were £39,000,000 and that our exports to Britain amounted to £37,000,000, so that the balance of trade was in favour of England to the extent of £2,000,000?  Did he take into account that the Argentine sent exports to Great Britain amounting to £52,744,000 but only took British goods to the value of £15,000,000?  Did he take into account that Denmark exported goods to Great Britain to the value of £47,000,000, and in return only took goods to the value of £9,000,000?  Did he take into account that these two countries are outside the British Commonwealth of Nations? Let us now take the case of Canada, a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Canada sold to Great Britain in that year goods value £33,000,000 and only took in return goods value £22,000,000.  It has been said that we only took six per cent. of the total exports of Great Britain But I want to remind the House and the Government that if that plea is going to be made, the whole of South America, including the Argentine, only takes six per cent. of Great Britain's exports, and the whole of North America, including Canada, only takes 11 per cent. of British exports.  I have taken the figures for the year 1931 because they are the latest available for a full year.  Even at the present time, on the balance of trade, we should get a bigger consideration, because I think we are still England's second best customer.</P>
    <P>I have tried, as far as possible, not to touch on the economic war, not to touch on quotas and on the ruin that is being inflicted on our country.  I do not want anything that I have said to be taken as propaganda for either side.  My sole desire in moving the amendment is to have a settlement, and, I believe, if the Seanad adopts the amendment, and if the Government agrees, we will arrive at a settlement, outside the politicians, which will make for lasting friendship and goodwill with Great Britain. <Col N="167" /> I strongly recommend the Seanad to adopt the motion as amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I think it is the most vital motion that has come before this House for a long time.  It surprises me that more interest is not taken in it.  It is strange that more interest should be taken in other Bills such as, unemployment, which are merely subsidiary to this.  Our trade and employment are dependent on the success of our agricultural industry. The whole thing comes shortly to this that President de Valera is costing this country £1,500,000 a month.  Could any man be worth that to this country even if he were an Irishman?  We are paying £1,500,000 a month for his vanity war, and all that we get in return is the statement of Senator Connolly, that purveyor of negations, that there will be &ldquo;no surrender.&rdquo; The secondary apology for this vanity war is that we are to be made a self-sufficient nation.  It seems to me that this is an outcome of self-complacency. There is no such thing as a self-sufficient nation, and it would be very undesirable that there should be because each would be cutting itself off from the inventions, the amenities and the transport system of the world. We would be somewhat in the position of the cranoge dwellers of Moate who only succeeded after 1,000 years in losing the art of making native pottery.  What is the meaning of self-sufficiency when one gunboat in any of the four seas of Ireland could open fire and send the President and his 300 irregular Guards helter skelter to Athlone&mdash;beside the national broadcasting station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a monstrous thing to call this war.  It is a blunder, mingled with dishonesty.  Even in the face of unmistakable disaster there was no attempt made to meet it.  All that we had was a cynical sneer from the President who, on a previous occasion in this House, told me it would be a good thing if the people were trapped into losing their cattle trade.  Now he has trapped them into losing it so <Col N="168" /> far that they cannot regain it. England is giving what may be called a bonus of £37,000,000, in an exchange of trade to Denmark and of nearly £30,000,000 to the Argentine.  Was there ever such a moment in our history?  We have all this nonsensical pride which makes it impossible for us to look an equal in the eye and deal fairly with him; we can see no one as an equal when we could have demanded on account of the value of our market for England's hardware a doubling of the wealth of the country by preference trading and a share of the money that she is pouring out without any return to Denmark and the Argentine.</P>
    <P>A country does not cease to have self-respect because it deals to advantage with another country, in our case an advantage of £30,000,000 on our side with England.  We are losing all that because we happen to be guided by an intellect that outside the realm of politics would be a matter for an alienist.  That is the serious side to all this.  We ought to have sufficient self-respect and self-confidence, let alone self-sufficiency, to be able to demand equal rights with England and not be always taking up a subservient attitude.  The attitude taken up by the Government is a most pathetic exhibition of self-conscious inferiority and obstinate infantilism.</P>

      <P>It rather passes me to reconcile the motion of Senator Sir John Keane with the amendment that has been moved by Senator Counihan. Senator Sir John Keane said that there was nothing really between the two of them.  I think they are essentially different.  I think it might be a good thing, quite irrespective of any dispute between the two countries, to set up a commission of inquiry as to the disposal of our agricultural or other produce.  That is Senator Sir John Keane's motion.  The amendment moved by Senator Counihan completely cuts away Senator Sir John Keane's desire for a committee of investigation and substitutes the desirability of &ldquo;approaching the British Government with a view to the <Col N="169" /> setting up of a joint commission to consider how far the economic policies of the Irish Free State and Great Britain can be reconciled.&rdquo;  The only comment that I wish to make on that is this: that immediately before the words &ldquo;approaching the British Government&rdquo; Senator Counihan omitted to insert the words &ldquo;hat in hand.&rdquo; Senator Sir John Keane told us, with a considerable amount of verbiage, that agriculture was practically our sole industry.  He did not say that in so many words, but that is really what he was leading up to because eventually he came to the point &ldquo;we produce agricultural commodities; you produce manufactured articles and it is only right and fit and proper that we should exchange them.&rdquo;  I would suggest to Senator Sir John Keane that he should read the address the Minister for Agriculture in England, in his capacity as Lord Rector of the University of Aberdeen, delivered in that university last week on self-sufficiency.  I have a copy of it and it will afford me great pleasure to let the Senator have it.  If he reads that lecture carefully I suggest that he will not again make in this House such a speech as he made here to-day.</P>
      <P>The Senator went on to stress and to detail the prices that the agricultural producer was getting for his produce in this country, but by a paradoxical form of reasoning, in this market which the Senator wishes us to get into again, he told us that butter can be had at 5d. per lb. cheaper than it can be had here.  That is perfectly true.  Therefore, the point of his attack is on the Government here for securing for our agricultural producers, in the only market in which it has control, such prices as will enable them to continue to produce.  These enhanced prices in the home market, the enhanced price of sugar due to the Carlow and the other proposed beet factories, may be hidden taxes on the people of this country, but at least every penny piece of them is retained here and given largely to our agricultural producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Counihan gave us what we <Col N="170" /> were promised in the <i>London Sunday Times</i>, a flood of facts and figures. I rather expected that they would have come from another source.  I was pleased that he gave them.  He gave us the figures relating to the imports into Britain from the Argentine, Denmark and Canada and the exports of Britain to this country.  In comparison with those countries, we are still a very large asset to Britain, but now, as always, we do not receive any of the favours that those countries get.  Penal legislation is enacted against the entry of our agricultural products into England.  Now as always Ireland is the step-child of the empire.</P>

      <P>It is true, propaganda or no propaganda.  Senator Sir John Keane says that we must approach this from the scientific standpoint and from the purely economic outlook. The purely scientific standpoint and the purely economic outlook described in terms of free trade of which Senator Sir John Keane up to yesterday was a very consistent advocate, has resulted in a continuous drain on the population of this country and a continual increase in the number of bullocks. Circumstances over which neither Britain nor this country has had any control have compelled the retention in this country of tens of thousands of our young men and women, and if there never had been what has been rightly or wrongly called an economic war and no change in the attitude of self-sufficiency of Britain, we would be obliged by the compulsory retention, at which I rejoice, of these people in their own country to do something to provide employment for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very pleased over the week-end to visit nine factories in Cork and to see what was being done in them. Not only is there a tremendous development in the industrial and manufacturing end, but those factories are working as hard as it is possible for them to work.  They are working during all the hours that they are permitted to work.  The boot factories are producing men's boots, ladies' <Col N="171" /> boots, children's boots.  These factories have been established in the Free State during the last few years, but with all their production we are now only producing 50 per cent. of the shoes that are required in the country, so that there is still a large available leeway to be made up in that respect. I am very pleased that such a development is going on.  Ultimately we hope to produce all the boots and shoes that we require.  It is noteworthy, too, that we are beginning to produce at least part of the leather from which these shoes are made.  We are told: &ldquo;It is so easy to produce.&rdquo;  It is. I have some interest in manufacturing concerns myself.  It is relatively easy to produce, but very frequently it is a very much more difficult thing to sell and to distribute.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that. I partly anticipated that from the Senator in view of what I saw in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on Sunday last.  On Saturday I asked one of the largest industrialists in Cork in one of his factories: &ldquo;How are you for orders?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;We cannot cope with our orders and, so as to prevent confusion, on receipt of an order from a traveller in case we cannot supply by the date marked for delivery, he is written to and the order cancelled in case he cannot give us time for extended delivery.&rdquo; While we continue to import on as large a scale as we are doing, there will not be very much difficulty in selling the home products provided, and I think it is well this should be insisted on, that the goods in quality and substance are produced at a price at which they should be given to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senator Counihan tables a motion such as he has on the Order Paper to-day we know that he has principally in mind the trade which he knows better perhaps than any other member in the House.  Let us be candid.  He put his finger on the point that affects the cattle trade&mdash;the continued, persistent and growing increase in the use of chilled meat, not <Col N="172" /> frozen meat, in England. I think I am right in saying that the year before last home-killed beef in England amounted to no more than 20 per cent. of the beef consumed.  Eighty per cent. of the beef used in England is imported.  I am not throwing cold water on any market but, if we are not blind, we must see the danger of relying on a market which is a wasting asset.  I heard the late Mr. T.P. Gill, Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, saying during the war that for the ten months preceding the time at which he was speaking 78½ per cent. of the meat of all sorts used in England had come from this country.  Contrast that figure with the present figure.</P>

      <P>Yes, but contrast that with the 20 per cent. which represents the consumption of home-killed beef in England at present.  Possibly a commission such as Senator Sir John Keane suggests might be usefully set up to consider the whole question&mdash;not only that, but how our industrial production might be accelerated and lines of distribution improved conjointly with improvement of the methods of production and quality of agricultural products which we must recognise will be more and more wanted in this country as more and more people become employed in industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate because I want to draw the attention of the House to the initial mistake which, in my opinion, the Government has made in the conduct of business generally.  They have made a fetish of self-sufficiency.  I have asked before in this House if any Senator could name one country in the world, with the solitary exception of Tibet, which is self-sufficient.  We are less dependent on the outside world than is Great Britain or Russia or even the United States.  The sooner that idea of self-sufficiency is exploded the better.  Unfortunately, I had not an opportunity of visiting the nine factories in Cork which Senator <Col N="173" /> Dowdail had the pleasure of seeing last Saturday.  I should like to ask the Senator a few questions about these factories.  I should like to know how much of the machinery used in these factories was made in Ireland. I think it would have to be admitted that not one per cent. of it was turned out in this country.  I should also like to know how much of the raw material used in these factories was produced, discovered or manufactured in Ireland. I should think that 50 per cent. at least, of the value of the finished article had to be sent out of this country in payment for the raw material.  So far as I can judge, no matter how hard we work our industrialists, we shall not be able to produce, on an average, more than half the value of the finished article within the country.  We must bring in materials to the value of about 50 per cent. of the value of the finished article.  So far as I know, in only two important industries do we not require to bring in raw material&mdash; sugar and leather.  We all wish our sugar factories and all other factories the greatest possible success but to think for one moment that a country like ours can rely upon industries, irrespective of agriculture, is perfectly absurd.  If that were true, it would be the greatest reflection upon the Irish nation ever made.  Some people have been very abusive of our country but none of them ever said we were absolutely incompetent and stupid. Yet, under the same conditions as Cork exists, Belfast has existed. Belfast has been a wonderful success industrially while I cannot say the same for Cork.  Why?  Because Belfast was surrounded by an agricultural community protected by land laws which no other part of Ireland enjoyed.  That is the secret of Belfast's success as apart from any other portion of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to Senator Dowdall that the butter question is not truly represented in what Senator Sir John Keane says.  He says we got 11d. per lb. for our butter.  So far as my knowledge goes, we got far less than that.  We had to pay the tax before we touched the 11d.  The reason <Col N="174" /> is the position brought about by the difference between the two Governments. The British Government claim that that position was brought about because we broke the Treaty.  We have never discussed that with them or with anyone else.  We have never suggested that it was a matter for argument except before a tribunal which they would not have.  The initial mistake the Government are making is in thinking that they can establish this country as an industrial country.  Many of us are old-fashioned enough not to be very sanguine as to its being an industrial country in the manner in which Belfast, Manchester, and Sheffield are industrial cities.  I should prefer to have a prosperous agricultural community and I believe it is still quite possible to bring that about.  The way to bring it about is to try to get the very best prices we can for everything we produce.  There is an unlimited market, no matter what Senator Dowdall says, for our produce in England.  Had we gone in and got the same terms that other countries got when they came to settlement in Ottawa, we would be very well in the running for the supply of various agricultural products in England.  On the last occasion that this matter was before us, Senator Connolly said that he had met many Danes who regretted very bitterly that Denmark was so dependent upon England.  That may be so.  From what I know about the butter trade&mdash;I am sorry Senator Dowdall is not here because he could correct me&mdash;Denmark has been supplying butter to England for the last seven or eight years at a far greater loss to herself than the annuities were to us.  She supplied 70 per cent. of the butter going in to England and at no time did the price she got for it cover the cost of production.  Notwithstanding that, she is still eager to get all the products she can into the English market.  If she loses on butter, it does not follow that, on other commodities which she is sending into England, she is not making up the difference.  At all events, we can be satisfied that our industries can only be successful if our agriculture is <Col N="175" /> successful.  I think the Government should bear that in mind.  As regards the industries visited by Senator Dowdall, I should like to know the proportion of men employed.  I should be very much surprised if it amounted to 50 per cent. and I should be still more surprised if the number employed showed more than a 30 per cent. increase on that of three or four years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">

      <P>If there is any value at all in the statement the Senator has made, it is that Denmark has been losing wholesale on her trade with Britain and that he wants this State to do exactly the same thing.  That is a most extraordinary argument for the Senator to bring forward in defence of his theory.  I cannot understand it.  Senator Sir John Keane compared the position in different countries and said that the Irish agriculturist was worse off than the agriculturists of other countries.  I know a good deal about one of the western States of America, where I have relations working on farms.  I can assure the Senator that the reports from there show that the farmers there are very much worse off than they could be anywhere else.  They are utterly unable to sell their stock.  No price is offered for their stock.  It was suggested that the banks should call in their debts and it was found that the whole countryside would simply be wiped out if that were done. Every farm in that State would be taken possession of and there would be a similar position in the other cattle-raising States of America.  However, these comparisons do not go a long way.  What astonishes me is that the people who objected so much to the retention of the annuities and even to an enquiry into the annuity position <Col N="176" />&mdash;this matter was brought before the Seanad before&mdash;are the people who are now shouting for an inquiry.  That proposal was only beaten by the vote of the Chairman of the period.  If that inquiry had been held, the whole question might be in a better position than it is now.  An inquiry by the Seanad would have gone a long way to establish the legal rights and wrongs of the question.  The people who are now in favour of an inquiry voted dead against the proposal then and it was thrown out finally by the vote of the Chairman.</P>
      <P>These are the very people who are now so anxious for inquiries.  They are all clamouring for them now.  Of course, everybody wants a settlement of this question.  Does anybody suppose that the Government do not want to settle the question?</P>

      <P>The position of the few people who think that is not very important.  The Government, of course, would like a settlement of this question.  It is in their interest and the interest of the whole country to settle it.  We have had a great deal of inquiry into this matter.  Senator Counihan supposes that there never has been an inquiry or an attempt at an inquiry or an effort to smooth matters over.  He forgets that during the last Session, he was told all about the different attempts to settle the question and he starts off afresh with the suggestion that there never has been any attempt at conciliation. What happened?  Immediately we retained the annuities, Mr. Thomas and Lord Hailsham came over to this country to see how the matter could be settled and I take it for granted that they had some hope of a settlement. However, it fell through, for what reason I cannot say.  Shortly after, there was another meeting when the President himself went over to London and had conversations there which ended in absolute failure.  In the letters that passed between the two Governments afterwards, there <Col N="177" /> were statements of the entire facts and of the points on which they agreed and disagreed and so on, so that it cannot be said that nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>This has happened on several occasions.  Efforts have been made, first on one side and then on the other, to bring about conciliation.  What prevented this?  Let us see for a moment what prevented it.  I was in London when the Bill to impose extra taxes on this country was brought forward. Mr. Thomas, in making his statement, said over and over again that the only object he had in bringing forward that Bill was to recoup the English taxpayer for the money that ought to have been sent over but was being retained in this country.  He made that statement again and again and he based his whole case for the Bill on it. A few weeks after that, the Solicitor-General in England made a public statement, as a public official, that the amount of money sent over from here was of no consequence at all to them; that it did not amount to much compared with their own finances and that the whole thing could be wiped out if certain political concessions were made.  What were we required to do?  We were required to surrender our liberties to the British&mdash;the liberties that we had gained, and gained how?&mdash;with rifles in our hands. We were to be prepared to sacrifice those political advantages in order to get this money.  Those two statements are directly in opposition to each other as anybody can see.  Mr. Thomas stated that it was the money they wanted and the Solicitor-General that they did not want the money at all but certain political concessions. No one can deny this because they are public statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the object of all this, and why do these difficulties arise?  Because the British Ministers are playing a game under the table and shuffling the cards according to what they want.  About the time I speak of, there was a proposal made by the Labour Party.  It was a very fair proposal and was to the effect that two representatives should be appointed from each country to inquire into the whole legal position <Col N="178" /> and to state what, in their opinion, was the legal position of the matter. Mr. Baldwin stopped that.  &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will have no such thing.&rdquo;  Why did he say so?  Because he knew that he was going to get the worst of it if he did agree.  The British Government found that they were in the wrong and that the money was not due to them.  That was the reason why he did not agree.  Otherwise, why did he refuse?  I know of no other reason.  He did not give any reason himself except that he thought it would not result in an immediate settlement.  The result of the opposite course of action has not been a settlement. Curiously enough, one of the points put forward by the English newspapers and English politicians on which we were asked to surrender was the subject of references to the Privy Council.  We were told that we were not entitled to prevent such references and that we ought not to have done it.  In this morning's or yesterday's newspaper, I saw a statement from the Prime Minister of South Africa absolutely and plumply objecting to the British statement, made by Lord Hailsham in the House of Lords, that we had no right to abolish references to the Privy Council.  The Prime Minister in South Africa is entirely of our opinion, so that the British are not playing straightforwardly with us all along and until they see that, we will get no further.  It is a very remarkable thing that while Mr. Thomas, a few weeks ago, said that the door was open and would never be closed, and while he made an amicable speech along those lines, immediately Senator Counihan's motion appeared in the newspapers he asked for cash down.  These things are rather remarkable, and they must not be passed over.</P>
    <P>Another remarkable point is that when this matter was debated in this House, it took several years to induce Senators to accept the arguments in favour of the retention of the annuities, while they were accepted at once by the British.  As soon as the question arose between the two countries and the money was not sent over, they were asked to state what claim they could make to it. Did they set out all the preliminaries <Col N="179" /> about the 1920 Act and the Treaty and so on?  Not at all.  They dropped all that and practically admitted, by doing so, that we were in the right. They proceeded at once to find a better position for themselves and the first thing they did, about January 1922, and immediately after the Treaty, was to get a lot of Irish Ministers to England who could not at that moment have been expected to know very much about the rights or wrongs of that affair, being straight from having guns in their hands. They went over there to settle this difficult question and the British put forward a sort of temporary agreement by which they were to receive the annuities.  I may say that General Collins objected to that agreement but the others signed it.  He made a special plea that the annuities should be left out.</P>
    <P>That gave the British their first start and shortly afterwards, they issued Orders in Council on 30th April, 1922, by which they took charge of the annuities.  They found, however, that they were a bit late for that and that they had no right to issue an Order in Council on that date.  Later on, in 1923, they took another step.  They got some more Ministers over there or here&mdash;I forget which&mdash;to sign a new document.  That document was kept secret and it handed over the annuities to them as well as any other moneys available.  That document was kept secret for eight years and no one knew about it.  The curious part was that when this new scheme to get hold of the money was brought forward, the British, unfortunately for themselves, put their foot in another trap and were caught again, because it was found that it had not been passed by the Oireachtas and that any Bill, not so passed, had no validity in this country. We were not all very wise about that at the time but it has turned out since then that while the British meant to try to bind us to the settlement of one Minister over here without reference to the Oireachtas, it was totally illegal from the British point of view and that the British point of view is that any financial arrangement <Col N="180" /> made between the two countries must have the authority of the Oireachtas itself and not of an individual.  It has turned out that this is easily proved because several cases&mdash;one in Australia, another in England and a third in Newfoundland&mdash;were decided by the Privy Council on exactly the same basis, that no agreement made by a Minister is of any use unless passed by the Parliament of that country.</P>
    <P>Still we are being told, in spite of all those things, to go over again and try to make some arrangement.  Mr. Baldwin, whom I have already quoted, put another stop to proceedings on another occasion.  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come over and have a settlement over here but first pay us half a year's annuities, that is, £2,500,000 in cash, before you come near us.&rdquo;  Was that very agreeable?  Sir John Keane has spoken of the wonderful good nature the British Government has always shown to this country.  He lavished praise on them for being so good and so kind to us and for offering at any time to settle matters and stating that the doors were always open.  Was Mr. Baldwin's demand for £2,500,000 before we looked at them a very good thing? Was it a good thing for him to reject the proposal of the Labour Party to have two representatives from both sides to examine the question?  I think you will find it very hard to regard these things in that way.  One of the objections they put forward was that they objected to an international committee. Why did they object?  They objected because they wanted to have another Feetham Bill settlement.  They had a very nice arrangement previously. They brought over what they called a Dominion Judge to settle matters here and I suppose there is no one in this room who will not agree that the settlement come to was a scandal and a disgrace and in absolute opposition to the whole idea on which the Treaty was founded.  Before we go any further in this and before we come to any agreement on it, I should like to know what chance there is of not being met with demands for £2,500,000 and various other demands, and also whether we are prepared to surrender all our rights to the British <Col N="181" /> on the subject of the Privy Council and such things, as has been told to us by Ministers over there.  I suggest that Senators should apply themselves to those things and see what the results may be.</P>

      <P>This question has been discussed with great moderation except for the characteristic sally or two from Senator Gogarty.  What does Senator Sir John Keane's motion mean?  It means that a commission should be set up&mdash;to do what?  To do the very thing which is the principal business of the Cabinet of this country. For the greater part of my life we have been at loggerheads in one way and another with the inhabitants of an adjoining island.  At one time it was physical war, but now it is financial and economic war, and the conduct of that war is the business of the Cabinet of this country.  It is idle to say that this state of affairs, that the relations which exist between the people of this country and the people of Great Britain are not at the moment most unsatisfactory.  Mr. Thomas, the Minister whose function it is to deal particularly with this country, says in one town in England: &ldquo;Oh, the door is open to a friendly settlement.  That door will never be closed.&rdquo;  Then he says: &ldquo;It is desirable that these two islands which have been thrown up out of the bed of the ocean side by side should be in friendly relations.&rdquo;  Now, that is a very commendable speech and I think it deserves the commentary remark which Senator Sir John Keane passed upon it&mdash;that it really represented the patriarch keeping the room open for the prodigal child and killing the fatted calf.  Very well, but in the next town where Mr. Thomas made a speech he said: &ldquo;We are entitled to £5,000,000 a year and we must get our due.&rdquo;  That is what Mr. Thomas said.  As Senator Sir John Keane has suggested, he presented for us at one place the fatted calf, but I say that in the next town he gave us the cold shoulder.</P>

      <P>Well, it might be said that the reporters as a class are the most reliable men I have come across here, and when I use a euphemism of that kind I hope I am not to be taken literally.  However, that does not get rid of the essential question which has been raised here and calmly debated. There is an economic and financial war of great intensity proceeding between Great Britain and this country.  That is a war which has succeeded a physical encounter and if you throw your minds back 15 or 20 years you will find that it is the type of war which was suggested by Mr. Balfour in the midst of the bloody encounter we had in this country as being the most effective method of dealing with this country.  Now, how do we stand?  I am sure that Mr. Thomas knows as well as any member in this Seanad how we stand.  We can survive this war.  We can go on, with difficulties of course, with privations perhaps, and in the end a state of things will exist which will not be good for this country or for Great Britain.  We will settle down alien peoples to each other.  I do think that Senator Sir John Keane unintentionally misrepresented what the President said two days ago.  As I read it the President said: &ldquo;The farming community in all countries is suffering.  The farming community in this country is not worse off than the farming community in America or in other countries which might be named.&rdquo;  He admitted at the same time that the farmers in this country <Col N="183" /> are suffering somewhat more by reason of the economic war which is going on. I carefully read what the President is reported to have said, and I do not think he misrepresented the state of affairs in the slightest degree.</P>

      <P>If I might be permitted to interrupt I should like to say that I have got the quotation here now and it does bear out what Senator Comyn said.  According to the <i>Irish Press</i> the President said: &ldquo;One hears a great deal about the position of the farmers as the result of the economic war with Great Britain.  In common with agriculture in all countries, our farmers are suffering from the world depression and low prices of primary products.  That is the real cause of the present condition of affairs, though I admit that the economic war has been an added factor.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Well, I think that is true also, because in some other countries agriculture was not in the same sound and healthy condition that it was in this country.  I am sure I will not be contradicted by Senator Miss Browne or by anybody else when I say here positively and categorically that we have in this country the best farmers in the world, and that is the reason we have not suffered so much.</P>

      <P>I hope that this great industry, the greatest industry in this country and an industry that ought to be the greatest in every country, will survive.  That is my hope&mdash;that it will survive without suffering very much <Col N="184" /> more than it has suffered up to the present.  The farmers, especially the larger farmers, have sustained considerable loss.  The smaller farmers, I think, also have sustained loss.  Put against that the change that has taken place in the system of agriculture. Tillage has been encouraged. Industries ancillary to agriculture have been encouraged.  Indeed, your attention was called to the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce made a very hopeful speech so far as it related to the matters within his special province.  We are suffering somewhat but we will survive.  I think that is stating the case fairly enough so far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the question now from the side of Great Britain.  She is a powerful nation with one-fourth of the surface of the earth under her flag.  Perhaps she will not feel this conflict with a small country very much at the moment, but, in my opinion, this conflict with Ireland will cause an ultimate loss and an ultimate injury even to that powerful nation much greater than the loss and injury that will be caused to us. Senator Sir John Keane has said that this dispute is in many ways unsatisfactory and that it is a dispute that ought to come to an end.  I suppose it will come to an end some time, but I was surprised to see in the speeches of Senators that there was not a thorough appreciation of what, in my mind, the dispute is.  What is the dispute between these two countries?  I should say, as Senator Colonel Moore indicated, that the dispute originated in the dismemberment of this country. Is it a dispute about the land annuities?  I say positively, categorically, and with full knowledge, although I know nothing about the Cabinet of this country, that the dispute between Great Britain and the Irish Free State has nothing whatever to do with the land annuities.  I am disclosing no Cabinet secrets.  I know nothing about what happens in the Cabinet.  Any person reading the public Press for the last two or three years must know full well what the dispute is about, especially if he is a lawyer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> Senator Sir John Keane called attention to what Mr. Thomas said.  In one place the public Press informed us that Mr. Thomas stated that Great Britain is entitled to certain payments from this country, Senator Douglas asked me whether I believed what Mr. Thomas is reported to have said.  I do not believe what he is reported to have said, and I positively assert that the British are not&mdash;and those of them who count know it&mdash;entitled to one penny of these annuities, and they will never argue that with anybody who understands the question.  On that basis of fact I would like the Seanad to discuss the question.  Let the Seanad now discuss the question.  We do not seek warfare or conflict with any nation.  We know the disadvantages to us of conflict with Great Britain.  We know that while the doors are closed to our people across the Atlantic they are left open across the Irish Sea.  We admit all that.  Still we say that we are entitled to our rights in regard to these land annuities.  No Englishman of standing &mdash;and there are plenty of them in England&mdash;who knows the situation will venture to discuss or debate the question of the land annuities with any man in Ireland who knows the question.  It is just as well that the people of this country, and the people of Great Britain also, should know where they stand, because if they know where they stand, perhaps we have taken the first step towards the full consideration of the case, and, of course, when the case is fully considered, it must be expected by reasonable people, that a settlement is not far off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to listen to the speech of Senator Keane, because when I saw his motion I thought it was put down, perhaps, by agreement with the Government.  The motion seems to accept all the Government's arguments, and merely asks them to carry on their policy with a little more thoroughness.  I do not think we can&mdash;and I was glad to notice that Senator Sir John Keane did not&mdash; go any distance in that direction.  We cannot take the view that our external markets are gone for good, or that they are going to disappear, and that <Col N="186" /> we have only to consider how best and most quickly we can become entirely self-dependent here.  There is no doubt at all that in some respects modern invention may make self-sufficiency rather easier.  There are new synthetic substances, new ways of producing necessities that were not produced in a country before, but complete self-sufficiency is something that only countries bigger than the Saorstát and more richly endowed with natural resources, can achieve.  At any rate, only such countries can achieve self-sufficiency without reducing the standard of living to absolutely primitive levels.  The Saorstát is a very small area relatively.  It has comparatively little in the way of minerals.  It is unable by reasons of climate to produce many things that are necessities, if we are to live as the peoples of other countries in Europe live, and as the people of all civilised countries tend to live.  That is one aspect of it.  If we are to continue to live along the lines that the people of modern civilised countries live, there are very many things that we must import, that we cannot produce at present, and that we are not likely to be able to produce. In some respects inventions or discoveries may ease the position but, broadly speaking, we have to get our requirements in iron, coal and other metals.  We have to bring in rubber, petrol, cotton, and for a long time&mdash; perhaps for ever&mdash;large quantities of timber, as well as cocoa, tea, coffee, materials for artificial manures and many sorts of machinery.  In fact, we are always going to have to import very large quantities of machinery, and the only way in which we are going to be able to pay for these things that are necessities, if we are not to sink to a primitive standard of living, is by exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As matters stand, it is not likely that we are going to be able to export substantially to any other countries than Great Britain.  Not only must we export, and export, apparently, to Great Britain, but the fact is, that there is as large a market there as we need. The figures of British imports of foodstuffs are perhaps irrelevant, because in the £300,000,000 worth imported <Col N="187" /> annually, there are many items included which we could not supply, which are not produced here.  Never-the less, of the things that we do produce, if we can export, the British require what we may regard as illimitable quantities, more, in any case, than we will need to export.  What is the sense at the moment in setting up commissions to make inquiries into how we are going to live without markets unless we make up our minds to lower our standard of living and to do without markets? What we should make up our minds about is this: that the people of this country are entitled to live as well as the people of any other country and to try to maintain for them the highest standard of living by developing resources and manufactures here, in so far as these resources can be exploited and the manufactures developed, and to do it on the other side by carrying on, on the most favourable basis, the trade it is necessary to carry on.  Complete self-sufficiency is complete lunacy or imbecile talk. The United States of America may become self-sufficient, and by the progress of invention may enable its people, without imports or external trade, to maintain the standard of livelihood that exists there.  We would have to go back to a standard of living that existed generations ago and to force our people to endure greater labour, greater hardships, and to suffer disease and privation, that would come from want and impoverishment if we were to abandon the notion of having an adequate import trade, which can only be financed by an adequate export trade.  We should develop the foreign market we have, the only one of any importance at the present time.  I take it that the amendment is really in favour of developing that foreign market and meeting the situation along that line.  I do not suppose the proposer of the amendment wishes to stick very rigidly to the machinery suggested in it.  I do not think we could hope to get along very far by means of that kind.  It is really a question of the Government itself entering into negotiations with the <Col N="188" /> British Government, with a view to settling the present difficulties, and with a view to making any arrangements that may be for the mutual advantage of the two countries.</P>
    <P>The land annuities question has been mentioned, and it has been pointed out by some Senators that, in fact, the land annuities are not being retained. At this stage I do not want to cover any ground that might arise in connection with the land annuities, but it is obvious to any person who will look at the matter impartially and sensibly that the difference is one to be settled by compromise.  We may hold&mdash;which I do not&mdash;that the British have no legal claim to the annuities.  On the other hand, it is quite evident that the British Government are not prepared to accept the attitude taken up by the Government here.  A struggle is going on which is improverishing the people of this country, and which is going to impoverish them further.  Undoubtedly it is causing loss to the people of Great Britain, and it is bound to cause them further loss, so that it is to the interests of both people&mdash;not the people of the Saorstát alone&mdash;that a compromise should be reached and a settlement made.  But the thing is taking a much wider aspect than a mere dispute about the land annuities, because we have the development of a new policy in Great Britain.  The development of that new policy is proceeding without our taking advantage of the opportunities that we have had, and that we still have, by rather allowing it to shape itself in such a way as to do the utmost damage to this country.  I think it is common ground that if our Ministers at Ottawa had the courage, or had been given authority, or if they were not afraid of, or were not held by people who would not make any settlement, or take advantage of any opportunities, that they could have made a good arrangement&mdash;a beneficial arrangement for this country.  With regard to our place in the British market, although the best arrangement that could have been made for this country is now lost forever, it is still possible to see that our position is to some extent saved.  It is still possible to <Col N="189" /> negotiate with the British before the policy on the other side has hardened, and before vested interests have been created.  Before we have put ourselves permanently on a lower plane than we need be from the point of view of commercial advantage, we should negotiate.  We should see that, in the interests of this country, full advantage is taken of our position.  As has already been pointed out, the trade of the Irish Free State with Great Britain is a big trade.  It is a valuable trade to Great Britain.  It is a trade which British negotiators must take into account in the course of any negotiations.  If you look at it from the political aspect, I think that we ought to take advantage of the constitutional relationship between the two countries.  In the past the relations of Great Britain with Ireland have been fraught with nothing but evil for the Irish people.  Through generations our people have suffered attack, massacre, robbery and despoliation.  Now the relationships of the two countries give us an opportunity to get more advantageous terms in the British market than, say, people whether from Denmark, Holland or any other country.  If the people in the past have had to suffer and lose because of the relations of the two countries, it is only common sense to say that now, when the constitutional relations that exist at the moment give us an opportunity of gaining, that the Government here should exploit that position, and see that we do gain the most that we can gain economically for the people in order to enable them to live on a better standard and with less difficulties than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk here about industrial development. Industrial development is extraordinarily handicapped at the present moment by the shrinkage of agricultural purchasing power.  We have had enormously high tariffs imposed on almost every conceivable class of goods. The employment that has resulted from these tariffs and the industrial development that they have caused has been nothing like what it ought to have been, having regard to the high tariffs and the burdens that they have <Col N="190" /> imposed on the consumer.  Every development by means of tariffs means some burden on the consumer.  With the aim of creating new sources of productive power we have had the burdens, but we are not getting anything like a commensurate increase in productive power.  The cause of that is that our basic industry, agriculture, is almost bankrupt.  If we had not this condition of affairs in relation to agriculture you would neither need such high tariffs nor such high burdens, and you would be able to get much more employment and more speedy and sounder development than is taking place at the moment.  As some Senator pointed out, if the impoverishment of agriculture continues it can only mean that industries that are now promising will be crippled.  They may not collapse or die out, but they will not reach the development that they ought to reach.</P>
    <P>The position on the whole will be, if a settlement is not made, that we will continue our trade with Great Britain, as we must continue it, under the most disadvantageous circumstances.  We will continue it with those tariffs and other levies and with quotas arranged without any regard to our interests. That is a quite unnecessary condition of affairs.  We will continue it with the farming community getting poorer and poorer, and in a year or two, as must be perfectly clear now, with enormous new burdens of taxation.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear that whatever may be done in the way of collecting rates this year it is going to prove impossible to get in rates next year. Consequently, in order that the public services may be maintained it is going to be necessary for the Government to undertake new burdens and give new grants for the maintenance of those services.  The difficulties about collecting the annuities is obviously the same as in the case of the rates so that we are going to have all those difficulties with new taxes added.  If we assume a policy of high tariffs, the industrial development that would be almost automatic is either going to be prevented or is going to be dwarfed in such a way as to provide no real advantage to the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>After the excellent speech that we have had from Senator Blythe I do not propose to delay the House.  Still I am of opinion that the voice of the practical farmer, who has to depend on agriculture for a living, should be raised every time that this question comes before us.  With regard to the motion and the amendment, I wish to support both, with certain reservations, and on the same lines as Senator Blythe indicated.  I do not believe that the British market is gone forever, nor do I think that it would be gone for any length of time if our Government did the honest thing.  I do not think that a joint commission would settle the matter.  There is no necessity for that.  The door is still open if the Government is prepared to do the honest thing.  I listened to-day to three of the weakest, the most laboured and the most futile speeches, that I ever heard in an attempt to bolster up the Government's policy. We had speeches from Senator Dowdall, Senator Moore and last but not least, Senator Comyn with all his heroics.  I suggest that speech would be more suited to a cross-roads meeting down the country.  The farmers, and the people whom it is trying to deceive, are quite wide-awake to all that the Government is doing.  The three Senators who spoke might as well be whistling jigs to a milestone as trying to get the farmers to believe their arguments.  The farmers in the last year or two have learned a great deal.  They have learned almost all that they want to know about this so-called economic war.  They have been struggling along for the last two years. Those who had any little reserves lived on them during the first year of the economic war, while those who had no reserves are to my own personal knowledge in a state of absolute poverty and hardship.  I have seen it and I know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a tillage county.  If tillage could be made to pay, then it would be made pay there more than in any other county I know, because the people there have a long tradition of good tillage methods.  Senator Comyn trotted out the old argument again to-day: &ldquo;Why not have tillage <Col N="192" /> and do away with the cattle trade?&rdquo; Could one expect to hear such a statement outside of a lunatic asylum?  I felt ashamed having to listen to it. The fattening of cattle depends on tillage. Tillage cannot exist without the fattening of stock.  The position of the fat-stock industry at the moment is a terrible one.  I need not go into it. Everyone knows about it.  Senator Comyn said that this country can survive.  If this economic war goes on for another year there will be a totally different position in this country to the position we have now.  It will be far worse than it is at the moment.  If we had 10,000 more industries than we have, it would not make a bit of difference so far as the general outlook of the country is concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to our industries I believe the only ones that are really flourishing are those which were established by the late Government.  They were established on a proper basis after a full investigation had been made by the Tariff Commission.  The others are, I believe, on a foundation of sand bolstered up by high tariffs. We have been told over and over again that the farmers are getting a great benefit from the halving of the land annuities.  That may have made a little difference.  It has not been appreciable.  The rates are higher than ever they were, the Agricultural Grant has been withdrawn, so that all these disabilities more than neutralise the halving of the land annuities.  It is not going to make very much difference so far as the ultimate fate of the farmer is concerned.  If the present policy is continued the country cannot survive as a civilised country should. It will all end in chaos.  At the moment we have here the conditions which Communism requires, and these conditions have been created by the Government. That is the real danger as I see it.  People may not agree with me, but I say that is the position.</P>
    <P>There is not a farmer in the Free States who does not regard as a direct insult to his intelligence the statement made by the President of this State which appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> It is absolutely false to say that the farmers of this country are no <Col N="193" /> worse off than the farmers in other countries.  Nobody believes that statement. I would like to support the motion and the amendment in a general way.  I should like to see the amendment amended so that we could give it our wholehearted support. The statements of Senator Dowdall astonished me, coming as they did from a man of his business capacity.  I think it was he who referred to the chilled meat coming from the Argentine. As long as I can remember, and I am not very young now, the Argentine has been sending chilled meat into the British market.  The British people were as inclined to use it 20, 30, 40 years ago as they are now.  Irish produce held its own against all comers in the British market by reason of its quality.  The policy of the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Hogan, was the right one, because it was quality that he aimed at all the time; to produce better stuff and more of it than we were doing before, to beat all comers by the excellence of the produce that we sent to the English market.  That was the right policy to pursue, and it was because of it that we held such a firm position in the British market. The figures published in this morning's papers with regard to the trade of the country are absolutely staggering.  In no sphere of agricultural production have more terrible hardships been felt than in the sale of the Christmas turkeys this year.  We paid in tariffs on that item alone £125,000. The value of our eggs has gone down by nearly £1,500,000.  These are staggering figures, and nothing in the policy of the present Minister for Agriculture can compensate for the loss.  Providence favoured the Government last year in their wheat policy.  One wet year will finish it&mdash;such a year as we had in 1927 and 1928.  A succession of wet years will absolutely bankrupt any farmer who tries the growing of wheat.  I shall not go over the question of beet growing again, because I spoke at great length on it when the Bill was before the House.  People are not a bit enamoured of these schemes.  I know farmers who are trying to take advantage, particularly, of the wheat scheme.  They are keeping no cattle and using no farmyard <Col N="194" /> manure.  In five years their farms will not feed a snipe.  What are good farms now will be waste.  Every farmer knows that, in cases of wheat growing, plenty of farmyard manure is a necessity. The farmer who continues to grow wheat for any length of time without using plenty of farmyard manure will only turn his farm into a waste.  I know farmers who are doing that at present.  They are like the people whose philosophy is &ldquo;Let tomorrow take care of itself; we will get the most for the moment.&rdquo;  They know that they are going down.  They are trying to keep the tide out with a brush.  It is absolutely criminal for the Government to continue its mad, reckless course.  Senator Blythe gave us a very able statement, which I hope the people of the country will appreciate fully, as I am sure we, in this House, appreciate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Connolly) Joseph Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, in the first place, to express my satisfaction at the tone of this debate in contrast with the tone of some of the debates we have had on similar subjects.  The issue has been dealt with on a wider basis than has been our experience. Senator Keane's motion does indicate, for the first time from the Opposition Benches, that there is such a thing as an economic crisis throughout the world, and that that economic crisis is peculiarly concentrated on the agricultural side of production.  It is not solely concentrated there but, in the main, the collapse of the economic system&mdash;because that is what we are living through&mdash;has been largely due to the fate of the agriculturist in every country.  The difference, between this country and other countries in facing the peculiar circumstances that are world-wide to-day is that it has been practically impossible to get recognition of the fact that a serious collapse has taken place all over the world and, secondly, that, for propagandist reasons, in the Press, in speeches and in every statement that was made on the subject, the whole responsibility for our present economic difficulties was attributed to the fact that an economic conflict existed between Great Britain and ourselves on a <Col N="195" /> matter of right, justice and principle.</P>
      <P>Senator Blythe, in what I believe is his maiden speech in this House, referred to the difficulties in this country and to the handicaps which face us in regard to the development of self-sufficiency.  We are quite conscious, as everybody must be conscious, of the limitations that are forced upon the people of this country.  We are quite conscious of the undeveloped state of the country from the industrial point of view.  We know the natural reasons for that, and we know the unnatural reasons which, as Senator Blythe knows as well as anybody here, are largely to be found in the historical association of this country with Great Britain.  We recognise our limitations in resources&mdash;mineral resources and the rest.  The argument of Senator Blythe is that, because of these factors and these limitations, there is no hope of progress or prosperity to any worthwhile extent in the industrial field and no use in attempting anything approaching self-sufficiency.  We realise that this country is not likely to produce tea or coffee or oranges or exotic fruits, but we realise also that it is possible to secure a greater measure of production in agriculture than has ever been attempted in the past.  The Senator's argument is, in my opinion, completely invalidated by the fact that the full measure of the collapse and the full blast of the economic frost have struck the countries that were most highly developed and had the greatest resources.  If Senator Blythe's premises and arguments were sound, then there is no reason why there should have been 14,000,000 people unemployed at one time in the United States.  They, of all countries, should have had all the natural resources that they needed.  They had highly developed and efficient organisation, they had efficient machinery production, they had resources of credit unknown in history, and they had the most highly-skilled technicians in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to seek reasons for the crisis through which the world is passing, we have got to look beyond <Col N="196" /> all the factors which the Senator mentioned. We have got to look beyond the problem of natural resources.  We have got to look beyond efficient machine-production and we have got to look beyond organisation.  If this House realises what has happened and, what is happening, this debate will be productive of much good.  What has happened is: the machine has got out of control.  It has got out of control in a perfectly comprehensible way, because it has been used purely for the exploitation of human beings and largely for exploitation on imperial lines such as we have suffered from ourselves.  We have heard a great deal of talk about economic matters everywhere during the last, couple of years.  Rightly or wrongly, I am convinced that we are steadily approaching a position where the balance of imports and exports will be evened.  The only conditions I can see emerging from the present situation are those in which there will be an exchange of equal values if not of actual commodities.  Countries will trade on a monetary basis, if you will, but they will only purchase according to the amounts of the exports to the particular country with which they are dealing.  The arrangement will be on what our American friends call a &ldquo;fifty-fifty&rdquo; basis.  I can see no other possibility from what I know existed and from what I know exists to-day. There are antagonisms everywhere in evidence on this question of the balance of imports and exports.  We know that at present a revolution is going on in many countries.  We know that the greatest revolution in history is going on in the United States. Senator Counihan speaks of the position in this country.  Senator Miss Browne follows suit.  They picture a situation in which we are drifting to ruin, in which bankruptcy is staring us and in which the collapse is being precipitated by the action of this Government.  Let us look at the facts.  We know that in the United States they do not hope to balance the Budget until 1937 or 1938.  We know that borrowing is going on until it has reached really astronomical heights&mdash; to a figure which we can hardly con <Col N="197" /> ceive.  We know that these things are happening in this highly developed country, in this country which has so much efficiency and so many resources at its disposal, simply because a very big man is handling a very big situation. His dictum is that humanity comes first.  If we realise that it is the kernel not only of our problem but of the problem everywhere else in the world.</P>
    <P>It is argued here that the cattle trade is the be-all and end-all of Irish existence and that without that trade this country will go on the rocks.  I should like to speak dispassionately on this business, so far as I can.  I do not want to upset the tone of the debate.  We have had a great deal of the ranching and cattle-raising business in this country. I submit that that system could not have been continued, from the human point of view.  The population of this country would not have stood for it but for the fact that you had an exodus of 30,000 a year.  If those 30,000, who included some of the best young blood in this country, had been retained that element would not have tolerated the bullock on the land so long as it did.  It may be argued that the tillage production we aim at requires a certain number of cattle.  I am not an experienced farmer.  The Minister for Agriculture is here and will deal with such points as that.  I should like to point out, however, that Holland, which has no economic conflict with Britain, has decided on the extermination of 200,000 head of cattle in 12 months.  We have this consolation in this country: certain agricultural products necessary for this country have not been produced up to the present here.  We can proceed to produce them.  The situation in America and other countries has been entirely different.  They have been developed to their limits in agriculture as in every other industry and, at present, they are ploughing into the soil one-third of the wheat crop and one-third of the cotton crop.  Denmark and the United States have also taken steps to reduce the pig population, and the dominating note of the London Conference was to reduce production and increase prices.  These are the <Col N="198" /> circumstances under which we live and these are the circumstances under which this Government has got to set about the changing of the whole economy of the country.  I am not for a moment disputing the fact that in agriculture, in the cattle trade and in all industries at present, we are going through a difficult period but I say that our difficulties are less than those of other countries.  I point to another fact&mdash;that in every transition period&mdash; the period of change-over from one set of circumstances or type of trade to another&mdash;difficulties are created that are not inherent in the position itself. We feel, and the country feels, that the drift has been too long in the one direction.  We are endeavouring, because of the circumstances, to change the whole position over-night.  I am perfectly satisfied that the change is necessary, even though it is carried through at considerable inconvenience and loss for the time being.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that in spite of all the talk there has been about economic hardships and the rest, our budgetary position is still sound; that our financial position is still sound and that the reflex we have got from the bankers' meetings and from the position of our reserves of credit and so on, show no tendency at all to bankruptcy. I feel that it is not fair to the country as a whole to have this type of statement made, indicating that we are drifting towards bankruptcy.  We have difficulties in front of us and these difficulties will have to be surmounted, but to suggest that we are in anything like a difficult position at the present time, or even in such a difficulty, is far from the facts.  Our social services have all been maintained and there is a further extension of social services necessary in this country.  We, on the question of the economic war, which has been dealt with at some length, are not beaten and we are not going to be beaten.  Whatever steps are necessary to maintain the people of this country and to adjust the economic life of this country to carry through that fight to a successful issue will be carried through by this Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan brings forward a suggestion which is purely a song of <Col N="199" /> defeat.  The song of defeat is not felt by the people of this country.  There is at the present time an economic dispute going on between France and Great Britain.  It looks pretty acute at the moment.  Is there anyone in this House who would suggest that in the deliberative assembly or in the legislative assembly of either France or Great Britain songs of defeat would go up while Ministers were carrying on an economic fight?  I suggest that that is defeatism of the worst type, and while we are open to criticism and are fairly tolerant, under even abuse, we do feel that in a national fight of this issue, the nation ought to stand together.  We have our responsibilities as a Government; Senators have their responsibilities and the people have theirs, and we will get nowhere in this country irrespective of what Government is in power, unless it is generally agreed and admitted that we must all stand together to carry through any national issue in which we are involved.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to labour the matter further.  The technical side of it and the purely agricultural side of it will be dealt with by the Minister.  I would like, however, to finish on this note: That at no time have we sought or been anxious for a conflict with our neighbours on the other side.  People may sniff and sneer, but let the correspondence and discussions be examined and it will be found that at every time we have gone further to try to meet the position created by them and we have never refused to discuss anything that was reasonable.  What is the issue in essence?  The attitude taken up by His Majesty's Secretary for the Dominions, Mr. Thomas, and by the others over there, has been one of simply making us yield to the last degree.  The Premier, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, indicated that he would not discuss until we paid.  In every discussion they have insisted on their right to have this matter of the annuities considered by an inter-Commonwealth Tribunal.  That is an issue on which we will not give way, and that is the issue on which we stand to-day.  We are not at all despondent about the position throughout the country.  As I <Col N="200" /> say, we will have our difficulties, but with the co-operation of the people we will surmount these difficulties and we will not be defeated in the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>The motions before the House, in my opinion, deal with what is pre-eminently the most important issue before this country at the present time.  There is nothing of equal importance in the field at the present time, but with the usual fortune of motions, no matter how important the subject may be, they do not always command as full a House as Bills, which deal, perhaps, with subjects not anything like as important.  There is, of course, a great difference as between one and the other in the nature of the case.  I do not propose to add to the arguments on the detailed aspects of this subject, but to review for a minute or two what our actual attitude to this motion and amendment should be.  The issue before us in that matter is whether we are to believe that the present economic state of the country is no worse than is inevitable, that is to say, that from the Government's point of view, there is nothing to worry about; that it is quite all right; that nobody is to blame or whether we are to take the view that it is unnecessarily bad and, further, largely as bad as it is through the action of our own Government.  That is the issue.  There are many in this House who are not blinded by party spirit who believe and are convinced that this policy, which started with the non-payment of the annuities and has developed into an economic war&mdash;and nobody denies that it is an economic war, and a very serious thing&mdash;is the prime cause of our troubles&mdash;not the only cause of all the troubles but the great dominant factor.  We believe that.  What ought people who believe that do in a case of this kind?  Motions are always laughed at, one knows.  Anybody can pass a motion but still, the question is whether you ought to pass a motion or whether you ought not.  I think we ought to pass one or other of these motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Counihan's motion is complementary to that of Sir John Keane's, and, I think, hits the nail more practically on the head.  It is the one which <Col N="201" /> I would prefer.  We cannot reverse the policy of the Government, but if we have a subject like this before us, and if we talk about it, the whole afternoon and pass no motion, all I can say is that if we accept the policy of saying that everything is quite all right and that we are going to come out on top, it would be bad.  Everybody and everything are to blame except ourselves and our Government, and the policy they have adopted.  We know quite well that that is disguise, and that we are going down hill and that we are going down hill at a headlong rate.  Both Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Counihan hold that the primary cause of that is the loss of the British market which has been lost to a very great extent.  All sorts of arguments have been put up to make the House believe that whatever the evils in the present position are, they would have happened anyhow, and all countries are in a very bad way, and that we are in no worse a way than any other; but the distinction which I would draw between the serious economic position of this country and the serious economic position of a great many other countries that have been mentioned is that we have thrown our prosperity away, and thrown away our chances of having to suffer only a moderate degree of lack of prosperity voluntarily.  They have been thrown away for us, and the best thing to do is to try to get them back, and that is why I think we ought to pass Senator Counihan's amendment. A great deal of what I think I am justified in describing as political camouflage has been let off here this afternoon, and all sorts of red herrings have been produced.  Colonel Moore talked about the British Government getting into a trap.  If any Government has got into a trap, our Government has.  We are suffering for it&mdash;we Irishmen here in this country.  Nobody is more responsible for that than Colonel Moore, and I hope he is wondering whether his policy was really the right one, because it certainly has not brought much prosperity yet.</P>
    <P>The economic war is for the Cabinet to deal with.  That is the argument which has been used this afternoon but surely our Government is our own <Col N="202" /> Government, that is to say, the Government exists for the people and not the people for the Government.  If the Government made a mistake, if they have made a mistake of such a character that everybody is going to be much poorer and a good deal of unnecessary misery and suffering is going to take place, is it not right that we should draw attention to it and show that we do not all agree with that policy or that it will all work out all right in the end?  I think we ought to show it and the only way we can do it, unfortunately, is by passing a motion.  One extraordinary statement has been made and it is that the decision on the annuities had nothing to do with the economic war.  That is a most amazing statement, and all I can say is that that is how it strikes me and, I think, everybody in the House.  I certainly do not agree with it.  Senator Connolly has pointed out that the United States, to mention one country, with its great resources and, hitherto, an enormously prosperous country, is in a very bad way and that, therefore, we need not worry about the bad way we are in, but I would point out&mdash;and in these difficult times in the world, there is, of course, a very great deal of difference of opinion amongst experts&mdash;that so far as any reasonable person is able to read the newspapers and to get good information about what is going on in the different parts of the world, while things are getting better in Great Britain and in the United States&mdash;I need not go into all the others&mdash;here we know that they are getting worse.  That is the difference, and it is a very important difference, and I do not think that we ought to be satisfied with the present state of affairs.  I believe that it is largely the fault of the adoption of the State policy and that it could be cured and that we could get into a much better position again.  Therefore, I hope that these motions are not going to be withdrawn.  As I say, I prefer Senator Counihan's amendment and I shall vote for it.  I think there is no difference of opinion between the two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands and Fisheries and a couple of his supporters, <Col N="203" /> Senator Dowdall and Senator Comyn, entered into this discussion in the spirit of that American slogan &ldquo;Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?&rdquo;, but while the Minister and his colleagues are engaged in making political whoopee and indulging in a kind of economic jazz, we must not forget that a vast number of the people of this country are facing the prospects for the future in the spirit of another American slogan much less exhilarating, which was something like this &ldquo;Brother, can you spare a dime?&rdquo;.  I think that Senator Counihan's amendment, which I am supporting, expects too much of the Government.  It expects the Government to perform a miracle.  In other words, it expects the Government to forget themselves for a little while and to think of the people.  It expects the Government to refrain from further fantastic venturings into the blunderland of wearied egoism, and to get down to a sane facing of the realities of life in this State in such a way as will procure solvent and sane progress.  I say that, in expecting that from the present Government we are expecting them to perform a miracle which, great as they are in their own esteem at least, in mine they are not gifted with the faculty of performing.  During the last few days&mdash;on last Monday to be exact &mdash;I came across one grain of consolation. I found it in the journal of the Government, the <i>Irish Press.</i>  In that journal I read this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It takes only half a peanut to provide enough energy for a normal person to engage in intense mental effort for one hour.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an item of information which occupied not as much prominence as the President's statement but which is, I think, of even more importance, because it may possibly form the basis of a theory on which the salvation of this country can be achieved.  On this basis of half a peanut per hour, a dozen peanuts and a glass of light beer ought to be sufficient to sustain the average man for a day.  In other words, a dozen peanuts a day will keep depression <Col N="204" /> away.  I do not know whether the Minister who is now present can throw any light on whether or not this potential plant or vegetable is grown in the Free State but if so, in view of the importance of this statement, I hope he will take into consideration the desirability of coupling the compulsory growing of peanuts with the compulsory growing of wheat in the near future.</P>
    <P>We have listened to a dissertation from the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to-day and, having, so to speak, delivered a sermon from the mountain of his aloofness, he disappeared and left us to digest his message.  I never listened to a discourse on what I might call world ethics and universal economic morality so detached from the realities of life here as that which the Minister for Lands and Fisheries made to-day.  He wandered all over the earth.  He seems never to have read that old adage which says that the eyes of the fool are on the ends of the earth.  Because he found in that world-wide survey that there were difficulties that other peoples had to encounter he drew the conclusion that therefore we can only regard these present difficulties of ours as a kind of visitation of Providence and he appealed to us to stand together in order to win out.  I want to take definite issue on that point.  There has been to-day, by more speakers than the Minister for Lands and Fisheries&mdash;by Senators Comyn and Colonel Moore&mdash; an assumption that their attitude on the land annuities is accepted as accurate. I say that in its beginnings when the theory of the present Government was first propagated by Senator Colonel Moore and subsequently endorsed by Senator Comyn and several of his legal brethren I dissented from their point of view.  I say that for every learned counsel that could be produced to support the theory of Senator Comyn and his legal brethren I could produce a dozen equally learned K.C.s to take the opposite view.  There is no infallibility about the attitude of the present Government on this point.  There is, I believe, a big fundamental blunder in it, and it is to perpetuate that blunder that the Minister for Lands and <Col N="205" /> Fisheries asked us to stand together and, probably, to expire together.</P>
    <P>Seeing that the economic war has been spoken of so much to-day, I should like to know from the Minister when he is replying, as I think he is probably the most responsible speaker on the other side, is the economic war still on or is it won or is it lost?  I think it is very pertinent to know that. On January, 7 1933, the present Minister for Finance, in Bantry, used these words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It must be clear to everyone interested in the country that the Free State had won the economic war, and the victory, he thought, everyone of them would admit, had been achieved with the minimum of hardship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in January of 1933.  Eight months later, after that announcement had been made that the war had been won and that victory had alighted on our banners, the President, speaking in Dundalk, used such phrases as: &ldquo;If we are beaten,&rdquo;&ldquo;If we win the war&rdquo; and so on; so that, evidently, the war was on on the 10th September, 1933. Another great statesman, Deputy Maguire, speaking still later at Carrick-on-Shannon on the 21st of this month said: &ldquo;Our war has gone on for two years and I rejoice to say that we have won and that England is beaten.&rdquo; About the same date, Deputy Moane said at Ballyhaunis: &ldquo;If the people stood loyally together this year it does not matter whether the economic war was on or off; at the end of the year they would have won it.&rdquo;  To-day the latest pronouncement on this, as I might call it, peculiar kind of war was made by Senator Comyn, who said that a financial and economic war of great intensity is proceeding between Great Britain and the Free State.  They say that in a multitude of counsellors there is safety, but when there is such a multitude holding such diverse views on this matter the country is entitled to know where it stands and what is the position.</P>
    <P>We want to know what will be the factor which will tell us when the war has been fought and won.  I take it that this war was initiated to retain the <Col N="206" /> land annuities.  I take it that was the reason.  They have been retained. Does that mean that the war is won? If it is so, I am afraid that it looks as if it would have been much better if we had lost the war.  In any case, what ever be the present position, whether the war has been won or lost or whatever the winning of the war may mean, this, I think, is emphatically clear, that the war represents a situation into which the present Government blundered and fumbled without any idea of what the war was going to entail and what it would involve the people of this country in.  Certainly, judging by their own statements, there is no evidence that they looked at this matter with any kind of foresight or with considered judgment, because on December 13, 1931, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They had heard talk of destroying the English market.  Fianna Fáil had no intention of destroying that or any other market that would buy from them.  They would develop it to the fullest possible extent.  It was true that up to the present the British market was, virtually, their only outside market.  It was their natural market too, for Ireland bought in that market more than it sold in it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that statement in accord with the kind of apologies being sounded to-day by Ministers who are telling us to-day that the British market is a wasting asset.  I think that phrase was used by a speaker on the Government Benches to-day.  I think it was used by Senator Colonel Moore.</P>
    <P>The same Minister, at Navan, said: &ldquo;There could be no doubt that for a very long time to come trade with Great Britain would be of enormous importance to this country.  At present 90 per cent. of the goods we export go to the British market.  No matter how we may seek to revise the economic system in operation here the British trade will always play an important part in it and it would be a serious thing for the people of this country if whatever advantages that could be secured there are lost to it.&rdquo; Is that in accord with the outlook at <Col N="207" /> the beginning of this war?  Was it not clear from that statement that the Ministers never anticipated that the present impossible impasse would have occurred?  To drive home that, I produce the statement of the President in Wexford.  It is very striking and very extraordinary, and very illuminating on the point I am trying to make just now.  He said: &ldquo;There was no fear of falling out with England because Ireland was a better customer of England than England was of Ireland.  The ordinary trade relations will go on because trade does not take account of politics.&rdquo;  I am not quoting these statements for Party purposes.  I do not pretend that I am not a politician or that I am not taking a political view of the matter.  I do not see anything to be ashamed of in viewing these things from a political point of view, providing that the politics behind that point of view are at least honest and well intentioned; but I say that when you get statements like those at the initial stage of the struggle and contrast with them what that struggle has led to in this country you must realise what false counsellors and what incompetent leaders the heads of this Government have proved themselves to be to the Irish people and you can gauge from that how much weight should be attached to their counsels for the immediate future in this dispute between the two countries.  I want to make one point clear.  I am not standing here as one hostile to the policy of industrial development in this State. If I uttered one word that would tend to discourage such development I would be false to my own convictions, and false to my preaching for a number of years.  The test I apply to national economics is this: can agriculture absorb the natural growth of population in the State?  If not, how is it to be absorbed if it is not to be exported. You must have industrial development but the balancing of these complementary economic assets in the economy of this State by the present Government has been pursued by a method which could only be based on <Col N="208" /> something that might be read in &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland.&rdquo;  If we decide nationally&mdash;which I say was unnecessary&mdash;that this external trade is to be taboo, and that we should concentrate upon our home market for the consumption of our produce, unless we are lunatics we should proceed gradually and steadily until an increased population absorbed our maximum agricultural products.  What is the process of the present Government?  The very reverse.  They have suddenly and abruptly embarked on a plan dramatically to reduce the agricultural output, which will lead to a diminution of agricultural productivity, and to reduce the present population.  I say that that policy is sheer lunacy, and can only lead to a dwindling population, dwindling commerce, and to a lowering of everything worth while in any community. Radical changes are not confined to this country.  In his world survey I am sure Senator Connolly did not leave out the great Soviet Republic of Russia.  Importance may be always attached to Senator Connolly's pronouncements. According to Stalin, the Communist Leader, &ldquo;the example set by our Government has proved victorious and the face of the country has been changed from an agricultural to an industrial one.&rdquo;  I am thoroughly convinced, not only of the advisability but of the necessity of industrial development in this State, but, its natural place in Ireland, viewing the fundamental basic conditions of life here is that industrial life shall be an annexe of agricultural, and not the reverse.</P>
    <P>I do not view this question in the main aspects from the point of view put forward by Senator Sir John Keane and though he said many things that are undoubted truisms in trade, he also expressed many ideas which are obsolete and have been generally accepted as such in modern countries. The position we are confronted with is this, that a serious situation has arisen, which immediately affects the well-being of that section of the community which is the basis of our social economy, namely, agriculture.  We know that that situation has been directly the result of a certain conflict <Col N="209" /> which many of us believe was precipitated by the present Government in their handling of our relations with other countries.  At present it affects seriously that section of the community which forms the base of our social structure.  The effects are not going to remain there.  They are going to penetrate every strata of society, and if there is not an end the whole structure of society must inevitably come down in ruin and chaos.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan put forward a suggestion and a request that something should be done to put an end to this dispute before the country has been irretrievably ruined.  The response of the first speaker on the Government side, Senator Dowdall, was that he was surprised that the words &ldquo;hat in hand&rdquo; had not been inserted.  This is not a question of going hat in hand.  If there is any section of the community that should be thinking of going hat in hand anywhere, it is the present Executive Council, which should be going hat in hand before the constituencies, and asking pardon for an atrocious mishandling of the national affairs.  We, who are in opposition to the policy of the present Government, and who stand for something different in national and international politics, have no reason and no need to go hat in hand, either to our own people or to outsiders.  There is no suggestion, and no implication in the request that there should be any hat in hand procedure. I am sure Senator Counihan realises, as we all do, that this motion, even if passed, is hardly likely to be acted upon by the Government.  At any rate it gives us a peg on which to hang this discussion, to get publicity for our views and to urge the necessity of putting an end to this terrible situation that exists&mdash;wantonly exists.  We might add that if the present Government find themselves incapable of securing a solution, there is one source from which that solution can be secured, and that source is the people. If the Government reconcile themselves to the view expressed by the President, in his statement to the Press representatives last Saturday, that a <Col N="210" /> solution is impossible, then I say it is their bounden duty to place this matter once more before the people, if they have the courage to face the people, after a couple of years of alleged victory in a war that is still raging.</P>
    <P>Senator Colonel Moore gave us, amongst the fairy tales he recited, an idea of how attempts had been made to meet this dispute.  He spoke of British Ministers coming over here, and of Free State Ministers going to London, and asked what more could be done.  I will suggest what might be done.  Instead of Ministers of the Free State approaching the British in the spirit of dictation, if they approached them in the spirit of negotiation some progress might be made.  Never since Fianna Fáil came into power, and since the dispute was initiated, has there been any attempt at negotiation by the Government of this State.  There has not been what every average sane man regards as negotiation.  The idea of negotiation in the minds of Ministers and their supporters is that of dictation. I want to emphasise one thing. Speaking at Ballyconnell a few nights ago the Minister for Lands and Fisheries said: &ldquo;The truth is we have not lost a day in driving ahead with our programme.&rdquo;  If he had said: &ldquo;The truth is, we have not lost a day in driving the people either to the workhouse or to the madhouse since we came into power,&rdquo; then I think it would be much nearer to an accurate statement of facts.  In conclusion, I want to say that the matter we have been discussing to-day is too vital to the future of this country to be simply dismissed from our minds.  If the friendly suggestion tendered by Senator Counihan is spurned with scorn, if those gentlemen who, for the moment, are clothed with a little brief authority, think they are gifted with infallibility, and if they remain immune to remonstrance until the British surrender, then there will have to be found methods to change their tune.  I invite them to-day to take this issue to the country at the earliest possible moment, and to take the verdict of the people at the polls.  At the last general election they appealed to the country to return them to power and <Col N="211" /> that this question would be settled. Since they were returned to power they have not lifted a little finger to try to settle it.  I challenge them to go back to the people now, and to try to get the same mandate on the same terms. I venture to say that if they go back their victory will be something like the victory of the present Minister for Finance in Bantry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to swim through the sad waves of the economic war, but in a few words will confine myself to the amendment standing in the name of Senator Counihan.  Now I have a great deal of sympathy with Senator Counihan, and if he avails himself of every opportunity that he can get to point out the destruction of the cattle trade he is entitled to a great deal of forgiveness at my hands and I am sure at the hands of the majority of the members of this House, as it is very hard on a man like Senator Counihan to see melting, day by day before his eyes, the hard work of his life.  In saying that I want to add that in my opinion this amendment is a very injudicious one.  I am strengthened in that belief by this that it will, in my opinion, do harm instead of good.  It will encourage the British authorities to go on still persecuting this country by excessive tariffs.  I think it was Senator Sir John Keane who referred to the speech of Mr. Thomas in which he mentioned about the open door. Like Senator Sir John Keane, I am not quoting from memory.  I happen to have the quotation before me.  No one can find fault with the words in the quotation.  I knew Mr. Thomas in the past, and I am satisfied that what he said was sincere and that he meant it. The quotation is taken from the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  It is headed &ldquo;Door is still open.&rdquo;  I should mention that the speech was made at a social gathering in Birmingham on Saturday night, at the jewellers' dinner.  Without being uncharitable, one may make this comment: that men say things perhaps with a certain amount of sincerity after a good dinner which they regret the day after.  Mr. Thomas stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" />&ldquo;However much the estrangement between us may in recent months have been widened, I say on behalf of the British Government, we will not allow bitterness or prejudice of any sort or kind to blind us to the facts that the geographical ties between the Irish Free State and England are such that they ought to make them real friends.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure every member of the Seanad of every degree of thought will heartily agree with the sentiments expressed in that statement.  Why then the sudden change in the vision of Mr. Thomas?  I am forced to think that the amendment put down by Senator Counihan had a great deal to do with it because he stated the night after in the British House of Commons: &ldquo;Immediately the Irish Free State give an indication of their desire to meet their just obligations.&rdquo;  I have listened to the many speeches made here to-day with a certain amount of sadness.  I regret the gloomy and the sad pictures that were drawn of the destruction of the agricultural industry of this country.  I admit, and I regret it, that men big in the cattle trade have suffered.  I regret it, but has there ever yet been a war, let it be a bloody war or an economic war, in which some have not suffered and in which soldiers have not lost their lives? I am sorry, if it could be avoided, that the cattle trade of this country should have suffered so much, but I am not satisfied, and I am very much in touch with different parts of the country, that the pictures of economic and agricultural decay painted or portrayed by so many speakers here to-day are nearly as bad as they are painted.  Mr. Thomas said: &ldquo;When our obligations are fulfilled.&rdquo;  Almost every speech which was made from the left-hand side of the House to-day would seem to point out that it was this country that forced the fight.  I deny it.  The fight arose over the land annuities, the retaining here of the land annuities, which the present Government believe they are entitled to.  As an act of repression we have had these exorbitant tariffs put on the cattle trade by the British Government, <Col N="213" /> on the cattle trade of which Senator Counihan is such an illuminating, such a forceful and such a leading defender.  I put this position to any unprejudiced person in this country: The Government maintain&mdash;I am not a legal man&mdash;whether rightly or wrongly, that they are entitled to hold the land annuities.  The President with the responsibility attaching to his office stated only a day or two ago that the door is still open to England, and it is not a trap-door like the one that Mr. Thomas opened on Saturday night. The President stated emphatically&mdash;he has stated it all along as a fair-minded and honest man&mdash;that his Government are prepared to place the whole matter before an impartial tribunal.  Now I ask is there anything in the world fairer or squarer than that?  Owing to the promptings which I am afraid sometimes percolate from this country into the drawing-rooms of Downing Street, Mr. Thomas says: &ldquo;No; let their obligations be fulfilled.&rdquo;  Even if these obligations are fulfilled, what guarantee have we that these excessive tariffs will be taken off the cattle trade?</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane painted a glowing picture of the prosperity, the great wealth and the revival of industry and the getting back of trade that is going on in England, but on the other hand I have a little cutting in my hand which refutes that argument.  It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Farming is in a very bad state indeed.  Young cattle have been almost unsaleable and the prices for sheep and lambs continue at a very low level.  Had it not been for the good current harvest and the wheat quota system a great many farmers would now be in a desperate position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These words were used by the Chairman of Barclays Bank, Limited, in London, so that all the gilding is not on the gingerbread of England's great success.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, I am going to vote against this amendment.  I think it is injudicious.  I fear that the speeches that have been made here to-day will strengthen the attitude of the British Government towards this country.  But <Col N="214" /> there is an open door for the many Senators who have spoken in support of this amendment.  An opportunity is now given to them to buckle on their armour led by Senator Sir John Keane. I give the Knight the preference, Senator Counihan.  Senator Counihan, Senator Miss Browne, who always fights her corner well&mdash;I always admire her for it, although I do not always agree with her&mdash;and many other Senators of great importance on that side of the House, why not let them go unofficially to Mr. Thomas and tell him &ldquo;I think you are making a mistake. We in Ireland are as loyal, some of us, to the British Constitution as ever we were.  Why not now show your respect and your help to us; why not accept de Valera's proposition, and if you are not afraid why not let the whole matter be dealt with by an impartial tribunal?&rdquo;  If they had done that they would, in my opinion, have done a better day's work for Ireland than by making speeches here; they would have helped to steady the economic downfall, if you like.  Perhaps a little soft soap from our friend Senator Counihan whispered into the ear of Jim Thomas, as he is commonly called in England, would have more effect than amendments like the present one or than the speeches we have heard.  If they do that, then, as they say over the wireless, &ldquo;Good-night and God bless them and send them safely back to us.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The motion moved by Senator Sir John Keane is one that would commend itself to me if it requested the Executive Council to inquire as to the best method of absorbing the excess of agricultural produce for which an external market may no longer be available.  I am rather surprised that Senator Sir John Keane should ask to have another commission set up, although, in his speech he indicated that he envisaged a commission on which there would be no politicians.  I should imagine that the Executive Council are, and have been, inquiring into the best method of absorbing the excess of agricultural produce for which an external market may no longer be available.  If they <Col N="215" /> have not been doing so, I think they have been greatly negligent, because, whether the situation which has arisen since 1932 had occurred or not, it is evident to anybody who has studied the position underlying the present agitation and dispute that there would be need in any case to inquire into the best method of absorbing the excess of agricultural produce.  If one looks at the matter carefully and with a little detachment from political animus, one will see that that is not a matter which has arisen since 1932.  The statistics of agriculture, which have been circulated and which every Senator can refer to, show that since the beginning of this century and earlier&mdash;I shall not go further back than 1901&mdash;there has been a steady and consistent decline in the sources of agricultural wealth within this country.  In 1901, the cattle population of this State was about 3,867,000.  In 1931, before the present dispute had originated, the cattle population was 4,029,000.  That is a slight increase of about 170,000.  In the case of sheep, we have a decline from 3,891,000 to 3,575,000 during the same period.  In pigs, we have a slight increase, from 1,014,000 to 1,227,000.  The number of pigs varied considerably during that period.  The only considerable increase of live-stock population was in poultry, which rose from 14,000,000 to 22,000,000. Since the beginning of the agricultural policy of the late Government, there has been a steady decline in each of those types of live stock.  From 1923 to 1931, there is actually a decline of 250,000 head of cattle.  Let us turn to agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the figures for the Saorstát for both years.  They are official figures, quoted from year to year by the Department of Agriculture. Let us look at the question of tillage crops.  There was a decline in the area under corn crops, as between 1901 and 1931, from 924,000 acres to 763,000 acres.  In root and green crops, <Col N="216" /> there was a decline from 1,750,000 acres to 1,423,000 acres.  In hay, there was an increase from 1,757,000 acres to 2,281,000 acres.  Can one say that there was any prospect of a turn of the tide in respect of the basis of agricultural wealth in this country?  We are told frequently of the improvement in agricultural wealth during the years prior to 1931.  The one thing that saved agriculture in this country during those years was the increase in the prices of beef and dairy produce.  If there was a decline in production, there was an increase in the price and possibly an improvement in the quality.  For some years before the war and in the years after the war, there was a tendency towards rising prices.  Then what happened?  Take the year 1929.  I have here the British official market reports, which give the prices from 1929 onwards.  I suggest to Senator Counihan, and the other farmer Senators, that it would be well worth their while to examine these statistics if they wish to get a really detached and impartial view of the situation.  Taking the price of fat cattle as equalling 100 in 1929, in 1931, before the economic war, as it is called, had begun, the price had fallen to 92.  In 1933 it had fallen to 76. These are the prices for British fat cattle to British farmers in the British market.  From 1929 to 1933, they had fallen from 100 to 76.  These are the index numbers.  In respect of sheep, the price fell from 100 in 1929 to 70 in 1933.  The price of bacon pigs fell from 100 in 1929 to 64 in 1933; porkers from 165 to 66, butter from 100 to 62, and eggs from 100 to 66.  These are the chief products of Irish agriculture.</P>

      <P>Will the Senator give us the corresponding figures for the Irish Free State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with those in a moment.  Those figures show that for British farmers' produce of the kind and type produced by the Irish farmer there has been an all-round decline from 100 to 74 in these four years.  If we were to take wheat, barley, oats and potatoes, there were declines in some respects higher and in some respects lower, but nothing less than 20 per cent. and in one case of 46 per <Col N="217" /> cent.  I am taking, for the purpose of this argument, the classes of live stock and dairy produce which this country is in the habit of exporting to Britain. If we were in exactly the same position as the British farmer has been put into, there would have been that rate of decline&mdash;from 29 per cent. to 33 per cent.  That is an important fact.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan asked me what were the relative prices in the Irish market.  I have tried to make a detached estimate of the effect of this economic dispute on the receipts that Irish agriculturists, taken as a whole, would obtain from their output.  I had to assume that the produce of 1933 was equivalent in all respects to the produce of 1929.  There are variations and one has to make modifications but, for the purpose of this illustration, I am taking the year 1929 as the basis of analysis.  I take the returns published in the Census of Production for that year and I make the calculation that the difference between the prices actually obtained in the British market and those obtained in the Irish market for those goods sold by our farmers would have been as follows: In 1929, the gross output of agricultural produce was roughly £65,000,000.  There was consumed by non-agriculturists in the Saorstát and exported, produce to the value of £43,000,000 odd.  The market value of that same quantity at Saorstát prices in 1933 would have been £26,000,000.  The market value of that same quantity in the British market in 1933, taking the British index figure, would have been £32,000,000.  That is to say, the difference between actual Saorstát prices and actual British prices for the 1929 output of Irish agriculture would have been £6,000,000. The Senator will take that as being, at least, an attempt to estimate fairly the loss to Irish agriculturists owing to the difference in prices.</P>

      <P>I can get the prices but not the quantities of those specific items which were available for sale during 1933.  Those figures will come later but they are not available now. I leave others, if they so desire, to state what Irish agriculturists, taken as one firm, have lost and to assess the value of what has been attempted to be paid them or provided for them by way of recompense.  When that is done, some estimate can be made of the net loss to Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>The placing of duties upon Irish stock for the purpose, as Mr. Thomas alleges, of recovering the loss due to the retention of the annuities and other sums is a different question from that which has been more recently raised&mdash; the fixing of quotas for imports of live stock.  I cannot imagine that anybody looking on this question with some impartiality would think that even the agreement that Senator Counihan seeks to have obtained would bring about any solution of that particular question.  In this Agricultural Market Report, prepared and edited by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and dated 5th January of this year, there is a quotation from a statement made by the Minister for Agriculture in the House of Commons on December 20th, 1933, and it is evident from that statement that whatever the relations might have been with regard to a dispute or the absence of dispute, the policy of the British Government would have been to restrict the import of Irish fat cattle, store cattle and dead meat.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have had under consideration the position of the beef <Col N="219" /> industry in this country.  Notwithstanding the efforts that have been made since November, 1932, to hold and improve the situation on the wholesale meat market, the returns from the feeding of cattle have continued unsatisfactory.  Many United Kingdom feeders have kept back their stock from sale owing to the low level of prices, while supplies from other sources have been pressed on the market.  The number of home-produced fat cattle marketed this summer and autumn has thus been less than in the corresponding period last year.  The supplies held back are likely, however, to come forward at an early date, so that the immediate problem is now that of averting a further price decline as well as of bringing about an improvement in the situation.  In these circumstances, it is essential to afford some relief to the market in respect of supplies of cattle imported for immediate slaughter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall not go further in retailing this because most Senators probably read the speech when it was made but there is interpolated into this extract in this official journal, the figures of imports into the United Kingdom from the Irish Free State for the three months, January to March, 1933 as 46,000 odd head of fat cattle and 76,000 odd head of store cattle.  The figures with respect to the Dominion of Canada for the same three months of 1933 are given as 4,400 head of fat cattle and 2,400 head of store cattle. &ldquo;It was decided to limit imports of fat cattle from the Free State from now to 31st March to 50 per cent. of the numbers imported in 1932-33&rdquo;&mdash; they wanted to reduce the supply of fat cattle by 23,000 or 24,000 head and they wanted to reduce supplies of store cattle by some percentage and they persuaded the Canadian Government that not even they, with whom there was no economic dispute, would increase their supplies over the very small figure of 6,800 fat and store cattle altogether imported in 1933. There was, therefore, a definite policy, a definite decision, by the British <Col N="220" /> Government that whatever might have been the case as between the two Governments in respect of land annuities and other financial monetary disputes, there was necessity for the protection of the British agriculturists, who were fat cattle feeders, to reduce the supply of fat cattle by 25,000 head in those three months.  I am suggesting that that decision had nothing at all to do, therefore, with this dispute on the head of the land annuities and, consequently, if one takes into account the steady decline throughout this century, including the period since 1923, in the live-stock population of all kinds and in the tillage areas, combined with the rapid fall in the price of Irish live stock and dairy produce in the British market, some such proposal as Senator Sir John Keane puts forward&mdash;that the best method of absorbing the excessive agricultural produce from this country must be found&mdash;was necessary.</P>
    <P>We know that owing to the steady rise to which I have referred in the price of beef, meat and dairy produce in the years before 1929, nearly all the countries in the world, which are producers of primary commodities, had increased their supplies and were encouraging the export to the British market of those supplies.  The inevitable result is that the British agriculturist has had to secure some assistance. The British people, apparently, are following the British Government in saying that British agriculture must be saved and can only be saved by restriction of imports.  In these circumstances, some way must be found to absorb the excessive agricultural produce and I think, inevitably, to alter the course of Irish agriculture. I think it will be found that a good deal of attention will have to be paid to the change over from foodstuff crops to industrial crops, and I hope the Ministry is already inquiring into the best method for doing those things in the most economical way.  I am a little astonished to hear a Senator with the record of Senator Milroy speaking as he has spoken.  He is supporting this amendment of Senator Counihan's.  I happened to be reading to-day&mdash;I am sorry the Senator is not here&mdash;the propaganda <Col N="221" /> of the late Arthur Griffith and the speech that he made at the first annual convention of the National Council in 1905.  I should be surprised to hear that Senator Milroy was not present at that meeting, but the tone of that initial convention of Sinn Fein and the tone of this amendment of Senator Counihan's are very discordant indeed.  If Senator Milroy of that day or even of a much later day had been asked to support a motion of this kind&mdash;that the Government of the Free State should approach the British Government to be restored to the preference in the British market accorded the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;I think he would have spurned the suggestion with indignation because even this amendment of Senator Counihan's, no matter how he may have thought of it when he was drafting it, can only be read in the light of what Senator O'Neill has drawn attention to.</P>
    <P>I feel it very desirable that we ought not to forget the general surroundings. I do not, for one, at all believe&mdash;and I have said so before&mdash;that that question has its origins or its chief meaning in a monetary dispute over the land annuities.  It has been said, time and again&mdash;with what force I do not know, but I think it is much more in accord with what one understands British Governmental mentality to be&mdash;that the chief reason for this present dispute lies in the fact that they allege that the Irish Free State Government had broken a Treaty without agreement with the other party to that Treaty&mdash;a unilateral decision breaking a Treaty&mdash; and they state definitely that they would not, therefore, enter into any new agreement with the Irish Free State.  In that case, the question arises whether it would be any use to approach the British Government with a view to reconciling economic policies.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Neill has very rightly drawn attention to the fact that the spokesman for the Free State Government, President de Valera, had publicly announced his willingness to have the various disputes, and particularly, the economic dispute, referred to an international tribunal.  I think he <Col N="222" /> reminded his hearers of the time&mdash;I am not sure of this&mdash;that the British Government had entered into the Treaty with the Irish Free State Government in 1924 and with other Governments, agreeing that &ldquo;whenever any dispute shall arise between them which they recognise to be suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement and which cannot satisfactorily be settled by diplomacy, it shall be submitted to arbitration or judicial settlement&rdquo; and that &ldquo;disputes as to the interpretation of a Treaty, as to any questions on international law or as to the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of any international obligation are declared to be among those which are generally suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement.&rdquo;  Then, it is stated that &ldquo;for the consideration of any such dispute, the court to which the case is referred shall be the Permanent Court of International Justice.&rdquo;  The weakness of that particular article, so far as it affects this particular matter, lies in this, that it contains the words &ldquo;any dispute which they recognise to be suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement.&rdquo;  The British Government does recognise, apparently, that this dispute should be settled by arbitration provided the arbitrators are drawn from a given limited circle, so that they do recognise it to be a subject suitable for submission to arbitration.</P>
    <P>When the Free State offers to allow that kind of dispute to be settled by arbitration by an international court and the British Government say &ldquo;No; we shall allow it to go to the arbitration of a British Commonwealth court,&rdquo; it is quite clear that the issue is not a monetary issue but definitely a constitutional issue.  Senator O'Neill quoted Mr. Thomas as saying, when asked when he would have something to add to the statements he had made with regard to what he was doing to bring about a settlement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Immediately the Irish Free State give an indication of their desire to meet their just obligations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then, the next day he said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" />&ldquo;It would be a mistake to assume that it would help towards a settlement to say that you were not prepared to stand up for your rights.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It does seem to me that this question resolves itself into whether Mr. Thomas's judgment of what are the just obligations of this country is supreme.</P>
    <P>The Government of this country has said they are prepared to submit to an international tribunal the question whether these obligations that are claimed are just.  I should like to have repeated at this stage, if the Minister is in a position to do so, the offer made by the President that this dispute might be submitted to the arbitration of an international court and that the decisions of that court would be submitted to, agreed to and accepted by the Free State Government.  In the absence of agreement upon that kind of a judicial settlement then I can see no possibility of this economic dispute being settled for quite a long time.  In the meantime, the Government of this country will have to pursue a policy of readjustment of the agricultural economy.  I am quite satisfied, for my own part, that even in the prosperous year of 1929 the position of at least one-third of the agricultural population of this country was below the level of the unemployed British workman.  I believe that that fact is sufficient to justify a very great move on the part of the Irish Government on purely material grounds to demand some remission of the agricultural obligations that were alleged to be due by this country to Great Britain.  Whatever may have been the case in 1929, it was very much worse in 1931.  It was 30 per cent. worse in 1931 than it was in 1929 before the present Government came into office.  If those facts do not make it necessary that there should be a change in the agricultural economy as well as in the industrial economy of this country, then I do not think any other set of facts could possibly persuade any member of this House that a change was necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Browne and, I think, <Col N="224" /> Senator Crosbie, made some references to the industrial development, and Senator Miss Browne, particularly, went out of her way to say that she did not believe there was any branch of industry that had prospered except those which were established or assisted by the policy of the last Government.  Now, quite appropriate to that statement, I have before me an analysis of the returns of the Census of Production of 1931, before the present Government came into office. Senators will have seen copies of the preliminary reports of that Census of Production.  They comprise about half the total; the rest of them have not yet been issued; but taking that half the total, what do we find?  We find that as between 1926 and 1931 there was an increase in the net output, that is to say, the value added in the course of production within this country, of £1,000,000.  There was also an increase of 1,600 in the number of persons employed in those industries, but, notwithstanding the increase in the value of the output, there was a decline in the wages of £35,000.  If Senator Miss Browne were here I would ask her if she thought that was the kind of progress and prosperity she wished to support. I hope it will be found, and I am going to do what I can at least to induce those responsible to ensure, that when there is a new Census of Production for, say, the current year, an increase in the output will be commensurate with an increase in the amount of wages paid.  So that, when you are going to have prosperity it does not mean prosperity merely in sums of money and figures on a sheet of paper, but it means actual earnings of the masses of the people.  Senator Miss Browne may talk about the growth of industries under the last Government, but she will have seen from the figures I have given that with the growth of output in sums of money there was a decline of £35,000 in the total amount of wages paid.</P>
    <P>I believe it is inevitable whatever Government comes into office here, if this country is to survive economically, that there will have to be a change in the agricultural economy.  I hope that everything possible will be done, and <Col N="225" /> I think it will have to be done, to case the fall and to assist the change over for the agriculturists.  I think it can only be done by a strong effort to improve the industrial and manufacturing output within the country.  The chief thing I have to say is this, that quite apart from the immediate effect of the dispute, the greater part of the trouble that has arisen would have arisen in any case and cannot be got over by simple means.  It will take time and prolonged effort, I think, and, certainly, it will not be solved by an approach to the British Government in the terms of this amendment.  I am quite in favour of the motion except for the paragraph which deals with setting up a commission.  I am not so sure what can be done in that respect, but I think that would be a matter entirely to be left to the decision of the Executive itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to enter into this debate and I do not like to admit that I have been drawn into this controversy by the high-sounding words and misplaced Americanisms of Senator Milroy.  However, as a result of this debate we have at least a definite indication of the policy of the Opposition, and we may, perhaps, shank Senator Milroy for that valuable information.  In the course of his speech Senator Milroy quoted from various newspapers and several speakers, but amongst other things he read quotations from speeches made by Deputy Ben Maguire and Deputy E. Moane, and, to the great amusement of the members of the Opposition, Senator Milroy attempted to ridicule those two Deputies for trying to create the impression that we had won the economic war.  Now, the attitude of the Opposition was very definitely expressed by the applause for Senator Milroy in this unsuccessful attempt to ridicule the two Deputies I have just mentioned.  Senator Milroy, in his recent trip to the United States, got a sort of a mixed-up idea of Americanisms. Apparently, he went to considerable pains to pick up some of the slang when he was over there and he, apparently, took some notes and brought back some of the statements of <Col N="226" /> the various American statesmen, politicians and soap-box orators and others&mdash;mostly of the soap-box orators &mdash;but he might have picked up one very useful phrase used by some American statesmen in years gone by.  It is a phrase that would have been more appropriate in this or any other country for a man claiming the nationality of that country to use.  That phrase was: &ldquo;I pray to God that my country be always right but, right or wrong, my country.&rdquo;  I say and I challenge contradiction that the attitude of Deputies Moane and Maguire was a more proper attitude for any Irishman to take up than that of Senator Milroy and the various members of the Opposition who sniggered and applauded Senator Milroy because he tried to prove to John Bull and, indeed, to the rest of the world that we have lost the economic war.  The Deputies who said that we had won the war were far nearer to the truth than the members of the Opposition who were trying to prove that we had lost it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be very slow to take sides as to the motion or the amendment. I can see nothing in either the motion or the amendment but a repetition of the old policy of the Opposition, a repetition of various motions and amendments brought before this House by the very same gentlemen in the past.  I can see nothing in either the motion or the amendment but just another attempt to clap the British on the back and to create the impression that they are winning the economic war; to try, if possible, to get the people of this country to believe that we are losing the war.  The fact may not be very pleasant news for the members of the Opposition and for the leaders of the Opposition who are, apparently, out of touch with the people of the country, that the people of the country to-day are of the very same opinion that they were at the last election or at the previous election and that to-day they are more solid than ever behind the Party represented by the two Deputies Maguire and Moane and behind the policy of Fianna Fáil in this economic war.  Running through the whole debate, as I say, we have the same old tactics at work, <Col N="227" /> the same old cry we have had in the past: &ldquo;Give us back our markets.&rdquo; A disinterested outsider, looking at the situation, would certainly say that people who stand up here in this House and say that they represent the farming interests of this country or the cattle breeding interests or the dairying interests and who even, once in a while get up and talk on behalf of the agricultural workers&mdash;any outsider not drawn into the blue net would certainly say that they were a thankless crowd and that they showed very little gratitude for what has been done for them by the present Government, because, regardless of all the propaganda which is being used to prove the contrary, the Fianna Fáil Government since it came into power has done everything, in my opinion, that has been possible to help the farming community through the present struggle.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into statistics. That side of the matter has been dealt with by other speakers.  But, when anyone tries to prove that we are going downhill as a result of this economic war, then I definitely contradict the statement.  A number of people who were definitely engaged in the production of beef for a number of years have suffered considerably, not only within the past two years, but within the past ten years.  Without going into past history, the price of beef has been falling all the time and, as one Senator mentioned, if the economic war, as it is now called, was settled in the morning I believe there would be still considerable beef exports to England.  The Canadians, trading under the quota system, have no economic war with England.  In fact they boast that they are sons and daughters of the motherland. Perhaps if some people who say they are Irish and patriots, but who apparently are taking the wrong side in this economic war, would come out openly and boast with the Canadians that they are sons and daughters of the motherland, there might be more sympathy with them.  Failing that, by the methods adopted here to-day, they are making a terrible mistake.  Senator <Col N="228" /> Milroy said that he was in favour of industrial development, but that the policy of the Government with regard to agriculture was disastrous, or something to that effect.  Probably the Senator used a bigger word to express himself.  How does Senator Milroy or anyone else propose to provide for increased industrial development without ensuring, at the same time, that there is a healthy rural population behind that development?  In every country, where the people have a reasonable amount of sense, very definite steps are taken to ensure that there is a sound agricultural community, because on the strength or weakness of that community depends the life or death of a nation.</P>
    <P>Coming to employment, capital has been made of the fact that the wages paid the workers are perhaps low.  But the people who are shedding crocodile tears for the workers are the very people who are leaving others to ensure that agricultural workers will have a living wage.  They would have no wages to get if we were to continue to produce beef on the scale at which it was produced in the past.  What suggestion has the Opposition put up to deal with our increasing population? Members of the Opposition know very well that there is no emigration now. They know that we have an increase in population, and that that population must be employed somehow.  Regardless of any statements to the contrary they know that that increased population is day by day being put to work as a result of the policy of the present Government.  When we had a far greater population than we have now, when the British Government ruled here, when the people were in the way of a beef policy they were shifted out of the country.  I do not want to arouse any more bitterness than there will always be in this country until it is free, but when the British found that the people were in the way of their beef policy they shifted them in chains and in other ways to make room for cattle.  The time has arrived when there is no further outlet, and the Government in charge of this part of the country are not inclined to adopt the policy formerly adopted by the <Col N="229" /> British.  There is no alternative but that beef must give way to human beings.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition have any policy other than the policy of further developing our agriculture then we should like to hear it.  If they have any other way of dealing with the unemployment problem, which must necessarily be faced by this or by a future Government, we would like to hear it.  We must have large numbers of people employed on the land.  The only alternative to that policy is to have a correspondingly large number employed in the cities.  Even if we could afford to pay correspondingly large numbers of unemployed in the cities; even if we could afford to pay them when idle, it would be a bad policy because what applies to the individual applies to the country.  I ask any of the gentlemen who used such strong language against our agricultural policy to say, even if they could afford to keep people in absolute idleness, would they, as individuals, stand for that policy?  Would they think that a sane policy in the conduct of their own domestic affairs?  I say definitely that they would not.  They would not think it a good policy to have their families idle but they think it would be all right to let the families of the masses grow up in idleness.  The only result of such a policy would be revolution.</P>
    <P>We are determined that that state of affairs will not exist in this country and as an alternative we are determined that the people are to be put to work.  The principal trouble and the howl of these people is, not so much to cause' some kind of conference, as is suggested, but the question running through their minds is: &ldquo;What will we do with our bullocks?&rdquo; While we have given considerable attention to that question, they forget that other people are asking: &ldquo;What will we do with our grown-up children?&rdquo; Those who are considering what they are to do with their grown-up children are the great majority and this Government, or any future Government, cannot afford to ignore their interests.  They have to be put to work and the only policy for any <Col N="230" /> Government, apart altogether from industrial development, is to put the people back on the land.  We heard British Ministers being complimented from Opposition Benches because they stated that the door is still open. From these benches we heard the President and the Irish Ministers being complimented because they stated that the door was still open.  In the Seanad the feeling, apparently, is that the door is a swing door; that it is open from both sides.  All I have to say in that case is to appeal to members of the Opposition, and their followers, not to forget that the door is on the swing, and that their duty is to get to the right side of it.</P>

      <P>Senator Dowdall dealt with butter prices but I do not think the House saw the point I was making.  My point was that while farmers in England are getting 10d. a gallon for their milk on the farm, the consumer there is able to get butter as cheap as 11d. per lb.  That is due to the fact that the whole balance is different there, agriculture being a small element, and the consuming element much larger!</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but not in country districts.  Under the operations of the Marketing Board in England and owing to better methods of trading a flat rate has been imposed.  It is different here. The farmer is only getting 5d. at the creameries and if he wants butter he has to pay 1/4 a lb. for it.  The Minister for Lands and Fisheries has referred to the old policy, which he says was rather abused, to the exploitation of human beings, and to Imperialism, which he said had broken down.  I do not think that that would be the fairest description of the policy of the President of the United States of America.  The Minister also referred to our sound budgetary position.  Up to a point I agree with him, and generally I appreciate the whole of his speech, but I think it is only fair, in viewing <Col N="231" /> the whole budgetary position, to bring in also hidden taxes.  After all, there is very little difference between putting on a tax in the form of a subsidy or putting it as a hidden tax on the consumer.  On that basis I do not think our budgetary position would balance.  I did not like Senator Connolly's attitude as to detaching the whole of the annuity dispute from any general statement.  He said that we were not going to be beaten on the annuity question.  As one Senator said, it is all a question of compromise. If we went to the other side and said: &ldquo;Can we not discuss the whole question of inter-trade relations, and bring in the annuities at the same time,&rdquo; the British Government then might say: &ldquo;We will do it on this basis: if you give us certain trade preferences for our manufactured articles; they might be sufficient to justify us in accepting the annuity position and abandoning the penal duties.&rdquo;  All these things resolve themselves into a question of bargaining.</P>

      <P>The British Government have very much to gain by a satisfactory trade agreement.  I think that we have much to gain, too. Take, for instance, the question of a substantial preference on British motor cars.  Naturally, the British would like that.  I think that the general public here would like it too, particularly those in a position to buy motor cars. At the present time you have to pay here about one-third more than you have to pay for the same article on the other side.  The same argument would apply in the case of heavy and steel goods.  There is quite a big scope for agreement on that basis.</P>

As regards the motion versus the amendment, I am quite prepared to take the sense of the House on the amendment. The matter of immediate necessity is what is contained in the spirit of the amendment.  I do feel, especially after what Senator Quirke said and his whole attitude towards the development of agriculture, without really examining its possibilities at all, that there is need for an inquiry independent altogether of Senator Counihan's amendment into how we are to absorb our surplus.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane, I understand, has some connection with the creamery business in this country. He knows that even the most efficient creamery will take two and the one-third gallons of milk to produce a lb. of butter.  A farmer will take a great deal more than that.  Therefore, what that amounts to is this, that it will take 1/11 worth of milk to produce a lb. of butter, which is to be sold at 11d.</P>

      <P>If it is imported butter that is being sold at that price, of course it is all right.  I do not know that.  I can believe the Senator's statement if it is imported butter. There was another point that Senator Sir John Keane dealt with.  He said that he felt that there was hope of a settlement.  The Minister for Lands and Fisheries answered the Senator on that.  He told the Senator that when our predecessors in office approached the British Government for a moratorium on £250,000 they were turned down.  In spite of that there appears to be the opinion amongst the Opposition that we could get a settlement even now.  Why?  If our predecessors could not even get a moratorium on £250,000 how could we succeed now?  If the Opposition really believe that we could succeed now, then they must believe that we have won the economic war.  I cannot see any other explanation for it, because certainly we are not likely to get any favours from the British Government that they would not give to our predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bagwell in speaking said that he was not blinded by party <Col N="234" /> spirit.  I read in the <i>Irish Times</i> a few months ago speeches on a certain subject.  It referred to Senator Bagwell's speech as a non-political speech, and to prove its point, which of course, was against us, quoted this non-politician, Senator Bagwell.  I think it was a very good joke, but it was nothing to the joke of the Senator describing himself as a non-politician. However, I think that joke was beaten by Senator Milroy when he said this evening that he was quoting figures but not for any party purpose.  The spectacle of the two Senators describing themselves as non-politicians was rather amusing.</P>
    <P>Taking this motion in general, which asks for an investigation into the policy that we have been pursuing, I think, there is a great deal to be said for it.  I think no one could put up a reasonable case against the motion, but the real difficulty, as Senator Johnson pointed out, would appear to be that the Government themselves ought to do it.  There is no commission that I know of, or that could be suggested, that would be useful in a matter of this kind.  We can say that we had foreseen some of the difficulties that were going to arise.  We foresaw these difficulties three, four, or five years ago.  We said at that time that the British market was not a market that was going to last; that it was not an unlimited or an unrestricted market.  We were told at the time by our opponents, by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and by other Parties that we were wrong: that the British market was unlimited and unrestricted, that it was there to take as much produce as we could possibly put into it.  I think it is becoming very evident now that the British market is restricted.  It may be quite competent to absorb all the produce that we have at the present time, but even if it were willing to take ten times what we have to offer at the present time any one can see that the British Government is pursuing a policy to develop its own agriculture. It is bringing in these quotas, and eventually they hope to reach the position of being as nearly self-sufficient as they can be.  Whether they <Col N="235" /> will reach that position or not I am unable to say, but their aim is to be as self-sufficient as they can.  Therefore, we at least, ought to prepare for the position that the British market is not unlimited.  We must face the facts.</P>
    <P>The policy which we proposed to meet that position was, in the first place, to confine our home market to our own agricultural produce. Shortly after we came into power, as Senators know, we protected our home market for such things as bacon, butter and other agricultural produce. In that way we gave our own agriculturists, at least, a market that they had not got before.  Senator Sir John Keane, in the course of his speech, gave me the impression that that was not a sound economic policy; that it was an unsound economic policy to restrict in any way or to help in any way, by subsidies such as import barriers, the development of agriculture here or elsewhere.  He said there should be absolutely free access to every market and no barriers at all: that that was the proper economy to pursue.</P>
    <P>Suppose that we had continued to pursue that economy, is it not quite evident that things would have become much worse during the last few years than they had been before with regard to the import of feeding stuffs coming in here?  Take the case of Poland, Denmark and those other countries which are restricted in their imports of bacon into the British market.  If we had no import duties here they would naturally come along here with their bacon and put as much in here as they possibly could.  I do not know if there is any market in the world now without its quotas.  Practically none, I think.  They would come in here.  They would cut one another in price and cut our producers out of the home market altogether.  The only safeguard that we had for our own pig producers was to guarantee them at least the home market.  That does not apply to bacon alone.  The same thing would apply to beef.  Argentine beef is being restricted to a certain extent going into the British market. <Col N="236" /> They are looking for alternative markets all over the world.  Quite naturally they would come along in here with their chilled beef, which would be selling here at 2d. or 3d. a lb., the price at which it was selling in England up to a short time ago.  A good many housewives believe that chilled beef can be cooked, put on the table and presented to the people of the house in just as good a condition as beef that is produced at home.</P>
    <P>Even butter which has been spoken of could be landed here at the present time from New Zealand and Australia at 60/- per cwt., so that our own creameries might close down if there was no protection for them, if we had not shut out the agricultural produce of other countries.  The same applies to mutton.  At the time that we put a tariff on the import of mutton and lamb there were very large consignments coming here from Australia and New Zealand.  Even last Spring, to give an instance, New Zealand lamb was landed here and paid a tariff of 56/- per cwt., so that it all comes back to this: the prices at which those countries would be prepared to sell beef, butter and bacon at the present time if they were allowed to come here at all.  Therefore, I think that the days of the old and the sound economist are gone&mdash;I mean the idea of free trade.  When countries are in the position that they are in, it would be foolish to go back to the free trade idea.</P>
    <P>In the second place, in order to try to meet a difficulty which was likely to arise by being restricted on the British market and for other reasons, too, of course, we tried to develop our industries.  We believe that we can get for our own agricultural producers a better and a surer market amongst our own industrial population than elsewhere.  I never could understand why people cannot see that if we get our boots made in Waterford or Cork that the workers in these boot factories are sure to be better customers for our own agricultural produce than the shoemakers in Bradford, New York, or elsewhere.  Certainly they are going to be better customers for our agricultural produce, so that from that <Col N="237" /> point of view alone it certainly should be good policy to develop our industries here at home.  Senator Sir John Keane speaking on the matter of trying to develop an industrial policy and an agricultural policy at the same time, spoke of it somewhat on the lines of feeding a dog on his own fat. I do not know any reason why we should not have our own industrial population consuming our own agricultural produce rather than have our agricultural population buying their industrial requirements from other countries, and of having a very poor chance of getting much of the market for their agricultural produce, whether it be England or any other country.</P>
    <P>We know from the census of agricultural output taken in 1926 and 1927 that every person in a town in the Free State at that time consumed annually £10 10s. 0d. worth of Irish agricultural produce and that every person in Great Britain consumed 16/- worth.  Some people in this country have an idea that what we should do is try to develop a great agricultural trade with Great Britain, buy our industrial products from Great Britain and, in that way, help Great Britain in keeping up her industries.  But for every person we help to put into employment in Great Britain, we only get 16/- per year in respect of agricultural produce supplied, whereas if we turn to our own country and put people into employment there, we shall get £10 10s. 0d. from every person so employed for the supply of agricultural produce.  From the theoretical as well as the practical point of view it is, therefore, better to develop our industries.  It is better from the agricultural point of view.  The development of our industries and the development of agriculture are in no way compatible with one another.  I think that one cannot be developed properly without the other.  Having protected our agricultural industry and our manufacturing industries, we turned to see in what respect we could increase our agricultural output.  We found we were importing certain agricultural products which we could produce at home, such as wheat, feeding stuffs, certain fruits, sugar, tobacco, <Col N="238" /> and other things.  There are certain things, as the Minister for Lands and Fisheries pointed out to-day, which we cannot produce, such as oranges and tea.  But the things we could quite well produce would create a market for about £12,500,000 worth of produce.  We considered that that £12,500,000 distributed amongst agricultural producers would, in some way, compensate for any losses they might have on the British market.  I do not want to dwell on these matters except for a minute or two.  The wheat policy I need not delay to deal with, because I considered, when the scheme was being brought forward, that it would want at least two years' trial before we could ascertain whether it contained any serious defects.  We have one year over.  Wheat is being sown at the present time and, at the end of next Spring, when we see the amount sown, we shall be in a position to judge whether our scheme has been a success or not.  If we find that we are not going quickly enough towards getting the requirements of the country grown, we shall have to make some attempt to revise the scheme or get a better one.  I think that the scheme has been reasonably successful up to the present.</P>
    <P>We did confuse the prophets to a great extent&mdash;the prophets who said that everything was wrong in this country for the growing of wheat, that we could not grow wheat because of the soil, the climate, the predatory birds, the weeds in the fields and the unsatisfactory nurse-crop.  The prophets have been more or less confused, but Senator Miss Browne says that we were lucky in having a fine harvest and that, if we have a bad harvest this year, our wheat policy will be a failure.  Strange to say, I heard Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney say the very same thing this time last year.  He said that our policy had not ruined the country yet but that a bad harvest would be the end of us.  The only hope now of Cumann na nGaedheal appears to be a bad harvest.  There are also the grain crops other than wheat.  That matter will certainly require amendment.  I considered that, if we provided a certain market for <Col N="239" /> oats and barley, the operation of supply and demand would create a decent price for the farmer.  The price which the farmer got for his oats, at any rate, was not remunerative. The price which the farmer got for his barley was, in some districts, very poor.  It went down as low as 12/- a barrel.  Now, four months after that barley was sold, it is worth 16/- a barrel, so that the corn merchant has come in for the greater part of the profit.  The same thing, I believe, is likely to apply to oats.  It has commenced to rise in price.  That is likely to increase and, in all probability, those merchants who bought oats at 6/- or 7/- a barrel and filled their stores are likely to derive a very big profit.  The Government had no intention of bringing in a Cereals Bill to benefit the merchants.  Before next year's crop comes in, some Bill will have to be introduced to secure that the farmer will get a remunerative price for his oats and barley when it is sold after the harvest and to secure also that there will be no profiteering subsequent to that, so that feeding stuffs can also be sold at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>This quota system is becoming State policy in many countries, and we have to face that fact.  Senator Sir John Keane, in framing his resolution, appears to have accepted the fact that quotas have come to stay and that we had better deal with them.  I think that that is the proper attitude.  There is no use in making the sort of opposition speech that was made by Senator Milroy.  That is in no way helpful. He tried only to throw all the dirt he could.  Great Britain has adopted the quota system, and we are more concerned with Great Britain than with any other country.  She has adopted the quota system for a number of commodities&mdash;bacon, fat cattle, milk products, potatoes and some other things. Great Britain has adopted the quota system because, in the first place, she wants to develop her own agriculture and, in the second place, she is not against fighting an economic war with other people than the Free State.  She took on Soviet Russia lately, and she <Col N="240" /> is going to take on France.  If we were to settle this economic war with Britain and make some arrangement about what she was to be paid in respect of the annuities and other items, it is quite possible that, in a few months, something might be done which would cause her to start an economic war again.  It seems to be her settled policy, when she has a falling-out with any country, to start an economic war.  She has adopted that course, and if she thought she had got the better of us in this contest, she would be quite free to adopt the same weapon any time she had anything against this country.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of talk about the door being open.  Mr. Thomas, we are told, has the door open all the time.  Senator Sir John Keane says he is there waiting with the fatted calf and that, if we come along, we can have part of it.  I suggest that if we went along he would be much more likely to confiscate it.  Mr. Thomas, in another speech, used the phrase, &ldquo;As soon as they show a desire to honour their just obligations.&rdquo;  We have shown the greatest desire to honour our just obligations all the time.  In fact, we believe we have done so.  But in order not to appear unreasonable, we have suggested and proposed to the British Government that the question should be put to impartial arbitration.  The British have refused to put it to arbitration unless the arbitration tribunal is drawn entirely from the British Commonwealth of Nations, which we objected to.  If the British have really a strong case, they do not mind very much about procedure and details and they are not usually so inconsistent. It would appear that they are not very sure of their case, and they would like to have another Feetham Commission and would not like to take the chance of an international tribunal dealing with this question.  We have stated over and over again that we were prepared to put the matter to international arbitration and abide by the consequences.  We cannot do any more than that.</P>
    <P>The spirit shown here to-day is very different from that shown on previous occasions.  The Opposition appear to think now that the British Government <Col N="241" /> were a little bit at fault also and that all the fault was not on our side.  That is a big advance.  Perhaps, before long, they may come to agree that the best policy would have been to stand behind their own Government, whether they were right or wrong, as Senator Quirke said.</P>
    <P>I find great difficulty in visualising the commission suggested by Senator Sir John Keane.  He says that there must not be politicians on it.  He leaves out the politicians.  It would, presumably, consist of economists and business men.  I do not know about the economists.  One economist seems to spend all his time criticising another economist.  In all probability, if you put two economists on the commission, one would agree with us and one would disagree, because whatever proposition was put up by one would be criticised by the other.  I think economists are not very much use for practical purposes.</P>
    <P>As regards business men, what would the business men be like?  Business men on the whole are very useful in their own business, but I have not found they were any great help to us on many occasions on which we consulted them.  I shall give you an example of that.  When the bacon quota came along, there was the same outcry that there is now about the cattle quota. There was an outcry in the Dáil and in the Press.  I do not think there was any in the Seanad.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> was very strong about it. They talked about the blunderings of the Government and, in particular, the blunderings of the Minister for Agriculture, because he did not get a sufficient quota.  The <i>Independent</i> stands for business men.  It is one of the most businesslike papers in the country. They talked about the blunders we made in not getting sufficient under the bacon quota.  What was the real position?  We went to the bacon curers themselves and told them what we asked for.  They said, &ldquo;You asked for too much.&rdquo;  So we had the bacon people themselves saying we had asked for too much, and the business people in the Dáil and elsewhere, as represented by the <i>Independent</i>, saying we asked for too little.  So far as I can see, <Col N="242" /> we asked for exactly what we wanted. We had too much bacon here in November and December.  We knew we would have too much.  We knew we would have to store some.  We knew we would have too little in January and February.  We have too little.  We are taking that bacon out of store now. The business men did not take that into account.  The business men were all wrong, and we were right.  Now, we are taking that bacon out of store and filling our quota as we are going along.  But we shall not be able to do more than that.</P>
    <P>As regards the Pig Industry Tribunal, we got the greatest criticism in the Dáil and in the Seanad about the setting up of that Tribunal.  We were told that we were going to put a few civil servants on that Tribunal to teach business men their business.  We got great criticism from the business men. Now we find that the business men are being interviewed and that they are talking about the fine report made by the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>We were exporting butter all last summer to Great Britain and elsewhere and on a certain date in September I stopped the export of butter.  On that certain date, butter was at the highest point it reached on the British market for the whole summer.  On the following day it came down, and it has been coming down since.  I do not claim that I foresaw all that, but if a business man had done it he would claim that he had foreseen it and he would be described as a business wizard.</P>
    <P>The cattle quota has been spoken of, and, as I say, when the bacon quota came along, we were told that we had got too little while we were told by the bacon curers themselves that we had got too much.  The cattle quota comes now, and there is an outcry that we have got too many cattle in the country and so on.  We are not very sure of that point yet, and we will not be sure for a few weeks.  We are having a census taken of all the cattle in stalls throughout the country and, mind you, it is very bad to lay too much stress on having too many cattle and the quota being too small, because farmers <Col N="243" /> all over the country get panicky and inclined to sell their cattle at sacrifice prices.  I am inclined to think it is not necessary.  I have got in some preliminary figures&mdash;we will not have them all in for another two or three weeks&mdash; and I am inclined to think that there is a good chance of dealing with the whole situation in respect of fat cattle and that we have just enough cattle to deal with our own and the British market between this and the end of April, and farmers can hold on to their cattle and get a decent price.  Papers like the <i>Irish Independent</i> and speakers from the Opposition side come out and make this outcry through the country about the farmers being ruined and stating that the last blow has been given to the cattle trade.  The cattle trade has got the last blow about fourteen times since I came into office, according to these people, and this is again described as the last blow.</P>

They say that the cattle trade and the farmers are ruined; that there are too many cattle in the country, and they ask what are we going to do with them; and the farmer down the country, with four or five cattle in his stall, says to the first man who comes along: &ldquo;Take them at any price.&rdquo; That is the result of it.  If the people in opposition would have a little more regard for the farmers, about whom they are always talking, than for politics, things would be a little bit better in this country.  The export of store cattle has actually increased in the last month and is higher than in January, 1933, under the quota.  It is rather peculiar, but still, it has happened. The export of fat cattle, of course, is down, but the complaint was made to me in this House actually, before Christmas, that people were not fattening cattle this winter on account of the policy of the Government, and we were asked how we could expect to <Col N="244" /> get our oats consumed when there were no cattle in stalls.  That was the point made to me before Christmas by the Opposition, but when the quota came along everybody had cattle in the stalls and could not get rid of them.  I hope that the advice of these particular propagandists, including the Press, will go unheeded.  It certainly was unheeded when the pig quota came along, with the result that people held on to their pigs and got a good price.</P>
      <P>There is some talk also about our policy with regard to the bullock and the rancher.  There does not appear to be enough land in this country for everybody.  Anybody who reads statistics will see that two-thirds of the agricultural population are living on one-third of the valuation and that the other one-third are living on two-thirds of the valuation, so that you have one-third of the agricultural population living principally on these big farms and ranches.  We will be told they are sources of wealth in the country.  What is the use of the wealth when you have a ranch of a couple of hundred acres which supports the owner and, giving him credit for keeping two or three workmen&mdash;four persons in all on a big ranch?  That is the greatest number who can live on it and they say, as a matter of fact, that they cannot live on it.  On the other hand, if you go down to the congested districts, on 200 acres you would have, perhaps, 20 or 30 families.  They do not complain so much at all and they say they can live there all right.  Where, then, is the wealth in the ranch?  We believe that if those people can make a good living on ten acres of bad land and if we give them ten acres of a ranch they could make a better living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ranch is only what you might call the land policy because if people want land, naturally, you must settle them, but there is also the cattle policy.  We are hopeful that the dairy industry will be at least one of the best paying branches of farming and, therefore, it would be a great pity to have to reduce the number of cows in this country.  In fact, I think, we should try to improve our cows&mdash; perhaps not to increase the numbers very much, but at least to improve <Col N="245" /> them.  All old and diseased cows might be replaced and there is an opportunity, at the present time, of replacing them with good heifers we have in the country instead of having those exported at what are very poor prices just now.  That is one thing that can be done and probably some means will be found for doing it in the very near future.  We do not want to have those cows actually wasted but some use can be made of the old cows apart from using them for human food. We may have to go further if, on examination, we find that this British quota system, if it is likely to continue, will not absorb the number of cattle we have at present coming along each year, both in the home and foreign markets.  Then, there may have to be some sort of system for restricting the numbers that will come to maturity.  We have certainly a problem to deal with.  We have a big problem in agriculture in this country and we do not by any means take it lightly or assume that everything is right.  We do not assume that the farmer is well-off or that there is nothing at all to be done.  We assume that there is a whole lot to be done and we have given a lot of time to it, but every country has its problem at present.  Take Denmark as an example.  Denmark was cut down by 17,000 cattle in respect of Great Britain and cut down from 200,000 to 6,000 in respect of Germany.  She has to deal with that problem, of course, and she is doing so as best she can. I think the Opposition here ought to try to get a few tips from the Opposition there as to how they are taking it.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible, also, that more quotas will come.  Eggs, for instance, are spoken of, and poultry.  We are not sure yet whether it will come or not in relation to these commodities, but at least, they have been mentioned as being likely to come under a quota system.  If they do, we shall have to meet the situation as best we can. There is no use, however, in the sort of publicity that has been given to our eggs, such as Deputy Dillon gave in a speech recently, when he spoke of a number of our eggs being thrown out <Col N="246" /> by public health authorities in England. That sort of thing is very bad for this country, and it is a very irresponsible thing for any public man to make such a statement.  In the first place, of course, it is not true.  I do not mind that because a good many of the things said in that way are not true, but one really wonders that a man would make a statement like that in public, whether it were true or not, because one would imagine that any good Irishman, if he found that it was true that some of our eggs had been condemned, would keep it to himself and come to us and make suggestions for getting it right without making a row about it.  I am quite sure that that statement has been published in all the British papers.  It is just the sort of thing they would like to publish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I mentioned the Deputy's name.  I intended it as an example.  Another thing I should like to say with regard to quotas is that the quota on bacon, for instance, has been rather good for us than a hardship, provided we are able to cope with it on this side and able to make the proper provision to meet it, because naturally, if the British get what they want&mdash;a rise of price in Britain &mdash;it is going to do us good too, because our prices will go up also.  It does, of course, entail a certain amount of difficulty in dealing with it here.  I hope we shall be able to deal with the bacon situation and I think that, as soon as we have examined in detail the recommendations of the Pig Industries Tribunal, we shall be able to frame some sort of legislation that will control the production of bacon in the country. On the other hand, take commodities in respect of which there is no quota&mdash; butter, for instance.  New Zealand and Australia are landing butter in Great Britain at 60/- a cwt.  They have no quota and there is no great good in the butter trade on that basis.  Senator Crosbie mentioned here that Denmark was losing on the butter landed in England.  Denmark is getting at least 16/- more than the others and would <Col N="247" /> get 16/- more than we would get if we were putting butter freely on the British market, so that if Denmark is losing what Senator Crosbie has estimated, we should be losing heavily if we could land our butter in Britain at present without any tariffs or any restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to self-sufficiency, there are other things which can be done, and one thing that was mentioned here was the putting of oats into bread. That is a question that is being investigated, and I should like to say that some loaves of that particular bread&mdash; 5 per cent. and 10 per cent. of oats&mdash; have been made and the bread is very good.  I saw that it was described in the <i>Irish Independent</i> as a dark brown loaf.  The person who would so describe that bread must be blind, and I defy that special correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> or the editor or the baker who was interviewed, or any man in this House to pick out that loaf on colour alone, when uncut&mdash;because the difference can be seen in another way when the bread is cut.  There is no difference in colour whatever, and in food value it is good.  Senators have spoken here about the bankruptcy and so on that is sure to come.  That bankruptcy appears to be always six months off.  Since the economic war started, I have been told in the Seanad and in the Dáil that it will come, some say three months and some say six months, but it is always a little bit ahead and we have not reached it yet.  Some say that we are close to it, but can any Senator explain why there is so much money in circulation and why the bankers have shown such favourable reports and why everything appears to contradict this pessimism we hear from the Opposition Benches?  There is, I believe, a better market for agricultural produce within the country now than there was, because we have an industrial population at least somewhat bigger than it was before.  I think that the setting up of a commission such as that suggested would be, in a way, an evasion of the duties which the Government have undertaken.  If, however, a suitable commission could be got, although I cannot see from what class it could be <Col N="248" /> drawn, I do not see that any Government would object to taking advice from it if it were a competent and useful commission.  The Government, of course, must be responsible for general policy.  As Senators know, we have appointed from time to time many <i>ad hoc</i> committees.  We had a commission, to which I referred a few minutes ago, to inquire into the whole bacon industry. We have also had commissions to inquire into other subjects from time to time.  It is easy to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> commission for some particular subject but it is very difficult to get a commission competent to advise on the whole policy.  We might, of course, get minority reports.</P>
    <P>We have been told that things have gone from bad to worse, but the facts do not bear that out.  For instance, cattle are lower now than at any time for the last 14 or 15 years&mdash;all classes of cattle.  In everything else, however, it is quite different.  Sheep, for instance, are higher now than they were at this time in 1933 and as high as in 1932 and higher than at this time in 1931.  So that we can go back to the Cumann na nGaedheal regime and find that they were worse.  Pigs also are higher now than in 1931, and again we find that things were worse when Cumann na nGaedheal were in power in regard to pigs.  Eggs are better now by 1d. a dozen than at this time last year.  Potatoes are also better and farmers' butter is 1d. per lb. better.  Creamery butter is very much better.  Senator Milroy challenged us to go to the country.  Of course, it does not matter very much to him whether we go to the country or not.  He will not be in the fray at any rate, because he will find no constituency to have him.  However, why should we go to the country?  As far as farming conditions go, we went to the country when every single thing&mdash; sheep, pigs, potatoes, butter&mdash;every single thing except cattle, was worse off than now.</P>

      <P>What about unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there was more unemployment then.  As a matter of fact, I think it was published at the last election that there were 100,000 <Col N="249" /> unemployed.  It was up on every election poster.  There is less than that number unemployed now and it must be remembered that we had 30,000 of an increase in population in the meantime.  So there is no point, I think, in going to the people at the present time at any rate.  I do not say, of course, at all, and I do not want anybody to say afterwards that I said it, that we went to the country when the farmers were well off.  They were not well off and they are not well off now.  In fact, I never saw them well off except during the War.  I was reared amongst them and they were never well off; in fact, they found it difficult sometimes to find the halfpenny to go to Mass on Sunday.  I do not say they are well off but, on the other hand, I say that they are at least as well off as they were at this time last year, and they returned us to office then.  I suppose they said to themselves that, badly off as they were, they would prefer us to Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>
      <P>As far as the motion is concerned, I think it was moved in the proper spirit and that Senator Sir John Keane was anxious to help us, but the big difficulty that I think the Senator will have to realise is the personnel of such a commission.  With regard to the amendment, I think that it is only a repetition of what has come up again and again.  The only thing I can say is that Senator Counihan, while making his usual speech, added to it this time by making an attack on Mr. Thomas, which did balance things a little bit this time.  I think the amendment is really not necessary.  Considering that we have always said that there is an open door, just as Mr. Thomas said, and that we are willing and anxious to settle this question, and, what is more, willing to honour our just obligations, as Mr. Thomas put it in the House of Commons the other day, I do not see any necessity whatever for the amendment and I do not think it could be acted upon even if it were adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be unreasonable to start at this hour of the evening to follow the Minister for <Col N="250" /> Agriculture.  In my opening speech, I tried to avoid, as far as I could, any reference to the economic war or to quote the other subjects which the Minister has dealt with.  I am not going to deal with them now, but possibly I may have an opportunity later. The Minister said that sheep and pig prices were better now than in 1931. He did not tell us the cause.  The cause is that the people have gone out of production of pigs and sheep.  The Minister for Lands and Fisheries pointed out that in Holland the Government had instituted a system for reducing their dairy cows and made an order for the reduction of 200,000 dairy cows, because the British market had put a tariff on cheese and butter, and they thought the best way to meet this was to have the cows slaughtered.  Our Minister for Agriculture is still advocating the production of more cows and more dairying.  I believe he is financing a scheme for the purchase of heifers for dairy purposes.  What is the sense of that if the quota system is going to be carried on and we have no market for our stock?  We produce a calf and feed him until he is 15 months old and sell him at 50/-, which with internal expenses and £1 bounty will leave 5/- of net profit.  That is not sound economy.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister for Lands and Fisheries and the Minister for Agriculture, I think, referred to the attitude of the British Government in refusing to the previous Administration a moratorium of £250,000.  That is, possibly, correct and I do not think it is to the credit of the British Government for refusing it, but they do not tell us what was the position of the British Government at that time, what was their financial position then or what was the position of this country at that time.</P>

      <P>As far as I remember, the British had not balanced their Budget, that it was far from being balanced and that their amount of <Col N="251" /> unemployment was running into two millions, whereas at that time we were supposed to be the best off country in the world.  If we were, as we were reputed to be, the best off country in the world, it was, from the British Government's point of view, an unreasonable claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking from the British Government's point of view. We wanted a moratorium, and I do not think it was to the credit of the British Government to refuse it.  However, the only further comment I will make is, what is the gain of this economic war to the country?  We will have paid by the end of the financial year, according to Mr. Thomas, the whole of our liabilities under the land annuities and the other claims.  When he found that was so he put us on a quota.  He did not want to go over it, because he has promised that he will only charge the full amount of our liability.  The Minister for Agriculture stated that we are going to be on quotas and that there will be quotas instituted in every country.  If quotas are to be instituted against us by Britain, and if they adopt their present policy and carry it to a logical conclusion of doing it on a fifty-fifty basis we will be in a sound position to get the quota to which we are properly entitled.  That quota, if they work it out on anything like the same proportion as in the case of Denmark or the Argentine, will provide us with an outlet for more agricultural produce than we can hope to supply. The whole economic policy of Great Britain has changed in the last few years.  Previous to that Britain was a free trade country.  She has now become a protectionist country, and I <Col N="252" /> believe that following on that fifty-fifty basis, or having a quid pro quo arrangement with Britain we would be able to sell more agricultural produce than we could hope to produce in this country.</P>
      <P>My object in moving this was to try to get a settlement.  What is the use of carrying on if the farmers are paying the whole debt to Britain in the form of special duties, and if we get no consolation for it?  Our President, and a number of Ministers of the Executive Council have stated that they are anxious for a settlement.  The Minister for Agriculture stated so here this evening, and said that they were anxious for goodwill to be established.  The British Ministers have said the same thing, but a deadlock has arisen. According to the statements of the Ministers here and, I believe, Mr. Thomas's statements, that deadlock will not be got over.  The only thing then for the ordinary people to do is to try to get around that deadlock and to fix it up, and the only way to do that is to get some commission that will inquire into this whole situation and put up some proposals to each Government which the respective Governments would be in a position to accept or reject, and to take the responsibility for the acceptance or rejection.  If that were done we would know where we stood.  Senator Colonel Moore told us that it was not the money that was the real concern, that it is the political end of it.  We would like to know what the political end is, and what is the crux that prevents agreement from being come to.  Despite the rosy position pointed out by the Minister for Agriculture, the country is in a bad way and the farmers are in a bad way. For that reason I ask the Seanad to accept my amendment.</P>
