      <P>The following Message has been received from the Dáil:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Standing Order 105 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In case of disagreement between the Seanad and the Dáil in regard to any Bill, the Seanad may, on motion made with or without notice, propose a conference between members representing both Houses for the purpose of discussing the points of disagreement. Any motion for a conference shall specify the purpose for which the conference is desired and the number of representatives of the Seanad proposed to be appointed.</P>
      <P>I think that the disagreement in regard to this Bill is a proper subject for conference. The Schedule inserted by the Seanad is a very good Schedule.  However, amendments might possibly be agreed to in conference which would leave the principle of the Schedule which the House accepted intact and which might make the Schedule acceptable to the Dáil.  In view of that, I propose:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="7" />&ldquo;That it is desirable that a conference be held between members representing the Seanad and the Dáil for the purpose of considering the amendments made by the Seanad to the Electoral (Revision of Constituencies) Bill, 1934, and that the number of Senators be five.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I second that.  These amendments were considered following the passing of the Bill in Dáil Eireann.  I think that this is more a matter for the Dáil than for this House and, if the figures are examined, it will be found that the amendments sent up by the Seanad were rejected by a very considerable majority in the other House.  It is rather an unusual course to have a joint committee of this nature and, for that reason, I question whether it is wise for the Seanad to interfere in the matter, which is largely one for the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm certain Orders which have been made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  These Orders are: Emergency Order No. 23; Emergency Order No. 25; Emergency Order No. 30, and Emergency Order No. 31.  Emergency Order No. 23 imposed an additional customs duty of 4/8 per cwt. on sugar.  These duties were imposed following representations made as to the necessity for protecting the sugar-beet industry against unfair competition from abroad.  When Emergency, Order No. 23 came into operation it was found that the provisions in regard to stocks on hand on midnight of the 6th February would operate inequitably against the merchant who held dutiable stocks as against the merchant who was just about to import sugar.  For example, a trader who imported, say, 20 tons of liquid glucose on the 5th February would be charged an excise duty at the rate of 4/8 per cwt., whereas if the article arrived subsequent to the imposition of the duty he would be charged at the rate of 2/1½ per cwt.  A similar position existed in regard to sugar not exceeding 98 degrees polarisation, and also in the case of molasses.  As it was not the intention of the Government to penalise traders in this way Emergency Order No. 25 was made.  It provided that, in the case of sugar stocks in hand of a polarisation of not less than 98 degrees, molasses and glucose, the excise duty should be at the rate of 2/4 per cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emergency Order No. 30 revoked wholly a number of previous Emergency Orders, and, in part, the Emergency <Col N="10" /> Imposition of Duties (No. 5) Order following on the inclusion of the duties previously chargeable under these orders in the Finance Act of this year.  Emergency Order No. 31 was made on the 15th May, 1934.  It imposed an excise duty of 5/- on every pig carcase, or part of a pig carcase, used for conversion into bacon for sale on any premises in the Saorstát.  The circumstances leading up to the making of the order were briefly as follows: It was found that in practice bacon exporters were filling the bacon quota to Great Britain and Northern Ireland at a loss, owing to the fact that the price for bacon on the home market was substantially higher than the nett sum realised on bacon exported.  As failure to fill the bacon quota to Great Britain and Northern Ireland would, or might, have been a serious matter in view of the probability that the quota in future periods would be reduced to actual exports, it became necessary to introduce arrangements which would enable exporters to fill their quota.  Following on discussions with representatives of the trade, it was decided that the most equitable method of dealing with the situation would be to impose an excise duty on all pigs, alive or dead, used for conversion into bacon for sale, and to pay an increased bounty on exported bacon.  These, briefly, are the four Emergency Orders which it is proposed under this Bill to confirm and which it is desirable should be done now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Emergency Order dealing with sugar, I suggest that the House would like to have from the Minister a little more explanation with regard to that duty.  As it is a peculiar method of raising money, arising out of the Minister's explanation, I should like to ask in what respect there was unfair competition. I understood him to say that the duty was put on to protect the beet sugar produced in this country against unfair competition.  It is desirable that the Minister should explain the nature of the unfair competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone admits that the last Budget was a good one, and that if one wanted to pick holes in it it could not be done.  But I hope the <Col N="11" /> people's eyes are opened now, when they realise that it is not one Budget we have in the year, but a series of Budgets.  This Emergency Order puts a duty of 4/8 per cwt. on sugar.  That really means putting a tax of £500,000 on the people.  Because that did not come in under the Budget they do not realise that they are paying it.  I am not saying that all the money is going into the Exchequer, but it will all be paid by the people.  As the tax is not imposed on Irish manufactured sugar but on foreign sugar, that means that the price of the home article will also be raised, and that the people are paying £500,000 which was not dealt with in the Budget.  The sooner it is realised that these Emergency Orders are really a series of Budgets, the better for everyone.  Taxation is increasing.  This Government are adepts at trying to increase taxation without letting the people know it, and they do so through these Emergency Orders.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Bagwell that we should have a fuller explanation about the increased duty on sugar, because it is going to affect everyone, particularly the poor people whose interests this Government professes to have in mind.  They said so at the Kildare by-election and at two general elections, so that, in justice to the poor, we should have a fuller explanation of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the duty on foreign bacon, there is a levy of 5/- a head on bacon pigs exported, the result being that that falls on producers. A quota has been fixed by England but we have failed to fill the quota, and the levy of 5/- a head is imposed in order to stabilise the export price between here and England and to fill the quota.  In addition an increased bounty has to be paid by the taxpayers so as to maintain the quota. Producers here have to bear the impost of 5/- a head, and the general taxpayers have to bear an impost of something like 28/- per cwt. to maintain the export quota.  The result is that there is a scarcity of bacon in this country. That was brought to my notice lately as a director of the co-operative society in Waterford.  There is a scarcity of <Col N="12" /> hard-cured bacon in the West of Ireland, arising from the exclusion of outside bacon, while there is an impost of 28/- a cwt. and a levy of 5/- a head on producers and consumers here.  That requires some explanation. The people here have to bear the brunt of the cost because every producer and consumer is affected while, at the same time, cheap bacon is being supplied to people across the water.</P>

      <P>I wish to know how this impost on consumers of sugar is going to benefit beet growers.  When this Government came into power, I think it was the Minister for Agriculture announced with a great flourish of trumpets that they were going to put a tax on tea, because it was a luxury, and to relieve sugar which was a necessity, especially for the children of the poor.  This is another quick change on the part of the Government, a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. I expect a very strong protest from the Labour people, who are the bosses of the Government, about this impost on the poor.</P>

      <P>In connection with this duty on sugar, am I right in saying that the sugar produced in this country was not found sufficient, and that for that reason other sugar was brought in? How was it that if the sugar was imported in February, as I understand from the Minister it was, it was not included or referred to in the Budget which did not come along until May? He must have had notice of that, and must have known at the time that sugar would have to be imported and have to pay the tax.  As a result the Minister has got rather a windfall, as I should call it, of £500,000.  He has not told us what he is going to do with that money. Is it merely going to swell the surplus at the end of the year, or to be used for other purposes?  If so, is the Minister in a position to tell us for what purpose the £500,000 will be used?  It is a considerable sum of money.  As I do not understand the bacon question I cannot discuss it.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to the matter from another angle, and to ask the Minister to give us specific figures as to what he expects the new retail price of sugar to be after the duty is imposed.  I have been looking through certain retail prices for the last two years, and I was agreeably surprised to find that while a good number of articles have not increased in price, sugar, which is essentially consumed by the poor, has substantially increased.  Speaking from recollection I think sugar was 2½d. per lb. two years ago, but I remember distinctly that the retail price now, according to an authoritative source, is 4d. per lb.  If this duty will lead to a further increase, I think the Minister is placing a very severe and a hidden burden on the poor.  I desire to reinforce what Senator Guinness said, that it is most unsatisfactory to have this duty put on at a time like this which, although it is passed on to the consumer as a hidden taxation, is in every sense a burden the same as indirect taxation imposed through the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator Sir John Keane should be astonished at the price of sugar going up.  I think the Minister told us, when we adopted this policy of making our own sugar, and putting on a duty in order to keep other sugar which might compete with it out of the country, that the people would have to spend I think it was considerably over a million&mdash;I am speaking from memory&mdash; more on their sugar than if we had not established this local industry.  I did not expect that this duty would have been imposed on the people until we were ready to produce our own sugar.  What happened last February was that we were not prepared to produce our own sugar, but we were quite prepared to see that the citizens paid more for their sugar, and paid the money into the Exchequer. Therefore, this duty of 4/8 per cwt. was put on long before the local factories were able to supply the sugar that the country needed. The consequence of that, I take it, was that the Exchequer made out of the people in a certain time, while we were still importing sugar, something like <Col N="14" /> half-a-million.  As Senator Guinness said, that has not been budgeted for, and was not mentioned, as far as I know, in the Budget; but it is there, and is being paid by the people.  Why it was put on before we were able to make our own sugar is a question that I should like to hear answered.  It was only another method of raising revenue from the people of which no mention was made in the Budget.</P>
      <P>If we are going to have Orders of this description made to raise money for the State without having been included in the Budget we can see that the Budget is of very little use to us. That is the important question which we ought to consider in discussing these Orders.  There is an enormous number of them.  We are only considering four to-day.  They were issued between February and May last, and we are only hearing about them now.  This is the first time we have had an opportunity of inquiring into them.  I should have thought that when Orders like that were made, involving such a sum of money, we would have heard about them very quickly. What is the good of talking about them now when the public have paid the money, and it is in the Exchequer? How long is this to go on?  I do not think that we are able yet to produce the amount of sugar required.  I suppose this duty is now being paid by the citizens.  What is the point of it? It is extracting money out of a lot of poor people.  The justification for extracting the money will be clear enough when we get our factories established, and we want to get a market for the produce of the factories, but it is not clear now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not been able to supply the sugar in the past; I do not know whether we are now; but the people have been taxed as if we were.  The price of the sugar that the factories produce will be such that a duty of this kind, to prevent the importation of foreign sugar which would bring the price down so that our factories could not pay, will be required in order to keep the price of sugar up.  Why should we have it now?  I should like the Minister to tell us what the real situation is.  We are considering now <Col N="15" /> in August what was done last February.  A large sum of money is involved.  Why do we only get it now? What is the financial state of affairs? How long will it be before the factories can produce the sugar required, and the money will be applied in support of an established factory, and not be a mere addition to the revenue?  These are the things that occur to one.</P>
    <P>The Bacon Order, I take it, has something to do with the same kind of thing.  The Minister, no doubt, will tell us what that means.  The queer thing is that one of these&mdash;No. 30&mdash;is just one mass of revocations.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us about it.  It looks as if the people outside would say: &ldquo;Here are a lot of duties that have been put on and have been running for a certain time, but for one reason or another it was found they were not working.  Here is an Order revoking a whole pile of them.&rdquo;  I think the Minister ought to give us a little insight into the operation of the system, and tell us how it works; what is the object of it, and why these revocations are necessary.  These are things that the public are enquiring about, and the Minister should enlighten us.</P>

      <P>As to the question of sugar, I think the Seanad will remember that there was such a thing as the Sugar Beet Bill and that it was agreed upon in the proposals then put forward that the public were to pay ½d. per lb. in order that the farmers who grow beet at 30/- per ton will be paid.  The beet was sown last spring.  It will be marketed very soon and the farmers will want the money.  Probably this is the money out of which the Minister will be paying the farmers.  If that is the case, I will not grumble.  Anything you can give the farmers they are always very anxious to receive.  I remember hearing about this ½d. in connection with the Budget.  It is mixed up with the general beet proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a great deal of this debate has proceeded on a misapprehension for which possibly I myself am somewhat to blame.  I took it that the Seanad would have apprehended the circumstances under which <Col N="16" /> the additional duty of 4/8 was imposed by an Emergency Order.  It was in fact a non-effective duty.  It was imposed in February when the Sugar Beet Company found itself in this position: that due to concerted dumping from abroad foreign sugar was being offered here at such a price as would have prevented the Sugar Beet Company from clearing its stocks at the normal figure&mdash;the figure at which they had been accustomed to clear these stocks in preceding years&mdash;and which would have left them with the whole output of last year's campaign on hands.  It happened that the amount of sugar which they had in stock would carry us on reasonably until the commencement of this year's campaign.  In order to ensure that these stocks would be cleared in the normal way this Emergency Order was made in February and provided for the imposition of a customs duty upon imported sugar and an excise duty on stocks of imported sugar, so that people who had forestalled and taken advantage of these low offers would not be able to take advantage, at a cost to the consumers, of the position which the Emergency Order would create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the making of the order, representations were made which convinced me that it would be unfair to the importers who had already imported sugar and upon whom an excise duty would have been levied in the ordinary way, to charge them the full rate.  The effective amount of the duty actually levied on imported stocks coming into consumption here was at the rate of 2/2 per cwt.  The difference between the price at which this sugar had been delivered here&mdash;the imported foreign manufactured sugar&mdash;and the price which the ordinary wholesale distributor would have to pay for the Carlow factory sugar was something like 10/- a cwt.  The importer was therefore mulcted to the extent of the difference between 2/2 and 10/-, but owing to the fact that the Carlow sugar was being sold at the old price, the price to the consumer was not increased.  I am not in a position to say whether the price to the consumer will not be increased, but if it is increased in the future the Seanad must remember that it is an important element in connection <Col N="17" /> with the whole sugar scheme that we should put on a duty of ½d. or ¾d. on sugar and that in the normal way this would be put on some time in November of this year.  Consideration had also to be given to the Parliamentary arrangements which have been made, and which might prevent us from imposing a customs duty in the ordinary way in November.</P>
    <P>The position which we are in is this: Some people have had to pay the excise duty.  Those are the people who imported foreign manufactured sugar. The net burden imposed upon these people as compared with what would have to be borne by those who bought sugar from the Carlow factory is the difference between 9d. or 10d. and 2/2; it would amount to about 1/4 a cwt.  Up to the present there has been practically no increase, due to the fact that the Carlow stocks are being liquidated.  So far as the general consumer is concerned, there is no increase in the price of sugar, and so far as the Exchequer is concerned, we have only benefited to the extent of the 2/2 imposed as an excise duty upon the stocks of imported sugar.  It is not a very considerable amount.  It certainly does not come to £500,000.  I doubt if we have got £40,000 or £50,000 out of it.  We got it as an incidental circumstance and not as a major budgetary consideration.</P>
    <P>The proposal to confirm the Emergency Order is due to the fact that I felt, in view of the statements made in the Dáil and Seanad that an additional customs duty would have to be imposed upon imported sugar when the sugar beet companies came into operation, it would not be the right thing to allow the emergency order to run its course and then reimpose this duty, as we would have to, by emergency order.  I preferred to allow the Dáil and Seanad to discuss it.  We are merely anticipating by a month or six weeks, due to the exigencies of Parliamentary time, a customs duty which we would have to impose in the ordinary way under our original proposals for the establishment of a sugar beet industry.  The factories are under construction now and they will have to come into production in due course. <Col N="18" /> It is my desire to keep to the lower of the two figures mentioned when the sugar beet proposition was before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised about the excise duty imposed on bacon, I think the two considerations are, first of all, what was the effect of this imposition of an excise duty on the price to our consumers and, secondly, upon the price to our producers.  I am told that there has been no increase in the price of bacon since the excise duty went on, and that there has been no decrease in the price paid to producers of pigs.  So far as the mass of the population is concerned, the order has made no change.  It has made important changes in regard to the bacon manufacturers.  The position in which the Minister for Agriculture and certain bacon manufacturers found themselves was this, that there were some manufacturers unwilling to bear their fair share in filling the quota.  It was impossible to get agreement between them, and this emergency duty was intended to make it less profitable for the bacon manufacturers to sell their bacon at home than it had been before the duty went on.  We have heard a great deal about the British market. This imposition has been put on the bacon manufacturers in order to compel them to do their duty to the community, and to the farmers, and to fill the quotas allotted to us.  It has had no other reaction.  The price of bacon to the consumer has not gone up, and the price to the producer of pigs has not gone down.</P>

If the Minister says he wants this Bill to-day, and gives us some positive reason, good and well; but to say that we should pass this as a matter of form after listening to the Minister, and without having time to think it over, seems to be rather straining the thing.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time past&mdash;perhaps, the last four or five years&mdash;there has been a Co-operative Bill in preparation by my Department.  It is rather an elaborate Bill and, when it does appear, will be one of the most massive documents that ever was presented to the Oireachtas.  There are, however, a few matters that are very urgent in connection with co-operative legislation and we have thought it advisable to take these few matters out of that Bill and to have them hurried along before the big Bill comes before the Oireachtas, possibly about Christmas time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two matters dealt with in this Bill.  The position in some co-operative societies is that they need money.  The co-operative societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of 1893 are not entitled to take benefit under the present law.  The second point we <Col N="20" /> think urgent is the matter of loans issued by the Agricultural Credit Organisation in regard to these societies.  First as regards debentures. These co-operative societies cannot give debentures.  The result is that when a co-operative society is in difficulties the committee is compelled to go to a bank and the bank, in providing a loan for the society, asks for the personal guarantee of members of the committee. That has certain reactions. In the first place men cannot be members of the committee unless they are men of standing.  Therefore the smaller suppliers are no use to the committee because they would be no use to the bank.  So that the first reaction is that in the ordinary way the bigger men in the district are put on the committee because they are good marks in the eyes of the bank and having once given their names to the bank they must be left on the committee.  So that the whole spirit of co-operation is destroyed. You have the same men reelected on the committee: they must be re-elected because they have given their names to the banks.</P>
    <P>In the past, when many co-operative societies have gone down, the banks have come forward to claim what was due to them, and, not getting enough through the liquidation of the society, they have claimed from the individual members of the committee.  We have cases of where good, public-spirited men in a district have been absolutely ruined because they were guarantors for such co-operative societies.  There you find the best type of men in the district willing to come in and sign their names on behalf of the co-operative society.  The cute, selfish type do not do so.  They get all they can out of the society, but take care that if it goes down they lose nothing; it is the decent man that loses all.  It is only fair that if there is loss, the society, as a whole, should suffer in such a case. That is why it became rather urgent to allow that some societies&mdash;fairly big societies&mdash;should be allowed to offer debentures for loans.  It is stated in this Bill that they can only get debentures from certain institutions, such as the ordinary banks, the Agricultural Corporation, the Industrial <Col N="21" /> Credit Corporation, and the Dairy Disposals Board.  The people from whom they can get credit are limited. There is also the precaution here that the Minister for Agriculture must certify that the society is eligible, and, secondly, the Minister must sanction the loan.</P>
    <P>These precautions are put in to prevent societies going into large expenditure at the present moment that perhaps is really not needed nor justified. When the main Bill comes into force there will be a Registrar, but the difficulty here is to get somebody to act as Registrar until the main Bill comes on.  The Registrar of the Industrial and Provident Society was not willing to undertake that duty, and the Minister for Agriculture is named more or less to fulfil the function until the main Bill is brought before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The second point is as to loans issued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation to certain creameries.  About 1929 I think a number of new creameries were built, particularly in the midlands, and the way they were financed was particularly favourable to the shareholders. The shareholders paid in about half-crown per £1 share, and on the uncalled portion of the share&mdash; 17/6&mdash;the Agricultural Credit Corporation gave a loan to the society to build and equip the creamery, and to provide a sum to carry on.  A large number of farmers in a district, by putting down a comparatively small deposit, were in the position to start a creamery, and become absolute owners of it, because the Agricultural Credit Corporation could not call in its loan quicker than a stated period&mdash;that is, at the rate of 2/6 per annum for seven years, so that it would take seven years to pay that off.  But at the time it was stated that the Agricultural Credit Corporation were not sure that the society was legally entitled to give the Credit Corporation the necessary loan. The Credit Corporation was assured by my predecessor, or by the officials working under him, that that matter would be made right in the Co-operative Bill which was to be introduced. It was to deal with that particular matter, and make it right.  When <Col N="22" /> made a legal charge upon the uncalled capital, the Agricultural Credit Corporation will be entitled to collect its outstanding shares so far as the law is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible, though there is some doubt about it, that if the Credit Corporation proceeded to collect without this Bill they would be entitled to do so.  But as there is a doubt, it was felt to be only fair that we should take this opportunity to redeem the promise made by my predecessor in 1929.  These are the only two points dealt with in this Bill.  There is just one other matter I should mention. We are only dealing here with agricultural co-operative Societies.  The Agricultural Co-operative Society is more or less correctly defined in sub-section (4) of Section 3.  That is, it must be, first of all, a co-operative society under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act.  Secondly, it must be mainly agricultural; and, thirdly, it is in want of funds.  If the society can make its case, then the Minister for Agriculture may certify that it is an agricultural co-operative society under this Act. Once certified that it is so, then that society may go out and look for debentures and make its arrangements.  But having made its arrangements, then the transaction must be sanctioned by the Minister for Agriculture before that particular transaction becomes legal.</P>
    <P>In reading through the sections that come afterwards, it might appear to Senators that we were taking rather drastic powers to control co-operative societies, but Senators must remember we are only taking powers to watch very closely agricultural co-operative societies; that is, societies that have come under this Act and have got a loan under this Act or are seeking a loan.  Once they become agricultural co-operative societies and come under this Act, I have very definite powers controlling them with regard to their change of rules and so on.  These are the two main points dealt with in this Bill and, as I said in commencing, I hope that the main co-operative Bill, which is very badly needed from other points of view, will be brought forward as soon as possible.  There is a very great need of a general co-operative <Col N="23" /> agricultural Bill.  That Bill has been in preparation by the Department for the last five or six years and has now gone to the draughtsman, but it will take a long time to draft because on many points on which the draughtsman raises a difficulty we have, in turn, in my department to consult various interests affected by that Bill.  I hope, however, to have it before the Oireachtas, perhaps, between Christmas and Easter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a good deal of experience in co-operative societies.  A good many years ago the whole country was very enthusiastic about them and I, personally, started six or seven different societies in very poor districts in the West of Ireland. There were all sorts of prognostications to the effect that they would not do any good and so on.  Nevertheless, we went on, and I am sorry to say that the prognostications were right in a great many cases.  The people were enthusiastic at first and looked after the business in committees for a time, but gradually they began to think that it was getting on very well and they left matters entirely in the hands of secretaries.  As long as those secretaries were first-rate in character and everything else, things went on pretty well; but secretaries change and sometimes people got into that position who did not deserve to be in it, and the result was that several of these societies became bankrupt on two or three different occasions.  Each time it was put right again and worked for a while.  I was a good deal disappointed that this should be the case, but it was not the fault of the people themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committees which the Minister has mentioned did undertake to pledge themselves for interest with the bank and they carried on in that way.  At first we were told that nobody would pay us and that the money would be all lost.  However, that did not happen on any single occasion.  There was not one occasion in which there was a single pound left unpaid.  We bought chemical manures in Dublin, transported them down and distributed <Col N="24" /> them through the country, and in no case was there any person who bought those manures who did not pay the money for them within a few months after getting the manures.  We started a bank in the same way to help it and had a small capital put into it.  We warned the people that it was only meant to help poor people and that we did not expect rich people to come to the bank.  The result of that explanation was very extraordinary.  Nobody asked for any money.  When we asked them why they did not ask for it, they said that they were able to buy themselves and that they had money of their own.  We explained to them that if they were in poor circumstances there was no reason why they should not borrow this money.  After a while we persuaded a number of people to borrow money, and very reluctant they were.  I am speaking now of the far West of Ireland&mdash;the very poorest districts&mdash;and they are the most honest people in the world, because every single one of them paid up the money due by them.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty is to keep up the interest in this matter.  People lose interest after a while and leave it to somebody else to carry on.  They have their own work to do, and they do not bother about this.  They think that the priest or somebody else will look after it, and so it falls into bad hands.  I do not know, but I think that this Bill will have a good effect.  At all events, I think that it is desirable that it should be tried so as to see what can be done, because, certainly, there were faults underlying the original ones.  They failed, and there was always a reason for failure.  Things may not have been so bad in the richer parts of the country.  Many of them still exist, and are still carrying on.  I do not see that there is any necessity for failure.  What is really wanted is to have two or three people in the district who will give personal attention to the matter and see that things go on right.  If you have not that it will be rather difficult to carry on.  I, for one, would vote in favour of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Bill is something like the curate's egg&mdash;<Col N="25" /> parts of it are good, and there are other parts that require very considerable attention.  There is no question that its intentions towards the bankers and the Agricultural Credit Corporation are excellent.  I think that also its intentions are excellent as regards the people to whom the Minister has referred; that is, people who, being patriotic, put their names down for sums of money as guarantors for those societies.  To put it shortly, the way the Bill really works for all of them is the grip it is going to give upon the uncalled capital of those various societies.  To enable these things to be carried out, I should like the seanad to look carefully at the conditions of Section 4, because here a thing is being done which, if it were being done to other businesses than agricultural co-operative societies, would lead to a tremendous lot of trouble, and it is a thing for which, if the directors of companies chose to act on it, they would probably be put in jail; because it says here in Section 4 that no matter whether according to the articles of association the issue of debentures is or is not authorised, or is or is not forbidden by the rules of the society, these debentures can be issued now when this becomes an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us&mdash;directors of companies at any rate&mdash;must work according to the rules and articles of association of the company or, as in this case, the society. This Bill goes on in this case and it says in effect: &ldquo;We will scrap all orders and regulations and articles of association on which this society was originally founded.&rdquo;  When this Bill is passed, the ruling body or committee, I suppose, of this co-operative society will have power to do a thing which according to the articles of association they had no power to do at all.  The individual who seems to be hurt in this case is the ordinary shareholder.  The ordinary shareholder comes into this thing.  What has happened is something like this: He took, say, a £1 share and he paid upon that £1 share 2/6, leaving 17/6 due on it.  Then the committee of management borrowed from the bank some money to carry on, because the 2/6 paid on the £1 share <Col N="26" /> did not give them enough working capital.  But the shareholder knew what his articles of association were, and he knew that the committee of management had no right to issue debentures.  He knew there were probably various other things which they could not do in the way of pledging the credit of the association to put charges of which he was not aware upon his unpaid capital.</P>
    <P>This Bill enables the society to issue debentures and to give an outside lender a right of action against the ordinary shareholders of the society&mdash; a right which did not exist previously. It is giving a right on which as an ordinary shareholder he will have no opportunity of expressing his opinion. If there were a section here to say that before the society could go to the Minister and ask for leave to issue debentures, they should summon a meeting of their shareholders and that if the thing is approved of by the shareholders, then this matter would be all right as they would have an opportunity of accepting the liability.  I dare say the matter could be worked in that way.  But to say that we are to take away the right from the shareholder of having any voice in this way in the management of the affairs of the society is quite a different thing.  This was a right which he was guaranteed when the society was originally established: the issuing of debentures was a thing which the committee could not do. Making such a thing legal here is a thing we have no right to do.  In some way or another, this Bill should be so altered that the shareholders would have a voice before any application is made to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Take the case where a society is now in existence.  Such a society could be wound up and the loss on the winding up of that society would mean a loss to the ordinary shareholder of, say, 10/- per share.  In such a case it would be open to the members of the society to say: &ldquo;We will suffer the loss of the 10/- per share and wind up the society.&rdquo;  Under this Bill, without the ordinary shareholders being consulted at all, the managers of the society could issue these debentures, <Col N="27" /> giving to the institution, from which they are borrowing the money, a right over the uncalled capital of the society whether the members like it or not. The result may be that the shareholder who is willing to lose 10/- on the winding up of the society or company may find himself in the position that when eventually the society or company is wound up he may have to pay 17/6 of his unpaid capital, and this without ever having been asked a question about it or consulted about it.  That is a point that I would ask the House to consider in connection with this Bill. That, at all events, is my reading of this section and it is a correct reading, because I have asked several people to look into it and they say that this gives the right to the managers of the society to issue debentures which will be a charge on the ordinary shareholders without asking by your leave or with your leave.</P>
    <P>I suppose the objects of the Bill are really quite good.  As to the present lenders to the society&mdash;the creditors&mdash; we have to consider Section 7 of the Bill.  That section talks of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, which it puts ahead of everybody else. It enables them to come in now where the society had no right to issue debentures.  This is a very extraordinary phrase to put into an Act of Parliament &ldquo;that when such loan was so made there was an arrangement or understanding between the said corporation and such society.&rdquo;  In the name of goodness, who is going to give you any evidence as to what that arrangement or understanding was?  It is a talk between some manager or representative of the society and some official of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited.  It will be a case of what one representative was told by another when the loan was being got by the society.  Will people lend their money on such an agreement?  Who could go into a court of law on such an understanding?  We are legalising such an understanding.  Really, putting such a thing into an Act of Parliament seems to me to be accepting a principle which we should not accept.  I do not think you ought, by an Act of <Col N="28" /> Parliament, sanction an agreement made between two individuals of whom we have no knowledge whatever.</P>
    <P>Here we are sanctioning such an agreement and giving on the strength of that prescription a right to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited to get debentures and to come in and rank before other creditors.  Undoubtedly, when they get these debentures the other creditors of that society will be in a much worse position than they were before these debentures were issued.  This is another point that I would like the Senators to consider&mdash; whether it is wise, in a Bill of this nature, to put in a sanction and make legal the mere word of mouth agreement between two officials.  That is a thing that nobody should do.  These are the two things which step over bounds.  They are things which the Oireachtas ought not to do.</P>
    <P>There is not much more to be said about the Bill.  The rest of the measure seems to be all right.  As a banker, I have not the slightest objection to the Bill.  I do not think there can be any objection to it except on these two points.  Bankers would be unonimous on that.  I submit that the Seanad ought to look into the rights of the individual shareholders and see whether we can, by amendment, or otherwise, protect them against these things. Senators should consider whether they ought to sanction such clauses as these to which I have objected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the criticism of Senator Jameson is well founded.  On both points made I put forward two amendments rather with a view to eliciting from the Minister some information. These he has partly met. Touching the latter part of Senator Jameson's speech, as I understand from the discussion in the Dáil, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, would require those powers only in the case of three or four societies.  It is only in these cases that they would be concerned with these special powers. It seems to me that the case the Minister wants to make could be met by putting into a schedule to the Bill these particular societies, so that inquiry could be made as to the nature of the agreement or understanding. <Col N="29" /> In speaking on this Bill I prefer to call the shareholders of these societies members rather than shareholders. That is the practice in the case of the industrial societies.  I agree with Senator Jameson that there should be some obligation in this Bill that the members of the society will have to concur in the issue of these debentures before the certificate of the Minister is sought.  That is to say, before the committee of management has any power to make application to the Minister, the members of the society should first agree that the application should be made.</P>
      <P>I am rather curious to know whether it is expected or intended that only a few societies shall apply for these certificates, or if it is intended that societies, as a general rule, shall apply for them.  The Minister here to-day referred to the practice of societies getting a few substantial men in the locality to go bail and to become members of the committee.  He wants to remedy that, but if the purpose of this section of the Bill is to induce societies, as a general rule, to seek certificates of this kind, then it seems to me that there should be some further amendment.  If that is to be the expectation, then agricultural co-operative societies are going to be segregated into two classes&mdash;that group which has sought these certificates, and that group which has not sought these certificates. We all think that we understand what an agricultural co-operative society is, but in future we shall not understand what an agricultural co-operative society is unless we have some evidence that it is a certified society&mdash;that is to say, that it has obtained a certificate for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that if we are going to assume that this power will be sought generally by the societies for the purpose of remedying this evil which has grown up amongst societies, then we should consider some of the later sections of the Bill.  Take Section 11, to which I have put forward an amendment. If societies in general are to become certified under this Bill, then the position is going to be that the Minister will have power to prevent a society from fulfilling its traditional functions of being a voluntary <Col N="30" /> organisation capable of changing its rules.  I understand now from the Minister's statement to-day that this term, &ldquo;the Minister,&rdquo; is only intended as a temporary requirement until a registrar is appointed under the new Bill that is in contemplation.  But at present we have a registrar of friendly societies, industrial and provident societies, etc.  He is bound to approve of any alteration of rules if it is within the law.  He is bound to approve of the alterations before they become operative.  I cannot see the necessity for this departure&mdash;why in addition to the approval of the registrar there has to be specific approval by the Minister of a particular Department as to a change of rules in such a voluntary society.</P>
    <P>In Section 8, there is another point to which I have put forward an amendment. The section provides that where a society has applied for and obtained sanction in regard to debentures, whenever any part of the called-up capital of the society is applied, in contravention of the section, every member of the committee shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a fine of £25.  I would ask the Minister to explain the position that might arise where you had a committee of management, consisting let us say of six members. Five of them might have voted for an undesirable or illegal proposal and one against it.  That one is going to be made suffer equally with the five. That appears to me to be, on the face of it, unjust.  It throws an obligation on him, or on any other larger minority, to retire immediately from his position as a committee man and possibly, even probably, leave the society in a position of ill-direction because such men would likely be most valuable members of the committee.  I think it is unjust to make a minority of just men suffer for the sins of the majority of unjust men.  I do not know what line the Minister might take in remedying that defect but he might take a leaf out of the recently enacted law relating to local government under which the names of members of local authorities, who vote for a particular proposal that is illegal, are taken. They are made to pay a penalty or to suffer an obligation.  That might be a <Col N="31" /> way of meeting this particular point, but it should certainly not be made an offence carrying a penalty where a person opposes the action of a committee but is overborne by the majority of the committee.  He should not be made liable for the offences of the majority.</P>
    <P>If the proposed Co-operative Bill is going to set up a special registrar whose functions will be very similar to the functions of the present registrar of friendly societies&mdash;industrial and provident societies&mdash;then I would have little objection to Section 11, but I would have a strong objection to giving this power to the Minister to override the action of a society in respect to alterations of rules.  The precedent that such a change of the law in respect to this class of voluntary society would make, might be a very dangerous one. I certainly would like to have some strong assurance as to the effect of this section and the Government's proposals for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is a Bill that requires to be examined very carefully.  It raises a totally new principle with regard to the control by the Minister of what has hitherto been regarded as an independent and autonomous concern.  Whether that concern is registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts or under the ordinary Companies Joint Stock Acts makes no substantial difference to the principle where the ostensible object of the Bill is to give co-operative societies power to raise debentures without the embarrassment of such debentures becoming a bill of sale.  Senator Comyn is not here and I am not clear as to what objection is involved in a bill of sale.  I know it is more serious and that it does create alarm in the minds of creditors but surely it would be possible by a simple Act to remove that stigma and to give co-operative societies powers to raise money in the same way as any other company?  That would appear to me to fulfil all that was really necessary in the present case.  Instead of that we have all this elaboration, to which we are now getting used, of bureaucratic control over the lives, destinies and <Col N="32" /> actions of every citizen.  I would first of all, in regard to Section 2, ask the Minister why an individual is not eligible to become an authorised lender?  There has been a good deal of misconception in the debate heretofore as to what is involved in the finances of these societies.</P>
      <P>We have heard about the banks.  We know that they are creditors, secured or unsecured.  In the case of co-operative societies, they are generally very well secured&mdash;secured on joint and several guarantees and, very often, on one or two strong names.  I mention that case because nobody appears to have referred to the position of the guarantors.  The guarantors are really behind the banks, and the banks are happy because they can always pass the burden on to the guarantors.  It is quite conceivable that, in a case of this kind, the bank would call in the guarantee and, if one or more strong men amongst the guarantors be put in their place, is it not only just that such guarantor or guarantors should be allowed to seek a debenture?  The guarantor may possibly be the chief creditor involved and, yet, under this Bill, no individual can become an authorised lender.  I consulted a certain authority who is expert in the management of these co-operative societies, and he sees no objection whatever to having an individual, same as a corporate body, an authorised lender.  I shall introduce an amendment to secure that at the proper time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next comes a very important point raised by Senator Jameson&mdash;the power of the Minister to impose, without the consent of the shareholders, debentures on the society.  That is a very drastic and, conceivably, a very unjust act. Incidentally, since I discussed this matter with Senator Jameson, the same authority to whom I have referred told me that that is not the case.  I should like the Minister to pay particular attention to this.  The authority with whom I recently had a conversation says that the shareholders have to agree in every case to the creation of a debenture.  Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us on that point because, if the Minister has power under the Bill <Col N="33" /> to create a debenture, I hope the Seanad will not pass the Bill.  Look at the position when a debenture is registered as a bill of sale, or merely registered as a debenture.  Companies are loth to create debentures, because it puts creditors on the alert.  If the Minister can create a debenture, when that debenture is registered the ordinary trade creditors and the guarantors will become aware of it and, if they are alive to their interest, they will proceed to writ the society and pull it down.  In that way, the Minister will have created a position, without the authority of the shareholders, which may have very serious consequences for the society.  This particular power has been introduced for the first time, so far as I know, into an Act of Parliament, and it should be very closely examined by this House.</P>
    <P>A further question arises as to the power of the Minister to withhold authority if the shareholders desire to create a debenture.  Why should they not be allowed to raise a debenture if debentures are permissible under the Act?  Why should the Minister have authority to refuse shareholders the right to create debentures if debentures are permissible under the Act without the attachment thereto of the conditions of a bill of sale?  These societies have always been autonomous bodies.  What is the justification for coming down on one class only of societies under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act and applying to that class this very drastic form of legislation?  Senator Jameson referred to another point, though he did not mention guarantors in connection with it.  The guarantors or shareholders may say that they are masters and owners of the society.  Do not let us forget that, however important the public interest may be, ownership still remains in the legal body&mdash;the people who promoted the society and put up the shares.  They may say: &ldquo;We can go into liquidation now and get out with 10/- in the £1.  If debentures are created without our authority, further commitments are involved, prior liens are created and the assets of the society pass out of our hands into the hands of another authority which holds <Col N="34" /> the debentures.&rdquo;  That seems to be most unjust and it can only be remedied by making the owners the final authority in a matter of this kind. The Minister may say that by creating debentures and by lending the society more money, the society can be put on its feet and the loans of the past recovered. That is only a matter of opinion.  Guarantors or shareholders may say: &ldquo;We do not agree with you. We think that you are increasing the obligations of the society and depriving us of our right to put the society into liquidation and get out as best we can.&rdquo;  That attitude on the part of the Minister would seem to be very wrong and very unjust, and I hope this matter will be dealt with on the Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to make quite clear to us what power he is taking under the Bill.  Is he taking greater power than the Registrar of Industrial and Provident Societies already possesses?  I am not quite clear as to what powers the Registrar does possess at present.  He has power to scrutinise and refuse or approve of the rules of the society, but under what conditions I do not know.  If the society wants to raise a debenture in the form at present permissible, can the Registrar say &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  If a society wants to increase its borrowing powers, can the Registrar say &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  That is a matter on which I should like the Minister to inform the House.  Senator Jameson dealt with the very important point as to the placing of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in a position of a preferred creditor&mdash;an act that may, as I have already said, make other creditors anxious and force the society into liquidation.  I think I have said enough to show that this Bill raises new principles which should be carefully examined by this House.  Time will be required to frame amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to be a member of the committee of an agricultural co-operative society.  I am not a very active member, but I feel a great responsibility in this matter.  I should like to express my appreciation of the criticism of the Bill which we have heard, especially from Senator <Col N="35" /> Jameson.  He has done a very great service to the ordinary shareholder, who does not bother about the management of these co-operative societies.  A few people on the committee do everything; the shareholders just pay their money when they are asked.  The society with which I am connected was several times on the brink of bankruptcy, and members of the committee, including myself, went around amongst the people and canvassed for membership and shares.  We are under a great responsibility to these people. I am very much alarmed by what I have heard, and I hope that every opportunity will be given to those people to understand the position in which they are placed.  As a rule, the managers of these societies manage everything, and I think that the Minister was more in touch with these managers than with the committees when he was framing this Bill.  That is my impression.  A few people are guarantors.  They are generally the better off members of a committee. They are in a very peculiar position with regard to this Bill.  I wish to thank the three Senators who have explained the position so clearly.  I hope that every care will be taken in connection with this matter.  The situation that will be created under this Bill is a most extraordinary one. I must confess that I did not understand it fully until I heard the criticisms made by the three Senators I have already spoken of.  As a result of their criticisms I feel very alarmed as regards the position of the ordinary shareholders of these societies.  I feel a certain amount of responsibility in the case of the people who were canvassed to put their money into the society which I belong to for the position they are in.  I hope that the matter will be put right before the Bill is allowed to become law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel this is a very useful and necessary measure.  There is one matter to which I would like to call the attention of the House.  It is contained in sub-section (1), paragraph (b) of Section 7, which gives power to the Minister to charge uncalled capital. The section provides:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" />&ldquo;(1)  Whenever the Minister is satisfied, on the application of the Agricultural Credit Corporation Limited,&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that money is owing to the said Corporation by a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, in respect of a loan made by the said Corporation to such society before the passing of this Act, and</P>
    <P>(b) that when such loan was so made there was an arrangement or understanding between the said Corporation and such society that the amount of such loan and the interest thereon would be secured.....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The point I wish to call attention to is this.  There are two words in paragraph (b) which are practically unknown to the law.</P>

      <P>The words are &ldquo;arrangement or understanding&rdquo;.  If it is an arrangement it must be an agreement: that is an agreement in law.  That is the construction that I consider would be put upon it: that it was an agreement known to the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The other is the word &ldquo;understanding.&rdquo;  Now, what is an &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;?  Is an understanding an agreement, and is it an enforceable agreement?  The reason why I think that the word &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; is a very unfortunate word is this: that I think in my earliest case at the Bar I happened to use the word &ldquo;understanding.&rdquo; I asked: &ldquo;Was there an understanding between ye that the price of the horse was £15?&rdquo;  The judge said to me: &ldquo;What do you mean by an understanding?  Was there an agreement or not?&rdquo;  I think that the word &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; is unfortunate in this section, and that it might really interfere with the smooth working of the measure.  I am sure that the Minister has probably considered it, but I think it would be a very dangerous thing if he was entitled or <Col N="37" /> allowed to act on an understanding which the court would not enforce.</P>

      <P>I desire to give my support to that part of the Bill which provides for the distribution of the debentures of a society rather than having the responsibility put on a few men.  I have known of cases where such men have been victimised on many occasions.  There are a few points on which I would like to have information from the Minister.  Will the Minister say if a society can create debentures to pay off an old outstanding debt, and whether this measure can be applied retrospectively in that connection?  Can it be applied retrospectively so that the lenders will be compelled to accept the newly created debentures?  Would a society for the curing of bacon say, be included in the category of agricultural societies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by the last Senator, under the definition section a bacon factory would come under this Bill.  As regards the other point he raised, these debentures could be issued to pay off an old debt, but there is nothing in the Bill to say that the lender of the old debt must accept the debentures.  There would have to be agreement between the society and the lender that the banker would accept the debentures in respect of the old debt.  That is a matter for agreement between the parties.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Johnson, I do not know if the Senator is satisfied with the present wording of the section. It appears to me that, if the offending committee is brought before the court, the judge would in all probability absolve all those who tried to keep within the law from any fine, and would, probably, inflict a fine on those who formed the majority of the committee and voted for doing the wrong thing.  If Senator Johnson is dissatisfied with that it may be possible to do something on another stage of the Bill to make the point more clear.  I think that Senator Jameson and Senator Sir John Keane are under a misapprehension with regard to Section 4.  It means <Col N="38" /> that it is the society that must agree and not the committee.  The society can only agree at a general meeting to which all the members are summoned. The shareholders, summoned to a general meeting for the purpose, must agree to the debentures being issued.  In fact, that must be done at an extraordinary general meeting.  All the members are notified of that meeting and the purpose for which it has been called.</P>
      <P>A member of a society who gets a notice, asking him to attend an extraordinary general meeting, is told what is the purpose of the meeting, to issue debentures.  He knows before going there that there is a question about issuing debentures, and every member has an equal voice, no matter what the number of shares, as to whether debentures shall be issued or not.  On the other hand, societies are absolved from the formality of changing rules specially for the issuing of debentures. When a general meeting approves of the issuing of debentures, societies are thereby authorised to do so without changing the rules for that purpose. If that wording was not in this Bill perhaps four general meetings would be required.  First of all one would be called with regard to changing the rules.  Senator Comyn will correct me if I am wrong, but a second meeting would have to be called to approve of that, after which another meeting would have to be called to issue the debentures.  Three meetings would have to be called to allow the society to get through the business. That would take some time, as there would be an interval of seven days or, perhaps, fourteen days between the meetings.  The object here is to give societies an opportunity of getting through the business quickly, by calling an extraordinary general meeting and doing the work at one meeting. Every member of a society has a voice, and no debentures can be issued unless the majority of the members agree to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked what Section 11 really means.  Senator Jameson was anxious to know what power we have.  We can only interfere with societies that come under this Bill.  They are to be called agricultural co-operative societies.  There is no such thing as an agricultural co-operative society at present, but once a society comes under the Bill, and is looking for debentures, it becomes an agricultural co-operative society.  It may not be any more agricultural than other societies, but that is the legal name a society will have when it comes under the Bill.  It is only these societies that the Minister for Agriculture can interfere with as regards the changing of rules.  In the main Co-operative Bill there will be three authorities.  There will be the Co-operative Council, which will be, more or less, formed much the same as the Agricultural Organisation Society.  Senators will recognise it better if I say that it is the one at Plunkett House.  The committee which will run the whole co-operative movement in the main Bill will be known as the Agricultural Co-operative Committee, or some such name, and will have certain functions over co-operative societies.  I am not sure whether that committee or the registrar will have <Col N="40" /> this function of saying whether a society shall be allowed to issue debentures or not.  One of them will have that power.  The point has not really been decided yet.  It will come up for discussion on the main Bill which will come before the Dáil and Seanad.  A registrar will be appointed to look after agricultural co-operative societies.  He will have certain functions, principally with regard to auditing and inquiring into the position of societies where there are defalcations, and to look into their affairs generally.  To a limited extent the Minister also comes into the main Co-operative Bill.  There are certain appeals to the Minister on a few points from the governing body elected by the societies, or from the registrar. Either the registrar or the governing body will have this function that the Minister has, the sanctioning of the issue of debentures by co-operative societies when that Bill comes along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an objection to a bill of sale even from the legal point of view. A society would be much more restricted. They cannot sell anything, practically, when there is a bill of sale there, without going through the formality of registering their sales.  There is much more freedom with debentures. Apart from the legal restrictions there is no doubt that people look upon a bill of sale as the last step.  If there is a bill of sale, a society's credit is ruined.  Debentures are not looked on the same way.  We know that some of the biggest and the most prosperous companies have debentures, and that that does not prevent them carrying on. I was asked why any society should be forbidden to issue debentures.  It was urged that if we must have power over the issuing of debentures, why not leave it to the societies to look for debentures, if they feel they needed them, and why should the Minister come into it?  My Department has been in consultation with the different co-operative interests, mainly the society at Plunkett House.  Other people are also interested in the co-operative movement, such as the I.A.W.S., and big bodies of that kind.  They are all agreed that while we should take their advice in co-operative matters, some body should have the giving of sanction <Col N="41" /> for the issue of debentures by societies.  We have not yet decided in the main Bill what that body should be.  I was asked if the Minister was taking powers which the registrar has not got.  The answer is yes.  If the Bill was to go through, giving societies powers to issue debentures without any mention of sanction from the Minister, then the registrar would have no control except to see that they complied with the law.  If everything was done legally the registrar would have no power to interfere.  The Minister is taking power that the registrar has not got, and would not have unless his name was specially mentioned in the Bill.  I mentioned, when introducing the Bill, that the Registrar of Industrial and Provident Societies was asked to take the power, but he refused to do so.  He said he did not think it was a matter for him, and that as we were taking over these powers in the near future, someone in the Department should take the power which could be passed on to the registrar, or to whoever may be appointed when the main Bill comes along.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that in the drafting of the main Co-operative Bill we have been in consultation with various advisers, if you like to call them that, of the co-operative movement.  We have consulted many times with those who have been in charge of the co-operative movement for the last 25 years and they have been very insistent that somebody should have the right to give sanction or to refuse sanction to these societies for the issuing of these debentures. They are anxious that somebody should do it.  As I say, when I was bringing in this temporary Bill I asked the Registrar of Industrial and Provident Societies to take on this duty and he refused.  He said that we were, at any rate, taking over these societies in the near future and that we should set up the machinery now.  I did not feel in a position to set up the machinery immediately for a controlling body and the most obvious way was to let the Minister do it in the meantime.  I can <Col N="42" /> assure Senators, however, that it is not a position which my Department would advise me to take or which I would be willing to take myself, except as a temporary expedient until the main Bill is brought in.</P>

      <P>Would it not be better to leave it out for the present until the final Bill is brought in, because you do not want it and the registrar does not want it?  You are taking away from these societies the right of issuing debentures which might be very useful. If this is only a temporary Bill, why not leave it as it is for the present, giving them the power to issue debentures if they find it necessary, and then, when you get the proper officials appointed under your final Bill, let that go in? This is only a temporary measure and it seems a pity in the meantime to take away the right from the societies.</P>

      <P>What I want to make clear is that the Committee in Plunkett House, who have been running the co-operative movement for 25 years and who know the pitfalls and difficulties of co-operation and, perhaps, the weaknesses of the societies at times, have asked me to put somebody in charge of this.  As a matter of fact, they are keen that the Minister for Agriculture should do it because they look upon it as temporary.  If, for instance, the Minister for Finance or anybody else was put in they might think that was going to be permanent, and we want to keep it for this controlling committee when it is set up. That is why they are anxious that the Minister for Agriculture should do it. I want to make it clear that it was more the wish of the co-operative movement itself than of the Department of Agriculture that I should take this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane asked why should not an individual get the right to lend money by means of debenture. That would be against the whole policy of the Department of Agriculture for a number of years past.  As Senators are aware, a considerable amount of money was voted by the State to buy out the proprietary creameries and hand them over to co-operative societies.  If we were to allow an individual to take over the <Col N="43" /> affairs of a creamery and so get that creamery into his own hands virtually, we would be going back to the old proprietary system once more and all the money which the State has spent would be gone for nothing.</P>

      <P>It does not appear to me to be exactly the same.  I am afraid that if we were to sanction an individual getting debentures we would be, as it were, giving our blessing to that movement.  We have gone as far as possible to prevent what Senator Sir John Keane has referred to.  On a few occasions when a creditor came in and took over a creamery and was willing to work it, we refused to give a licence to him to do so.  We told him he must get rid of it either to the co-operative society or to some other society.  We have always refused to give a licence to any proprietor to run any creamery, whether he comes in as a creditor or by any other means.</P>

    <Title>Public Business. - Dairy Produce (Amendment) Bill, 1934&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dairy Produce Act of 1924, like many others of these Produce Acts, was passed to regulate the industry in order to turn out a superior article, mainly for export.  Every creamery therefore has to be registered under that Act. There are certain definitions in that Act defining &ldquo;premises&rdquo; and so on which have given us some difficulty with regard to travelling creameries. It is therefore necessary to amend the <Col N="44" /> Act of 1924 in order to make it possible to have travelling creameries registered under that Act.  The travelling creamery has been experimented with in the County Kerry for some time and it will probably prove to be very useful for certain purposes.  I believe it is going to be very useful for testing out a district.  For some years past the Department has had a lot of trouble with districts which were looking for creameries.  In all cases the representatives of the district said that they wanted a creamery; that they had, say, 1,000 cows and were going to supply, say, 2,000 gallons of milk.</P>
      <P>Everything appears to be all right, but when the creamery is built and got going, sometimes we find that the number of cows is down to 25 per cent. of what was stated, and that the supply of milk is down to the same figure. The result is that the creamery is uneconomic and cannot succeed.  In many cases it will be very useful to have a travelling creamery to go into the districts and test the amount of milk which can be got before we go to the expense of building a creamery.  Of course, when a creamery is built there is at least £1,000 or £1,500 for capital expenditure before any mistake can be found out.  There is, therefore, a great loss to the shareholders and others, and sometimes to the State, in the building of these creameries if they are not successful.  For experimenting in a new district the travelling creamery is undoubtedly going to be useful. Whether it is going to be useful to continue a travelling creamery in a district is very doubtful.  It has, of course, the advantage that it can go from one cross-roads to another and cover a scattered district better than a fixed creamery.  I am afraid, however, that the expenses of running a travelling creamery are going to be higher than those of a fixed creamery, because the wear and tear on the machinery will be higher.  The travelling expenses also are going to be high and it will also take two skilled men to run it&mdash;one to drive the lorry and another to look after the separating&mdash; as compared with one skilled man and an unskilled man, or a boy, in fact, in a small fixed creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> Taking everything into account, I think the travelling creamery is going to be more expensive than the fixed creamery.  It is very doubtful, therefore, if it can be looked upon as a permanent institution in any district. There are certain districts which may appear to suit a travelling creamery rather than a fixed creamery.  There is one place which most Senators will realise as a suitable place for a travelling creamery and that is Dingle Peninsula, where you have a large stretch of land and where a travelling creamery could succeed, while a fixed creamery could not succeed.  In the ordinary district where milk can be got within a radius of five miles, the fixed creamery is more economic and more useful.</P>
    <P>There is a second matter dealt with in Section 8, relating to the extension of licences under Section 42 of the Principal Act.  Under the Principal Act no creamery could accept cream from a supplier unless it had a special licence from the Minister for Agriculture. There was only one creamery in the country that got that licence and that was the Macamore Creamery in the Country Wexford.  They got that licence for a period of three years and since that time two amending Acts have been passed in order to continue the licence.  On each occasion it was felt that another three years might help them and place them in the position of being able to carry on economically. They had not reached that stage when the last amending Bill was brought in and I am afraid we shall have to ask for another amending Bill. They have to depend on cream collected from a distance in order to make the creamery an economic proposition. It is proposed under Section 8 to give another extension until March, 1937. This is the only creamery that has got the concession of accepting cream from the producers.  It is not likely any other creamery will get the concession, and I hope it will not be necessary to continue it in the case of this creamery beyond 1937.</P>

      <P>There are three matters dealt with in this Bill, and the first has relation to travelling creameries.  I need not repeat what I have said in regard to them.  The point is that the travelling creamery has to be registered under this Bill also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the present they are owned by the Dairy Disposals Board. There is nothing to prevent a co-operative society registering a travelling creamery under this or under the Dairy Produce Bill.  The second point deals with certain illegal institutions such as have been set up in County Cork and other districts.  These are cases where a number of farmers come together and are supplied by some unknown individual with separating and churning machinery.  The individual is fairly well known to the Department of Agriculture, but it is impossible to prove in law who he is.  He supplies the machinery, and the farmers come along and get the milk separated and the butter made and sold.  These institutions are interfering with established creameries.  They should be compelled to register if they are creameries, and if they are not creameries they should be compelled to close.  Our difficulty is to name the individual and serve a notice on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed in this Bill to get the same power as they have in municipalities. In the case of condemned houses, where the owner of a place is unknown, the notice is nailed on the door.  If the owner does not appear in court the case would be dealt with in the ordinary way, and if he does appear in court he can defend his case to the best of his ability.  The judge can then order, under the Act, the closing of the premises or compel the owner to seek registration and so on as the main 1928 Act lays down.  There are seven or eight of these institutions with which we want to deal.  They are set up in <Col N="47" /> our good creamery districts, but they have none of the expenses which the ordinary creameries have, either in the way of levies, registration fees, or anything else.  For a time, at any rate, they are able to pay attractive prices for milk.  They are doing damage to creameries without playing their part in the general creamery development.</P>
    <P>The third point has relation to Section 5, which deals with the control of the use of milk products and byproducts. We have had some difficulties with regard to the registration of premises.  In one case, where a partial condensing of milk was done, we found it was impossible to invoke the law because the Creamery Act of 1928 was not drawn to cover the case.  There would also be the case of a creamery starting out and perhaps spending a considerable sum of money in going into one line of business.  All the other creameries would stand by to watch how that creamery would get on.  If it succeeded they would follow suit and try to get the business, and if it did not succeed they would let that creamery go down and lose all its capital.  We are anxious to give a certain amount of protection to persons embarking on a large expenditure in the case of a new product.  Section 5 strengthens the main Act of 1928 with regard to the issuing of licences for dairy products. I do not know if there is very much in the measure apart from that, but I shall be glad to answer any questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is rather a comprehensive <Col N="48" /> measure, and perhaps I should give some explanation of the main features first, and afterwards deal with some of the details.  The Principal Act brought in two years ago dealt with a guaranteed price and a guaranteed market for wheat, and it also gave a guaranteed market for feeding stuffs such as oats and barley, but did not give a guaranteed price.  We are dealing principally with feeding stuffs in this Bill, and for the moment I would like to deal with barley and oats. We are all familiar with what happened last year with regard to barley and oats, particularly with regard to oats. Oats were sold very cheaply after the harvest, and the average price per barrel was something below 8/-; in some cases it went to 6/- and perhaps 5/- a barrel.  During the late Spring and the early summer oats were worth 16/- a barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody, of course, got the benefit of that huge increase in price but it was not the producer.  Neither did it go to the feeder.  He was at the disadvantage of having to pay the increased prices, while the producer was at the disadvantage of getting a very low price for his oats.  We have to try and make that right.  It was never intended, under the Agricultural Cereals Bill of 1932, that these benefits should go to the maize miller and the oat miller.  The farmers who produced oats last year had the oats left on their hands.  They wanted to get rid of it.  Some of them wanted money, and some of them had no storage, and they had no confidence in the future. They were encouraged by a considerable Press propaganda into the belief that there would be no market for their corn since we lost the British market.  We tried to reassure the farmers and the merchants and the maize millers that the corn would be used in this country.  The merchants were in the habit of buying a considerable amount of oats in the country. They bought up the harvest sometimes and stored it for twelve months and sometimes for longer periods, but last year they were not willing to continue to store it.  We approached the merchants to agree to a price and the position was somewhat <Col N="49" /> improved.  The merchants did not all agree, and in some parts of the country there were no merchants to buy at any price.  The result was that the producers lost, while at the same time the feeders had to pay more; but after that prices were somewhat regulated. Oats is very dear at the present time.  Some time ago we reduced the percentage from 33? to 15; still it did not reduce the price of oats to any great extent.</P>
    <P>We have been asked: Why not drop the percentage altogether so that oats might come down?  It would be unfair to do so.  There were maize millers last year who bought up the whole supplies for the year and it would be very unfair to those millers who did their duty if there was to be no further mixing of oats and barley from this date.  That would leave them with their oats on hand and would mean to them a very considerable loss.  It would give the impression to those who were not prepared to buy their full requirements that they need only buy what they choose, and that buying only what they want they can turn round and say that those who bought the full complement were foolish to do so.  There is some suffering inflicted upon the consumer and the feeder at the present time in order to make this policy secure and stable.</P>
    <P>We are taking power under this part of the Bill, in the first instance, to fix prices.  The Minister for Agriculture may make an order at any time saying that oats is such and such a price, and barley such and such a price.  That will be based on quality rather than quantity; the price would be for the bushel of oats.  We take oats bushelling 40 lbs. and fix the price.  For every bushel above that 2d. a barrel more, and below that 2d. a barrel less. In that way, we give encouragement to the farmer who grows good quality oats, gets it properly threshed and cleaned before sending it to the market. It is important to him to have the price fixed on quality.  The fixing of prices will entail registration and so on.  We must register the dealers who buy oats or barley and we must compel the maize miller and the oat miller to buy from them, so that the dealers will <Col N="50" /> have a ready market for what they buy &mdash;that is, as far as the fixed price is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our idea will be to encourage the consumption of home grown corn but we must keep in mind the feeder who can only pay a certain amount.  If the feeder drops out, we destroy the whole scheme.  We are not compelled to fix a price.  The Minister may by order, fix a price, but he is not compelled to do so.  In fact, this year if the market was to open at a fair price, we might not have to fix any price at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point we are dealing with is the point of mixing oaten flour with wheaten flour.  There is not a considerable surplus of oats even if we were to mix the minimum amount that ought to be used in compound feeding stuffs.  An order may be made compelling the flour millers to mix oaten flour with wheaten flour, and as soon as that is done the usual regulation and registration would follow. But that is not likely to be done this year.  Our acreage of oats is down a considerable amount on what it was last year.  If we have the same percentage of oats and barley in the feeding stuffs this year, we would have none to spare for wheaten flour.  I think that is a great pity for the sake of the health of the people, but it cannot be helped for another year. We have made tests, as a matter of fact, with 5, 10 and 15 per cent. of this oaten flour in the wheaten flour.  Some of the loaves made were on exhibition at the Spring Show in Ballsbridge, and there was rather a puzzle there put to everybody to say which was the loaf with the oaten flour and which with the wheaten flour.  The colour was the same, in spite of the talk about black bread, but if one were to taste it I think it was quite easy to know which had the oaten flour, because it was a much nicer loaf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third matter which is dealt with in this Bill is the mixing of dried milk with flour for bread.  This has been adopted compulsorily in a number of countries, and has been adopted, as a matter of fact, in this country to some extent by a number of our bakers for certain varieties of bread.  If any Senator is interested enough, I think he will find that there are milk pan loaves sold by various bakers here, and that dried milk is mixed with what are considered to be the superior types <Col N="52" /> of bread by our own bakers, and certainly the dearer loaves have dried milk in them.  Again, from the point of view of taste, we have tested it for about three months on certain individuals, and they have not complained of the taste of the bread, nor have they noticed the colour.  Apart from that, it should naturally be a more healthy bread than ordinary wheat bread, because wheat with dried milk would appear to supply the entire requirements of a person in the way of food. In other words, you have a balanced ration with a loaf of that sort.  I am not supposed to be interested in the health of the people as Minister for Agriculture, but my desire is to get rid of the surplus skimmed milk.  There is a surplus always here, and that surplus is likely to increase, because the market for condensed skimmed milk is all the time declining, while the market for condensed whole milk is improving. Four or five years ago, I think that if anybody would get particulars of the output in Limerick it would be found that about 95 per cent. was condensed skimmed milk, while at the present time it is less than fifty per cent. This is one instance where we have a number of markets.  We are exporting milk from that factory to fifty countries, and in every single instance they are increasing their purchases of condensed whole milk.  That could not come into operation this year, because the surplus skimmed milk would not be there till June.</P>
    <P>In working any scheme like this, such as fixed prices, there is always the danger that if we fix a price a number of merchants in any district might say that they will not work it. Therefore, we always have to have power&mdash;although we do not want to use it unless it is necessary, and have never used it as far as I know&mdash;to take over stores and go into business.  We have those powers, as the Seanad is aware, in regard to maize-milling and flour-milling. The Seanad, I think, was very reluctant to give us those powers, but we never had to think of using them.  It was probably very useful, however to have the powers, because a flour-miller or a maize-miller who, for any reason, objected to carry out any <Col N="53" /> Government regulation, might not like the idea of the Government coming along and serving the dreaded notice that the mill was being taken over. We have not the same powers here with regard to taking over corn stores.  If a merchant is using his corn store, and refuses to buy oats, say, under the fixed price, and if he buys a small quantity, not under the fixed price, and sells it to brewers and so on, we cannot take over his store; but we have the power to take over stores in the same place, and either to let or sell those stores to other persons&mdash;perhaps a co-operative society or a society formed of the farmers themselves, to store their oats there; or the Minister for Agriculture himself may carry on the business of dealing in oats or barley.</P>
    <P>It does prevent, at any rate, what I might refer to as the dog-in-the-manger attitude of a merchant if he says: &ldquo;I will not buy or let anybody else buy as far as I am concerned.&rdquo; It is possible that we might be up against such an event.  The stores and kilns go together here, but they are not exactly the same.  We would not take over stores or kilns under the same conditions. We might have to take over kilns where business was not going normally, and all merchants buying under the fixed price and millers buying from them.  Even so, we might be compelled to take over kilns, because if our corn crop increases very much&mdash;if we have, say, seven or eight times as much wheat as we have now, or a little more oats or a little more barley&mdash;and if we were to come up against a really wet harvest, there would be great difficulty in having the grain dried, and we might have to take all the drying kilns that were not being used and get them into use immediately. Apart from that, however, I think the Government would have no intention of going into business with regard to kilns except in the case of a crisis such as that.  Of course, I need hardly say that adequate compensation is being provided for the owners of stores and kilns where these are taken over.</P>
    <P>Senators, I am sure, will find it rather difficult to follow all those various sections in the beginning with <Col N="54" /> regard to amendments, and if the Seanad wishes, I could give a few words on each section to show what each section is dealing with.  Section 5 is the first section that amends.  It is amending the definition of the word &ldquo;flour&rdquo; in Section 3 of the Principal Act, and it is necessary in case the mixing of oat flour is brought in. Section 6 gives the Minister power to vary the quota for the preliminary quota period.  Section 7 amends Section 28 of the Principal Act.  There are certain mills in the country which do all wholemeal milling, but in order to be permitted to import foreign wheat for their business the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to give them a quota, and as the Principal Act was worded he could only give a proportion of that quota to wholemeal.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce by this amendment can give them 100 per cent. quota for wholemeal and no flour at all.  Section 8 makes it an offence to mill more than the quota.  Section 9 amends the Principal Act.  Under the Principal Act the fine was 3/- on 400 lbs.  This increases the maximum to 30/-.  The small miller is fined a smaller sum. Section 10 amends Section 31 of the Principal Act.  Under the Principal Act the person who fails to make returns is guilty of an offence, but it was not an offence to make misleading returns. We are making that an offence now under this section.  Section 11 gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to make different regulations in relation to mills, the quota for which does not exceed 1,000 barrels.  There are certain small mills which do commissioned milling for farmers in the matter of wheat, oats or barley, and these mills like to fulfil small orders and they import, say, 1,000 barrels a year.  The Minister does not want to have these small mills bound by the regulations that are made by the larger millers.  This Bill gives him power to do that.</P>
    <P>Section 12 amends Section 32 of the Principal Act with regard to the keeping of records.  The Principal Act could only deal with the wheat brought to the mill; it took no account of the <Col N="55" /> wheat purchased and kept in a store not owned by the miller.  Section 14 amends Section 34 of the Principal Act. Under the Principal Act notice is issued that the licence will be revoked. It cannot be revoked for one month. But now, if the miller wants to make reports he gets seven days to do so, and if he asks for an inquiry the inquiry must be held.  Section 16 amends Section 36 of the Principal Act. Under the Principal Act the holder of a licence could not get a permit to mill wheat.  That was rather an anomaly.  It had the effect that if a miller had a licence he could not also own a mill&mdash;a &ldquo;permitted&rdquo; mill for grinding farmers' own wheat.  There are cases where a licensed miller also owns a small mill.</P>
    <P>Section 17 amends Section 54 of the Principal Act.  Under Section 54 the appropriate Minister could register the personal representative in lieu of the person who died.  But we are amending that to read that he can register the name of a person in lieu of the person previously registered.  It is the same now as in the case of death. Amendment 18 amends Section 55 of the Principal Act.  It exempts persons registered in the register of manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs and premises entered in such register as well as registered manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs.  We found it almost impossible&mdash;at least, they claimed it was impossible&mdash;to keep returns of the many concoctions in the mixture.  There might be a very small quantity, say, of salt.  It was difficult to keep a whole return of the mixtures and now we have exempted them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not interfered with.  Section 19 is an amendment of Section 58 of the Principal Act which gave the Minister power to cancel <Col N="56" /> registration if there had been contravention of the Act.  That is a section with which I will have to deal more fully another time.  Section 21 amends Section 68 of the Principal Act.  It will be unlawful for a farmer to effect a nominal sale with the miller and at the same time draw the bounty.  He cannot bring in wheat and say to the miller: &ldquo;I will sell you that wheat at 17/6 per barrel; you sell it back again to me at 17/6 a barrel.&rdquo;  He must make a genuine sale before he gets the bounty.  Section 22 amends Section 70 of the Principal Act.  That is when calculating the quota prices of homegrown wheat a fraction of a penny will be disregarded.  That makes it much more easy for calculations in the office and also for totting up in the record checks and so on.  In future no bounty will be paid on any fraction of a penny per barrel.  Section 24 amends Section 80 of the Principal Act.  It was not unlawful to sell maize, though some illegality may have been committed by the person who had it.  In other words, it would be illegal for the importer to sell to anybody maize meal, but if anybody had maize he would be entitled to sell it.  Section 25 amends Section 82 of the Principal Act.  That provision is desirable for the protection of the manufacturers themselves.  Sections 26 and 27 are dealing with the importation of flour and flour products; there is some relaxation there.  If a person from outside the country sends a present of buns or cakes made from flour, and if they are sent as a present, they are allowed in free of duty.  Up to this they would not be allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill calls for many criticisms.  To begin with, we seem to be getting more and more into the bog and mire of blunderdom.  We are being so tied up by State control that soon we will not be able to call our souls our own.  The Minister is taking more and more power to himself. Every Bill that is brought before us takes more and more control of the people's business into the Minister's hands.  That is all to the bad.  The independence of the people is being destroyed in many ways.  I have just noted in connection with this Bill a few points with which I am going to <Col N="57" /> deal.  There are a great many others which call for criticism.  The mixture of oats and wheat is a very important matter for the health of the people.  I happen to know an expert on this matter, a man who was engaged during the Great War in making experiments to see how far flour could be adulterated with other matters and still remain eatable.  This expert assures me that what will happen will be this: When oaten flour and wheaten flour are baked together, the oaten flour will cook in half the time it will take the wheaten flour to cook.  As a result of that whatever vitamins are in the oats will be largely destroyed in the baking.  That shows that what the Minister said is contrary to the fact. The loaf produced will be of far poorer food value.  It will be less digestible, not to mention its food values.  I do not think that the appearance of the loaf where 50 per cent. is of oaten-meal will be as good either.  Wheaten flour is of great value.  It is one of the principal necessaries of life and any attempt to interfere with it in order to prop up the fantastic idea of increasing tillage is very bad and ought not to be attempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amount of milk used in making bread, I might say that in every country house milk is used in making bread, but it produces a heavier and less digestible bread than that made with yeast.  I cannot say anything in regard to milk powder, or whether it gives any better results than liquid milk.  I need add nothing to what I said here recently about the maize admixture.  It has done serious injury to the country, and the opinion which I expressed here in regard to its effects when fed to stock has been backed up by some leading agriculturists in the country.  The number of all stock in the country is decreasing.  The latest figures issued by the Department show that poultry is decreasing, pigs are decreasing and, of course, owing to the Minister's orders regarding the slaughter of cattle, cattle are decreasing. I think it would be much better if we went back to the rearing of cattle, and used the skim milk for that purpose, and abandon all these <Col N="58" /> fantastic schemes of trying to use it in the making of bread.  All this tinkering with the agricultural economy of the country is doing a great injury.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of oats and the effect of all these Cereals Bills on the tillage of the country, the area under oats this year is down by almost 50,000 acres.  According to the figures issued by the Departments, there has been a decrease of between 48,000 and 50,000 acres in the area under oats. The area under wheat has increased by 39,000 acres.  The area under barley has shown a small increase also.  I really do not know why, but probably it is because people are going out of tillage and it is well known that barley is the best nurse crop for grass.  The fact is that there is not one additional acre of corn in the country, notwithstanding all these Bills.  The acreage under turnips has decreased, because of people rushing into the growing of sugar beet.  They are growing it, even at an uneconomic price, in order to get any little ready money that is offering. The people are in the desperate position that they will grasp at any straw. That is why they are growing beet&mdash; because they must get some little ready money somehow.  We can safely leave wheat to its fate.  We have two exceptionally dry years, but two wet years will finish it without any trouble on our part.  Meanwhile a great deal of valuable land will have been ruined.  I know a land myself which has been utterly ruined by continuous cropping of wheat.  It will grow nothing but weeds for the next ten years.</P>
    <P>With reference to what the Minister said to cover up the terrible blunders that were made in regard to the oat crop last year, the Minister has the effrontery to blame Press propaganda to cover up his own blunders.  That is not good enough.  He said a number of extraordinary things.  He said that the feeders of the country did not suffer owing to the price of oats last year. If the feeders of the country had got oats for nothing&mdash;and many of them got it for very little&mdash;they could not have made money in feeding their stock.  Any person who fed stock last year&mdash;with the one exception of pigs <Col N="59" /> on which they might have made their expenses&mdash;lost heavily.  The feeders who stall-fed cattle are ruined.  I wonder if there is any use in once more calling the attention of the Minister and the Seanad to this patent fact&mdash; that you canot have, and will not have, increased tillage without maintaining the numbers of stock in the country? As I have said the figures show that the numbers of stock are decreasing. In my county which had a larger acreage under corn and other crops than any other county in Ireland, with the exception of the barley sold for malting, all the corn was used for feeding, principally for feeding cattle.  As I have said before, more barley would be used in feeding ten stall-fed cattle than would be used in a whole parish otherwise.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about this fetish of increased tillage but anyone who examines the latest figures will see that there is not one single acre more under tillage than there was last year.  With a subsidy in operation, inducing the people to go in for new crops like wheat and beet, it will simply mean that they will decrease the area previously devoted to other crops.  When the Beet Bill was being discussed here before, I pointed out that what would happen, when the sugar pulp was returned to the farmers, was that they would sow less root crops.  As we have seen there has been a very large decrease in the acreage under turnips. I think the whole thing is fatal to the economy of the country and that it will leave the country in a much poorer condition, gradually going back to the conditions which prevailed here before the great famine.  It must have the effect of lowering the standard of living for everybody.  That can be its only effect even if this scheme succeeds. It will not succeed.  It cannot succeed. and I, for one, hope it will not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the correction, although at present I do not understand the exact difference in meaning between the two things.  I have taken the trouble of examining all the regulations and arrangements that have been made in other countries, including Great Britain, in reference to this question of tillage, and I find that the arrangements made by the Minister, both in his principal Act and in this measure, are milder than the regulations and arrangements made even in Great Britain.  Whether for good or ill, the people of the world seem to be coming to the conclusion that the food supplies of a nation should, as far as possible, be provided within the nation.  The outstanding example of that is France.  France produces all the wheat that is required by the people of the Republic and by the other peoples in the French dependencies. Great Britain is making a great advance towards securing that as much as possible of the food of the people shall be provided within the shores of England, including wheat, oats and barley.  I do not think that anybody could object to that.  It is a sound policy for the people of Great Britain, who are a great carrying people, who have ships.  Why should it not be a sound policy for us who have very few ships?  Why should the Minister for Agriculture, who has a very serious responsibility, not guard against a condition or a possibility in which the people of this country might be starved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may say so, the Minister in the principal measure acted wisely.  This Bill shows that he has carefully studied the effect of the principal measure, because here we have a series of 15 or 20 amendments to the Principal Act.  Every one of these amendments shows that he has considered the particular question which is the subject of the amendment.  Why should he not bring in a measure to perfect his legislation? Senator Miss Browne has said that she objects to every proposal in <Col N="61" /> the Bill.  I was surprised that she should be objecting to every proposal in the Bill until I heard her in the end saying: &ldquo;I hope it will not succeed.&rdquo; It is the hope that it will not succeed which makes her object to every proposal in this Bill.  Let me take her objections one by one.  What is her objection to using oaten flour with wheaten flour for bread?  She says an astonishing thing that if oaten flour is mixed with wheaten flour, kneaded and baked, the oaten part will cook sooner than the wheaten part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask Senator Miss Browne, as a housewife, and a very good housewife, if that is a bad thing.  I have always heard that the better you bake wheat, oats or anything else, the better for the person who consumes it.  I think that the Senator will have to reconsider that part of her criticism.  Senator Miss Browne next says that milk is used in the kneading of wheaten flour.  So it is, but she says further that milk is not as good as yeast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">

If however, instead of understanding how to make and bake a loaf, you talk about it, then you, or your brother or cousin, gets stuff as bread that an elephant could not digest.  Then, again, we had the question of poultry.  Poultry have decreased in numbers because the price of eggs has gone down.  I am sorry to say that a lot of very deserving and useful members of the community who keep hen runs about the City of Dublin and elsewhere are not doing as well as I should wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a scandalous thing to do, because the people who could least afford it suffered most. The poor people were obliged by this piece of trickery&mdash;it was nothing else&mdash; to sell their oats at a price at which they could not afford to sell and which was very much under the true value. There is another difficulty in the way of restoring a proper balance of agriculture in this country.  I am not against grazing or anything else and I am not in favour of tillage, but it is absolutely essential that there be a proper balance of agriculture.  There are several difficulties in the way. There is the difficulty of arranging it. That was manifested in the Principal Bill and it is manifested in this very skilfully-drawn amending Bill.  The difficulties are great even if we had the co-operation of everybody, much less having people who hope the scheme will fail.  Another difficulty in the way of tillage is fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may say so with respect, Senator <Col N="63" /> Miss Browne has very great knowledge on these subjects and a point of view which I like to hear expressed. With her knowledge, she ought to be a little more careful in what she says. I should like to know where the farm is which has been destroyed by continuous cropping of wheat.  How many crops were taken off it?  Were they taken year after year?  This farm must have been in the moon, in the Steppes of Russia or, perhaps, in that rich land that can produce crops for 100 years without any diminution of quality.  All I say is that is a very exceptional farm and that he is a very exceptional farmer.  I am surprised that he has not something else on his farm worse than wheat.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure.  It is a Bill which, so far as I, as a person with some experience of agriculture, can ascertain, manifests remarkable care and remarkable research on the part of the Minister and the Department responsible for it.  The Minister was not ashamed to inquire into the deficiencies which were to be expected in the original measure.  He brings in a measure to rectify and amend everything which was found to be wrong in the original Act.  I think that we ought to welcome the Bill instead of criticising it and hoping that the policy of mixed agriculture will be a failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became a member of the House I have rarely seen a Bill that, in my opinion, is a worse one than this.  I wish to speak in criticism of it in this Second Reading debate. I have no technical knowledge of the manufacturing processes or of the trades affected by this legislation. I have some slight knowledge of the production of the raw material.  I represent, and I speak on behalf of, a very much larger number than all those interests taken together, namely, the consumers of bread.  I propose to devote my remarks to the Bill as it affects the consumers.  This is a very big Bill.  I do not propose, for the reason that my knowledge is not sufficient, to take up the time of the House with a general criticism of the Bill. I propose to devote my remarks to that part of the Bill which affects consumers. <Col N="64" /> In effect, the object of the Bill is the regulation and control by the Minister of the production, sale and consumption of the most important article of food in this nation&mdash;bread, the staff of life, as it is called, and the poor man's food.  In a normal state of affairs, wheaten bread should be the cheapest food for the labouring man in this country.  You cannot expect such a state of affairs when you have quite good beef selling at 3d. a pound, but that is only because of extraordinary Governmental mismanagement, the effects of which cannot last for ever.  The reason is that the thing is economically impossible.  Therefore, bread is an article of food of very great importance to our life here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am naturally a person of free trade predilections.  That is well known to members of this House, and I am sure some members will discount what I have to say on this Bill for that reason. But I recognise that it is not always possible to follow the principles of free trade.  You are forced by the actions and the circumstances of people in other countries to protect yourself.  I do not hold, however, that this Bill can be excused on such ground as that. I am amazed at the temerity, the courage, the rashness if you like, of the Minister and of the Government in rushing into the control of the principal article of diet for the people of this country and at their proposal to regulate it from top to bottom.  The complete restriction on all liberty, and such confusing complications as regards distribution as we find in this Bill, are really amazing.  We are accustomed to compulsion in this free country. Now we are going to get accustomed to it in an increasing degree under this measure.  We are accustomed to being told how we could produce, whom we shall buy from, how much we shall pay, and all that sort of thing, but now we are practically being told what we shall eat&mdash;bread&mdash;and, at that, what sort of bread we shall eat.  Hitherto we have been able to settle that for ourselves.  It ought to be a natural process between the miller, the baker and the consumer.  If the consumer does not like the bread he is being <Col N="65" /> supplied with, he tells the baker.  If the baker is doing his best and finds that it is the fault of the flour, he goes to another miller and gets better flour. Now we are to have regulated for us what the flour is to consist of.  It is possible that one man's meat may be another man's poison, and the average consumer is better able to find out by trial what is good for him than any Minister.</P>
    <P>Parts V, VI and VII of the Bill are, in my opinion, the most objectionable from the consumer's point of view. Perhaps, as this is not the Committee Stage, I ought not to draw attention to Sections 61 and 63, 73 and 74.  But in my opinion all these sections involve a most extraordinary curtailment of liberty in all its forms.  Section 28 is a most amazing section.  The Minister referred to it.  The section provides that it shall not be lawful for any person to import into this country any commodity in the preparation of which wheat or any product of wheat is used unless it is imported under licence given by the Minister&mdash;the power to import will rest entirely in the hands of the Minister&mdash;or unless the commodity is imported by parcel post or is a present from somebody outside the country.  I consider that it is almost fruitless to put such a provision in a Bill of this character.  There are a great many things which come in under the head of patent foods.  I am not, if I may so put it, very much of a patent food person.  I can eat all kinds of ordinary food, and these do me for the most part.  But some of these patent foods are very important for certain people, so that it is to depend on the decision of the Minister whether they are to have them or not.  People may consider it of vital importance to their health to have these foods, and even though the Minister may be right about that and such people wrong, yet because they believe these things do them good, they should be able, in my opinion, to get them without any kind of restriction.</P>
    <P>I must say that it disgusts me to think that in this late period of time power should be given to a Government in this country to light-heartedly deteriorate the quality of our bread, <Col N="66" /> because I maintain that is what this Bill is going to do.  The bread we have been accustomed to may be the most palatable and the most wholesome to be obtained anywhere in the world, and I am inclined to think that it is.  I have travelled through a great many countries.  Speaking for my own district, hitherto we have had bread produced there the equal of which I have rarely been served with anywhere outside the country.  I think I can say that I have never got better bread anywhere.  If that bread is going to be mixed up with oatmeal, with various forms of milk and all that kind of thing, well the Lord knows what will be the result.  It will not be as good bread as we have had up to now.  I like oatmeal, and I have nothing to say against it.  I like milk, but I like to take them separately.  I should like to have preserved to me the liberty that enables me to take them separately.  If our bread supply in the future is to be a mixture of all sorts of things, I consider that tyranny. Bread, as I have said, is one of our most important articles of food.  I am speaking here on behalf of a great many people who, I feel, do not quite realise all that this Bill means.  This like some other measures introduced by the Government, is, in my opinion, an interference with the liberty of the subject.  In spite of what Senator Comyn has said, I can say with an absolutely free conscience that I am not criticising this measure for any political reason.  I am speaking principally on behalf of the consumers of bread.  They are not going to benefit by this Bill, and that is why I consider it my duty to criticise.  I think that this is a very bad piece of legislation. It involves an extraordinary curtailment of liberty.</P>
    <P>There is one suggestion I have to make.  I think that the Minister should bring before the House some authoritative statement to convince us that this bread which is made of wheat, oatmeal, barley, milk and other things is going to be as wholesome as the bread that we have been accustomed to.  Let us have that from, say, the Irish Medical Association, but that the Minister himself should be the judge as <Col N="67" /> to whether it is good for me to eat my porridge, milk and bread all messed up together I do not agree with that at all.  I know far better than he does what is good for me, and so do very many other people.  They know that far better than the Minister.  These are the principal grounds on which I base my criticism of this Bill.</P>

Some five or six months ago, when the mixture of maize meal consisted of 33? per cent., a good many of the millers did not understand how to use that 33? per cent.  They had no experience of such work, and, as a result, the hulls of the oats and barley were not properly ground.  Young animals and some old animals to which it was given were injured.  In my area a number of young turkeys were killed by it.  That was unfortunate, but I think it will not occur again.  In some districts, principally in the south and west, millers were not in the habit of handling that class of work and had no experience of it.  I think the complaint will not arise again, and that it will not be necessary for the Minister to enforce in future a mixture of 33? per cent.  The result of having a mixture of 33? per cent. is that oats are at present selling at 17/- a barrel.  There is an artificial scarcity of the crop, which is not good for anyone. I take exception to Senator Comyn's remarks about the price of oats last year, that it was arranged by an organisation which is out to smash the Government's policy; that it was done by trickery, and that sort of thing. There is no ground whatever for that statement.  The position is that when the season opened last October the majority of the dealers north, south, east and west had in their stores practically all the oats and barley they had bought the previous year, when they bought large quantities at very long prices.  Then the Government's policy was changed, and they were <Col N="68" /> ordered to export no more oats, while at the same time England put a tariff against oats and barley, so that the crop could not be exported, even if the Government was anxious to export it. There was no demand for it in this country, and dealers started the new season with the old crop in hands.  Last year we had the biggest oat crop that we had for a number of years.  It was much larger than we will have this year. In fact we are not likely to have such a good crop for ten years.  Having that quantity on hands oats were sold at 5/- a barrel last year.  Nothing else could happen.  In this country we were always accustomed to buy oats and to keep it for a month or two, and then to send it to England, to France, or wherever a market could be got.  Owing to Government policy, and to England putting a tariff against our agricultural produce, that trade was killed.  The dealers could not see any outlet anywhere to sell stocks, and as a result they could not buy.</P>

      <P>They may have been, but when you have a change from one policy to another it is difficult to foresee what is going to happen.  The merchants' money was locked up in existing stocks and their stores were full.  The Senator says they were bad business men not to continue buying. The bulk of them would be unable to buy even if they were anxious to do so.  There was a glut.  The Minister then raised the mixture to 33? per cent., which I think was unwise, because that makes a bad feed.  It may not have that effect in two or three years, but last summer you had a mixture which was very objectionable. Practical farmers like Senator Miss Browne considered that the scheme was wrong.  I believe that a mixture of 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. will make a good feed.  I am a farmer and a miller, and I have no hesitation in saying that a mixture of 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. of oats or barley will not have an injurious effect.  I claim that the other mixture was not a success because it increased the price of feed that farmers require for their <Col N="69" /> stock by 1/- a cwt., and in some districts by 1/3 or by 1/6, owing to the exceptionally high price of oats.  What benefit is it to a farmer in Mayo to have to pay 1/3 per cwt. extra for maize meal, so that farmers in Wexford, Louth, Westmeath or Carlow, who grow grain extensively for cash purposes, should get an extra price? A better way to encourage tillage, and to carry out the Government's policy, would be to put an import tax on maize and to use the money collected as a bounty for oats and barley.  That is quite as justifiable as giving extravagant bounties to bacon, beef, butter or eggs.  I think if we had the same treatment for oats and barley there would not be much to be exported. If the price for oats was something in the neighbourhood of 11/&mdash;not 16/&mdash;it would be easy to fix the export bounty so as to keep the price of oats at that level.  The money could be found by an import duty on maize and the Minister for Finance would not be asked to provide any money beyond what came from feeders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If farmers were guaranteed a price they would grow more oats.  Instead of doing that, the Minister proposes to fix a price, and to see that that price is paid.  He can do so.  I presume it will be a wise proceeding, but, as far as I can see, it will not be necessary to do it this year, as there will be good prices for oats and barley. The position at present is that there are no stocks of native grain in the country, and we have small crops, with less acreage than previously.  The weather is bad, and some of the crop will be damaged.  I hope the Minister will not ask to have a fixed price this year, unless there is some justification for it.  If the market gives 11/- for oats, and 13/- for barley, I think the Minister would be foolish to step in, and not allow the ordinary law of supply and demand to operate. Senator Miss Browne, Senator Comyn, and Senator Bagwell talked about the oat flour.  I do not think the Minister will ever put the section dealing with that into force.  He is asking for permission, and he will get it, to mix oat flour with wheat flour, but I do not think that stage will ever be reached. <Col N="70" /> There is always the maize-meal mixture at hand.  I believe that a mixture of 7½ per cent in flour would not be injurious.  It would be quite good food, and no one would be injured by using it.  There might be a mixture of 7½ per cent. in flour and people would not know anything about it.  If the Minister works the maize-meal mixture properly there will be no necessity for any other mixture. The Minister's object should be to work towards reasonable prices, and not to have what occurred last year, oats selling at the opening of the season at 7/- and at the close of the season at 16/- a barrel.  These prices are objectionable from every point of view.  Oats at 7/- or 8/- are uneconomic, and when the price reaches 16/- a barrel that is an indication that there are no oats in the country.  That is bad for farmers who have to pay extra for feeding stuffs.  It was because the Minister put 33? into the mixture in the summer months that oats went to 16/- a barrel. I felt that that was unwise.  There is no justification for that this year.</P>
    <P>I hope before making the mixture 33? per cent. the Minister will consider some other system of getting rid of the surplus.  The way I suggest is the way the surplus pigs and bacon were got rid of, by an export bounty.  It is much better to export 100 tons of oats in November than to hold it and send it across the country to farmers later, after paying the cost of storage.  It would be better to export it earlier and to let farmers buy pure maize-meal in July and August when it is better to do so than at any other time of the year. A small export bounty of 2/- or 3/- a barrel on oats and barley would simplify the whole thing, would do away with the necessity for the mixture, would cheapen the price of maize-meal to the farmer; and would do away with all this Government inspection which we have in this Bill.  It is a most elaborate scheme under which every man buying oats will have to be registered and keep a new set of books; the millers also will have to get a different set of books with auditors and all that. All that can be simplified by having a small export bounty on oats and barley.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to what happened at the beginning of last year's harvest.  It has been stated that the Minister for Industry and Commerce issued an order to all the millers to export and clear out their stocks of bran and pollard.  I am not sure if that is a fact; but at all events all the pollard and bran in the country was exported.  It has been stated that the mills were subsidised to export it. The fact remains that at this time last year the price of bran and pollard went up 60 or 70 per cent. in about a fortnight and the whole of the stocks were cleared out.  The idea I understand was to make room for the oats to have a market.  I think it was very bad policy that the producers of bacon and the feeders of poultry should have had to pay such a high price for their feeding stuffs.  I hope the Minister will look into the matter and see that it will not occur this year.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask the Minister if he would consider the possibility of granting a licence for whole-meal to people feeding young pigs, and in some cases poultry.  I can speak from experience when I say that when the admixture is fed to young pigs it is most injurious, particularly if it is anything like it was last year.  I myself lost a number of young pigs who died from being fed on an admixture of Indian meal and oats.  As Senator O'Rourke has pointed out, the oats was milled with the hulls, and there was too large a proportion of hulls in the mixture, which was most injurious to young pigs.  From a <i>post mortem</i> examination I found that that was the cause of the death of the young pigs.</P>

      <P>Three or four months old.  Senator Comyn referred to an organisation amongst farmers last year to keep down the price of oats.  That was a ridiculous statement to make. It shows that the Senator did not know anything of the real cause.  Senator O'Rourke has explained the real cause. Anybody who knows anything about the matter should see what was the real cause.  There was no propaganda to depress the price of oats in 1932. <Col N="72" /> From the first buying of oats in 1932 the price continually kept going down until the harvest of 1933.  One of the things which contributed to raise the price of oats last year was that the admixture was raised to 33? per cent., but that was not wholly responsible. What contributed mostly to the rise in the consumption of oats was that in December last year a quota was put on our fat stock at a time when most of the farmers had their stock in the stalls.  They had to keep them for several months longer than they intended, and the cheapest food they could get for them was their own oats. The result was that nearly all the corn was used in feeding stock, and very little was put on the market.  That was an important contributory cause and helped to raise the price.  This is an amending Bill, and the Minister and his advisers have found it necessary to bring it in, and I am of opinion that the Seanad should let the Minister have his Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, in the first instance, to say that I think the Seanad is very much indebted to Senator O'Rourke for his speech.  He certainly cleared up a great many points that I did not understand.  I hope he also enlightened a good many Senators. Senator Comyn was rather severe with regard to a remark made by Senator Miss Browne in connection with a mixture of wheat-meal and oatmeal in baking bread.  I think there is a good deal in what Senator Miss Browne mentioned.  The Minister has had a scientific training, I believe, and he knows well that when you bring two or three constituents together and subject them to treatment such as they would get in baking or in any other way there may be great variations in the result.  You cannot tell, except by a very careful scientific experiment, what the result really will be.  There is hardly an industry to-day the product of which is not very carefully scrutinised, biologically and chemically, and in many other ways.  Where the whole feeding of the country is concerned, as in the case of bread, I think it would be advisable to have that done.  Possibly the Minister has <Col N="73" /> already got a department for that purpose.  We have an agricultural college here and we have a veterinary college, and I hope the matter will be considered.</P>
      <P>On the subject of mixtures, we have had from two Senators comments on the result of what I may call <i>ad hoc</i> mixtures.  Senator O'Rourke mentioned the case of turkeys which had died from the effects of being fed on what I call an <i>ad hoc</i> mixture.  Senator O'Rourke has told us that he lost a number of young pigs through using a mixture recommended by the Ministry.  If careful scientific experiments had been made in connection with these matters we would not have had these losses which have occurred.</P>
      <P>Senator Bagwell referred to a section in the Bill under which wheat preparations or other preparations cannot be imported except under strict rules and probably heavy duties. I should like to know if that would apply to two very well-known articles which are largely consumed elsewhere and are also consumed in this country &mdash;quaker oats and shredded wheat. There are a great many others of a similar nature which are used and which are most excellent foodstuffs. Bemax is one.  That is not a simple mixture, it is a compound; but quaker oats and shredded wheat, and similar foods, largely used for children, are pure wheat or oats treated in a certain way and are extremely valuable as foodstuffs.  Are these to be kept out of the country or are they to be allowed to come in?  I should like if the Minister would give an assurance on the points I raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were several points raised, but I think they are mostly points suited to the Committee Stage. As regards the mixture of oats with wheat in bread, that has been commented on a good deal.  I do not know if there is very much use in saying again that I believe bread made from wheat mixed with oats is superior to wheaten bread alone.  There are Senators who will not agree with that, and we will have to agree to differ on that matter.  I have eaten bread several times that was baked by way of experiment. It was baked both by the baker in the ordinary baker's loaf and baked <Col N="74" /> also as household bread with buttermilk and soda.  In both cases the bread was very nice, and it appeared to be properly cooked.  I agree with Senator Guinness that it would require scientific research in order to see if everything is right.  Of course, that is being done, and it will be done before this order will be brought into force.  I quite agree with Senator O'Rourke that it will probably be a good while before this order is considered necessary. I think Senator Miss Browne's speech might be left with the comment that she appeared to bank on two wet years finishing the wheat scheme.  I think a somewhat similar expression, or rather a hope, was indicated in the course of the discussion in the Dáil by a member of the Senator's Party.</P>

      <P>Senator Miss Browne said that two wet years would finish the wheat scheme and I said that was an expression from Senator Miss Browne, but it almost amounted to a hope, and I heard a similar expression amounting almost to a hope coming from a person belonging to Senator Miss Browne's Party during the discussion in the Dáil. The expression was that two wet years would finish the scheme.  God grant that we will not get the two wet years. Senator Miss Browne said that we would require more cattle if we are to increase our tillage.  We do not want more cattle in order to increase tillage.  We have enough human beings in the country to consume the wheat produced on 800,000 acres and if we had that much tillage it would mean a very big increase.  If we had just the same number of cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry and so on as we have at present, and if we stopped the import of 6,000,000 cwts. of maize, and if we relied upon home produce it would mean a big increase in the production <Col N="75" /> of wheat, oats and barley.  There is room for a huge increase in tillage without increasing the number of our people or the number of our livestock. Of course, I hope the number of people will increase.</P>
      <P>Senator Bagwell made a vigorous speech against this Bill.  He would not be so vigorous in his opposition if he knew what this Bill really meant.  He made a most violent attack on the powers the Minister for Industry and Commerce is taking to stop people getting buns made from wheat unless they come through the post.  At present the Minister for Industry and Commerce can stop any product of wheat coming in and I can stop any wheat coming in.  We have that power. I can stop the wheat and he can stop the wheat products.  The point is we want to relax those powers and give the people a little more freedom. Senator Bagwell vigorously attacked what really is a relaxation.  We are giving the people a little more freedom. We have used those powers in a very mild way.  Those things that Senator Bagwell speaks about, such as medicinal cereals and all those things, are allowed in.  We do not try to inflict our opinion on people that certain things are bad or good for them.  If a person thinks he wants a thing, if his doctor thinks he wants it, he gets a permit and we do not try to override those decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were certain things mentioned by Senator Guinness such as quaker oats, which are not now allowed in.  So far as we can find out quaker oats are ordinary rolled oats, and that can be done in the Free State by our own millers.  They can afford to sell them more cheaply because they do not advertise like the quaker oats people.  They can give the Irish people as good an article for a lower price, and that is the result.  Senator O'Rourke said we ought not to fix the price unless it is necessary.  I quite agree.  If the price of oats is reasonable, if it is 11/- or 12/- a barrel, we would consider that reasonable, and we would not fix a price.  If the price of barley is reasonable we would not interfere.  It is only in such a case as occurred last year when we <Col N="76" /> were approaching a collapse that we fix a price.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce had to exercise certain powers in regard to the millers.  Since the Cereals Act was passed we have been saying that we would bring in an order to prohibit the export of offals. The millers said that they themselves would stop the export of offals. Eventually, two or three months ago an order was issued, and mill offals are not permitted to be exported.  We never encouraged the export of offals at all.</P>
    <P>With regard to whole maize meal, the college in Glasnevin and other agricultural colleges have carried out experiments for many years with an inclusion of home-grown grain.  There may be something in what Senator O'Rourke says, that the oats in some mixtures were badly ground and included the hulls.  The greater portion of the mixture now contains dehulled oats, and there should be no trouble in getting the mixture for young animals. Many of the points that were raised could, I think, be more conveniently discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks with regard to this Bill by saying that it is a Bill entirely for the benefit of the producers.  I do not want to be bothered answering remarks about putting money into the butcher's pocket or the pocket of anybody else. As far as we are concerned, we are introducing this Bill entirely for the benefit of the producer.  There has been a very severe fall in the price of cattle, which is due to three things. The first is the fall in world prices.  If we read any of the British farmers' papers we will see, at meetings of farmers in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland, where they are engaged in discussions in regard to the very low <Col N="77" /> prices of cattle.  The low price in cattle all over the world is felt everywhere and has hit the farmers very severely.  The second thing was the financial tariff inflicted by the British Government against this Government in July, 1932.  In order to overcome and counteract that effect we paid a bounty on cattle.  The result was that after a month or two prices were reduced by the difference between the tariff imposed and the bounty we paid.  You had ordinarily a gap of 4/- or 5/- a cwt. between here and the market on the other side.  In addition to that ordinary gap you had, as a result of the penal tariff, the difference between the tariff and the bounty. The third thing was the quota.  That was imposed by Great Britain and came into effect after Christmas some three or four days before New Year's Day.</P>
      <P>As a result of the quota there is a further reduction in the price of cattle. It is to deal with that reduction of the price in cattle that this Bill was brought in.  We are not trying to deal with world prices or the reduction as a result of the tariffs.  So let us lose no time, if the Seanad is agreeable, discussing these matters.  This Bill is intended to make right the wrongs of the quota and to give the farmer the same price as if there was no quota, to dispose of his surplus cattle.  That is what this Bill is designed to do, and that is all this Bill is designed to do. It would be waste of time, under this Bill at any rate, to talk about the losses sustained as a result of the tariff.  If these losses are to be made good there should be a motion, or an agitation, to have the bounty increased so that the bounty would amount to the sum of the tariffs.  If you increase the bounty you thereby minimise the bad effect of the tariff.  But this Bill is not meant to minimise in any way the ill effect of the tariff, it is only meant to make good the bad effects of the quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that, as a result of the quota within the last four months, if a farmer was lucky enough to have a licence to export a fat beast, he got £3 or £4 more than if he sold it to the home butcher.  This Bill is designed to make the home butcher pay <Col N="78" /> the same price as the person who bought the animal for export.  If we achieve this we achieve all we set out to achieve.  We also deal with surplus cattle, to which I shall come in a few minutes.  We have not got a very big surplus of cattle here.  We took a census in January and June.  It was the ordinary official census taken by the Statistics Department, and it did not show that we have a very great surplus of cattle.  The number in June this year is not any greater than it was in June, 1933, so that we have no great problem of surplus cattle to deal with.  Last January, when the quota came in, I tried to induce the farmers who had cattle to hold on, and they would be able to get rid of them before the stall-feeding period was over.  They might have to keep them a little longer, but the market would have been there for them.  Eventually we got rid of the stall-fed.  But the real big principle of this Bill is the fixing of prices. If we can work this Bill so as to operate the fixing of prices, then we have succeeded.  Suppose the price offered for cattle for export be 25/- per cwt., we fix the price 25/- per cwt. live weight.  We have to fix this price at the price that cattle for export are really worth.  We fix the price for cattle for home slaughter at the same level.  Suppose that figure is 25/-, and suppose we have got a surplus of cattle &mdash;let us assume that for the moment&mdash; then the exporter with a licence pays 25/- per cwt. for the cattle he buys.  The home butcher who buys his cattle for slaughter pays 25/- to the person who sells to him, so that the same price is paid for cattle bought by the home butcher for slaughter as is paid by the person who buys for the export.  We want to get the home price really regulated by the export price, and if we achieve that we have done that which we have set out to do.</P>
    <P>The fixing of prices, of course, means certain regulations.  The buyers of cattle for home slaughter must be registered.  Any person can be registered who has a slaughter-house and who buys cattle for slaughter.  We shall register him unless advised by the local authority not to do so.  But if a person's application is passed by the local authority we automatically <Col N="79" /> register him under this Bill, and he is permitted to buy cattle for slaughter at a fixed price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at the minimum price. In order to work this Act satisfactorily we will, of course, have cattle sold by weight as far as possible. We have learned of certain instances where a farmer, being very anxious to get rid of his beast, and very badly off for money, the butcher comes along and says: &ldquo;I have three or four other customers to attend to before I come to you.  I cannot buy from you at present, but if you give me £1 or £2 for luck I may do so.&rdquo; The farmer wants to get rid of his beast, and he does so.  We have to prevent that; it is, of course, illegal. If we did not sell by weight the butcher may say, &ldquo;This beast is 10 cwt., we will agree to nine and I shall buy.&rdquo; We have to sell by weight to prevent evasion of the Act.  In the cities and large towns there may be no great difficulty in selling by weight, but there will be country districts that will present difficulty.  Under the Act we have to provide other means, and we do so by a system of dead weight.  After a beast is killed the two sides are weighed and the price is fixed in certain districts.  The cattle are sold by weight and, therefore, at a fixed price, and it is an offence for the buyer to buy at any but the fixed price.  It is not an offence for the seller.  The seller might come back in 12 months and say to the buyer, &ldquo;You bought at a fixed price, and I want the money making up the full fixed price.&rdquo;  It is an ordinary contract, and the seller is likely to get it.  As well as that, of course, the buyer is likely to come under the provisions of this Act for having committed an offence.  It is an offence for both parties to sell cattle otherwise than by live weight or dead weight, as the case may be, that we have prescribed.  It will be necessary further to register the retailers of the beef and mutton, because it may be very difficult sometimes to trace some of those cases of <Col N="80" /> cattle and sheep&mdash;the prices paid, and so on&mdash;if we did not have some means of checking where the meat was sold, what amount was sold, and so on.  Accordingly, the retailer is registered also so as to enable us to examine his transactions, examine his books, and so on.</P>
      <P>A price may be fixed, of course, for different classes of cattle.  There may be one price for bullocks, another price for heifers, and another for young cows. It would be very difficult to fix a price for first and second-class bullocks.  We will have to have a minimum price for bullocks.  We might possibly fix one for heavy bullocks over 10 cwt., say, and a price, perhaps, for bullocks under 10 cwt.  Obviously, it would be impossible to classify them, because I do not think we have inspectors to do that.  I should like Senators to be clear, before we go any further with this Bill, that we may not have to go any further than the fixing of a price. It may be possible to operate this Bill with a fixed price alone and get cattle up to a good price.  If we can operate this Bill successfully, so far as the fixed price goes, we shall have raised the price of cattle at home to the same price as the price for export, and there will be no such thing as a man paying £1 or 10/- for a licence because they will not be any more valuable than the ordinary permit to export cattle if there were just an ordinary licence.  It would not be of any value so far as cash goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various parts of the Bill may be brought into operation by order.  We may not have to go into the marking at all.  We may be able to stop after fixing the price, and if there are no more cattle than there is a demand for, everything will be all right and things will take the normal course. Suppose, however, that there might be periods of the year where there would be more cattle than were required at that particular period.  Then, of course, the difficulty arises.  If you have, say, five farmers with ten cattle each and an exporter is willing to take ten, and a home butcher willing to take two more tens, that leaves 20 still, and the only fair way then is to bring in the marking provisions.  They come into operation by order.  A farmer has <Col N="81" /> a number of cattle which he thinks are fit.  He makes an application to the Department of Agriculture to have his cattle inspected.  The inspector goes down and he marks so many of them as being fit to be killed within, say, a fortnight or three weeks.  I cannot say the exact period, but certainly it would not go beyond three weeks.  The inspector might say that after this week so many will be fit next week or the week after.  He marks them fit for slaughter within a certain period and says to the farmer: &ldquo;I shall be round again in three weeks.&rdquo;  There are a certain number to be killed within the next fortnight, only, roughly, sufficient for the demand at home, and a certain number also for export.  In that way, if there are more cattle offering than are required for export and home slaughter, we try to get off the more fit cattle first and hold back the less fit.  Surely, the farmer should get relief by taking the very fit cattle off his hands first and leaving the less fit over. There may be a big surplus, say, in September or October, and that may disappear after some time.  Perhaps there would be a surplus again of stall feeders in March or April, as there was last year; but from that on to about July probably there would be no surplus at all.</P>
    <P>Senators perhaps may be under a misapprehension about this Bill. There is no such thing as sending an inspector into a man's farm and the inspector saying: &ldquo;I am going to mark your cattle.&rdquo;  The farmer will send for the inspector when he thinks his cattle are fit.  The farmers will be quite anxious, of course, to have the inspector sent.  In the same way, in the time of the stall feeding here, we did not send inspectors.  We asked the farmers to send us word if they wanted an inspector, and they were very glad to do so.  The process is the same here.  The farmer will notify us that he has cattle that he thinks are fit for slaughter.  We would then send an inspector down and he would mark them for some short period&mdash;two weeks or three weeks or whatever it is. They are the only cattle that can be purchased during that period.  Of course there is the usual provision about <Col N="82" /> the offence of slaughtering cattle that are not marked and so on.  That is the meaning of that Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>First of all, I said that if our supply did not exceed our demand we could stop at the fixed price.  If at certain periods it exceeded the demand, we would then have to resort to the other provisions.  Suppose, however, there is a greater number of cattle in the country than we can dispose of in the whole 12 months, then we resort to another provision in the Bill&mdash;Part IX, or rather Parts VII, VIII and IX.  I am taking Part IX first, however.  That deals with the supply of free meat.  We are quite convinced that at the present time there are more cattle than we require for ordinary export and home requirements, and we would be disposed certainly to bring in Part IX of the Bill as soon as possible in order to get rid of the surplus that exists at the moment. That brings us to the free meat scheme.  We can dispose of a considerable quantity of first-class meat in this way to those who cannot afford to buy it.  We would only supply the best beef.  There might be some advantage to the poor person in supplying inferior cows but there would be no advantage whatever to the Minister for Agriculture, because we want to get rid of the surplus of the best beef. It is very difficult at the moment to know what the number would amount to, but we could dispose of from 40,000 to 60,000.  At any rate, there are two classes of people who would get the free meat: people drawing home assistance and people drawing unemployment assistance.  We ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to issue vouchers through his home assistance officers to families in receipt of home assistance, and we ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to issue vouchers through the unemployment exchanges to those getting unemployment assistance. The vouchers would be according to the number in family.  They bring this voucher to a certain butcher who is named, and they get the meat from him.</P>
    <P>Now I have to come to the other point.  I have to make contracts with those butchers who supply that meat. <Col N="83" /> I ask the butchers for tenders to supply so much meat within such limits in a certain district.  Having got these tenders the butcher is given vouchers to supply the meat.  He supplies the meat to the people who present the vouchers. If that goes on all right everything is quite smooth.  But naturally there are various difficulties to be got over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the meat in addition to the unemployment assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely in addition to the unemployment assistance.  There is no deduction made for it.  Now as to the kind of meat supplied.  That was a very difficult matter to decide.  We had to consult with certain rather big people in the business in the City and in the country towns.  I met some victuallers and consulted with them on this matter and we found that it would be a very difficult and expensive measure to have certain cattle killed for this purpose.  It was more simple and convenient to have the beef supplied by the victuallers.  One condition is that it must come off first-class heifers and bullocks.  That is what we specify by order.  In all probability the contractors will be inclined to sell the very best cuts to their own customers; but they will supply good meat from first class animals to those who hold vouchers.  This will of course absorb a certain amount of cattle, which is really the interest we have in it more than anything else.  I mean that is the chief interest of the Department of Agriculture in it.  The question is whether that number of cattle is sufficient to absorb the surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We get a surplus in this way: In 1933 we exported 240,000 fat cattle; 120,000 fat cattle were consumed at home, so that 360,000 fat cattle were produced in 1933.  In this year we are only allowed to export 120,000 fat cattle. Our consumption, so far at any rate as this year is concerned, will probably be 180,000, and it is increasing all the time.  That would make 300,000 fat cattle this year.  So that if we had the same number of fat cattle produced this year as last year we would have 60,000 more to dispose of.  We can dispose <Col N="84" /> of that 60,000 if necessary.  But in all probability the number of fat cattle for sale will be less in 1934 than in 1933.  The number of fat cattle for the past five or six years has been going down continuously, and in all probability there will be fewer fat cattle this year than in 1933.</P>
    <P>I now come to deal with the other parts of the Bill.  I had better finish Part IX&mdash;Free Meat.  We first of all considered a scheme for giving out this meat at a cheap rate.  The first idea was that first quality beef was to be sold at 2d. per lb. to people who held vouchers.  The next scheme was to deduct a certain amount from home assistance or from unemployment assistance at the rate of 2d. per lb. We found that our great difficulty in such a very big scheme was this: that in the beginning we may not be able to supply the meat.  We thought it better for an experimental period of four months to give free meat.  It is <i>ex-gratia.</i>  If the person does not get it he has no cause of action; he may have a complaint.  We say we will do our best, but we are not bound by law to supply it.</P>
    <P>This scheme is so big that there may be certain districts where it may be impossible to operate it.  As soon as we have the machinery going we may in all probability change to the cheap meat.  We may then make a small charge instead of giving it as free meat. When I mentioned that matter in the Dáil, people on all sides, particularly the Opposition, approved of that plan, because they said it was better to make them pay a little for it, as it would make them feel they had a right to it and it would work better than if there were no charge.</P>
    <P>If Part IX of the Bill is operated, Part III becomes necessary.  Part III is the levy.  It provides for the levy which was mentioned in the Financial Resolution.  In the Dáil for purposes of calculation that levy was stated at £1 per fat beast and 5/- per sheep.  I do not know if that is to be the amount. It may possibly be varied to so much per cwt. or so much to the particular class of beast.  For purposes of calculation that would bring you in somewhere about £300,000 a year, and it <Col N="85" /> would go about half way towards carrying out the various things in this Bill, including the free meat scheme.  This levy of £1 and 5/- cannot come out of the pocket of the producer, because the producer is paid a fixed price.  So that the butcher must find this levy.  Naturally he either pays it himself or passes it on to the consumer.  If he passes it on to the consumer the consumer can unquestionably pay, because the price as compared even with pre-war prices is very low.  The levy of £1 per head increases the price to the consumer by one halfpenny per lb.  The producer of the meat can afford to pay his share of part of the cost of these schemes&mdash; that is, the free meat scheme and the other schemes to which I am coming.</P>
    <P>Part VII and VIII of the bill deal with manufacturing processes in respect of cattle and sheep. The Minister is taking powers to himself to lend or invest money in this business.  All that is well known to the Senators, as they have read the Bill.  The Minister is taking power, first, to lend money for setting up factories for the processing of old cows, and, secondly, for supplying these old cows at a very small cost to the manufacturers of meat meal. These old cows are very difficult to dispose of at the present moment. Many farmers find it difficult to dispose of them at any price.  They are selling them at 10/- and 15/- a head. We hope to give them £2 10s. 0d. to £3 per head for them.  £3 per head would be the maximum price delivered at the nearest railway station.  The manufacturer then takes them away and the farmer is paid for his cows.  That is all he cares about and not what becomes of the cow afterwards.  The cow is brought to the central factory and converted into meat meal.  In order to relieve anxiety amongst Senators there is a provision in the agreement with this factory that they must not sell any eatable products within this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For animals.  We are also empowered under the Bill to carry on tinning&mdash;that is to set up <Col N="86" /> any factory that it might be possible to set up under the provisions of this Bill, either by way of loan or by Government action only&mdash;by way of loan preferably.  If there is any proposition from any proprietary company prepared to start in this business it will be done by way of loan.  Under Section 35 the accounts of all such businesses must be properly audited and laid before each House of the Oireachtas, so that we cannot do anything without making both Houses fully aware of all our transactions.  I should like to stress that the big principle of the Bill is the fixed price and dealing with surplus cattle.  I have tried to outline as briefly as possible how the Bill will be worked, but these are the two big principles to which I should like Senators to direct their minds.  When we are able to offer a fixed price and to deal with the surplus cattle, I think we will have got over the ill-effects of the quota.  That is all we are trying to do.  Do not accuse me, therefore, of trying to do anything by way of getting over the ill-effects of the tariff.  That could be done by increasing the bounty if we were in a position to do it, but it is only to deal with the ill-effects of the quota that this Bill is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that it is going to be a difficult Bill to administer, but still I believe it can be done.  There was a very big discussion in regard to that point in the Dáil and as I am very likely to be asked a number of questions here in regard to the same point, I should like to anticipate them.  It is going to take a rather large staff.  I do not know exactly by how much the internal staff at the Head Office is going to be increased, but it is not going to be very outrageous.  It may cost between £3,000 and £4,000 a year.  The outdoor staff, however, will be rather big.  As far as we can estimate at the moment, it will take 120 inspectors to work the Bill.  They are going to cost probably about £250 or £300 each by way of salary as well as travelling expenses. Senators may have an idea of what that is going to cost.  It is, however, going to be a comparatively small item, even if it amounts to £40,000 or £50,000 a year, if we can get what we want under <Col N="87" /> the Bill, that is, to get £3, £4 or £5 more per head for fat cattle.  If we succeed in doing that the £40,000 or £50,000 spent on administration will be very well spent, and I am sure will not be thought exorbitant by any Senator here.  To anticipate any discussion with regard to the staff, I want to say that I am not going to have anything to do with the appointment of the staff, so that no Senator need say that I am going to put my friends into these jobs. I am trying to anticipate these questions so as to shorten discussion.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister answer two questions? It will ease the debate later. One of them is what will be the price to the consumer of the 180,000 cattle slaughtered at home at the fixed price?  Secondly, what will be the cost, under the free meat scheme, of 40,000 cattle of 10 cwt. each at £1 5s. per cwt.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The free meat scheme is to cost £400,000 roughly.  The old cow scheme, if I may refer to it as such, is going to cost about £150,000.  We are calculating that for odds and ends, increase of staff and so on, another £50,000 will be necessary.  That brings the total up to £600,000 per year.  With regard to the question put by Senator The McGillycuddy, I am afraid I cannot say what the increased cost of meat will be to the consumer, because perhaps that would be hardly fair. There are butchers who are paying at present a good price for cattle, particularly here in Dublin.  They are paying almost the equivalent of the export price.  There are, on the other hand, victuallers who have time to go down the country and make a good bargain.  They are getting cattle at a much lower price and they are, I take it, charging the same for the beef they sell.  I think I might say, therefore, that I hope at any rate that part of the <Col N="88" /> increase at least will come out of the butchers' present price.  It may admittedly increase the price to the consumer.</P>

      <P>The Minister has admitted for the first time, at least in this House, that the tariffs have lowered the price of cattle in this country.  He has asked us to discuss this Bill for what the Bill contains, and not to go into the causes of the economic war.  I agree that the Bill should be discussed on its merits and that we should avoid <Col N="89" /> a discussion on the economic war. The Minister says that if we want to secure a higher price for the farmers then we should advocate a higher bounty.  We have often advocated a higher bounty.  We consider that the farmer is victimised on account of his not being placed on the same footing as any other manufacturer.  If a man is manufacturing ropes or any other commodity, he can get a refund of the tariff which he has to pay when he exports his products.  If he is manufacturing shirts or collars he can get the full amount of the tariff that he pays on his exports.  The Minister tells us that we should advocate a greater bounty on cattle, and I hope that he will look at the matter in that light in future.  I have nothing further to say in regard to the economic war, and I shall confine myself to the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I oppose this Bill and I ask the Seanad to vote against the Second Reading.  Although such action is not in accordance with the usual practice in this House I am convinced that we should adopt that procedure with this Bill.  This Bill is a most revolutionary and a most unworkable measure.  In my opinion it is not capable of being so amended as to make it acceptable to the farmers, who produce fat stock, to the butchers, or to the cattle traders.  It makes the Minister an absolute dictator so far as the live stock of the country are concerned. It takes away all freedom of trade from everybody connected in any way with the live stock trade in this country.  Section 4 of the Bill says, &ldquo;The Minister may, by order, make regulations prescribing any matter or thing which is referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.&rdquo; Practically every other section of the Bill states that the Minister may &ldquo;by order&rdquo; do certain things.  The tendency of the Government is, and the tendency of the previous Government to a certain extent was, to give power to Ministers to make orders.  It is time that the Seanad put a stop to making of these orders by Ministers.  If the Minister wants to make an order, he should <Col N="90" /> have it passed by resolution in both Houses.  If this tendency is allowed to develop, we shall, in a short time, have legislation by order and government by officials.  Section 9, which the Minister discussed at considerable length, refers to registers. Every butcher must register and be licensed.  His shop must be registered and his slaughter-house licensed, and if he manufactures any product, however trifling, he must, under this Bill, have a licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only when the product is in a container.  That provision refers to tinned and bottled meat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, the Bill makes it necessary for a farmer who kills a sheep to register even if he only sells portion of it to his own workmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>He will have to register and pay 5/- in these circumstances, although the sheep may not be worth more than 5/-.  The Minister may refuse a licence to any person who fails to pay the fees or who becomes a bankrupt or for other reasons specified in the Bill.  It is hardly fair for the Minister to take such drastic powers because if a man in the ordinary course of business has, through no, fault of his own, to claim the protection of the court he is not knocked completely out of business.  In this case, if he fails to pay his licence fee to the Minister or if he fails to pay the charge per head for the cattle, the Minister may close up his shop.  That is very drastic treatment of the poor butcher who might not at the time have the necessary money.  A register must be kept of all transactions.  Any person can, on payment of 1/-, demand the production of the butcher's register. Moreover, on payment of 6d., a copy of a page or two pages of the butcher's register can be taken away. That is very drastic.  A number of people could come along one after another and demand certain folios of the butcher's book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall pass from that.  I am sorry I misinterpreted that clause.  Part III of the Bill deals with the levy on the cattle for slaughter.  If the Minister's idea is to be given effect, this portion of the Bill will have to remain.  It is not very objectionable. I have very little sympathy with the butchers, and I think that they could easily afford to pay £1 per head.  But there should be other means of getting it.  The only means of getting the butchers to pay a fair price is competition&mdash;supply and demand.  Nothing else will regulate the price the butcher will pay or the price he will charge. Part V of the Bill is rather important. This Part of the Bill does away with all freedom of trade.  It takes away from the farmer his ownership of his cattle or sheep.  An inspector may come along to any place where he expects fat cattle to be kept and require the farmer to bring these fat cattle in for inspection.  It is an offence for the farmer not to give him all the facilities he asks to inspect the cattle.  He will mark those cattle with the dates on which they are to be sold.  I suppose he will use a tag or a scissors mark. It is an offence for the farmer to sell these cattle until the time specified It is, again, an offence for the farmer to offer unmarked cattle for sale in Saorstát Eireann.  The Minister is, I presume, controlling all the licences, and, in that way, the farmer cannot sell either his marked or unmarked cattle. He may want money to buy provisions or food or clothing for his family.  His credit is gone.  He cannot get the commodities which he requires unless he is able to sell his cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is going to insist on this provision then, I suggest to him, he should arrange a moratorium for the farmer in the case of his rates, his <Col N="92" /> annuities, his bank debts and his shop debts and, in addition, give him a voucher to enable him to procure food and clothing for his family.  The Minister should do that for the farmer if he is going to stop him from selling his stock.  The Minister takes power under Part V of the Bill to fix the minimum price at which fat cattle may be bought, but he does not fix the price at which they are to be exported.  The Minister says the price fixed will be the price which the cattle will be worth in England.  Does that mean the price minus the tariff or the price plus the tariff.  That is an important point and, if I may anticipate the Minister's reply, I am afraid the fixed price will be the price minus the tariff in England.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister how he is going to deal with the licences.  If, for instance, we have 3,000 cattle in the Dublin market, less than one-fourth of them would be required for slaughter at home.  There would be only 1,000 export licences required. What is to happen the balance of the licences?  Can the exporters buy fat cattle at any price they like, and is the butcher at home to be compelled to pay the fixed price?  These are points the Minister ought to consider. I cannot see how the Minister is going to administer that portion of the Bill. I think it will prove more difficult than he anticipates.  Under the Bill the Minister may, when he thinks proper, prohibit the export of cattle or of any particular grade or class of cattle. There are many farmers who, like myself, tie up 300 to 400 cattle in the month of November.  They do so in order to wait until the glut period passes over.  The custom at present is to export those cattle and to have them all sold before the end of January. Under this measure we may expect to have an inspector coming to our farms or cattle sheds and giving us permission to sell them in lots of threes, fours or fives.  In my opinion there are very few people going to stall-feed under such conditions.</P>
    <P>A man in that business will want to sell his cattle because he cannot afford to keep them until April, May or June as he will be compelled to do if the Minister is to put this portion of the <Col N="93" /> Bill into operation.  There are very few men, I fear, who will stall feed under the conditions laid down in this Bill except they get an assurance that they will be able to dispose of their cattle when the glut period passes. This Bill prohibits them from doing that.  The cattle may be fat in November or December and the Minister may prohibit them from being exported until January or February, but when January or February comes there will be only stores to export and not fat cattle.  These are serious considerations and, in my opinion, the Minister has not given them sufficient thought or consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking power to engage in the various classes of business set out.  He himself stated in the Dáil that under this part of the Bill he can be butcher, buyer, seller or exporter and, I believe, he can become a feeder.  I would like to know how he is going to carry on the export side of the business when he takes that in hands.  Will he do it through the recognised exporters or through inspectors? It is important to know that because we have had some experience of Government interference in the cattle trade.  It was not very successful. Nobody can manage the export trade as well as the exporters.</P>

      <P>That is a controversial matter, and I am keeping off it. I am glad to be able to say that I am in agreement with the Minister as regards one part of the Bill, namely, the part that proposes the setting up of a factory for the manufacture of meat meal.  I am in thorough agreement with the setting up of a factory for the making of canned meat.  I have <Col N="94" /> advocated that for a number of years. I have long been of the opinion that we should have some means of disposing of old and diseased cows.  As regards Part IX, I have no objection to free meat being given by the Government to people who are in receipt of home assistance or to the unemployed. But I suggest it will be rather hard lines on people who are working, many of them at a small wage, that they should have to pay top price for the meat they require, and inferior stuff at that, whereas the Minister's proposal is that the best quality of meat must be given to the unemployed, and given to them for nothing.  That will have a demoralising effect.  These people should be charged something for the meat.  They will put no value on it if they get it for nothing, while the people who are working and who will have to go to the shops and pay top price for inferior stuff will become very dissatisfied.  It is certain that the price of meat is going to be very much higher.  While I have no objection to that, I do not believe it is going to be of any advantage to the producers if the export price is to be kept low. We produce a surplus of butter in this country, and yet we have this extraordinary position that butter is 6d. or 7d. a pound dearer here than it is in England.  But what advantage has that been to the dairy farmers of this country?  They are no better off.  The same thing will happen in the case of beef.  The price of beef is going to go up as a result of this Bill, but the advantage is not going to go to the producers of beef or mutton.  In a short time this country will, in my opinion, be the poorest country in the world.  The cost of living here will be higher than in any country in the world.  I move the adjournment of the Debate.</P>
