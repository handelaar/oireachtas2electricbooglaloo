      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1), To delete in lines 33 and 34 the words &ldquo;a vocational education committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that the officers of vocational education committees shall not come under the operations of the Bill.  It is pretty well known that the salaries paid are not excessive.  As a matter of fact, when the Act setting up vocational education committees was under consideration reference was made to the inadequate salaries being paid technical instructors and people of that kind, and in order to ensure that adequate salaries would be paid a special clause was inserted giving the Minister for Education power to see that local authorities or vocational education committees would be compelled, where the necessity arose, to increase the salaries of these teachers. It is, I think, true to say that about 85 per cent. of the teachers employed by vocational education committees will not come under the operations of the Bill, as it stands, because it is well known that 85 per cent. of the salaries paid do not reach the maximum of £300 per annum.  The Vocational Education Act was introduced for a definite purpose.  It was stated, and I am certainly in agreement with the statement, that our system of economy was lopsided, that sufficient attention was not paid to the industrial <Col N="990" /> end and that an effort should be made to encourage industrial occupations apart from agriculture.  When we take into consideration the fact that this country could not for a long period in any sense be described as an industrial one, it was necessary to take steps to encourage industry. When the vocational education committees were set up, qualified teachers were appointed to educate boys and girls in order to prepare them to take their place in the new economy that was to be brought about.</P>
    <P>I do not think it can be said that the teachers employed by these committees are overpaid for their work. In my opinion, it is false economy to start interfering with people engaged in that work or to prevent them giving wholeheartedly of their best in carrying out the duties for which they were appointed.  Large numbers of brilliant young men and women secured scholarships in the universities after competitive examinations and having gone through their university course they were appointed teachers under the vocational education scheme.  It is to the credit of the vocational committees that they appointed such teachers.  At this stage it is unfair, having regard to the miserable amount that would be saved, to include these teachers in this Bill.  The matter was argued at great length in the other House, where it was pointed out that the small amount that would be saved by the inclusion of these officers would not be an economy at all.  The amount involved in most counties would be on the average £15 yearly. The extraordinary thing is that the county councils and urban councils are by statute compelled to strike a certain rate, the full proceeds of which must go to the vocational education committees.  If only £15 is saved in the different counties the local taxpayers will not be relieved. I do not see how the general taxpayers will be relieved, because the State is compelled to contribute a certain amount to the committees. Taking all these things into consideration, in all fairness and decency we should not include the officers of <Col N="991" /> these committees in the scope of this Bill.  Many of them were appointed in recent years and the salaries were fixed in proportion to present conditions here.  Some of these officials were transferred from the technical education committees, and I think it was laid down in the Vocational Education Act that their terms and conditions of employment should not be interfered with.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the present proposals are going to bring about a muddle and that it is quite possible we will have the position that was created in the case of certain civil servants.  As these civil servants were transferred officers, some of them went to the courts and succeeded in establishing their claim that as existing officers their terms and conditions of employment should not be interfered with. The higher paid officials who will be affected by this Bill, if they are included in it, will be in an identical position.  As this amendment was debated at some length in the Dáil, I think, on balance, a good case has been made out by the officers of vocational education committees that they should not be included in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I greatly regret to have to throw cold water on anything that should be a good thing, especially with regard to vocational education. As I happen to be a member of a village vocational committee, I do not think I would be doing my duty if I did not inform the House of my experience with regard to a rural school which employs a male and a female teacher.  Of course, I do not doubt if people were prepared to accept the instruction given to their children that the school might be made a success.  Our experience so far is that we cannot get people to come to this vocational school. During the first year we had a few boys who came very reluctantly and intermittently.  It is now in existence two and a half years.  It has been availed of by about half a dozen girls, who come dressed up like young ladies to amuse themselves for an hour or so.  They play hurling, learn <Col N="992" /> a little bit of cookery and a few words of Irish.  The committee went into the figures recently and they calculated that the entire cost of the school worked out at about £80 per annum per pupil.  I do not say that all vocational schools are as great a failure as that, but I honestly believe that the old system introduced by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction worked much better than these vocational schools. I do know another rural school which has been very successful and has done a considerable amount of work but, on the whole, I cannot agree that these vocational schools are worth the money expended on them.  In the school to which I have referred, we have no boy pupils although we have a man engaged to teach boys.  I regret that, owing to my experience. I cannot support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the gloomy picture of the vocational schools painted by Senator Miss Browne.  My experience, extending over a number of years, has been the opposite.  In some cases, there was a reason for the paucity of attendance in the schools.  It was in great measure due to the failure to procure openings for the pupils who had passed through the schools.  That grievance obtained under past Governments and up to recent times. With the growth of industrial life, which we all hope to see, openings will be made available for the pupils of these schools.  In the city of Dublin and other large centres, it is well known that employers go to those schools for their apprentices. The committees set up, acting in conjunction with the employers, are the medium through which many boys and girls attending those schools are placed in employment.  They are, therefore, doing remarkably good work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Miss Browne should remember that the recent extension of vocational education embraces continuation classes.  One of the complaints made, from time to time, was that the course in the vocational classes under the technical instruction committees was of such a character that <Col N="993" /> only a small proportion of the pupils leaving school were qualified to avail of it.  That came about by reason of the fact that pupils left school at a very early age.  Many of them left before they graduated in the sixth standard.  All that is being remedied at present.  Very few pupils now leave school before they pass through the sixth standard.  They are, consequently, qualified to take advantage of the classes provided by the vocational education committees.  I am aware that in one county there was a growing and persistent demand for these schools, not alone for the purpose of technical instruction, but for the purpose of the education provided by the continuation classes held during the day.  It was the usual fate of the boy or girl who left school at 14 years to hang around the streets or to get into blind-alley employment, with the result that, when they came to 18 years of age, they frequently went on the dole.  If for no other purpose than keeping these pupils occupied in educational work during that important period of their lives&mdash; 14 years to 18 years&mdash;the existence of the vocational schools would be justified. The demoralisation that sets in in the youth of the country of both sexes during that period is largely attributed to want of educational direction.  This, I think, is the only country in the world where such neglect has been allowed to exist.  In Germany, they follow up the pupils until they are 21 years of age and see that they are placed.  Employers can be induced to recruit their youthful employees through these schools and, with that inducement, the schools are bound to be a prolific source of educational and national utility.  Drop them now at this early stage and you do the gravest harm to 90 per cent. of the children of the poor, who have no other facilities for this class of education.  The rich man's child may have the secondary school or, later, the university available to him, but these schools constitute the university of the poor man's child.  I am speaking now with regard to the statements made by Senator Miss Browne, that these schools are not worth the money <Col N="994" /> expended on them.  I think that the sum of £80 per pupil mentioned by her is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The teachers in these schools are men and women of high educational qualifications. I know a married man, an M.A., with a wife and family, who is a full-time teacher under the Education Act and who receives a salary of £170 or £175 per year.  I think that that is disgraceful.  I do not say that that man will come under the present Bill, but a salary of that kind is very poor encouragement at the present time when the Government are embarking on a very wide scheme of university education for the poor.  I think that it is a very bad thing for the Government to come along with these cuts, since the people concerned cannot afford them.  The lives of these teachers are very arduous.  An itinerant vocational education teacher must not alone be an expert teacher, but must be an expert cyclist.  He has to cycle ten or twelve miles at night in all kinds of weather.  The same remark applies to lady teachers.  They receive meagre travelling expenses, which are not sufficient to provide proper travelling facilities.  To apply the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; to those who draw their salaries from the vocational committees is a very retrograde act and will react very unfavourably on the prospects of education being held out to the classes from which these teachnical schools draw their support.  I appeal very strongly to the Minister to exclude these officers from this &ldquo;cut,&rdquo; if he wishes to make vocational education a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment, but not for the reason given by Senator Miss Browne.  I believe that these vocational and technical teachers are doing good work but, under the present policy of the Government, we have not the money to pay them. While that policy lasts, everybody should be made bear part of the burden.  Senator Cummins said that a salary of £170 a year for a technical instructor was disgraceful.  A great many farmers have not half that amount to live on and we have no complaint from Senator Cummins or no argument that they should be relieved <Col N="995" /> of their rates or annuities or that they should get the dole in the many cases where they would require it.  I appeal to the Minister to reject the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly (Minister for Local Government and Public Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment of Senator Farren, because this Bill is intended to apply to all officials of local authorities.  It would be invidious to select one class, such as the teachers of vocational education committees, for omission.  It is true that a great number of teachers in the vocational education schools were very poorly paid as compared with national teachers and other teachers, but two or three years ago&mdash;I am not sure of the exact date&mdash;a Vocational Education Act was passed by the Oireachtas and power was given to the Minister, in that Act, to prescribe scales of salary for these teachers.  That has not been done by the Minister, but, in the last year or two, he corresponded with all the committees and pointed out that, in many cases, the scales of salary paid their employees, particularly teachers, were not adequate. In practically all the cases the committees agreed to raise the salaries of the teachers, and I understand that they are now being paid on such a scale as would have been prescribed if the Minister had acted under the powers given him in the Act.  That has been done voluntarily by the vocational education committees concerned. A very big percentage of the teachers&mdash;Senator Farren said 85 per cent., but I think that would be somewhat high&mdash;will not be subjected to the &ldquo;cut,&rdquo; because they have not got a salary of £300 a year.  The number of teachers who will not be affected will be very considerable, but there is a saving to be made and that saving will go partly to the local authority and partly to the State.  The State recoups the local authority certain payments, and if these payments are reduced the amount of the recoupment will be reduced, so that both the local authorities and the State will benefit by the economies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Edward Coey Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing section the provisions of this Act shall not apply to medical officers.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable proposal and one, I think, that every member of this House should support.  It is common knowledge that medical officers are doing continuous duty, day and night, Sundays and holidays.  They have no free time to call their own.  It is impossible for anyone to realise what this means except they have had the experience of it.  It interferes with the ordinary amenities of life and not only does it affect the medical officer himself, but it affects his wife and household as well; it interferes with his whole social life.  He cannot attend any function without being liable to be called away; he is always conscious of this liability and it restricts his freedom in many ways. That does not apply to any other class of public servants, so that these medical officers are in a class by themselves. They are paid a definite salary without war bonus or cost-of-living bonus, and their private practice has dwindled to practically nothing.  Then they have their travelling expenses to bear.  In all cases the salaries of medical officers here are much below those paid in England, Scotland and the North of Ireland, while in many cases, perhaps 50 per cent. of the cases, the cost of living is higher in the Free State than in England.  I could give many other reasons of the poverty and hardship that many medical officers are suffering from at the present time.  I appeal to the House in this matter not for their sympathy or generosity, but simply for justice and fair play.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  I understand that something like 75 or 80 per cent. of <Col N="997" /> the medical officers in the Free State have not got salaries which would bring them within the provisions of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  It is only something like 20 or 25 per cent. who will be affected.  The whole effect of this Act will be, because very few medical officers are above the limit, to bring in 20 or 25 per cent. who are now paid salaries that would bring them within the provisions of the Act.  The result will be that you will bring this small percentage down to the level of the other 75 per cent., and then you will have a dead level of low salaries amongst those medical officers. For these reasons, and the other reasons given by Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger, I support this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamOSullivan" hpid="Dr. O'Sullivan Dr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, first of all, that there is no man in this House, or in this country, who knows the conditions of the medical officers to-day better than Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger.  First of all he was a medical officer himself, then he was an inspector, and, finally, he occupied the highest administrative post in the country as a medical commissioner of the old Local Government Board. Medical officers are in two categories. First, you have the whole-time medical officer and, secondly, you have the part-time medical officer.  Whole-time medical officers comprise county medical officers of health, superintendents of mental hospitals and a few county hospitals.  No one could suggest that any medical officer of health is getting too high a salary.  They are very poorly paid considering their work.  Their work is very arduous and very dangerous inasmuch as they have to deal with infectious diseases.  The health of the whole county depends upon the county medical officer, yet he is to be cut because his salary reached £600 or £700 a year.  Part-time officers consist principally of dispensary doctors and officers of the smaller hospitals and so on.  The salaries for these men were fixed 25 years ago, on a graded scale, and it takes 20 years in most cases to reach the maximum.  These salaries were fixed very low and did not reach an adequate figure at all.  Then, dispensary <Col N="998" /> doctors have their locomotion expenses; they have to maintain a motor car, and to be at the services of the poor night and day.  When the times were good in the last 25 years I heard no Government, neither the British Government nor our own previous Government nor the present Government suggesting that medical officers should get increases in salary; but now when the times are bad it is suggested that they must get cuts in their salaries.  If there is one man that should be exempted from cuts it is the medical officer.  When times are depressed the part-time medical officer finds the income from his private practice, upon which he partly depended, almost cut out entirely.  I say without fear of contradiction that medical men throughout the country are not receiving one-fourth of the income, from private practice, that they did some years ago, and the amount that they receive, such as it is, is growing less and less every day.  I say the cut proposed here is too big for medical officers to bear.</P>
      <P>The Minister told the Dáil the other day that a Fianna Fáil T.D. told him that between 75 and 80 per cent. of the medical officers throughout the country will not be affected at all by this Bill.  That is the best argument that could be advanced as to why this amendment should be carried.  What this Bill is going to save the State or the local authorities is a mere bagatelle; it is not worth talking about.  It is suggested, or it might be suggested, that the cost of living is lower now than when these graded salaries were instituted.  That is not so.  Everything is higher.  Taxes on motors are higher; the cost of petrol is higher, and the rates paid to servants are three times as high as they were in those days.  Everything is higher&mdash;the cost of running the show, so to speak, is higher, and no medical man makes one shilling profit out of his attendance on the poor.  I think medical officers should be entirely exempt from these cuts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>To select for exclusion from the operations of this Bill, one class of men in the way this amendment does, requires justification.  I <Col N="999" /> think there is justification for it, in this instance.  The amendment being a comprehensive one, one can speak on it in general terms.  I believe there is no class of men in the country who get so little remuneration for the work they have to do, and which they only begin to do after long expensive training, as doctors affected by this legislation. It is well known to everybody who takes an interest in life in this country that probably the hardest and most disagreeable job is that of the dispensary doctor.  It is a terrible life. They get little remuneration; it is a continuous job night and day, and one in such a position can never depend on calling any part of the 24 hours his own.  A disheartened, discontented medical service is very bad for the community.  I think the House would be justified in passing this amendment and exempting these doctors altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am justified in saying that everybody in this country is justly proud of the record of the medical profession, the way they attend the poor and the way they attend the middle class for very little payment.  It is marvellous the way they attend on red tickets.  The way they treat other cases as if they were red ticket cases should entitle them to the sympathy of every right-minded man of this country.  We have in Dublin some of the best doctors in the world.  At the same time we have some of the poorest paid doctors of the world in this country.  If we cut the pay of these poorly paid doctors, how do we expect them to stay in the country?  Do we want to export them to England or to other countries? Their education has cost a lot of money here.  I think when they have qualified the least they might expect from us is that we might pay them a living wage. They are not being paid a living wage. We are told that their salaries are so poor that these cuts will not touch them, and that it is only the older men who have devoted years of their lives in the service who will be affected. See what the lot of these men would have been had they gone to England in <Col N="1000" /> their earlier days! First of all they would have got much bigger initial salaries than here; and they would get larger increases.  But we want to cut them and we are doing that at the very time when England is restoring the cuts in spite of the depression we hear so much about.  I strongly support this amendment and sincerely hope the House will pass it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  I would like to explain why I support this amendment after opposing an amendment in favour of vocational teachers.  The dispensary doctor is a part-time medical officer. It was calculated that the salary he was getting was only part of the remuneration he would get as a doctor. I am going through the country constantly, and I am positively certain that the salary the medical officer is getting as a dispensary doctor is entirely inadequate for the work he is doing.  That is a fact so far as the dispensary doctor is concerned and for that reason I support this amendment. I am not out for cutting the salaries of any particular class of the community, but the present time necessitates the cutting of salaries in almost every case.  But we should make an exception in the case of medical doctors, particularly dispensary doctors, until we can restore all the cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to say I cannot agree to accept the amendment. Speaking as Minister for Local Government and Public Health, I am very anxious that we should have a contented medical service.  But I do not believe the cuts proposed here will, to any extent, make the medical officers of the local authorities in any way discontented.  First of all, as has been pointed out by several Senators, it is only a relatively small percentage that will come under the cuts.  There has been made already special provision putting medical men in a privileged position <i>vis-a-vis</i> others that come under local authorities.  We went, as far as we could, to improve the several privileges that apply especially to dispensary doctors and medical men in the service of local <Col N="1001" /> authorities.  While only part-time officers, they are treated as whole-time when it comes to pensions. There is no other part-time official of local authorities that gets a pensions. Medical officers in that respect have special privileges under the local authorities.  It is not quite correct for Senator Dr. O'Sullivan to say that these scales of salary were fixed 25 or 26 years ago.  The scales of salaries were revised eight or nine years ago &mdash;in 1925 or 1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that, even after that revision, the salaries are too high, but I do not think it a good principle to select for special treatment any one class, no matter how deserving they may be or what good service they may have rendered, and unquestionably the medical officers of local authorities, whether they be the county medical officers instituted in recent years, other officers of the medical service, or the dispensary medical officers, have all rendered good service to this State.  I do not think that anybody has any doubt in his mind about that, particularly anybody who occupies a position under a local authority or who is connected with the Government. I think everybody must admit that while there are unquestionably black sheep in the medical service as there are in every other service, taking them all round the medical officers have rendered excellent service to this State and to the local authorities. Nevertheless, even making all due allowance for the excellent service <Col N="1002" /> they have rendered and even taking into account the fact that their incomes from other sources, as has been stated, may have decreased, I believe that under present circumstances, as Senator Counihan has said, it is only fair that when the majority of citizens have to suffer something in their incomes, the doctors should also be prepared to bear their portion.  I do not see any special reason to exempt them, nor have I heard any argument of such a nature as would induce me to change my mind and exempt medical officers from the operations of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOSullivan" hpid="Dr. O'Sullivan Dr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just desire to refer to one statement of the Minister. Twenty-five years ago the salaries of most of the dispensary doctors in Ireland were fixed on a graded scale. There were some few cases of boards of guardians who refused to fall into line, until the time the Minister mentioned, but they were a very small proportion of the total number.  I have a very vivid recollection of being a member of a deputation which met Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger when he was chief medical commissioner and Sir Henry Robinson 25 years ago. It was then the graded scale of salaries was instituted.  Most of the boards of guardians in Ireland adopted these graded scales.  There were a few who refused to do so and these few had to be brought into line in the last ten or a dozen years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;(1)  This Act shall only apply to such local authorities as shall determine to adopt the same in the manner in this section hereinafter provided.</P>
      <P>(2)  Within one month after the passing of this Act the Chief Executive Officer of every local authority shall summon a meeting of the members of the local authority of which not less than seven days' notice shall be given in the manner in which notices of meetings of the local authority are usually given, at which meeting the local authority shall decide by a majority of the members present at such meeting whether the Act shall be adopted or not.  In the case of an equality of votes the Act shall be deemed not to have been adopted.</P>
      <P>(3)  A certificate in writing of the Chief Executive Officer of the local authority, countersigned by the chairman of the meeting, shall be conclusive evidence of the adoption of the Act.</P>
      <P>(4)  The decision as to whether the Act shall be adopted or not shall be a reserved function of the councils of the county boroughs of Dublin and Cork and the borough of Dun Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to allow local authorities themselves to decide whether or not this Act should be enforced with regard to their employees.  On the Second Reading of the Bill, statements were made to the effect that local authorities were almost howling for such a measure or for reductions in salaries of the employees of local authorities.  I think the Minister said that he had received demands from local authorities for much larger reductions in the salaries of employees of local authorities than were proposed in the Bill.  There may be a legitimate difference of opinion as to whether local authorities are in favour of reductions in the salaries of their employees or not and it is in order to give local authorities an opportunity of giving expression to their opinions that this amendment has been put down.  The amendment proposes that before reductions can take place in the salaries of employees of local authorities, each local authority shall have an opportunity of considering the matter and that, if a local authority decides that it is not in favour of a reduction in the salaries of its employees, the Bill shall not operate as far as the employees of that particular authority are concerned. This raises a very important issue as to whether the people who pay the piper are entitled to call the tune.  The members of local bodies in this country have been elected in their respective areas by the ratepayers to manage the affairs of these areas.  This amendment proposes to give the elected representatives of the people an opportunity of deciding whether or not the proposals contained in this Bill with regard to reductions in the salaries of the employees of local authorities, shall operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions of employment and the rates of pay with regard to the higher officials employed by local authorities have been under consideration for a very long period.  In the early days of the Sinn Féin movement one of the proposals in the programme of that Party was that the higher officials employed by the local authorities should be recruited by competitive examination on a Civil Service basis: in other words, that there should be a local Civil Service system.  That proposal was never given effect to. <Col N="1005" /> Personally I regret it, because I think that the higher officials employed by the various local bodies throughout the country are, from the point of view of the welfare of the country, engaged on very important work.  I think that the local bodies are entitled to the services of the best men and women that are available, and that they are entitled to say whether their officials are at present being paid such salaries as would justify a reduction. Because of the failure to set up this Civil Service for the recruitment of local officials there is another good reason why this amendment should be adopted, and it is this: That you may have officials in one county being paid a much lower salary than officials engaged on the same work in another county.  That sometimes occurs.  It also happens that the officials who are being paid the lower salaries are more competent than those in a neighbouring county getting higher salaries.  Is it fair that people, already on low scales of salary in proportion to their responsibilities and the offices they hold, should be made subject to the same &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; as officials in neighbouring counties engaged on similar work and paid higher salaries?</P>
    <P>The amendment also provides that, in the County Boroughs of Dublin and Cork and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, this shall be a reserved matter to be dealt with by the elected councils and not be left to the decision of the borough managers.  In view of the statements made on the Second Reading of the Bill with regard to the terrible necessity that exists for the cutting down of the salaries paid to local officials, I think there is an additional reason why this amendment should be passed.  The local bodies, I think, ought to be allowed to express their opinions on this matter: on the statement that they are all in favour of the proposed reductions.  They, at least, ought to be given an opportunity of deciding it for themselves.  There is a fundamental principle involved in this amendment: that those who have been elected on the local bodies by the votes of the ratepayers ought to be the masters to decide whether reductions shall take place or not.  What is the good of having elections to local bodies <Col N="1006" /> if those elected by the ratepayers are not to be allowed to decide an important issue like this?  From every point of view, I think the Seanad ought to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would not be wise for the House to accept this amendment, and for the following reasons:&mdash;The House has already, in passing the Second Reading of this Bill, agreed to the principle that there should be a scaling down of salaries to meet the present emergency.  The cause for that scaling down is general. It applies to the whole country.  I do not think there is a rural district in the Twenty-Six Counties to which the case for this scaling down of salaries does not apply.  That is the first reason why the House should not accept this amendment.  The second reason is a practical one.  Suppose that you leave it open to the various councils to elect whether they shall apply this Act or not, the first result will be that you will have canvassing all over the country to a degree which was never known before.  Every official in the country who happens to hold a political view will have two incentives to go out canvassing. The first incentive will be opposition to the present Administration, and the second will be to save his salary.  Mind you, it is not one person looking for votes for office, such as we have heard here this evening, that will be out, but every other person in the country, canvassing, and you will have general confusion.  Is there any sound reason why you should face a situation of that kind?  I submit that there is not. That brings me into conflict, friendly conflict no doubt, with my friend, Senator Farren, in regard to one of the statements which he has made.  He has said that the local authorities in the matter of salaries should be the masters in their own house.  So far as I know they never have been the masters in their own house, and if some of the local authorities of whom I have had experience had been masters in their own house, then certainly you would have had very queer vagaries in regard to salaries.  We all know that these salaries are subject to the sanction of the Minister who, for the time being, represents the Parliament of this country. <Col N="1007" /> Therefore, the Parliament&mdash;the Dáil and the Seanad&mdash;are the masters in this House as well as in regard to every other matter concerning the salaries of public servants.</P>

      <P>My friend seems to have considerable knowledge of these local bodies.  It is extensive, but mine has been varied.  It embraces the whole country.  I know the working of these district councils, county councils, and councils in urban areas.  I know what would happen in case a general campaign of canvassing were started.  On the grounds that I have stated I would ask the Seanad, seeing that they have already agreed to the principle of this Bill on Second Reading, to refuse to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Senator Comyn, who says that the necessity for this Bill is general.  In the county I come from I have been a member of all the public bodies there for a number of years.  I have experience of the salaries paid and I can say that they are not excessive.  That county is in the happy position of having the lowest rates, I think, in any county in Ireland.  I am of opinion that if the officials there are subjected to the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; which this Bill would involve them in they will be unfairly treated, notwithstanding what Senator Comyn has said.  We are in the position in that county of having practically a new set of officials.  They are all employed at salaries which are much lower than the salaries paid in other counties.  Therefore, the position will be that they will suffer the same ratio of reduction as officials in other counties, some of whom may have twice their salaries and whose work is not nearly so onerous, and where perhaps the ratepayers are not in as good a position to pay.  I think, if this amendment is not accepted, that some provision ought to be introduced in the Bill whereby salaries fixed within a reasonable period of time, which are below a certain amount, should escape the operation of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is not to deal with the question of salaries, but rather that it should be left to the option of local authorities as to whether or not they will enforce the provisions of this Bill. Personally, I would prefer to vote for the rejection of the Bill than to accept the amendment because, as Senator Comyn has pointed out, the acceptance of the amendment would lead to any amount of canvassing and corruption. It would result in this, that it is not the deserving officials who would escape the cuts but those who would be the best canvassers: those who would have friends influential enough to exert themselves in canvassing the members of local bodies.  This amendment would cut across the whole principle of the Bill, and if it were accepted by the House I would move that the Bill be rejected altogether.  I think that would be a preferable course to adopt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal to be said in favour of the amendment.  There is no such thing as a uniform scale of salaries for the officials employed by local authorities. To a great extent they have been fixed arbitrarily by the local bodies.  The salaries of some officials have their roots in the past.  Some of them are a survival of the old Grand Jury days when salaries were fixed on a rather liberal scale.  Some local bodies, in fixing the salaries of their officials, did so in a rather parsimonious spirit.  So far as these local officials are concerned the Minister will, I think, admit that there is no uniformity such as you find in the case of big corporations like banks and similar institutions.  Would I be wrong in saying this: that the real object of this Bill is not economy. It has been introduced partly to be consistent and to fall into line with the general cuts made in the case of other public servants.  I feel disposed to say that politically the Bill is a popular one in the country.  It is popular, from the Fianna Fáil point of view, with the large masses of small farmers who want to see salaries cut and slashed.  We must be honest with ourselves and admit that that is a very <Col N="1009" /> important factor.  All legislation has its political reactions.  The Government in this Bill has given evidence of its intentions, and if there is strong opposition to it it can say &ldquo;the Seanad has blocked us&rdquo;.  That, of course, will fit in admirably with its general policy. The savings anticipated under the measure are negligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment, as I do not see any reason why the option which local authorities possess should not remain with them. I say that in view of the fact that there is no standard scale of salaries for the officials of local bodies.  Senator Farren pointed out that the policy of the old Sinn Fein Party was to standardise local government and to join up local services with the national services, so that there would be standard rates of payment.  It is ridiculous for Senator Comyn to talk about scaling down salaries when there are no standard rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to mention names, but everybody has read in the newspapers of certain secretaries of county councils having salaries of nearly £2,000.  We know that secretaries of county councils have been appointed at salaries of about £700 yearly.  I do not want to exaggerate the position, but I think I am correct in saying that the salaries in the case of new appointments to these positions would be about two-fifths of the old salaries.  To cut the salaries of people who were appointed a few years ago is not just.  Everybody knew about the depression, economic and otherwise, when these officials were appointed, so that it is unfair to cut their remuneration now.  I hope the House will pass the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I read the amendment, if it is passed, it would be as well to scrap the Bill straight away, because this proposal cuts across every clause, and gives the local authorities the power that the Government seeks to retain in its own hands.  It does not follow, of course, <Col N="1010" /> that I am in favour of this Bill as a whole.  The Government has brought it forward and apparently a good deal of time was taken in preparing it. While they considered the Bill necessary, this very cleverly drawn amendment, if it were adopted, would mean scrapping the Bill.  Possibly the Minister will correct me if that is not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read the amendment I was rather favourably disposed towards it.  On further consideration I have come to the conclusion that it would be a mistake to pass it.  In the first place the responsibility for the whole policy which underlies this Bill is with the Government and not with the local bodies.  There is a great deal to be said for the case made by Senator Duffy if he will only tell us how the amendment is going to meet it.  The Senator made the case, and I believe it is correct, that this Bill will not operate fairly; that the scale of payments is different, but he did not give us any evidence as to how adoption of the amendment would do anything to right that state of affairs. I am inclined to think that county councils that pay the lowest scales would be the first to vote in favour of cutting salaries.  There is no evidence that this proposal will work out equitably.  The Bill is a good attempt to have justice done to local officials.  It is not an attempt to right any injustice that exists but simply provides for a cut in salaries consistent, as the Minister suggested, with the cut that has taken place in the case of other officials.  The responsibility lies with the Government and with the Oireachtas.  As there is the possibility that some county councils would not adopt this proposal, probably there would then be a greater grievance.</P>

      <P>I desire to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Counihan.  I did not like this Bill. On the contrary I considered that it should be rejected.  The House did not reject it, but gave it a Second Reading, and if I were to vote for the amendment I should do so on the principle that the Bill is one I dislike. <Col N="1011" /> If the amendment were passed it would create an extraordinary state of affairs and make the position worse.  I do not think it is the proper course, having given the Bill a Second Reading, to pass an amendment of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what Senator Guinness said was quite correct, that if this amendment were adopted it would cut right across the principle of the Bill.  I think I would rather scrap the Bill if the amendment were adopted, because it would destroy all uniformity. I do not suggest that there is uniformity in the salaries now paid by local authorities, but it would destroy all uniformity in the cuts made in salaries.  There is a uniform system of cuts and different salaries are cut accordingly.  If a man has £700 or £800 a year, say, in County Meath, his salary would be cut in proportion.  If a man had a salary with cost-of-living bonus, the cut would be lighter than in the case of a man who has had a cut in the cost-of-living bonus.  People with cost-of-living bonus have suffered <Col N="1012" /> cuts in the last few years that other officials have not suffered.  A great many anomalies would be created if the amendment were adopted.  Perhaps some county councils, where the officials are well paid, would not adopt the Act while you would have other local authorities, where the officials may be badly paid, adopting it and making cuts in salaries.  Whatever anomalies exist at present would then be intensified.  Perhaps you would have a county council adopting the Act and a board of health in the same county not doing so, so that anomalies which undoubtedly exist would be intensified and there would be further grounds for real discontent.  It would be very unwise of the House to adopt the amendment.  If cuts in salaries are to be the order of the day, and as this House has agreed in principle to these cuts, then it is better to have them uniform, so that if there has to be a sacrifice all officials should be asked to bear them in proportion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1).  To insert before paragraph (g) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(g) payments by way of fees, salary or other remuneration paid to an officer of a local authority appointed in pursuance of Section 10 or of Section 11 of the Food and <Col N="1013" /> Drugs Act, 1875, for the due discharge of the duties therein mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not seem to be fortunate in getting support for my amendments but I think I can appeal to the good sense of the House in respect of this amendment. This amendment deals with very few persons, who are in a very special category It deals with only four persons who have been appointed by local authorities as public analysts.  The remuneration paid by the local authorities is very small.  It is as low as £15 per annum and the highest figure is £100.  The average, I suppose, would be between £40 and £70.  The position of these people is rather peculiar.  They are appointed by the local authority as public analysts and some of them occupy the same position for a number of local authorities. Because of their occupation, they have to maintain a laboratory and to employ a number of assistants.  They are obliged to spend a large amount on chemicals and all the paraphernalia required for the laboratory.  The bulk of the salary received by them is not paid directly by the local authorities. They are public analysts and they receive fees from private persons for examining samples submitted for public analysis.  The amount of money involved, so far as the local authorities are concerned, is very small.  It is provided in the Bill that the amount of money received for analyses such as I have described is to be regarded as part of their remuneration.  I think that that is grossly unfair and should be looked into.  If the Minister is not prepared to deal with the matter today, I am prepared to leave over the amendment until the Report Stage so that he may have an opportunity of examining it.  It is a matter that requires consideration and examination because these people are not in the same category as direct employees of a public authority.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the private fees that an analyst gets should be included in his salary.  I am doubtful that they are intended to be included.  According to the Food and Drugs Act, the public are entitled to have samples analysed at a fee of half a guinea.  That fee was fixed a very long time ago and it is a very small fee, because analytical work involves the expenditure of a good deal of time and requires a great deal of expert knowledge.  I do not think that that should be included in the analyst's salary.  I think that the analyst gets a salary from the county council over and above that, and no cognisance should be taken of these fees, because one analyst may do a great deal of this class of work and another analyst may do very little of it.  I do not care to give a positive opinion, but I think that private fees should not enter into the calculation in this case any more than in the case of the dispensary doctor.</P>

Probably they do <Col N="1016" /> not, because the registrars of State stocks were not affected by the other Economies Bill dealing with State employees.  My principal object in putting down the amendment is to bring the matter into uniformity.  The scales of fee paid to registrars of stocks&mdash;only very few are affected&mdash; were fixed a very long time ago and were based on salaries paid in 1890. Although there have been enormous increases in salaries since 1890, the fees have remained the same.  On general grounds, I think there is a case for exemption, but my main reason for moving is to secure uniformity of treatment.</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (2).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Every order made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and, if a resolution annulling such order is passed by either such House at any time during the continuance of such order, such order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which I originally intended to propose for insertion in the Bill was to ensure that any loss that would probably arise under the provisions of the Bill, in the price paid for sheepskins, would not fall upon the farmers who produced the fat sheep.  I wanted to propose an amendment that would ensure that any loss that would arise in the price of sheepskins would be met by the Minister out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  I was informed that such an amendment would not be in order.  Consequently I am moving this rather innocent and harmless amendment, which will ensure that if the price of sheepskins is unreasonable it will be open to either House of the Oireachtas to move a resolution nullifying the order made under this Bill so that sheepskins can be exported again in the ordinary way. I am quite sure that under this Bill, if there is no means of controlling the price, sheepskins will fall two or three shillings because there will be no competition. It would be well in these circumstances that the Minister should be able to say to these people that <Col N="1018" /> unless they pay a fair price for the sheepskins, representatives of the farmers either in the Dáil or in the Seanad would get an order passed allowing sheepskins to be again exported.  In all these cases provisions are made for such orders to be annulled.  I cannot see any reason why the same provision should not be adopted under this Bill.  Consequently I move this amendment and hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment is completely unnecessary.  It asks that any order made under Section 2 of the Bill shall be laid before the Oireachtas and may be nullified if either House so decide.  In fact that is what is happening now in a sense.  The Bill provides for the making of that order.  In fact the whole purpose of the Bill is to give power to make that order, and if either House thinks the order should not be made, or having been made, should be nullified they have the power to do so.  There is, I think, no analogy between an order made under Section 2 of this Bill, and orders made under other Bills which may be of a varying nature, and which may be made from time to time or made subject to certain contingencies arising.  Under this Bill we have decided to give power to make an order; there is no other purpose but to give power to make an order.  Consequently I think the passage of the Bill should signify approval of the making of such order.  I suggest that no purpose would be served by having that order again laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>It would have no effect except to show the view of the House. But a private Bill to repeal the Act could be introduced any time.  The difference between an order under this Bill and an order under the Transport Act or similar legislation is this.  The purpose of the Bill is to enable the order to be made.  The cancellation of the order, the failure to make the order or the subsequent revocation of the order is, in fact, a nullification of the Bill.  The whole measure goes; it has no other purpose whatever. There would be no purpose in keeping the Act in existence if the order were not in force.  In some other types of legislation, power may be taken to make orders in various contingencies, to make orders of varying kinds or to make orders at different times when different sets of circumstances arise. In such cases, there might be an argument in favour of having either the positive approval of each House of the Oireachtas or power in either House to cancel the order.  In this case, however, these various sets of circumstances do not exist.  In this case, the sole purpose of the Bill is to enable the order to be made and if the order were to be revoked, cancelled or annulled, the legislation might as well be annulled.  Consequently, I suggest that if either House of the Oireachtas should wish to cancel this order when made, the better way to do it would be by repealing legislation and not by resolution as suggested</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken power under the Bill to revoke the order and to allow sheepskins to be exported again in the ordinary way.  I contend that there is greater reason to give either House power to annul the order.  Presumably, that would only be done if the fellmongers, of whom there are only three in the country at present, could not deal with the stocks of sheepskins.  Such a resolution will not revoke the whole Bill.  After a resolution is passed in either House, the export of sheepskins will again be reopened, only until there is more fell-mongering or more customers for sheepskins in this country.  The resolution <Col N="1020" /> will not annul the Bill and the Minister can make another order in two or three months time when there will be more competition for these skins at home.  I do not think there is any occasion on record where this House passed a resolution annulling an order made by the Minister under any of the Acts under which they have power to do so.  I do not see any reason why that power should be taken from us under this Bill.  We are given certain constitutional rights under other Bills, and I think we should be given the same constitutional right under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Quite, but this Bill is somewhat different to ordinary Bills providing for the making of orders. The sole purpose of the Bill is to enable the order to be made.  If either House of the Oireachtas thinks that the legislation should not be operative, then I think it should be required to proceed by way of amending <Col N="1021" /> or repealing legislation rather than by resolution.  I can imagine this House objecting to a Bill of this kind, or of any kind in fact, being annulled by a simple resolution of the Dáil without this House being consulted just as I can imagine the Dáil objecting to legislation being annulled by a resolution here without the Dáil being consulted.  The Bill contains nothing except the power to make an order and therefore a cancellation of the order would mean repeal of the legislation.  That should be done by an amending Bill rather than by resolution.</P>

      <P>I think it would be unnecessary, but the same objection would not be there.  I think that because of the nature of the Bill, this provision is not required.  The Bill can be repealed at any time by legislation and the effect of repealing it by legislation is the same as the cancellation of the order.  Obviously, there would not be the same objection to the amendment if the consent of both Houses of the Oireachtas were required because in such circumstances it is reasonable to assume that amending legislation would be passed without opposition.</P>

      <P>The Minister will admit that this is a piece of legislation which is experimental.  What is in Senator Counihan's mind is that it is aimed at restricting the market for an extremely depressed industry, which is the largest in the State. That is what we are afraid of.  We think this may be proved as time goes on and so we desire some quicker method of dealing with it than the power of introducing private legislation. The matter could be met by resolution if it is found that the <Col N="1022" /> results are what Senator Counihan fears; otherwise it would be very disastrous and detrimental to the country.  I did not quite hear the Minister in his statement and I do not know whether he would be prepared to accept the amendment, modified in the way I suggested.

We are now engaged on a piece of experimental legislation, the consequences of which we do not know.  I think it would be useless to require that both Houses should pass the resolution.  The Minister has taken power to revoke the order himself and all I am asking is that the order should be revoked on a resolution of either House.  I presume that any Senator standing up <Col N="1023" /> to move such a resolution must show clearly that there is a case for revoking the order; otherwise he will not get the House to pass the resolution.

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very great need for a panel of nurses suitable for taking in children, because frequently a mother or somebody else comes with a child from the country and she has no means of finding a suitable home for it.  In the past, the maternity home about which we heard so much recently, gave a child to persons who were not in any way authorised to receive it or without having any guarantee as to the capabilities of these persons or the circumstances of the home to which the child was sent.  The mother now can go to the assistance officer and find out a suitable premises or a suitable nurse from this small panel. In many cases the infant has to be received in an emergency.  The woman comes on a train and she must get rid of the child immediately, as she wants to get back.  That is a great emergency and the notice of such reception required by the principal Act, as amended by this Act, may be given <Col N="1025" /> within 48 hours after the reception.

      <P>The object of the amendment is to secure an appeal to the courts where it is proposed to take land and by doing so to seriously prejudice the amenities of a residence.  That principle is already admitted in the Acts under which land may be taken for the purpose of providing plots for labourers' cottages.  If it is reasonable in that case it would appear to be reasonable in this case.  One quite understands that the needs for public services must predominate, but they should not be allowed to do so in the face of manifest injustice to owners. Under the Bill as at present drafted there is only an appeal to the courts against wrongful procedure under the Act itself.  There is no appeal on the question of prejudice to amenities. On that point the Minister is to be the sole judge.  It would appear to me to be reasonable that a final appeal should lie to the courts, and that is the object which I hope to secure by the amendment.  Those who have advised me in the matter assure me that the amendment is on the lines of the provision in the Labourers Acts. I hope the House will accept the principle embodied in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the amendment and to say that I think it is a very necessary one indeed.  Last <Col N="1028" /> week we discussed a Town Planning Bill, the object of which is to safeguard the amenities of the country and to preserve beauty spots to which people are attached.  People's lands may be taken for these allotments, and if the owners object there is no right of appeal, I believe, to the courts.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane mentioned that this amendment follows on the lines of a provision that is in the Labourers (Ireland) Acts.  I am aware that even with that provision in the Labourers Acts a great deal of damage has been done to farms on which land was acquired for the purpose of providing plots for cottages. I have seven such cottages on my land.  They are scattered all over the farm.  I was not in control myself when the land for the plots was taken.  I dare say that those who went before me did not realise the damage that would be done to the farm and the amount of inconvenience caused by having these cottages all over the place instead of in one field.  It is almost impossible to have a corn crop in a field adjoining one of these cottages because of the amount of trespass that is done. At least half of the crop is damaged by poultry, pigs and donkeys and by the people in the cottage.  All that might have been prevented if people had realised at the time that instead of having cottages scattered over a farm they should be erected in one field.  In this case the Government can come along and take land for these plots.  They may take land at an avenue gate, and damage an owner's property very much and yet there is to be no appeal to the courts.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I understand the meaning of this Bill at all, or whether Senator Sir John Keane by his amendment proposes to destroy altogether the effect of the Bill so far as it relates to the acquisition of land which may happen to be built on.  As I understand it, the Bill provides for the taking of land on which a residence is built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact I was reconciling myself to the thought that the house <Col N="1029" /> I occupy could be taken compulsorily for the purposes of a hospital under the provisions of the statute.  According to the amendment there will be an appeal to a judge of the High Court in a case where an</P>
      <P>&ldquo;order would seriously interfere with the amenity of the residence of the owner of the lands proposed to be taken or with his enjoyment of the lands immediately adjoining and customarily occupied with such residence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What I want to know is this: if there is an appeal to the judge upon that ground, would the judge be bound to annul the order if it were found that the taking of the land interfered with the amenities of the residence?  Would he have no option but to say, &ldquo;True enough the taking of this land does interfere with the amenities of this house and with the use of the land adjoining this house, but this land is urgently required for public purposes and the greater necessity ought to prevail&rdquo;?  Is the judge to have such an option under this amendment?  I think he is not.</P>
      <P>I do not see how this amendment could be accepted, seeing that under this Bill it is competent for a public authority to take a house for public purposes such as the erection of a hospital.  There is a necessity for this measure because a number of people occupying houses which they think would be suitable sites for hospitals are asking exorbitant sums for them. I do not think that the amendment, in its present form, can be accepted by the Minister.  Perhaps something could be drafted which would meet the wishes of Senator Sir John Keane, while at the same time not depriving the Bill of any efficacy that it may have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my friend, Senator Comyn, rather misunderstands the effect of this amendment.  The object of it is to preserve the amenities of a residence that is not taken, but where some of the land around it is taken compulsorily for whatever purposes the local authority wants it. The object is to preserve the amenities of a residence that is not compulsorily acquired.  The Senator has suggested that a house might be taken for a hospital. <Col N="1030" /> Of course it might, but that would not affect the amenities of the house because the house would be gone. This amendment applies only where a portion of the land of an owner is taken and taken for an object which interferes seriously with the amenities of his residence. That principle was introduced into the Labourers (Ireland) Acts.  It had a very good effect because the putting of a number of labourers' cottages right up to an owner's private residence would seriously affect the amenities of his residence.  That is the whole object of this amendment.  Senator Sir John Keane says that the wording is exactly the same as what appears in the Labourers Acts.  That may be going a little too far, because I do not quite understand what is meant by the words &ldquo;enjoyment of the lands immediately adjoining....&rdquo;  That cannot mean seriously to interfere with the money value of the land injuriously affecting a house and land for which compensation has already been obtained under the Land Clauses Act.  If that is what is meant, this amendment is unnecessary, but if that is not what is meant, this is really only a synonym for amenity of the residence. If the object merely is to preserve the amenity of the owner's residence, where some of his land has been taken, I am in favour of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

      <P>I should like to support the amendment and to relate an experience that I had some years ago under the Labourers Acts, when a proposal was made to erect some cottages on land very close to what was my home at the time, and which would have considerably damaged the amenities of the place.  An inquiry was held by the Department of Local Government and an inspector was sent down to inquire into the matter.  I appeared at the inquiry and explained how the land would be seriously injured if cottages were built in the place suggested. An arrangement was come to by which the cottages were built on another portion of my land where no damage would be done.  If I had not <Col N="1031" /> the right to appeal the appearance of my property would have been destroyed.  I take it that what is really meant by the amendment is to have the right of appeal to a judge, who may be an inspector under the Department of Local Government, or someone appointed to decide the question.</P>

      <P>I think the difference between us is not very wide, and that the Parliamentary Secretary may be able to meet me.  Senator Brown dealt with the question of total acquisition.  It is not the object of the amendment to protect the owner of a house or ground against total acquisition. It is only intended to protect against partial acquisition, where the amenities would be seriously affected. It is not intended to protect a person against anything which can be adequately dealt with by compensation. I will be frank and say that if the Parliamentary Secretary will co-operate I will meet him.  I can see him saying: &ldquo;This is the only place we can put this scheme for technical or for engineering reasons; that there is no alternative site for waterworks.&rdquo; Engineers may say that there is no other place to put these works, except in the owner's back garden or up against his lawn.  Then, I take it the law should enable the owner to go to court and argue whether there was an alternative site available.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would agree to a conference, what I want could be embodied in an amendment or words like &ldquo;where, in the opinion of a judge, no alternative site was available.&rdquo; Then I would be prepared to give way.  Where there is an alternative site I suggest that amenities should be respected.</P>

      <P>If the position is that there is a danger of some future Government electing a Minister who could not be trusted with the powers contained in this measure, I suggest that members of the Seanad cannot protect the position in that way.  The points it is intended to have referred to the High Court for adjudication and decision are essentially ones that would be properly considered by the Minister, following a sworn inquiry, in determining whether a particular site should be compulsorily acquired or not.  In all seriousness, I suggest to Senators interested in this amendment that the Minister, with his special knowledge, and with the assistance of his technical advisers, having all the evidence pro and con before him, is in the best position to judge the suitability of a site.  What we have in mind, of course, are hospital sites, and not to utilise the powers of the Bill for sewerage or waterworks.  It is because of our difficulties about hospital sites that the Bill was introduced at all.  It is true to say that a provision, such as is included in the amendment, is embodied in the Labourers Acts, but it is equally true to say that it has been omitted from the Housing Acts.  I submit that there is no comparison between compulsorily acquiring sites for labourers' cottages and compulsorily acquiring sites for <Col N="1033" /> hospitals.  You have wide scope over a rural area in which to select a site for cottages, but you have very limited scope in selecting a site for an hospital. Obviously an hospital must be in the centre of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a mistake, but when you consider the difficulty of transport, the difficulty of getting supplies to the hospital, the difficulty of getting electric power, a proper sewerage system and a proper water supply, you will be driven back to the position that you must have hospitals within reasonable reach of electric light, water and sewerage.  If the matters covered by the amendment were to be the subject of litigation in the high courts we are going to have endless litigation and we are not going to get on with our hospitalisation scheme.  I do not believe it will be necessary to avail of the powers of this Bill in a half-dozen cases in the 26 counties.  The fact that legislation is there, if the owner of a suitable site proves recalcitrant, and that local authorities can fall back on this measure, will be sufficient to secure the acquisition of sites by agreement. Members of local authorities understand the necessity for this Bill at the present time better than members of this House who are not connected with local bodies.  I am quite sure Senators know that in various parts of the country exorbitant prices have been demanded for land considered to be suitable for hospital sites.  As soon as the owner of a plot of land, in an area where it is proposed to build an hospital or dispensary, gets to know that the inspector is likely to approve of the site its value is multiplied about ten times. We have either to abandon our hospital scheme or to have such legislation as this passed to enable us to acquire sites at reasonable prices. I do not think Senators need have any anxiety as to the possibility of taking portion of a man's land and leaving him with the residence or a small piece of land and building an hospital&mdash;perhaps a fever hospital&mdash;beside his door.  No Minister <Col N="1034" /> would ever acquiesce or ever confirm an acquisition order in such circumstances.  These will be essentially matters that the Minister will consider most carefully.  If this amendment were passed, undoubtedly it would be availed of by a person who did not wish to facilitate us in acquiring a site, except at an exorbitant price, and it might hold up the scheme of hospitalisation indefinitely.  In all the circumstances the Minister is a perfectly safe and sound judge on the question which it is now proposed to refer to the High Court for adjudication.</P>
