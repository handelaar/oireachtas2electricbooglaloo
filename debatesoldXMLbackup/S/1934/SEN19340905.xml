    <Title>Agricultural Co-operative Societies (Debentures) Bill, 1934&mdash;Report Stage.</Title>
    <P>The following amendment appeared on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Jameson:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 4.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(6)  No issue of debentures shall be made by an agricultural co-operative society under this section unless and until a resolution approving the issue of such debentures shall have been passed by a special meeting of the shareholders of such society convened for the purpose of passing such resolution.</P>

      <P>I had a note this morning to say that the Minister has another amendment prepared to Section 4 and I think perhaps it would be well if the Minister said what he intends to say about his amendment before I say anything about mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proposing to change the wording of the Senator's amendment slightly. Perhaps he will accept it in the new form.  The first amendment which I suggest reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4, sub-section 1.  After the word &ldquo;time&rdquo; in line 25 to insert the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this section and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That, of course, only prepares the way for the alternative amendment which I suggest the Senator should propose instead of his amendment.  The second amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4, sub-section (2).  To insert <Col N="586" /> before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  An issue of debentures shall not be made by an agricultural co-operative society under this section unless either the committee of such society has power under the rules of such society to borrow money and the amount to be borrowed on the security of such debentures is within such borrowing power or a resolution approving of the making of such issue has been passed by a special meeting of the shareholders of such society convened expressly for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, passing such resolution.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it differs very materially from Senator Jameson's amendment except for the fact that the wording is altered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>This amendment provides for a case where the rules of a society allow the borrowing of the money without calling a meeting.  That is not provided for in the original amendment of Senator Jameson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I think it is better than mine.  I formally move the two amendments which have been read out by the Minister instead of my amendment on the Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the amendment by the Minister is the same as the amendment which is on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Jameson.  The object of Senator Jameson's amendment was, I think, to secure that, whatever borrowing powers the societies may have hitherto possessed, if they wish to raise debentures in the future under this Bill, they should go to the shareholders. What the Minister provides is that, where borrowing powers are at present entrusted to the Committee, these borrowing powers shall be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the idea some of us had when this matter was debated in Committee.  We were pressing, in Committee, that, in every case where debentures were issued, a meeting of the shareholders should be called, irrespective of what the borrowing powers of the Committee previously were.  The argument was that the creation of debentures in the new form raised a totally new issue, and that it was right and proper that the shareholders should endorse the proposal. We may accept this amendment, but I do not think we should accept it under a misapprehension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite see Senator Sir John Keane's point.  If a committee of a society has now the right to issue debentures without calling their shareholders together, I do not think that this Bill is intended to interfere with that.  That is the view I took.  I only came into the matter where the Bill introduced something new.  I cannot see where the two amendments disagree.  I did not understand that my amendment was interfering with the existing state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the objection raised by some Senators was to the words &ldquo;whether the society is or is not authorised or is or is not forbidden&rdquo; to borrow in that way.  I thought that the amendment I had drafted, as an alternative to Senator Jameson's amendment, met the wishes of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The words &ldquo;arrangement or understanding&rdquo; were objected to in the Seanad on one Stage of the Bill. It was believed that the meaning of the words was rather loose.  We propose to substitute for those words the words &ldquo;agreement in writing.&rdquo;  The amendment is hardly necessary now that we have a schedule of societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty I see with regard to this provision is that the Oireachtas is establishing itself as a court.  The Minister and his law officers may have seen these agreements. Nobody in the Seanad has seen them or heard of them until now, and I understand that the position in the case of members of the Dáil is the same.  I do not remember any reference to agreements in writing. Between whom were these agreements made?  Were they made between these societies and the lending Corporation, or were there understandings between the Minister and the Corporation?  What we are doing is <Col N="589" /> giving the Corporation power to proceed legally on written agreements which we have never seen.  The Minister will probably tell us whether or not he has seen these agreements and by whom they are made.  If they are legal agreements which can be acted upon, what is the need for this Bill at all?  I know that, in the case of the bank with which I am associated, we have, in some cases, got debentures in the case of loans made to these societies.  This has been done by agreement with the societies concerned. We have legally got debentures issued.</P>
      <P>If this lending Corporation have got a legal document that is an agreement entered into by the society and by the lending Corporation, and it gives them the right to charge the uncalled capital, why have they not done it? Why are we needed to step in, in order to say that because of this written agreement, which we have never seen, we are going to give this Corporation the power to proceed against all the shareholders in the four companies to collect from them all the uncalled capital?  I honestly confess I do not understand it.  If the Corporation have the legal power under this written agreement to proceed to collect their money, why have they not done so in the past?  I cannot see why the Oireachtas should be asked to interfere in the matter.  I know in all cases where banks have loans out, when they were lending the money what they got was all the security they were going to get.  If they did not like it they would not lend the money, and if they did like it they had to stick to that, because that was all they were going to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this matter is concerned, there is an agreement between the late Minister and the lending Corporation, and I do not know what document they have got from the shareholders or anybody connected with these four companies binding them to pay this charge when called upon.  Perhaps the Minister will now tell us what this agreement is, and why it is necessary for the Oireachtas to give this Corporation power over the uncalled capital which they have not got at the <Col N="590" /> present time and never had, so far as I am able to judge.  There is a very great difference between this Corporation and any other lending Corporation, it would seem.  The justification is an agreement between the late Minister for Agriculture and the lending Corporation&mdash;that is what the Minister now tells us.  The Minister should make a very clear statement as to the nature of this agreement, or agreements, whether he has seen them and whether, in the opinion of the law agents of the Government, they are documents on which we ought to act, giving the Corporation power to collect the uncalled capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the section. Does not the section mention that it must be an agreement between the Corporation and such society?  The section states it explicitly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>An agreement in writing between the said Corporation and such society&mdash;but that does not say the shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister had better explain the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely setting out my difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Cathaoirleach has mentioned is quite true.  It says in the beginning of the section: &ldquo;Whenever the Minister is satisfied ... (a) that money is owing to the said Corporation by a society registered ... and (b) that when such loan was so made there was an arrangement or understanding&rdquo;&mdash;or an agreement in writing&mdash;&ldquo;between the said Corporation and such society that the amount of such loan and the interest thereon would be secured... by a charge on the uncalled capital of such society....&rdquo;  That must be actually stated in writing.  There is a third proviso&mdash;&ldquo;that when such loan was made the rules of such society authorised the charging...of the uncalled capital of such society.&rdquo;  That is a very unusual rule for a society to have. As a matter of fact, I believe in all these cases the rules were specially changed for the purpose.  This agreement must be in writing between the <Col N="591" /> Corporation and the society, and the rules must provide for that being done.</P>
      <P>Senator Jameson asks a very pertinent question, why, if these things are right, was a Bill brought in?  The Bill was brought in because neither the Corporation nor the society had any legal power to charge the uncalled capital.  That is why the Bill was brought in.  I explained on a previous Stage that the very same thing was done by the Dairy Disposals Company in the case of creameries, and the 1928 Act had to be brought in to legalise that transaction.  At the time, the creameries mentioned in the schedule were being built.  They did look for capital in the ordinary way.  If they had gone to a bank they would have been asked to sign a joint and several guarantee.  They were not disposed to do that at the time.  At all times members of a committee are very reluctant to do that; they only do it as a last resort.  It would have been impossible to get a new creamery established on those conditions.  It is a different thing if the creamery has been in existence for some years.  In that case the members would see that it might be advisable to go to a bank and sign a joint and several guarantee.  In this instance it was not possible to get a body of farmers to sign a joint and several guarantee in order to start a new creamery.  I am not sure that banking institutions would have given 17/6 to every 2/6 raised by way of share capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point Senator Jameson makes is that we are giving special consideration to this institution as compared to other institutions.  That statement is true in fact, but the circumstances are peculiar.  I do not know of any case&mdash; perhaps Senator Jameson does&mdash;where the banks have advanced money to creameries without a joint and several guarantee of the members.  There was no such thing in this case, and the real reason why I think the Oireachtas should pass this section is because the Credit Corporation at the time agreed to make these advances only on condition that the Minister would legalise the action at a future date.  The Credit Corporation knew quite well <Col N="592" /> that they had not the legal power to enforce the terms of the loan when they were making the loan, but they were assured by the Minister then that at the first available opportunity their action would be legalised.  We are taking this opportunity of having that action legalised.</P>
    <P>I think the safeguards in this case on the societies' part are very clearly laid down.  They must, in the first place, owe the money and, in the second place, have made an agreement in writing that it could be charged on the uncalled capital, and, thirdly, their rules must have actually authorised them to do that at the time.  That would be sufficient proof that the members were quite well aware of what was being done.  Apart from that, it would have been quite obvious that the members knew what was being done, because new creameries were being organised, and they were only asked for 2/6 a share, the remainder being paid by the Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not complaining about this Corporation getting different conditions from other banks, once the Schedule is there, and refers only to four societies.  Apparently we are to have no statement that the Corporation collected these two-and-sixpences.  I referred previously to the fact that five out of the seven years for collecting the money had passed, and that there should not be very much money in dispute now.  I know that they have not paid these two-and-sixpences. What the Seanad is now doing is putting a charge of 17/6 on ordinary shareholders of these four societies which is to be collected when the Corporation chooses.  I do not like that. The Corporation has not collected the money.  It trusted these societies but is now getting power to collect 17/6 from the shareholders.  We are acting on the word of the Minister that there is an agreement such as he describes which complies with all the conditions in the Bill.  None of us has seen the agreement, and none of us knows how much money is going to be collected. It may be due to the fact that we have had no daily papers, but what astonishes me is that nobody, with the <Col N="593" /> exception perhaps of the shareholders, knows what we are debating now. I have not had any representations on behalf of the shareholders made to me.  I am objecting to this power being given because I know what will happen.  In the bank with which I am connected we have plenty of these societies but we have not collected the two-and-sixpences.  We have provided for that money.  We would not come to the Oireachtas to ask for power to collect the 17/6 due on the shares.  In some cases we may have some good guarantors.  That is a matter for negotiation.  I do not know if I could get the Seanad to agree with me if I put in another amendment.  I really do not like this proposal, and I should like the Minister to say how much the corporation say is due on the uncalled capital, and what he believes the shareholders are going to be called upon to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was I raised this matter on the Second Reading, because it seemed to me the words &ldquo;agreement or understanding&rdquo; were altogether too indefinite for an Act of Parliament. The Minister has now substituted the words &ldquo;agreement in writing.&rdquo;  That is precise and definite and, so far as I am concerned, the section fulfils its purpose.  I cannot understand Senator Jameson's argument.  Up to the present his complaint has been that we were putting this corporation into a more favourable position than the ordinary banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the first thing the Senator said.  Then he turned round and said: &ldquo;Oh, it is very hard on the shareholders.&rdquo;  On which leg is he standing?  Is he speaking on behalf of the banks or on behalf of the shareholders?  If he is speaking on behalf of the banks this section greatly facilitates them.  It is a great advantage to the banks, because it gives the corporation a new fund to resort to. That is the liability of the shareholders, and when the corporation has the new fund to resort to, it is a well-known principle that it must resort to it and leave the other fund for the <Col N="594" /> banks who may have advanced money to the societies.  Therefore, as the section stands it is very much in favour of the banks.  It is also in favour of the corporation, because it legalises what was a definite understanding. The present Minister is making good a promise made by his predecessor.  Nobody can say that the banks are being injured.  Justice is being done to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  When people got up societies it is only right that they should pay for them as far as they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to answer a question which has a bearing on this matter.  How is the uncalled capital called up?  Have the committees of management power whereby uncalled capital is collected in the form of deductions from the milk cheques?  I know that frequently that is the way it is done.  Whether that is legal or not I have not been able to discover.  Some of these things are done more or less in a friendly way. Can the Minister say if it is legal to make deductions from milk cheques without the consent of the owners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that we are on the Report Stage, but that we are not going to be too strict in view of this development.  I am surprised at Senator Jameson's argument to-day, because amendment No. 4 makes reference to particular societies which were named by the Senator in his amendment. If he had no communication with or responsibility for the societies concerned, I wonder whether he had any authorisation to put down the names.  All the Senator asked for is conceded, but he now opposes the concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Senator Comyn's remarks are concerned, we are dealing only with Section 7, which has nothing to do with any bank except the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I distinctly stated that I was not talking on behalf of the banks.  If I was, I would not do so under Section 7.  I do not know what Senator Johnson has complained about.  I accepted the Minister's proposal about the Schedule.  I am not complaining <Col N="595" /> about that.  Not a word I said applies to what Senator Johnson referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator supporting the amendment before the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing what the amendment is going to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think so. The amendment has now come before the Seanad in its final form, and it is going to give the corporation power to collect whatever money still remains due on the uncalled capital of the shares of the four societies in the Schedule.  I am not at all satisfied that it will not mean a call upon the shareholders of about 17/6 in the £ on the shares they have taken.  If the Seanad passes that it may be doing something on the shareholders of the four societies which may wreck many of them.  I am asking the Minister if he has any idea of the liability on the ordinary shares of the four societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it makes the slightest difference whether the amendment is passed or not.  Whether the agreement was in writing, or was an arrangement, or an understanding, the section will remain the same, I take it, as far as the power of the Credit Corporation is concerned.  We are giving the corporation power to collect the outstanding amounts. The society in turn has power to collect these amounts from the suppliers by deducting them from the cheque due to them for their milk supply.  That power was specifically given to the society by the suppliers when they joined the society which, I think, is sufficient proof that every member of the society knew what he was doing.  He actually signed an agreement when joining the society that if he did not pay his 2/6 the society could deduct it from the cheque due for his milk.  Everyone of them signed that agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> With regard to the amount that is due by the societies to the Credit Corporation, they have not paid in full in all cases.  I am quite sure of that.  I have not gone into the matter in detail, because I do not think it should arise.  I think that we should look at this from the point of view of the Credit Corporation.  The corporation advanced this money, the society knowing very well the bargain they were making, and every supplier knowing very well the bargain the society was making with the corporation. The society even bound itself to change its rules in order to enable the corporation to collect on that basis. But the Credit Corporation knew they had no legal power to do that at the time until they got the necessary power by a Bill being passed, and the Minister gave an undertaking that that would be passed.  As that was the position of the Credit Corporation, I think the Oireachtas should certainly make the matter right for the corporation, whether they did collect that money or not.  If the Credit Corporation ask the Minister to make good the promise made to them, I do not think anything else arises, if we want to be fair to the corporation.  They got the undertaking, and we should fulfil the undertaking.  I think I should ask the Seanad, at any rate, to fulfil it. Whether or not the Seanad thinks it is right for a Minister to give an undertaking like that and come along afterwards and ask for sanction is a different matter.</P>
    <P>Possibly there might be hardships if the corporation were owed 12/6 on every share by a certain society and, this Bill having been passed, they were to say to the society: &ldquo;You must pay up that 12/6 per share immediately.&rdquo;  I think the Credit Corporation do business much the same as the banks do.  The money may be due to them; they may have all the legal power required to collect the money, but they know very well that in practice it is not the best way to do it.  I am sure that having got the power they will then make the best possible arrangement for getting the money in over a period of time. I am quite sure that they are not <Col N="597" /> going to bankrupt the suppliers immediately. They want to have power, perhaps, to make the demand and then, if the demand is not met, enter into a new agreement.  However, of course, that is the business of the corporation itself and I have nothing to say to what they may do in that way.  I think, however, that we should not inquire as to what is due to the corporation, or what powers the members have or the societies have.  The only thing that really matters, as far as I am concerned at any rate, and I am asking the Seanad to adopt that attitude, is that this undertaking was given to the corporation and it is the first opportunity that either my predecessor or I have had of fulfilling that undertaking without bringing in a special Bill.  We have brought it in as part of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned a matter now which has not cropped up before&mdash;that he believes the corporation are going to deal with the collection of this money as other banks would do.  He thinks it is going to be spread over a period. That is one of the main things I am concerned about.  If the Minister says that he will tell the corporation that he has given an undertaking that these debts are not to be collected promptly and at once but that a reasonable time is to be given and that an arrangement, such as paying out of the milk supply, is to be carried out, I shall leave it in the Minister's hands and say no more about it.  If the Minister had stated earlier that he would see that these people were not going to be dragged into Court and that reasonable methods of collecting the money would be adopted and plenty of time given to the shareholders, I certainly would not have been talking so long. I am quite prepared to leave it in the hands of the Minister on that understanding.</P>

I made a statement in reference to Senator Jameson's amendments on the last occasion and he <Col N="598" /> appeared to think that I was misrepresenting his point of view.  Senator Jameson is reported in the Official Report, Col. 332, as having said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I ask the Committee to confine the Bill to certain societies specified. It would be a very bad Bill if it worked so that it could be applied to any or to an unlimited number of societies.

      <P>The question of calling on the unpaid capital of co-operative societies has been raised in a very serious way by Senator Jameson.  I am interested in a co-operative society, not a dairy society, which has about 10/- per share of unpaid capital&mdash;in the case of some shareholders it would be even more; that is, that the second or third call has been left unpaid.  We decided long ago that it was quite impossible, owing to present conditions, to collect these amounts.  I, therefore, for one at all events, could not agree that we should give power to the Credit Corporation to call on the unpaid capital of societies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill I criticised, rather at large, this particular matter, and this very small amendment may seem disproportionate to what I then said.  But the position is, that once you settle the principle of a Bill you cannot mend it, and the House is not prepared to hold up this Bill.  This amendment does not conflict with the principle of the Bill because only such small quantities are involved.  If the Minister accepts my amendment the trade in these matters will not be interfered with to any appreciable extent.  What I have in mind is a number of patent foods, containing wheat, consumed by a number of individuals in the country for the purposes of their health.  I know that some easement in the matter is recognised by the Bill because it permits <Col N="602" /> quantities under five lbs. and 10/- in value coming in.  I think that goes some little way to meet the case.  I suggest to the Minister that although the subject of patent foods may not open up anything very romantic in the way of gifts, still it is possible, under the existing conditions, that a citizen of one country may be found promising to send along a certain number of tins of patent foods in return for which the receiver may be tempted to send back a bottle of &ldquo;J.J.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment moved by Senator Bagwell and I think it is a very reasonable amendment.  Unless this amendment is accepted the food of a very large number of invalids will be affected and especially those suffering from diabetes.  The kind of food these people use is not manufactured in the Free State.  Their supplies might be interfered with, and their lives possibly shortened if the Bill were to become an Act in its present form.  It would be a great hardship to say that such people cannot be supplied from manufacturers in England or elsewhere beyond 10/- worth at a time.  These people are practically living on such food and they would have to get weekly or fortnightly supplies, whereas such people as these would have standing accounts with the manufacturers for supplies much larger than those for a week or a fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator does not realise perhaps that we are by this Section 28 relaxing previous regulations.  We are not, by any means, putting on restrictions.  As the original Act stood no product of wheat could be imported except on licence from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  These licences, however, were freely issued in this country for invalid foods, and were never refused on a medical certificate. But the Minister thought that the section as it was introduced was rather harsh and consequently an amendment was introduced giving authority to people to import packages which were less than 10/- in value <Col N="603" /> and under 5 lbs. in weight under certain conditions without any licence from the Minister.  So that relaxation comes in under the Bill.  On the Committee Stage in the Seanad we went a bit further and it was changed to read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...either is imported as private effects in passengers' baggage or is imported by parcels post and shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been sent by a person who is not a trader dealing in such commodity and to be intended as a gift for the personal use of the person to whom it is addressed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, as the Bill stands now, after the Committee Stage, any person may import a parcel of bread, or other product of wheat, which is not more than 10/- in value or five lbs. in weight, provided it comes from a person who is not a trader and provided that it is intended as a gift for the personal use of the person to whom it is sent.  I do not think we ought to go any further and I think that Senator Bagwell's amendment would look rather queer if we were to examine it. The parcel is not supposed to be sent to a person as a trader, but for his own personal use.  If you knock out the words &ldquo;as a gift,&rdquo; you will have people on the other side of the Border or across the Irish Sea going in for a special trade and sending parcels across to people here.  If they do not send the parcels as a gift, they are going to charge for the parcels, presumably; but how can they charge for them if they are not traders?  I think that the amendment suggested here rather conflicts with the remainder of the section.  The knocking out of the words &ldquo;as a gift,&rdquo; to my mind, would conflict with the remainder of the section.  If these words are knocked out the Revenue Commissioners will find it very difficult to administer the section.  They will then have to go to the very great trouble in every particular case of finding out whether the parcel concerned was sent as a gift or whether or not it was sent by a person as a trader.  If he charges <Col N="604" /> payment for the parcel, that may be sufficient evidence of the fact that he is a trader, but I think that it makes it easier for the Revenue Commissioners to determine such cases if those words are included, because if there is a question of an invoice the parcel may be held up or they may not allow it in.  The exclusion of those words will make it more difficult for the Revenue Commissioners and I think that that will be the only effect of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to know of what assistance to the Revenue Commissioners the retention of the words &ldquo;as a gift&rdquo; can be.  What proof has the Minister in mind as to whether a parcel coming in is a gift or otherwise? If I want to have some particular type of fancy bread or patent food which I think is a necessity, I can always arrange with a friend, either over the Border or across the Channel, to buy such a commodity from some trader and send it on to me as a gift.  There will be no invoice included with the parcel and it will not come directly from any trader, but I can easily settle with my friend by private treaty in respect of his account.  I do not suppose that the Revenue Commissioners will submit people of that kind to the test of an oath&mdash;particularly as it would be impracticable.  I think we may take it that a matter of sheer necessity or of the particular taste of an individual will over-ride the question of expense and so on, and that, in whatever form transactions of this kind take place, they will not be gifts or presents.  Nobody will send over a loaf of bread as a gift.</P>

That would not be sent as a gift but as a matter of trade. I think it would be more honest, if it <Col N="605" /> was the desire to prevent any person getting presents of this kind, to say so in the Bill rather than to put in a provision of this kind, which the Minister must know is quite incapable of being worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of this section is rather different from that of other Senators.  In the first place, I ought to say that I have had to import, for a close relative of mine who suffers from diabetes, a certain kind of flour and I had a licence for its importation under previous Acts before this general restriction came in in connection with flour.  I must say that without any effort of my own the Department sent me a new licence to cover everything required on the grounds that it was necessary for an invalid.  I take it that paragraph (b) does not apply at all in that case and that there is no intention that it should apply.  My understanding of paragraph (b) is that it is not really dealing with invalids at all, but that anybody who wants to bring in a particular fancy cake, or anything in a small quantity, which would be prohibited under the ordinary prohibition of the Minister, will be free to do so. What I cannot see is the Minister's point as to the importance of having in the words &ldquo;as a gift.&rdquo;  My particular relative, who, as I mentioned before, is suffering from diabetes, had an experience which makes me doubt very much the Minister's own statement with regard to the word &ldquo;gift&rdquo; in its interpretation by the Revenue Commissioners.  For obvious reasons, anything in the nature of sweets is poison to my relative, but it happened that he brought in a small box of chocolates about a year ago.  He immediately declared it and was asked whether it was for himself or whether it was to be used as a gift.  He said that it was a gift for somebody else and he was told that he would have to pay duty on it.  He had to pay something like 3/- a lb. duty.  That seems to me to be contrary to the Minister's statement and I am inclined to think that if the person bringing it in says that it is a gift, then it will not be prohibited, but if there is any duty to be paid then it will be regarded as a gift.&rdquo;<Col N="606" /> It will be prohibited as a prohibited article.  That is my own experience and there does seem to be some particular meaning to the word &ldquo;gift&rdquo; as interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners as far as personal baggage is concerned.</P>
      <P>I take it that no one can bring in dutiable stuff in his personal baggage, but it is the practice to do so.  It appears to me that if the commodities are for your own use they are dutiable, and I think it would be better if Senator Bagwell's amendment were accepted.  I assume that the Minister does not want to make this prohibition intolerable to people in this country, and that he wants the ordinary small transactions of people to be continued. I think that is desirable, and I think that the omission of the word &ldquo;gift&rdquo; would be better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>These revenue sections are rather difficult to comprehend, and they sometimes have a meaning which is not obvious to the ordinary casual reader.  I think that the Minister would make a great mistake if he struck out these three words &ldquo;as a gift.&rdquo;  This section does not permit a trader to send in here commodities of the kind mentioned in the section. But, suppose a person sends in this flour for personal use and that he is paid for it, I would say that the revenue officials would regard him as a trader, and would prohibit the import.  From the words of the section &mdash;&ldquo;as a gift for the personal use of the person to whom it is addressed&rdquo;&mdash;the revenue officer will see quite clearly the class of commodity which he is entitled to allow in duty free, and will be saved the trouble of making an inquiry as to whether the person who sends in free, for the personal use of another person, commodities of this kind, is a trader or not.  I imagine that this phraseology is inspired by those who have charged of the collection of the revenue of the country so as to facilitate them in their work and so as to enable them to allow these small consignments to come in, whether the case is a proper case or not.</P>

      <P>I would be glad if the Senator would allow me to proceed. My friend said that this would lead to fraud.  What I submit is that the striking out of these three words will promote fraud.  The question as to whether they are marked &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; on the outside will be a matter for revenue regulation.  The revenue authorities will determine by general order how this section is to be worked. Probably there may be a general order specifying what is a gift.  I do not know that, but what I am convinced of is this: that the section, as drafted, is workable, and that if you adopt Senator Bagwell's amendment I think you will be interfering in such a way with the section as to render the beneficial amendment passed in Committee unworkable.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister to what extent the revenue would be interfered with by permitting the importation of these small packages.  As Senator Bagwell has stated, there are a good many people in this country, some suffering from genuine diseases and some from imaginary diseases but all believing that their health would be improved by the use of certain foods.  The quantity of wheat contained in these foods is infinitesimal.  If the quantity of wheat used in them were to be grown here it would not make any material difference in our wheat crops.  The cost to the revenue will, I imagine, be very small. The concession asked in the amendment would confer a great boon on a number of people who, as we have heard, are suffering from genuine diseases and cannot eat the bread produced in this country.  In all the circumstances of the case I would ask the Minister to accept the Senator's amendment and to permit this bread that is only required in very small quantities to be admitted free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a certain amount of misapprehension has arisen owing to the case that has been made on behalf of invalid foods.  I do not know that this paragraph of the section would deal with that kind of thing at all.  I take it that paragraph (a), which has been passed, allows the <Col N="608" /> importation of invalid foods as before under licence.  I know myself that some difficulty has arisen through very kind friends sending gifts of cakes containing either wheat or wheaten products at Christmas time.  This section would appear to me to be aimed at meeting that kind of difficulty and of enabling friends in other parts of these islands to send, as gifts, cakes made from wheat to people on this side of the Border.  But the medicinal foods will have to be dealt with as before, as I understand it.</P>
      <P>Now, supposing the words &ldquo;as a gift&rdquo; were taken out, then persons who are not traders but are the friends of traders across the border, let us say, and who at Hallowe'en time would be sending what Senator Blythe would call &ldquo;barm bracks&rdquo; to their friends on this side of the border, would, in fact, be making a trade against the bakers on this side of the border.  It is quite possible if the words &ldquo;as a gift&rdquo; were taken out that they would not be traders.  It would be very difficult to prove them to be traders.  Therefore, it seems to me to be reasonable, if we are agreed upon the object, that the phrase in this sub-section should be as amended.  But, if we are not agreed upon the object, then I think the whole thing should be altered if we desire that small parcels not exceeding 10/- in value, no matter whether intended for medicinal purposes, as gifts or as a purchase, should be allowed in and that we should have another form altogether. From the case that has been made, it appears to be sought that the words &ldquo;as a gift&rdquo; should be taken out so as to assist in the easy importation of medicinal foods, but I would point out that that is not the intention of the section at all.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact I specifically asked the draftsman why the section was drafted in this way.  I was told that the reason was that the word &ldquo;gift&rdquo; would only cover the latter portion of the section dealing with parcels by post.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great care to what the Minister has said and to the arguments that Senators have put forward for and against the acceptance of this amendment.  I am entirely unimpressed by the arguments made against the acceptance of the amendment.  I want to assure the Minister that I am quite well acquainted with the section as a whole and that I have not concentrated simply on this one point.  I am aware that the section is, in certain respects, an easement of the previous prohibition. In that respect this Bill is a tidying&mdash;up Bill.  My desire is that it should be properly tidied up.  What I have in mind is simply the question of these patent foods which have got some wheat in them.  The amount of the wheat is extremely small but the article is very important to a limited number of people and may vitally affect their health.  I suggest that for a customs officer or a postmaster, because it is the parcel post we are dealing with here, to prove beyond all shadow do doubt that a bottle or box of patent food is a gift is an impossibility. He cannot prove any such thing but he can quite easily prove that a person is getting this stuff in greater quantities than he himself could possibly consume.  If it were coming in in such a way as to constitute trading and to be in conflict with the principle and objects of the Act, it would very soon become noticeable because he would be getting such an awful lot of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very small quantity is all a person requires and I would point out to the Minister that if my amendment is inserted, <Col N="610" /> the displacement of dots and milk, for which it is intended to develop a bigger market by using them in cereal foods, would be extremely small, and people with special needs would get what they want, openly and honestly, and in such a way as could easily be checked, because it will come in in small quantities by parcel post.  If the amendment is not accepted, you are leaving the door open to any amount of subterfuge and fraud, and, in fact, you are putting a premium on lying. Having heard what my friend, the Senator who sits in front of me, has said&mdash;and he knows far more about this than I&mdash;I am disposed to press this amendment.  I think the things is important and, in some cases, it might be vitally important that persons should be able to get these articles for personal use without having to prove they are a gift.  I therefore press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take out these words, it seems to me that it will make the amendment passed on Committee stage rather ridiculous.  That is what I tried to impress on the Senator.  It says &ldquo;is sent by a person who is not a trader dealing in such commodity.&rdquo;  If he is not, how can he charge?  And if he does charge, I believe that he becomes a trader dealing in such commodity. Therefore, you are putting the Revenue Commissioners to the trouble of going back and getting at the sender and proving that he is a trader, and so on.  I know that it may not always be possible to prove that it is a gift but, at any rate, if it is accompanied by an invoice or bill, straightaway you know that it is not a gift, and that in itself, excludes certain parcels and gets over the difficulty of having to go back to the sender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should imagine that if the Senator wanted to get what he is speaking for, that is, these invalid foods coming in, he should have dealt with paragraph (a), which deals with these matters in cases where licences are issued by the Minister.  Paragraph (b) obviously deals with other matters.  First, it deals with baggage coming in, in which people may have a cake, whether as a present from a friend for their own <Col N="611" /> use, and I do not think it matters in that case.  The paragraph says &ldquo;either is imported as private effects in passenger's baggage&rdquo;&mdash;and I think that &ldquo;private effects&rdquo; would cover that&mdash;&ldquo;or is imported by a parcel post.&rdquo; If it is, it must be sent by a person who is not a trader in that particular commodity. Surely, if a person sends a things for cash, he becomes a trader in that particular commodity, and the phrase &ldquo;as a gift&rdquo; is really designed to make it easy for a postmaster or the Revenue Commissioners to prove the case.  Removing it, however, I think makes the things ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The case of chocolates, quoted by Senator Douglas, is a different matter and, perhaps, that is why this section was put in&mdash;in order to make a difference between ordinary dutiable articles and products of wheat.  Products of wheat are not, of course, the only dutiable articles.  Confectionery is dutiable; bread is dutiable and some of the products of wheat are dutiable while some are not.  Wheat itself is not.  What we are dealing with here is prohibition of import and not duty.  We <Col N="612" /> have power under the Cereals Act to prohibit any products of wheat and it is with the prohibition of import of a certain commodity this section deals and not the duty question.  In reply to Senator Crosbie, we are not considering here the effect on the revenue.  The effect on the revenue would be negligible whether we adopted this amendment or not.  We are really dealing with the prohibition of import of these articles.</P>

      <P>65.&mdash;(1)  Whenever a milling (composite flour) order is in force, it shall not be lawful for any registered flour importer to sell any imported wheaten flour unless such wheaten flour is sold to another registered flour importer, the holder of a milling licence or the Minister or such wheaten flour is sold under and in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister under this section.</P>
      <P>(2)  If any registered flour importer acts in contravention of this section such registered flour importer shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in Part I of the Schedule to this Act.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a registered flour importer acts in contravention of this section such registered flour importer shall, for the purposes of Section 61 of the Principal Act, as amended by this Act, be deemed to have acted in contravention of the Principal Act, and the said Section 61, as so amended, shall apply and have effect accordingly.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Seanad to consider this matter though I consider it strictly out of order. 33 as they stand would have this effect at any rate&mdash;that imported flour, even at the present time, could not be sold to a baker unless under licence issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That provision was not intended to operate until the mixture of oatmeal with flour should come into operation.  If we are mixing oat flour with wheat flour it would be necessary to have the oat flour mixed before that to bring that part of the Bill into operation until after next harvest, that is the 1935 harvest at the earliest.  It is rather unnecessary to have this provision there and therefore, we are shifting these two sections into the part of the Bill which deals with the mixing of the flour.  That section would not be operative under that Part of it.  That is the object of these new amendments, to delete the section and put the other over to Section 65.  That would give the effect that we want in this Bill.</P>
      <P>We are not changing the sections except that we insert at the beginning these few words &ldquo;whenever a milling (composite flour) order is enforced.&rdquo; We are not making any material change in the sections:</P>

As the sections stood &ldquo;corn store&rdquo; or &ldquo;corn kiln&rdquo; was defined in certain terms.

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a point of principle which I have done before and of which, in this case, I have given the Minister private notice.  Increasingly, the Government is laying its hands on the business of private people.  It is not only in industry that that is happening.  It is also happening in agriculture.  For example, the Minister has taken power now to fix the price of oats in a certain emergency.  He is also involved in fixing, indirectly, the price of sugar beet.  I need hardly tell the Minister that there is a great possibility of trouble there because of the price he has fixed.  I do not want to forment trouble but I have been looking at certain of my own costings with regard to the production of sugar beet and I do not see how anybody is going to pay wages even at the present low level and have anything left for himself. That, however, is only incidental, to illustrate my point.  When his predecessor was in office, and also since he came into office himself, I pressed the Government to get active in ascertaining a real knowledge of the costs of production.  It is not a bit of good taking estimates in the air and getting people, however experienced, to sit down and say: &ldquo;You plough so much, hoe so much, harrow so much,&rdquo; and all that kind of thing.  Some Senators are quite competent to do that themselves.  The only possible way is to get returns from the working of selected farms. All that is required in the first instance, is that a man should have accurate information, that it should, <Col N="618" /> be collected and collated and then get the whole thing put into shape by people who understand accountancy. In Denmark, this is considered so important that the farmers do it themselves.  On one occasion, when I wanted to see their figures, I went to some Danish house in London and I was shown the cost of production over a period of years.  At one time, it was considered important here and something, though not every much, was done.  Then darkness descended. That was four or five years ago. About three years ago, I pressed the Minister or his predecessor on this question.  I had taken advantage of every appropriate opportunity to do so, because it is a very important matter.  I am afraid the Government is just putting it on the long finger. They do not deny its importance&mdash; they have too much sense to do that&mdash; but they say it means money and time.  It is absolutely essential that we should have the cost of production ascertained if the Government is to go into business and sell the people up.  This question has a direct bearing on what is going on now.  The Government is selling people up and they should have knowledge of whether or not a profit can be made on present prices.  That can be determined, to a great extent, by actual research. In the absence of any satisfactory reply from the Minister, I say that there has been neglect on the part of the Government in this matter.  The Government has been guilty of contributory negligence&mdash;remotely, perhaps&mdash;in not taking steps to ascertain the cost of production.  The Minister may say that they have ascertained some particulars.  He should tell the public what they have ascertained. If they cannot show that sugar beet can be produced, paying present wages, at 30/- per ton, they must be prepared to find an agitation amongst the farmers sooner or later.  I want the Minister to give the House a definite and positive assurance that he is taking active steps, through his Department, to ascertain the cost of production&mdash;not mere estimates but information which can be obtained from the actual returns of working <Col N="619" /> farmers collected and collated over a period of years.  Otherwise, this policy of increasing interference will mean that we will rush headlong to disaster.  There is, of course, a legal obligation upon us to obey the law but there is a moral obligation on a Government going into business to make a price which will enable the people to meet their liabilities.</P>

      <P>I endorse what Senator Sir John Keane said and I make a final protest against this Bill and against this policy of attempting to increase tillage by placing these terrible burdens on the people&mdash;particularly the farmers.  That policy will fail, as it has failed up to the present.  The policy of subsidising wheat and other crops has failed to put an extra acre under tillage.  What will happen is what has always happened where a particular crop is subsidised. If a farmer finds that he can get a little ready money by going into a particular crop, he will go into that crop and neglect something else. He will do things which he has no experience of, instead of going along and improving the sound and well-tried methods which made this country prosperous and put the farmer in an independent and comparatively comforstable position, notwithstanding the world situation.  I endorse all that Senator Sir John Keane has said regarding sugar beet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies to wheat.  The farmers are only growing these crops because there is nothing else left for them.  They know that they are doing wrong, that they are injuring their land, that the policy is fundamentally unsound but they must earn a few shillings to keep body and sould together.  The genuine farmer&mdash;all kinds of people are called farmers but I refer only to the genuine agriculturist&mdash;is being put into and impossible position.  I have still more figures than I quoted previously to prove that the maize-mixture <Col N="620" /> is increasing the price of feeding stuffs and making it impossible for the farmers to feed his stock.  I know that poor people&mdash;cottiers as well as farmers&mdash;have had this year, at great cost, to buy small bags of pure maize.  Before the original Bill was introduced, I could buy whole maize at £4 per ton, get it ground at a local mill and mix it with barley and oats in proper proportions.  In that way, I got a very cheap feeding stuff and one far superior to the stuff we have to pay for now.  With all these efforts to increase tillage, the acreage is not increased.  If the acreage under wheat is increased, the average under oats has gone down by 50,000.  I think it my duty, on behalf of the farmers I represent, to protest against this policy of the Government. It is running and will ruin the country.  It is making the people poorer and less independent than they have ever been.</P>

      <P>I saw in one of the Sunday papers that the French people were exporting to Great Britain flour at 11/6 per sack of 20 stone.  The British people were not very pleased to receive flour so cheaply as that.  Why did the French nation export their flour at such a price?  Because they had a surplus and because they had taken care to produce within their own borders sufficient food for their own people.  Why were the English people not pleased to receive these supplies of flour?  Those who reported the matter and commented upon it were not pleased because their idea was that in Great Britain as much flour as possible should be produced for the people of Great Britain.  If that is a sound policy for these great and powerful nations&mdash;France powerful on land and Great Britain powerful at sea&mdash;why should it not be sound policy for us in this fertile little island to produce the food necessary for our own people? I do protest against Senator Miss Browne speaking on behalf of the farmers.  She is a farmer&mdash;I am sure a very good farmer&mdash;in County Wexford but I do not know that she has a right to speak even for the farmers of Wexford.</P>

      <P>The Senator says she has and, of course, one can never contradict a lady.  Generally speaking, the farmers are, in my opinion, in favour of a balance between tillage and grazing.  There are some parts of this country where tillage is impossible; there are some parts of the country where tillage is impossible there are some parts of the country which have been destroyed, which are actually moss-grown for want of proper tillage.  I would have not spoken at all at this stage were it not that we have had a protest from Senator Sir John Keane, a sensible man.  He made his protest on the old free trade lines. These are absolutely impossible.  We must have tillage in this country and we must have industry.</P>

      <P>There are cereals, the cost of production of which at the present guaranteed price would not pay except one paid a starvation wage. When he is making out his costings the Minister should take into consideration <Col N="622" /> the agricultural wages paid in different districts and then ascertain if he could produce beet economically at 30/- or potatoes for industrial alcohol at 25/-.  This Bill aims at giving the farmer something which will compensate him in the matter of production cost.  In my opinion it will mean a reduction in the production of another industry, an industry greater than tillage.  By raising the price of oats, corn and other cereals, the Minister is going to interfere with the production of fat stock.  He will interfere with the production of fat cattle, fat pigs, poultry, and others things. The big pig and poultry rearing districts are in the West of Ireland and, when it comes to the production of those commodities, the people who have not sufficient feeding stuffs, and who have not land suitable for the production of suitable feeding stuffs, will find themselves in grave difficulties, and the raw material will probably cost them an additional 25 or 30 per cent.  In that way, though the Minister, through this Bill, is seeking to give the farmer something for the production of cereals, he will interfere with the ordinary avocations of those people to whom I have referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many considerations that arise on this question of the encouragement of wheat cultivation. Senator Sir John Keane has touched on a very important point when he deals with the cost of production.  I have had great experience of growing wheat and other cereals.  I am of the opinion that wheat cannot be grown profitably or economically on a large scale in this country.  I think it is an absolutely uneconomic proposition.  In the case of small farms, the average crop would be something like one or one-and-a-half acres.  From my experience of the cost of threshing and handling, the crop could not possibly be profitable.  In the old days the threshing used to be carried on with a fail, but in these days machinery is used and for that reason wheat-growing is definitely uneconomic.  Of course, if we could rely on a continuance of free family labour, what I might call slave labour, <Col N="623" /> unpaid labour, the position would be different.  As conditions exists, however, we may give up the cultivation of wheat on these small areas, largely because of the question of production cost.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane has raised a matter to which the Government should give very serious attention. Our experience during the last couple of years in the cultivation of wheat has shown that it has displaced other valuable crops such as oats and barley.  These had to be displaced to make room for the wheat.  Another important aspect is that the climate of this country is changing.  I am not suggesting that it is impossible to grow wheat or other cereals.  It is quite possible to do so, but the question of cost enters so much that it makes the cultivation of the crop absolutely uneconomic.  In conjunction with the question of cost, you have to take into consideration the Irish climate.  The climate is definitely changing.  Even the birds have failed to come to the country in the same way as they used to for many years past.  Take for instance, the swallows and cuckoos. They are actually leaving the country, or at least not coming in the same numbers, and that is very definite proof.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the plea of Senator Sir John Keane regarding the publication of costings accounts.  I have supported this idea for a long time.  Even though it is done, I do not think there will ever, be <Col N="624" /> any suggestion of being able to run agriculture in this country on economic lines.  Neverthenless, it is desirable that we should know exactly how much is being lost by the individual producer of any crop.  It might be a comfort to the Senator, in view of his reference to the growing intervention of Governments in economic matters, to draw attention to a statement made by the Premier of Canada, Rt. Hon. R.B. Bennett:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am convinced that there will be more and not less interference by Governments in private business&mdash; not to substitute Governments for men who are better able to conduct business but to regulate, control and prevent recurrence of conditions apparent to all.</P>
      <P>All our efforts since 1930 (said Premier Bennett) have been towards maintaining the capitalistic system, Guarantees to the provinces and to the great transportation systems and other grants were deliberately aimed at the retention of capitalism.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is quite likely that the Government here could repeat that sentence, and I would agree that it represents the Government's view, but if he has any regard for the opinion of a man of the experience of Mr. Bennett, perhaps the Senator will take comfort from the extract.  Senator Counihan, too, might be a little less pessimistic than he appears to be if he would take note of a statement made by another Canadian Minister, Mr. H.H. Stevens, in reference to the cost of production of live stock.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Canadian packers, who &lsquo;during these four depression years have piled up reserves not warranted even under normal business operations.&rsquo; experiencing &lsquo;the most prosperous years in their history,&rsquo; while farmers sold &lsquo;first-class steers for one and a half cents a pound.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is 3/4d. per lb. without an economic war and without all the difficulties that we have suffered under that is the situation in that great country across the Atlantic.  That is the complaint that is made there and that is the explanation of the policy that various Governments have taken.</P>

      <P>Senator Dillon's conception of this measure is founded on a wrong basis, because, as far as I understand the Bill, it is open to any farmer to grow or not to grow wheat as he wishes.  Farmers who grow wheat know better than anyone else whether it will be economic or not.  They will grow whatever crop pays best.  There was an increased acreage last year, and with the bounty they got more out of that crop than if they grew the crops that it substituted.  It is optional with farmers to do what they wish.  As the Government are helping in that particular line, and as there is no force, I do not see why the experiment should not go on until we see how far the growth of that cereal will meet the demands of the home market. When there are 500,000 or 600,000 acres of wheat grown, I wonder where the bounty will come from to induce farmers to continue growing it.  As the acreage grows the cost of the bounty will increase, until a time is reached when the Government may have to reduce the bounty or the position is that the growing of wheat will be an economic proposition.  I hope the present arrangement will continue.  After all there is no harm in growing a crop to feed our own people.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of costings raised by Senator Sir John Keane, we have not had a section in the Department dealing with that question for some years.  There was such a section in the Department during, and for some years after, the Great War.  About 1924 the Government introduced some measures of economy, and amongst these was one doing away with the costings section. Since then we have had none.  I have been trying since I took office to have that section re-established, but with the passing of Bills it has always been more urgent to get staffs to work them and the question of a costings section has been put aside.  I intend to make a serious effort to have that section <Col N="626" /> going in the near future.  It is a pity that the Government have to do such work, because in most countries it is done by other institutions, such as agricultural colleges.  It would be much better if it were done that way here, because if a Government Department does costings, and has to pay subsidies or a guaranteed price on, say, beet, wheat and other things, perhaps there is a suspicion amongst certain farmers that the costings are not done to their advantage.  It would be much better if costings was done by a neutral body, such as University Colleges.  There is no great hope that it will be done here by any other institution, and the Government will have to do it, at least for some time to come.  I do not understand Senator Miss Browne's complaint about people buying pure maize.  Pure maize is only used for human food in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">

If they did so for such a purpose they should not be classed as ordinary farmers.

      <P>Senator Miss Browne wound up her speech, as usual, by saying that the Bill&mdash;as is said about any particular Bill that comes before the House&mdash;would ruin the country.  We will leave it at that.  Senator Dillon dealt with the cultivation of wheat and stated that it is displacing oats and barley.  That is not altogether a fact. It is true that the acreage of wheat was increased this year, and that the acreage of oats went down, but taking the two years that the scheme is in operation, the area under oats has not materially decreased.  The area under barley and the area under wheat increased.  Taking it in normal percentages the total area under tillage has considerably increased in two years.  I do not think Senator Dillon is right when he said that it does not pay to grow wheat on a large scale; while it might pay farmers to grow it on a small scale, where slave wages were paid. We have a number of large growers registered this year, and in one district there are four growers with over 1,000 acres between them.  That is large scale production for this country.  It would not be much to speak of in Canada, but it is very good for this country to have an average of 250 acres in one district amongst four men.  It should pay them better than the small farmers, because obviously they can get the work done much more easily by using machinery, and by working in larger fields.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I took the Senator up wrongly.  As to the question of agricultural economy, I was going to say that we cannot go in that direction because unfortunately if we were to go in the direction of having big farms so that people could make farming pay better than, say, with small farms, we would be up against another difficulty&mdash;the social problem which we have to deal with and which is more important.  We have a population which we must settle on the land in some way and the only way that can be done is by dividing large farms and <Col N="628" /> putting the people on the land on smaller farms.  As we intend to do that, I suppose we must in turn try, if possible, to look after the economic condition of the smaller farmers.  The fact that the area under wheat is going up year by year is proof in itself that the price offered is a good one, because I think no farmer is growing wheat for patriotic purposes; farmers are growing it for the price offered. Obviously, if we have an increased acreage it is the price that is responsible for that.  That is a rough guide to where we are going.  I do agree, however, with some speakers who have advocated costings.  I agree that it would be a great advantage to the Department of Agriculture to have proper costings in dealing with these things, if there is a price fixed for wheat and beet.  I hope to get a costings staff as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>(2)  This Act shall remain in force until the 31st day of March, 1936 and shall then expire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not very much to add to what I said in reference to this amendment on the last day when I withdrew it in order to have a consultation with the Minister to see if we could get an agreed amendment.  The Minister and some Senators were of opinion on that occasion that the period of one year was too short for the experiment. Consequently, I have given an additional six months and now propose <Col N="629" /> that the Bill shall expire on 31st March, 1936.  The Minister has put down an amendment giving it another year.  I do not think that we can add very much to the arguments put forward on the last occasion in favour of the amendment, but it is a concession that the Minister has agreed that the Bill shall expire in 1937.  I am confident and I am prepared to have a small bet with the Minister on it, that before 12 months have expired the Minister will be compelled to bring in an amending Bill because this is a completely new departure.  He will find before the Bill has been working six months that a number of its provisions will have to be amended and consequently he will have to introduce an amending Bill.  For that reason, I think he should agree to this amendment. If the Bill is a workable one and if, as we all hope, it turns out to be to the advantage of the farmers in the way of getting better prices for their stock, then there will be no opposition to the amending Bill; but if it turns out to be an impossible measure to work, one which is taking away all freedom from the farmers, then the sooner we have an opportunity of getting completely shut of the Bill the better.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the amendment which I spoke in favour of on the last day.  I think the suggestion of giving the Bill a trial for 12 months is a very sensible one to make.  From my experience of the cattle trade I have no hope that the Bill will be a success.  I think 12 months' experience will more than satisfy the farmers and the Minister that the Bill cannot be worked&mdash;that it will lead to confusion and create changes amongst the farming interests in the country.  To a certain extent, the Bill is experimental and there is no such thing as anybody saying that it can be a success.  There is no opportunity of knowing how it will work.  I cannot see very much hope for its success.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating and I think 12 months are long enough for it to be in operation.  I really anticipate, especially in regard to the marking of cattle and the carrying out of the <Col N="630" /> regulations laid down, that it will be found to be unworkable and lead to greater confusion than we have at present in the cattle trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGarahan" hpid="Mr. Garahan Mr. Garahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to support the amendment.  This Bill provides for very wide powers of control over the principal portion of the live stock industry.  In my opinion, that control is likely to interfere very much with the independence of the individual in carrying on that live stock industry to the best of his ability.  It is likely to destroy initiative.  It will be rather inclined to reduce the expert farmer to the level of the dud farmer, because there will really be little or no initiative left to the person conducting his own business.  One would not be at all inclined to support the Bill but for the fact that it is dealing with abnormal circumstances and is considered necessary to relieve the plight into which the agriculturist is forced under existing conditions. I believe this Bill is calculated, and I am sure it is intended, to relieve the farmers.  It is, in my opinion, the first real effort of this Government in that direction. For that reason I feel inclined to support the Bill, as I have already done in Committee.  But when I supported the Bill, I did so on the understanding that there would be a time limit applied, say, up to September, 1935. Senator Counihan has increased that time limit by about six months.  The time limit, therefore, is the question before us now.  In my opinion one would not be justified at all in supporting this Bill if his sympathies lay with the agriculturists of this country, if there was no time limit imposed.  The Minister apparently is in sympathy with the suggestion that there should be a time limit, and the question is what the length of time should be.  I think the amendment we are dealing with suggests a very reasonable period.  I think we should have a fair indication by that time as to how the Bill is going to work. There is nothing to prevent revision and renewal of the Bill, if necessary, after the expiration of the period mentioned in Senator Counihan's amendment.  I sincerely hope there <Col N="631" /> will be no necessity for the renewal of the Bill at that time.  If the necessity for it has ceased, or if it ceases even in six months' time, the Bill will cease functioning, apart from the time that we may fix here.</P>
      <P>It is a very serious proposition for the State to enter into a particular industry in the country and to dictate how it should be carried on.  Despite the necessity that, to my mind, does exist for a Bill on the lines of this Bill now before us, if I thought there was any likelihood that it was to be the thin edge of the wedge of State control over agriculture in this country I would oppose it, no matter what the immediate consequences were.  I do not feel that it is such an indication, and I am satisfied to support the Bill provided that Senator Counihan's amendment is accepted.</P>

I quite agree with Senator Counihan that it might be necessary, before two years, to have an amending Bill.  But that is quite a different matter.  I think an amending Bill might be brought in, but a Bill to extend the present Bill would be a separate Bill.  I think we should get at least two years.  We would want a fair test of the working of the Bill and therefore I ask the Seanad to agree to the 31st March, 1937.  As a further consideration, however, I would be prepared to compromise with Senator Counihan, if the House would agree, because I think the 31st September would be a still more suitable date. Without having any number of years this Bill, when it becomes law, might be included with the Expiring Laws, but if there was any specific application we would have to have a special Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 10 (being the new section inserted in Committee).  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Nothing in this section shall apply to the occasional slaughter by a farmer of sheep or lambs for human consumption, provided that such sheep or lambs are owned by him and that the greater portion of the meat of such sheep or lambs is for the use of himself and his family, and that the number of sheep or <Col N="633" /> lambs so slaughtered does not exceed one sheep or lamb per week.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands the farmer can kill any number of sheep and lambs for his own consumption, but he cannot sell even one pound of that meat.  If he did so he would be committing an offence, according to this Bill.  The usual practice amongst farmers is to kill a sheep or a lamb every week.  In many seasons of the year weather conditions make it impossible for the farmer to keep the sheep or lamb for more than two or three days as he has no cold storage.  The consequence of that would be that unless he was able to consume the whole of the animal in his own family he would usually sell to his workmen or to a neighbour a leg of mutton or lamb.  I do not want a farmer to kill any number of sheep or lambs.  I only want him to have the right to kill his own sheep or a lamb, and to be allowed to sell a portion of it to a neighbour, if he decides to do so.  If it were extended to any greater number, it would amount to turning him into a butcher, and, particularly with the restrictions and levies which are on the butchers at the moment, he would be having an undue advantage over the butcher and it would tend to make him go in for making a profit.</P>
    <P>In discussing this section on the Committee Stage, I intended to put in a clause allowing institutions, such as asylums and mental hospitals and so forth, to kill animals and sell to the employees of such institutions, but in discussing that matter with some representatives of the committees of mental hospitals they told me that they did have that practice but found that all the employees wanted to have the best &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; and consequently they had to stop the practice.  For that reason I think that this should apply only to the farmer who kills one sheep per week and that mental hospitals and such institutions, that kill a large number of animals, should pay the levy and not have any greater advantage.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Minister or the House thinks of this amendment but, in my opinion, it is an amendment restricting the liberties <Col N="634" /> of the farmers.  I may be wrong, but it seems to me that, under the Bill, a farmer would be entitled to kill a sheep, or more than one sheep, per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that he could. Here is the governing section:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall cause to be kept the following registers, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  A register ... of premises in which is carried on the business of slaughtering cattle or the business of slaughtering sheep or the business of slaughtering both cattle and sheep.</P>
      <P>I do not think that a farmer who kills one sheep per week or, say, a bullock at Christmas, is carrying on the business of slaughtering sheep, but if the Minister thinks otherwise, of course, that is different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidRobinson" hpid="Mr. D.L. Robinson Mr. D.L. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.L. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, I should be inclined to support anything in the nature of legislation that approximated as near as possible to what was, and is, and undoubtedly will be, the practice.  It seems to me, however, that if this amendment is carried it will be incumbent on the Government to see that it is carried out; that is to say, with regard to one sheep, the Civic Guards or some other persons will have to see that the person concerned does not ordinarily slaughter more than one sheep, whereas I have not the smallest doubt that if this amendment were not carried the farmers would carry on the normal practice of slaughtering the sheep anyway and selling a portion of it to their employees.  I imagine that that could be done without breaking the law, on the same system as you pay labourers by deducting so much from their wages for the rent of a house, or for firing or potatoes&mdash;or all sorts of allowances that they get.  I do not see why a bit of mutton should not be an allowance on their wages and I have not the smallest doubt that that is the way it would be carried on, no matter what the law might be.  It seems to me, however, that if this is passed, while it will not affect the situation actually <Col N="635" /> because the farmers will continue to sell to their employees as they have done in the past, it will necessitate employing somebody to see that they do not break the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  A great many farmers, finding all channels of making sufficient to keep their families going closed to them, or of making a few extra shillings in the week, have resorted to killing a sheep or two.  Very few exceed one sheep in the week although some kill two; but I think that the least the Government might do is not to take away this small relief&mdash;this poor consolation&mdash;that the farmer has got for the destruction of what is ordinarily his proper market.  I think that the farmer should be allowed to have that relief.  I am not satisfied with Senator David Robinson's vague suppositions and Senator Comyn's doubts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all doubtful. It is perfectly clear that you are taking away the liberties of the farmers by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear that the farmer can kill a sheep and sell a portion of it to his neighbours.  That is not in the Bill, and if this amendment is not carried a farmer will have to be a registered slaughterer and will have to pay a levy of 5/- even for the killing of one sheep.  That means, of course, that he cannot carry on at all. It means that he cannot add to his already depleted funds the expense of killing a sheep.  Surely one sheep is not too much to allow, and it certainly will not interfere with the butchers to any great extent.  I think that the amendment is very reasonable and that it is the least we should expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble with the amendment is that it is far too reasonable. Senator Counihan is right when he says that it is going to do more harm than good to the farmers.  As the section stands, it will be interpreted as the business of slaughtering, and if my inspectors say&mdash;as they will have to say under the Bill&mdash;that unless a man is in the victualling business he is exempt, that man will be exempt. <Col N="636" /> A farmer is not in the business of victualling and therefore must be exempt.  If necessary, he can go to the courts and prove that he is exempt. Senator Comyn will bear me out, from the legal point of view, that when once you give an exemption you have to carry it out.  This amendment, however, is going to make it impossible. The amendment says: &ldquo;Provided that such slaughter does not exceed one sheep per week or one bullock in each year.&rdquo;  That is to say, if the farmer kills more than one sheep in the week or more than one bullock in the year he can be proceeded against.  If that proviso is left out, however, he can plead, if he is proceeded against, that he is not engaged in the business of a victualler, and therefore is exempt.</P>
      <P>There is another thing to be considered. If, by any chance, the farmer sells more than half the sheep he has slaughtered he will be guilty of an offence; but if this proviso is left out he would not be guilty of any offence. As a matter of fact, I saw the draftsman and said that I should like to accept Senator Counihan's amendment. The draftsman, however, said that he would not have it.  He said: &ldquo;If the Seanad want that I will not draft it because it is irrelevant and unnecessary.&rdquo;  He said that he would not be guilty of having a section coming under his hand with such an amendment added to it.</P>

      <P>He must be in the business as a victualler.  I could not define that exactly, but if he only kills one sheep in the week and keeps the major portion for himself and sells some of it, either to his employees or his neighbours, he is obviously not in the business of a victualler.  I suppose that one has to draw the line somewhere. If he were to kill, say, three sheep and keep half of one sheep for his own use and sell the remainder of the three <Col N="637" /> sheep, that would be different.  But it has to be defined by the court.</P>

    <P>If the Minister is going to raise a serious objection to this amendment, then I will not press it.  I would urge, however, on the Minister, that in order to save himself he should accept it. Under the provisions of this Bill the Minister for Agriculture is to be a buyer of stock, a seller of stock, a slaughterer of stock and a feeder of stock.  Now he is proposing to set himself up as judge, jury and high executioner.  Courts of justice have been set up to dispense justice to the <Col N="638" /> people and, therefore, I think that it is in a court of justice all these cases should be tried.  If the Minister would give me an assurance that he would be prepared to move an amendment to this effect when the Bill goes back to the Dáil, I would not press my amendment here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this amendment, I would like to point out that amendment No. 7, which follows, has been brought in by me partly to meet the point of view of Senator Counihan. In previous discussions, when we analysed this Bill in detail, we found that no Senator objected to the powers that we are taking under paragraph (b) &ldquo;that the business in respect of which such premises are registered has ceased to be carried on in such premises.&rdquo;  There is no necessity to go to court in that class of case.  A victualler closes down his business. We find that out after some time when we get no replies to our letters.  There is no necessity to go to court, and we simply remove him from the register. There was no objection either to paragraph (c), which deals with the case of a registered proprietor who has died.  There is no need to go to court in that case either.  We simply remove the name from the register.  The big objection arises under paragraph (d), which deals with the case of a bankrupt. We are proposing to delete that paragraph.  We do not see any great necessity for it.  All these paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) have appeared in previous measures.  As far as paragraph (d) goes, we have never used the powers given under it.  We have never taken a person off any of our registers because he was adjudged a bankrupt. As Senators appear to be somewhat apprehensive about the powers proposed to be given under paragraph (d), I am prepared to agree to its deletion. The powers given in paragraph (e) can be more properly discussed on amendment No. 8.  I think, in view of the fact that I am prepared to delete paragraph (d), that Senator Counihan should agree to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of Bills of this class this is the only one that has the provision &ldquo;that the registered proprietor of such premises has been convicted of an offence&rdquo; and so on.  In other measures, such as the Eggs Act, the Dairy Produce Act, the Fresh Meat Act and the others, the wording would be the same as I suppose here: that is that the registered proprietor &ldquo;has committed&rdquo; an offence and so on. When the Cereals Bill was first introduced the wording was the same as in this Bill, namely, that the registered proprietor had been convicted of an offence.  We found considerable difficulty in administering that Bill when it became an Act.  As a matter of fact, an amendment such as I am now moving to this Bill has been made by the Dáil and Seanad to the original Cereals Act.  At times it has been found very profitable for small millers to mill maize and leave out oats and barley.  When we threatened them they did not mind because they knew that they had the opportunity of doing good business in the four, five or six months that must elapse before we could take them into court and get them removed from the register.  We felt that the same thing might occur in connection with this Bill.  I am not in a position to forecast the circumstances in which it might occur, but those who got on the register might <Col N="640" /> defy the Minister for Agriculture and say: &ldquo;if you are going to bring us into court we will continue to carry on, making all the money that we can during the next six months.&rdquo;  It would take at least that period before we could get them into court because they can raise various objections and, in the meantime, considerable damage might be done.</P>
      <P>I want to make quite clear to the Seanad what the position will be when the Bill is amended.  As the Bill stands we could not remove a person from the register until he had first been convicted of an offence.  Our desire is to bring this Bill into line with the other Acts that I have referred to.  The Seanad might like to know what protection a person will have when the Bill is amended.  First of all, he has the right of appeal. Before there is any cancellation of his registration he must get a month's notice.  Then he is given seven days in which to lodge an appeal.  If he appeals I must set up an inquiry. That inquiry will be presided over by a competent person&mdash;by a senior inspector of the Department.  At the inquiry the registered person can appear either in person or be represented by counsel or a solicitor, and make his case there.  While, strictly speaking, it might appear that the man has not got a very good chance, I think that when Senators come to consider the matter fully they will admit that he will be fairly treated. If I take steps to remove him from the register and he lodges an appeal I must set up an inquiry.  He will have the right to appeal in person or to employ senior counsel&mdash;Senator Comyn, for instance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  If the inspector of the Department who is holding the inquiry, in spite of the pleadings of senior counsel on behalf of that man, were to turn him down unfairly does any Senator imagine that the matter will be allowed to rest there?  Surely the case would be brought before the Dáil and the Seanad.  There would be a further ventilation of it.  I think it is quite obvious that the Minister, in view of all these circumstances, <Col N="641" /> will be inclined to err on the lenient side.  At any rate the effect of this amendment would be this: if the offence is a genuine one the Minister will be able to stop it straight away, and will not be put in the position of having to wait for four, five or six months to bring the offender to court.  As I said already, we had that experience on two or three occasions under the Cereals Act and had to have it amended to deal with those people who were offending.</P>

I can conceive a case in which a person could keep the question going for 12 months during the whole currency of this measure if the section is left as it is&mdash;&ldquo;... the registered proprietor of such premises has been convicted of an offence under this Act.&rdquo;  It takes a long time to get before the District Justice and then, if he has a great interest in continuing the business, there might be a certiorari and you cannot say that there is a conviction if a conditional order for certiorari has been made.  In point of fact, the delays which would be possible in a case like this, with an expert performer who wanted to evade the provisions of the Statute and to carry on in violation of the Statute, would be so great that the Statute would be altogether nugatory, unless you changed that section in the manner suggested by the Minister.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that when you delete the phrase &ldquo;has been convicted of&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;committed&rdquo;, the case made by the Minister is understandable but it does not seem to fit in with the rest of the provisions.  It is quite plain that the Minister has the option as to whether there shall be an inquiry or not.  If a man has been convicted, it is then the Minister's option as to whether in spite of the conviction, he may consider the circumstances and decide not to take action, but where it is a case of the Minister assuming that a man has committed the offence and there has been no other conviction, it seems to me that the man should have the right of appeal.  Perhaps I have not made my case perfectly clear.  Where the Minister assumes, no doubt, of course, on good evidence, that a man has committed something, it seems to me that if that man has not been convicted in a court of law, he should have the right of an inquiry.</P>

When any fat cattle have been marked or any unmarked cattle or sheep are prohibited from being sold by an order or regulation made by the Minister under this Act, no decree or warrant of any court shall be executed for the recovery of any debt due by the owner of such cattle or sheep until after the expiration of the date before which such cattle or sheep are prohibited from being sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want a further explanation from the Minister with regard to the position of farmers who will be prevented from selling their stock under regulations made by the Minister.  I contend it would be grossly unfair to any farmer to have his stock distrained for annuities, rates, bank debts or any other debts which he may owe, when he could not or would not have an opportunity of selling his stock to realise the money to meet those demands, and if by an order or regulation of the Minister such a situation arises, I think it would be only reasonable that such a provision as this should be inserted to protect him.  We are completely at sea as to how these regulations will be carried out.  The Minister has taken power to prohibit the export of any stock and if a man <Col N="644" /> has stock to sell and cannot get a licence and if these stock are only fit for export, I cannot see how the man can realise.  The Minister says he will not prevent him from selling, but if he does not meet a buyer with a licence there is no possibility of his being able to sell them.</P>
    <P>At the present time the price cattle are making in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is very much in excess of the price we are getting here, and from the 1st September they are getting 5/- a cwt., or practically £3 a head, more.  If a man cannot sell his stock at all, and is compelled to meet all his liabilities, it will be a very serious situation, and I think some provision like this should be inserted to protect him in that case.</P>

      <P>I thought that Senator Counihan had decided on the previous stage to withdraw this amendment definitely.  Various Senators had spoken to the effect that even if the amendment were passed it would have no effect.  The amendment mentions &ldquo;when any fat cattle have been marked or any unmarked cattle or sheep are prohibited from being sold.&rdquo; The fat cattle are never prohibited from being sold.  They are prohibited from being slaughtered.  Even when marked they would not be prohibited from being sold.  If there are unmarked cattle, anybody, dealer or butcher, can buy them, but cannot slaughter them.  Let us say that cattle are marked for the 15th September. Anybody can buy these cattle, but the butcher cannot slaughter them until the 15th September, so that the amendment would really have no effect.  We are not prohibiting cattle from being sold.  I understood that the Senator had agreed that that was so when that argument was put up here on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I withdrew all these amendments in order to give the Minister an opportunity of having some agreed amendments substituted for them.  We are not out to put in an amendment which would have a bad effect on the Bill and make it unworkable. The whole idea of every Senator is to get some amendment inserted <Col N="645" /> which would protect the farmer and at the same time leave the Bill a workable proposition.  I submit that my amendment is reasonable, because some provision should be made to protect the farmer.  If the Minister is of opinion that mine is not workable then he should procure an amendment for the farmers' protection.</P>

He then said&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister is inclined to turn down every reasonable amendment.  In this he is backed up by Senator Wilson, who is tied to the couple of shillings extra and who thinks all the farmers should be satisfied, because they might gain a few pounds.  I think Senator Wilson has carried on in a most disgraceful way in this House in regard to these matters.&rdquo;  I want to repudiate that statement by Senator Counihan, and I ask him to withdraw it, because I did not say anything disgraceful. I simply explained exactly in the terms the Minister has explained now, and if I was disgraceful the Minister is disgraceful.</P>

Now, a marked beast can be sold.  I can buy a marked beast from Senator Counihan if he wants money and has a beast that is marked for slaughter.  He can sell that beast to any person.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 23, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;In fixing the minimum price at which cattle or sheep may be bought, the Minister shall take into consideration the cost of production of such cattle or sheep, as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this amendment with the Minister I pointed out to him that I would be satisfied, and I am sure the House would be satisfied, to have any provision inserted that would convey the same meaning.  But I cannot see any amendment I could put in that would give less powers than the one on the Order Paper.  The Minister agreed with me when I put the matter to him, and I believe he will accept the amendment. I would like to point out to the Minister, in fixing the minimum price that he would be well advised to have a minimum sliding scale.  I would suggest to him that he should accept the amendment so as to make it worth <Col N="647" /> while for the feeder to produce stall-fed cattle in April or May.  Otherwise we will, at that period, have a great scarcity of cattle, no matter what the quota will be.  No matter what it will be it will not be filled.  Last year we had an extraordinary experience of stall-feeding.  We were paid less for the cattle in April and May than we were in January and February.  That sort of thing cannot happen many years in succession.  The farmers cannot continue working at such enormous loss as they worked last year. Except something like this amendment is inserted in the Bill it will not be possible to fill the quota.  The same has happened in other branches of our industry with the quota.  This year we, farmers, produced a good deal of food for stall-feeding, but it would be better for us last year that we allowed that stuff to go to waste instead of feeding it to cattle.  Our losses would have been less.  That sort of thing is not going to happen this year, and I urge the Minister, when fixing the minimum price, to fix it at what he considers will be a decent price for cattle in April and May.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly cannot understand Senator Counihan moving an amendment such as this, because of the fact that the association that Senator Counihan represents in this House never gave the slightest consideration to the cost of production in the case of the farmers' products.  They never considered the cost of production when they were buying the farmers' cattle, and it was that which made it necessary for this Bill to be introduced. It is a notorious fact that the people who have been producing live stock in this country were never given the slightest consideration by the people who bought that live stock.  These people never gave any thought to the farmers' cost of production.  And that is the reason why this Bill has been introduced.  It was because the farmer was not getting anything like what his cost of production was that the Minister brought in this Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill was brought in to ensure that people like Senator Counihan would not be allowed to go along depriving the farmer of that to which he was properly entitled.  Under this Bill the Minister has endeavoured to protect the farmer and those associated with him; to ensure that the farmer when he produces a beast will get something like its fair value.  Then Senator Counihan, above all people in the world, comes along to move an amendment such as this, that the Minister must take into consideration the farmers' cost of production when he is fixing his minimum price.  Did ever anybody in life hear such audacity as that?  It is because of the fact that these things have been done by Senator Counihan and people like him that the Minister has been compelled in the interests of the unfortunate farmer to bring in a Bill which guarantees that the farmer will be protected against people like Senator Counihan.  Surely the whole framework of the Bill is designed to ensure that the farmer will get something like the cost of production. Is that not the whole principle underlying the Bill?  Otherwise the Bill would not be necessary.  The Minister by ensuring that these regulations will be carried out is ensuring that the farmer will get something like the cost of production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Douglas and for that reason I was inclined to accept the amendment, but after consulting the draftsman I find that it will be necessary to change the wording somewhat.  The amendment reads: &ldquo;In fixing the minimum price at which cattle or sheep may be <Col N="649" /> bought, the Minister shall take into consideration the cost of production of such cattle or sheep as the case may be.&rdquo;  The point is that we may fix different prices for different classes of cattle and sheep.  We may fix a price for heifers, bullocks and young cows. It is necessary therefore to change the wording, and the amendment which I suggest reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Section 23.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) When fixing a minimum price under this section, the Minister shall have regard to the cost of production of the animals to which such price applies.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to accepting such an amendment as that, although I do agree with Senator Douglas that it is not going to have any very great effect. My attention is drawn to the fact in the Bill that I must have regard to the cost of production but it does not go any further than that.</P>

      <P>Section 30, I am sorry to say, passed me, and both the Dáil and the Seanad in rather a drastic manner. Having granted a manufacturing licence, sub-section (4) states &ldquo;the Minister may at any time revoke a manufacturing licence.&rdquo;  I think that is rather drastic and I desire to amend it to this effect&mdash;that if the Minister is satisfied that there has been a breach <Col N="650" /> by the holder of nay such licence of any of the conditions of the licence he can revoke it.  That, at any rate, would prevent the Minister's revoking a licence for any other reason.  For instance, the Government might be accused, after going into such business itself, of taking advantage of that to revoke the licence of a manufacturer already there.  This amendment, at any rate, provides that the Minister cannot revoke the licence except for some very good reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>I think the introduction of the words &ldquo;if he is satisfied&rdquo; will mean that a person will be at the mercy of the Minister.  The Minister becomes the prosecutor, the judge and the jury.  If the amendment read that the licence would be revoked if the holder had committed a breach of any of the conditions, there could be an appeal and the person could go to court to prove that he had not.  If you take out the words &ldquo;if he is satisfied,&rdquo; if a person feels that there has been a gross injustice he can go before a court to prove that he did not commit the offence.</P>

    <P>I raised this matter on the Committee Stage.  It does not seem to be desirable <Col N="653" /> to set up under this Bill separate machinery for the Governmental financing of private enterprise.  At present there are elaborate checks and safeguards in relation to trade loan guarantees and money lent by the Government for similar purposes.  Independent committees examine the applications.  It does not seem to be desirable to leave this matter entirely to the Minister for Agriculture, acting in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  It is necessary that all this lending of public money should be under strict safeguard.  We know that there has been a great deal of loss in the past.  There has been a tightening up by legislation, but it remains to be seen how tight the new control will prove in effect.  Having set up the machinery to provide these safeguards.

      <P>I do not suppose Senator Sir John Keane is insisting very strongly on his amendment.  He has not put forward any sustained argument in support of it.  I take it that the reason there is a special code provided in this case is because of the nature of the work to be done.  In the first place, this is a temporary measure.  In the second place, part of the work for which money will require to be advanced will be the slaughter of old and diseased cows, so as to ease the situation in regard to cattle.  That is, of its nature, temporary.  The next thing proposed to be done is the tinning of meat.  It is hoped, I am sure, that that will be <Col N="654" /> permanent.  In any event, all the plans under this Bill are intended to reduce the number of surplus cattle, so that the farmer may get better prices. Speaking generally, the proposals in the Bill are, more or less, temporary in their nature.  When one is starting a business, the first question one asks oneself is: &ldquo;Is this to be a permanency?&rdquo; If it is to be only a temporary business, one is not inclined to invest money in it.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation and bodies of that kind would not, I think, be inclined to lend money in respect of an enterprise which, it is hoped, will come to an end in two or three years or, perhaps, in a year's time.  That is, so far as converting old and diseased cows into meat-meal is concerned.  I suggest that the financing of these schemes is on a different plane altogether from the financing of advances to farmers for ordinary agricultural purposes of a permanent character.  I believe that a special code is necessary in this case. This matter was considered on an earlier stage of this Bill and I thought that the reasons given for this section were accepted by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>If Senator Sir John Keane had brought forward a substitute for Section 37, I could see some sense in his moving this amendment and I might support him in his action. However, as this section is so vital to the other clauses of the Bill, I do not think that the Seanad would be acting wisely in deleting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was listening to Senator Comyn and he has stated quite clearly what is really the reason for Senator Sir John Keane's amendment. None of the banks or any businesses which have to do with the lending of money will lend money on this, because it lasts such a short time that any money invested in it is going to be lost.  That is as clear as daylight. This is another extra expense which will be incurred in order to carry out the Government's policy.  We have absolutely no figures in regard to our commitments.  The expenditure is not going to be examined by anybody. The Minister or somebody under his auspices will establish an industry for the manufactures which are described <Col N="655" /> in this Bill.  So far as our experience of this kind of manufacture is concerned, this business of buying cattle, putting them through a manufacturing process and selling the products, we are aware that in this country they have all lost a lot of money.  I do not know of any such factory at the moment that is making money.  All the money put into the Drogheda factory and other such places has been lost.</P>
      <P>What Senator Sir John Keane wants to draw attention to is that you are giving the Minister power to take State money and finance a business to which no financial institution would lend money.  That means, of course, that it is going to be lost.  I thought the Minister would have liked some corporation to consider the matter or that he would have got someone connected with finance who would estimate how much money was going to be lost in this undertaking, someone who would carry on with a Government guarantee. If they want to expend money they could do it by way of guarantee to some such institution or person and then they could feel assured that they had someone who would take an interest in the business and estimate its probabilities from the financial standpoint.  Of course the Minister merely wants to get rid of these cattle and everything connected with the cattle from hoof to horn.  He is anxious to establish a business and lend State money.  There is not a human being in the Free State who does not know that that money is going to be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be better for the Minister that it should be a matter of a Government guarantee to some financial institution which would have some sort of check.  It would be better for him to have somebody's opinion as to how much money it is going to cost.  Who knows what this will cost the State? Every penny is going to be lost.  There is no record going to be kept.  If the Government had some banking institution or somebody to look after the matter for them, we would know the extent of our commitments, but as it is we will know nothing.  It would be wiser for the Minister to arrange for <Col N="656" /> a Government guarantee.  I would like to hear what he has to say about it. Has he got any limit to the amount of money he is going to spend, or is he going to take up every one of these industries, large and small, lend them State money and then see them go west?  I think that is what is going to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage I tried to explain that no other body would lend money to this undertaking on the ordinary form of security because it will not in the ordinary way be good enterprise.  It will depend entirely on the supply of cattle at a reduced price.  If we take this factory at Roscrea, it cannot convert cows into meat meal unless the cows are supplied to them at a very much lower cost even than they are being sold at present.  Suppose they go to the Trade Loans people, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Industrial Credit Corporation or any bank and say that they have made a very good bargain with the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;that they are going to get so many old cows at such a price&mdash;I do not think any of those people would lend money on that guarantee because they would be afraid conditions might change and cattle might get dear again. Also, with regard to the repayment of loans, they are bound up more or less with the other part of the bargain in relation to the number of cattle that can be supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances the Minister for Agriculture is in a much better position to make a loan and see that it is repaid, because he has a fair amount of control over those matters. He has every security when he is lending the money, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation would not have the same security at all.  They would have only the ordinary security of a lien on the assets of the company. I am afraid we would not get the industry going unless the Minister had that power.  Senator Jameson speaks of our commitments.  I know in fair detail what our commitments will be in the factory at Roscrea.  We would be lending to that factory something less than £20,000, repayable over four years.  Under a subsequent proposal <Col N="657" /> the Minister must publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a notice in regard to the loan, setting out all the particulars, such as the amount of the loan, the terms of repayment, the person to whom the money was given and so on.  At the moment I cannot foresee that there would be more than £60,000 lent under this section.  I may be wrong in that; there may be something else cropping up, but that is my opinion at the moment.</P>

      <P>I suggest that any arguments that have been made here, sustained or otherwise, have been entirely in favour of the amendment. Most certainly if the business is to be of a purely temporary character money should not be lent, because permanence of business is the very essence underlying the granting of money.  The only recommendation I can see in the section is that this thing is permissive and the Minister need not do it.  The whole thing is thoroughly confusing and I feel very apprehensive that the Government should contemplate this at all.  When Senator Counihan asked for an alternative, my reply is &ldquo;It is there.&rdquo;  You have all the machinery in existence for lending money with guarantees to approved enterprises. My idea is that if Government money is to be spent, and if these enterprises are to be subsidised by the taxpayers, every precaution should be taken. There is no suggestion here that every precaution is to be taken.  The position is as loose as it could be, and that being so I ask for the feeling of the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the necessity for inserting a similar amendment in another position in the same section. The amendment provides that whenever the Minister lends money under this section he shall publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a notice stating the fact and all material particulars of such loan.  But in sub-section (5) the Minister gets power to vary the terms and conditions under which the money was so lent.  I think it is desirable, if there is to be a variation, that the new arrangement should also be published in the same manner as the terms of the original loan.  Otherwise the whole thing is nullified if there is so drastic a change made as to alter the terms which have been published.  Perhaps the Minister will do that when dealing with this amendment in the Dáil.</P>

Now, the difficulty is that in Dublin about 10,000 people will be concerned, and the writing of names and addresses of all these people would be a very laborious task.  The Department concerned with the administration of this part of the Act would like to have that paragraph (a) omitted, and instead, to have inserted after the word &ldquo;obtained&rdquo; the words &ldquo;by means of such voucher&rdquo;.  It is really asking to withdraw the condition that the name and address must be on each voucher.  The new amendment reads:</P>

I think the name and address of the persons written on the voucher would be a considerable safeguard, and would prevent a development of that kind, which would be very serious.

      <P>I would like to raise a small point at this stage.  A number of enterprising people rather tried to anticipate this Bill by developing the canning industry.  These people, who are all business people, will, in effect, lose their money, as their efforts will be nullified by this Bill.  Has the Minister taken into consideration the position of those people, and does he intend to provide them with some of the plums that should be given to people who certainly went a long way and made a big effort to develop this canning industry?  It is very likely now that some big combine will have a monopoly, and that these people will not be able to compete.  I think, in the circumstances, they are entitled to some consideration in the matter.  I wonder have any representations been made to the Minister on this subject and has he given consideration to the claims of those people?</P>

I discussed with them whether they would like to co-operate in the business or prefer to get out under certain conditions. But there will be no such thing as compulsion.  That is not our intention unless they prove entirely unreasonable. So far, we have treated them in a friendly way, and I think we are likely to conclude with them on friendly terms.</P>

      <P>This amendment was drafted to meet the point raised by Senator Staines on Committee Stage.  Section 28 gives the Minister power to make regulations in relation to certain matters, and the effect of this amendment will be that the Minister may, by order, make regulations in relation to the making, by holders of rehandlers' licences, of payments on account for tobacco purchased by them from growers or curers.  I think that it is the only way it could be dealt with, because to try to deal with it in any hard and fast way, such as on a 50 per cent. or a 66 per cent. basis, would be impossible.  With a little experience, however, we may be able to make regulations in accordance with the wishes of the Seanad.  This year a number of rehandlers are making offers of a certain advance of cash, and I think it would amount to more than 50 per cent. all round.</P>

      <P>I just wish to ask the Minister to consider the matter of the price.  I have had a great deal of correspondence with tobacco growers and I think I might use it in order to call attention to this matter before the Bill becomes law.  These letters are from tobacco growers who are very dissatisfied with the prices offered by the Government.  With your permission, Sir, I should like to read for the House a resolution passed at a meeting of tobacco growers representative of the Counties of Waterford, Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Leix and Wicklow.  The resolution reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That this meeting of tobacco growers ... hereby respectfully request the Government to reconsider the question of the price to be paid for the 1934 crop.  We consider it inadequate for the following reasons:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The price is based on last year's crop and extremely favourable year.</P>
      <P>(2)  This year's crop, being stunted in June and July by the severe drought, is at least one-third less in yield than last year's crop.</P>
      <P>(3)  The storm and gale of last Sunday night&mdash;</P>
      <P>this was about three weeks ago&mdash;</P>
      <P>and Monday has done irreparable damage to all our crops, some of which are completely lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons the price stated in your Tobacco Bill is entirely inadequate <Col N="668" /> and will militate seriously against a new industry which should be fostered and supported.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have an extract here also from a newspaper.  It refers to tobacco growing in England.  The extract is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;English soil is not ideal for tobacco growing, but surprisingly good results have been obtained from it none the less.  A successful grower is Mr. A.J. Brandon, of Church Crookham, Hampshire, who has been engaged on the work for a number of years.  At present he has six acres under cultivation and expects a result of from 700 to 800 lbs. an acre.  He gives it as his opinion that the price paid there would not repay the cost of cultivation and he urges the Government to remit the duty on home-grown tobacco or a portion of it, pointing out that if this were done some thousands of acres which have gone out of cultivation could be profitably planted again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Irish tobacco growers also ask that the Government should remit the duty or enough of it to make the crop pay, otherwise they are afraid that they cannot continue to cultivate the crop at all.  They say that the average crop here was also about 800 lbs. an acre and that it will be at least one-third less.  They also say that the cost of growing which was given in the Dáil was not accurate. The figure given in the Dáil was £32 and they maintain that it costs considerably more than £32 an acre to grow tobacco.  They consider that a price of less than 2/6 would not pay them and that they would not be able to grow tobacco at that price.  The opinions I have given are the opinions of practical tobacco growers.  Some of them have been pioneer tobacco growers in Ireland&mdash;people who have taken every opportunity to foster the growing of tobacco.  They are not new-comers into the business of growing tobacco.  They are not people who have rushed in with enthusiasm, who know nothing about it.  They are people of experience and these are their considered opinions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Miss Browne and others who are interested in this matter of tobacco growing and who have the interest of the farmers at heart ought really to be thankful to the Government for introducing a Bill of this kind which ensures to the growers a minimum price.  There is a tobacco growing industry amongst Canadian agriculturists and a recent inquiry has been held by the Ministry under the chairmanship of the Conservative Minister for Trade and Commerce in the Federal Government.  I propose to read just an extract or two from his report dealing with the tobacco industry.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The tobacco industry in Canada has passed into the control of one big institution which takes 80 per cent. of all production.  The Imperial Tobacco Company had a total cash investment of 14,000,000 dollars. To-day it is worth 100,000,000 dollars. In 1930, they paid 33 cents a pound for flue-cured tobacco.  In 1931, they brought a man up from the United States and they cut down the rates they paid the grower from 33 cents to 19 cents.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He goes on to explain that the normal time of opening the market was about the 6th October but that they held off until the 26th October, and as they had practically control of the market, the growers were waiting, as he says, &ldquo;sweating for a solid month, with their tobacco hanging in kilns, waiting for someone to come and buy, waiting for the market to open up. They had paid out their wages, they had gone into debt for fertiliser and implements.  They were hard pressed by their creditors.  The market got so panicky that they sold their tobacco for 16 or 17 cents, and,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;last year they had a similar result.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on to say that notwithstanding that experience it was the same the following year, and he blames this upon the Imperial Tobacco Company because they were the chief buyers in the market and were able to control the price.  I do not know whether the Canadian industry would be prepared to take a leaf out of the book of the Free State Government that is now <Col N="670" /> introducing this Bill, but I am quite sure that the Canadian farmers would be very glad if the Canadian Government would come along with a Bill, couched somewhat in the terms of this Bill, which would ensure at least a price not dependent upon the desire of the Imperial Tobacco Company to get the raw material at the lowest price they thought it possible to be grown.  The illustration is interesting because it shows that the tobacco industry, which is quite considerable in that country, has become one dependent upon a big buying organisation where there was no State intervention to protect the grower.  In our case the business is in the experimental stages, but through this Bill the State is coming forward to protect the grower against the machinations of any powerful company.  I think that the farmers here ought to be reassured at least that there is somebody to look after their interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Bill was debated on Second Reading and in Committee certain statements have appeared in the public Press which give ground for alarm.  I suggest it is desirable that they should be brought to the notice of the Minister with a view to having an official explanation.  The House will remember that the Shannon Scheme was undertaken after an exhaustive inquiry by experts.  Those experts gave, <Col N="672" /> as their considered opinion, on page 97 of their report, that: &ldquo;About 153,000,000 k.w.h. per year at the transmission busbars of the power station, which output is in accordance with the curve of requirements estimated by the experts.  This quantity will be available even during a dry year.&rdquo;  That was the essential data on which the whole scheme was undertaken.  Well we have had two dry years.  In the year 1933 the water generation only produced 143,000,000 units.  The balance had to be supplied by steam.  These figures have appeared in the public Press.  The Minister, of course, may say that they are incorrect.  I am assuming for the moment, as the basis of my argument, that they are correct.  In the year 1934 water power supplied 103,000,000 units and steam 82,000,000 units.  These figures certainly give ground for serious alarm.  What is done is done. It may be remedied but it cannot be undone.  Now we are being asked to spend further moneys on the development of the Shannon.  The same experts have been called in and, presumably, it is on their report that this is being done.  We have not seen their report.  We do not know what explanation they have to offer with regard to what appears to be their original and erroneous calculations. The whole position now appears to be one that calls for the exercise of their responsibilities by members of the House and for very serious consideration indeed as to whether we are right, merely on the representations of the Supply Board, in assenting to the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, presumably, is based on the experts' report and is vouched for by the Minister.  I feel very strongly on this.  I have no expert knowledge. As an original critic of the scheme I do not wish in any way to take credit for the alarm that I then felt, but it appears now that my alarm then has been fully justified.  Apart altogether from the financial grounds, which were the main grounds on which my earlier criticisms were based, on purely technical grounds there has been a very serious miscalculation. Now, without inquiry, or at any rate <Col N="673" /> without revealed inquiry, we are asked to spend further moneys on the Shannon scheme while we are not in a position to consider whether it would not be better to let that scheme remain as it is and to spend money on other sources of water supply, the Liffey or some other.</P>
    <P>On this general question I want to ask the Minister to give us certain essential figures: what is the cost of generation by water as against that by coal.  I have searched the reports of the Electricity Supply Board to see if these figures are available, but I could not find them.  One would like to know the costs under essential headings, especially distinguishing between direct costs and overheads.  One would imagine, of course, that in the case of water supply the overheads must be much higher because of the very heavy capital charges that have to be carried, and that the direct charges should be lower.  In the case of steam it should be the other way about: that the direct charges would be higher and the overhead charges less.  I feel that we have a right to know what these costs are.  We are faced with this serious miscalculation&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;with regard to the generating power of the Shannon.  I think that we are entitled to have those figures even at this the last moment and not allow this Bill to pass but that it should be sent back to the Government for further investigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to make the position clear on another aspect of this publicity to which Senator Sir John Keane has referred.  Whether it is the same publication or not, I am not sure, but I have before me an extract from the <i>Sunday Times</i> which is headed: &ldquo;Free State Electricity Surprise&rdquo;; &ldquo;Shannon's Smaller Supply&rdquo;; &ldquo;Increased Use of Coal&rdquo;; &ldquo;Five Million Pounds Project Costs Ten Million Pounds.&rdquo; Those are the headings, and the second paragraph reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The scheme as originally envisaged promised electricity supplies to the whole of the Free State at a stated outlay of £5,200,000.  Actually to date more than £10,000,000 has been expended on it&mdash;all out of the <Col N="674" /> taxpayer's pocket&mdash;and at least £1,000,000 and possibly £3,000,000 further expenditure is contemplated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed that the £5,200,000 that was envisaged was in regard to the constructional side of this scheme and the interest accruing until it began working.  The juxtaposition of £5,200,000 and £10,000,000 is certainly misleading because the extra votes have not had to do at all with the constructional side of the scheme&mdash;at least, not all of them although some of them perhaps have.  There is, however, the further point that it says that all this £10,000,000 has been expended out of the taxpayer's pocket.  Again, I think that is misleading.  It would imply that this sum of £10,000,000 has been paid out of revenue.  I wish it had, but it has actually been paid out of loans and to say that that is out of the taxpayer's pocket is to my mind very misleading and more or less justifies the sub-editors of this journal putting this heading &ldquo;£5,000,000 Project Costs £10,000,000.&rdquo;  I think the Minister ought to take the opportunity to make whatever correction he thinks is necessary of that statement.</P>

      <P>Apparently, last year it produced 143,000,000 kilowatts, if I understand it rightly.  What it comes back to, from our point of view, is what the ordinary expenses, including certainly interest but scarcely sinking fund, and the actual running costs, are and what is the revenue produced. <Col N="676" /> That ought to be a very simple figure that could be got without, I think, very much trouble, and I think we ought to know that.  Furthermore, is it now intended to go on with the further scheme on the Liffey, and what number of extra kilowatts will the expenditure we are asked to sanction to-day produce, and what will be the running costs of producing them?</P>

      <P>I am rather surprised at the statement made by Senator Jameson.  I think it is very desirable that it should be corrected forthwith so that any person who may be under the same misapprehensions as to the position as he is should be put right. The taxpayer has provided no money whatever for the electricity supply scheme.  It is not even correct to say that the State is in the position of a shareholder in the scheme.  The State is in theory, according to the terms of the Electricity Supply Acts, in the position of a person who lent money at interest to enable the electricity supply scheme to be undertaken, requiring not merely the payment of interest as it falls due upon the money lent but also the repayment of the amount lent in due course.  A shareholder in a commercial undertaking provides the capital and is satisfied with the payment of interest upon his shares according to the profits earned. He does not demand back the capital in addition to the interest within a specified period.  The State is asking, not merely interest from the Electricity Supply Board on the money advanced to it, but also the repayment of the advances.  The repayment of the advances has not commenced but the Board is paying interest upon those advances at the rate of 5½ per cent.  The rate of interest is high and it has, in fact, been argued, in the Dáil and in this House, that the rate of interest charged on these advances to the board is too high.  I announced, during the discussions upon earlier stages of this Bill, that a reduction in the rate of interest was likely to be made in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jameson said that he had not seen it stated that the Electricity Supply Board was paying interest on these advances but in the published <Col N="677" /> accounts of the Board for the year ending 31st March, 1933, the profit and loss account indicates that there was paid to the Exchequer in respect of interest on advances that year the sum of £494,861.  I think Senator Johnson also did good service in drawing attention to the statement, which was obviously considered of sufficient importance to justify a sub-title to the article which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on Sunday last, to the effect that the Shannon scheme, which was estimated to cost £5,000,000, has, in fact, cost £10,000,000, and that the taxpayers have had to provide the difference.  I have already made it clear that the taxpayers have had to provide nothing, but even the statement that the scheme, which was estimated to cost £5,000,000, has cost £10,000,000, is altogether and completely incorrect.  The amount advanced to the 31st of March, 1933, to the Shannon Power Development Fund for the Shannon scheme was £5,815,000. Included in that sum were certain advances in respect of additional works not contemplated when the scheme was being inaugurated, works which were provided for in a Bill which passed the Oireachtas in 1931.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Shannon works did cost a certain amount more than was originally estimated.  But the amount which they cost did not exceed the percentage which was allowed for when the original estimates were being prepared.  It is not always possible in respect of large works to estimate to within a penny of the cost.  Prudent persons always will allow a percentage, 5 per cent. or 10 per cent., for extras and these excess costs in the case of the Shannon scheme were within the 5 per cent. originally provided for when the works were being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The capital advances to the Electricity Supply Board amount to more than £10,000,000, but that capital was not all advanced for the purpose of constructing the works on the Shannon.  The capital was advanced to enable the Electricity Supply Board to carry out its functions as a distributor of electricity, also as a provider of electrical installations and as <Col N="678" /> a trader in electrical equipment.  The Electricity Supply Board had, in fact, utilised a very substantial amount of the capital advanced to it in financing a system of selling equipment on the hire purchase system.</P>
    <P>Senators are aware that the original scheme upon which the Shannon works were undertaken was departed from while, in fact, the works were in course of construction.  It was originally intended that the Shannon scheme would produce electricity for sale wholesale to electrical undertakers in the various towns throughout the country.  Subsequently, it was decided that the whole business of producing and distributing electricity should be nationalised and the Electricity Supply Board was brought into existence to take over either free of charge or payment of a sum in compensation, all or nearly all the existing generating stations in the country.  They proceeded to carry out functions in relation to the distribution and sale of electricity which it was not contemplated would be done by those in charge of the Shannon works.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane was good enough to indicate to me that he was to refer to this article in the <i>Sunday Times.</i>  The <i>Sunday Times</i> article was obviously written by somebody who had access to the figures.  He got those figures accurately enough but did not understand some of them.  He proceeded to write his article, leaving out of account the most essential fact relating to the Electricity Supply Scheme last year.  Senator Sir John Keane is quite right when he says that when the experts prepared their estimates these estimates were designed to produce a minimum of 150,000,000 units per year, and that this estimate was based on the lowest rainfall which had, in fact, occurred during the previous 30 years.</P>
    <P>Whether the Government which undertook to embark upon the Shannon works were wise in doing so, knowing that the works were planned upon the basis that they would be economic in any year in which the rainfall was as low as the lowest of the previous 30 years, is something that I <Col N="679" /> am not prepared to say.  The fact is that last year we had an unprecedented drought.  The rainfall last year was lower than the lowest in any recorded year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The year before was below the estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was unprecedentedly low.  Last year was below the lowest year of which we have any record.  Last year we had an unprecedentedly low rainfall.  For the first six months of the year 1932 the rainfall was lower than that of last year for the same period, but in 1932 rain came at the right time.  Those operating the scheme always estimated that the rain was to come during the months of September, October and November. The peculiarity of last year was that the rains did not come in September and October, and up to November last year there was an unprecedented drought.  The situation was critical in so far as the Electricity Supply Board's stand-by plant was not at that time sufficient to make good the deficiency in the output from Ardnacrusha; it would not if rain fortunately had not come at the time when it looked as if a serious situation was to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The early months of this year were also unprecedentedly dry, but fortunately the rain has come and it is not expected that any difficulty will arise this year.  The answer to Sir John Keane is that whereas it is quite true that the Shannon works were planned by persons who had estimated that the lowest rainfall we were likely to experience in this country would be the lowest in the 30 years previous to the time, they made their estimate.  Since they have commenced to operate there has been one year in which the rainfall was substantially lower than the lowest rainfall previously recorded at any time, and that was last year.  It is because of that unprecedented drought that the Shannon works were unable to produce the minimum of 150,000,000 units that were always contemplated. The steam station had to be brought into commission and kept in commission for a great part of the year.  Of the total number of units <Col N="680" /> generated, 80,000,000 units were produced by steam.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane says we are now asked to spend further moneys upon the Shannon works.  I want to make it clear that these storage works have no relation to the drought of last year.  These storage works would be undertaken whether there had been a drought last year or not.  These are highly essential works which will prove remunerative to the Electricity Supply Board.  I explained already the position with regard to the difference between the economic cost of producing electricity as a result of these storage works and the cost of producing electricity by steam.  I explained why, in fact, we were providing in the Bill for the making of a grant as against an advance.  But I have also explained that in so far as a reduction in the rate of interest is to be expected, the actual cost of the works and the economic value of the works will coincide and the Board will be able to sell the 14,000,000 units which will result from these storage works at a price to meet the interest and sinking fund on the charges which will fall upon it because of these advances.  These works would be undertaken no matter what the rainfall experience of the Board had been as an essential part of the development of the Shannon works and in order to enable it to meet the growing demands for electricity that is taking place here.</P>
    <P>In consequence of the Board's experience in the last year, the only additional capital charge that would fall on it would arise out of the necessity of enlarging upon its stand-by plant.  Its stand-by plant was based upon previous rainfall experience.  That rainfall experience has now been added to, in so far as we have had an exceptionally dry year and consequently the Board's stand-by plant will have to be enlarged so as to enable it to produce a larger number of units when required, but, in fact, the construction of these storage works, in so far as they will make a greater volume of water available and make the supply of water more secure, will reduce rather than increase the necessity for using steam plant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> Senator Sir John Keane asked to be told the cost per unit generated at Ardnacrusha and the cost per unit generated at the Pigeon House.  I regret that I am not able to give him those figures in the form in which he wants them.  I can give the direct cost of producing a unit of electricity at Ardnacrusha and at the Pigeon House, but the final analysis of the Shannon works costs have not yet been made, and, as the Senator quite rightly stated, by far the greater part of the cost per unit generated at Ardnacrusha is represented by the capital charges, whereas the greater part of the cost per unit generated at the Pigeon House represents charges other than capital charges.  The direct cost per unit generated at Ardnacrusha is 0264 of a penny, while the direct cost per unit generated at the Pigeon House is .3835 of a penny.  I expect it will be <Col N="682" /> possible to get the final analysis of the Shannon works effected and communicated to the Board at quite an early date, in which case it is possible that the Board may be able to embody in its next report the information which Senator Sir John Keane desires.</P>
