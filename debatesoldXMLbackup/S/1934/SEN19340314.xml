    <P>That the National Teachers' Superannuation Scheme, 1934, made by the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928 (No. 32 of 1928) be confirmed&mdash;(Minister for Lands and Fisheries).</P>

      <P>Since this settlement reached the ears of the teachers of Ireland I can say that seldom has any pronouncement been heard of with, as I may describe it, such consternation and disappointment: consternation by reason of the drastic changes which it makes in the future outlook of educational matters in this country.  An attack upon the moneys devoted to the educational purposes of 90 per cent. of the people of Ireland is undoubtedly not an attack upon the individuals who carry out that important duty but an attack upon 90 per cent. of the people of the Free State.  That is surely what it is.  President Roosevelt, who has undertaken work of a character that is unequalled in the history of the world and who, I am glad to say, seems to be on the highroad to success, did one thing in his plan of re-organisation of the economic <Col N="518" /> condition of his country.  It was, that while every other branch of national service was investigated and re-organised, and in some cases made to contribute very largely to the financial support of the various plans which he adopted for the revival of his country, one service he deliberately omitted: that was the service of education. Law, medicine, banks, combines, every other section of the community was called upon to contribute in great measure to the success of his plan, but he skilfully and wisely for the nation, for its future, for the hopes that he entertains of making it a great nation, refrained from touching educational services or matters relating to public welfare: mothers and children, and other matters upon which the nation builds and lays its foundations.  Those two services he deliberately excluded.  He did not ask them to give any part towards the reconstruction of his country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we have a Government here that is making efforts, perhaps in a comparatively small way compared with the work that the President of the United States has undertaken, to reconstruct our country.  Those efforts, I hope, are succeeding, and will meet with success, but if they meet with success at the cost of encroaching on the educational rights of 90 per cent. of the people of Ireland, then I certainly say that the Government are building on a wrong foundation.  The higher schools and the colleges are well provided for, but only a very small percentage of the plain people ever have the privilege of reaching those centres of education.  I may say that some of the very best material that reaches these centres of education, that reaches the secondary schools, comes from the national schools of the country.  They, with their meagre resources, with their staffs harassed as they have been since the days of the hedge schoolmaster ceased&mdash;harassed and attacked at every attempt that they make towards the end of securing for the child of the plain people that which everybody must acknowledge is its right, a decent system of education conducted under decent conditions&mdash;have produced results, notwithstanding some criticisms <Col N="519" /> to the contrary, which have been remarkable for this nation.  The best authorities who have made pronouncements on this matter, who have travelled through Continental countries and in America will bear witness, and have borne witness, to the fact that the education carried on in this country and its results have been unequalled in soundness, thoroughness, in laying the foundations of good citizenship as well as a true national outlook.  All the best authorities who have spoken on the matter have borne testimony to that.</P>
    <P>A struggle that went on for fifty years with the British secured a modicum of justice for those engaged in the teaching profession.  When education is attacked the most effective method of damning its progress is to make an attack on the conditions of life of those who have charge of carrying out the work of instruction throughout the country.  Now I am not exaggerating the picture.  If the public did realise the actual position of those engaged in educational work, the position with regard to salaries and with regard to the various costs which are imposed upon them personally in the carrying out of education, then the plain people and those who send their children to the national schools would wake up and undoubtedly take measures to condemn the injustice that is being perpetrated in that direction.  It is all very fine to say that the teachers are wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice, if you like, but anybody who goes carefully into the figures of the salaries of individual teachers will find that such exaggeration is far from the truth.</P>
    <P>The pension fund and its origin were dealt with very thoroughly by the Minister in his statement last week. He did, however, make a few statements that caused a gasp of surprise and wonderment on the part of some of his listeners.  The Minister stated what teachers' salaries were from 1914 to 1920, and then went on to say that the scales of salary under the 1920 agreement were £170 to £460 in the case of men.  That was quite correct but with with great qualifications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> The Minister did not tell us how many men engaged in the work of teaching had a salary of £460, or ever hoped to reach anything like that figure.  Only those specially favoured, who are in charge of very large schools, and with an efficient staff, need ever hope to reach that figure. Possibly, at the moment, the numbers would not be perhaps 10 to 20 per cent. of the teachers that could ever reach anything near that amount.  If we include the lower-paid grades, junior assistant mistresses, the average salary of teachers before the present reduction would be £250.  Surely no one will say that £250 is too high for those conducting teaching services. On the £250 there are many calls in connection with the discharge of a teacher's duties.  In every other public service the employee enters an office which is suitably prepared, where everything necessary is provided to carry on the work.  We all know how different it is in the case of a teacher. He has to go to the school before the morning work commences to see that the fires are kindled, that the rooms are dusted and to superintend.  Sometimes he has to do the work of a charwoman, morning and evening in connection with the school.  In many cases, he has to supply materials and maps for the walls, slates, ink, inkwells. Practically nine-tenths of the materials required in the ordinary country school are provided out of the pocket of the teacher.  That is undeniable.  Not a penny worth of chalk is provided.  Stationery, ink, pens, etc. are provided for ordinary civil servants but over 50 per cent. of the cost is provided by the national teacher.  When the £250 average salary that the teacher receives is reduced by 20 per cent., as it will be if this cut is permanently made in the salary, his outlook for the future is not a promising one, and the outlook for the nation that has to provide teachers for the education of its children is indeed very blue.  Such a prospect is not conducive towards bringing in to the profession of teaching anything like the best brains in the country.  I maintain that in the teaching profession conditions should be made so <Col N="521" /> attractive that the very best brains should be prepared to place their services at such very important work. So much in regard to salaries.</P>
    <P>There is not much to be said for the rest of the Bill.  Some portions of it we welcome very much, such as the admission of junior assistant mistresses and lay teachers in other schools.  We are very pleased that that has come about.  We have long agitated for it.  It is but simple justice.  There is nothing to thank any Government for.  It was done by the Northern Government at the change-over and these people were placed at once on the pensions scale, without any increased contribution, such as is being asked in this case, because they were given full credit for services rendered.  The Government here should have made provision for that immediately on the take-over. Instead of that, they were not being taken on this fund for 10 years, with the result that many of these unfortunate people after 40 years' service are, to my own knowledge, now living on the charity of friends or in homes where they can afford to pay a modicum towards their support.  We have nothing to be thankful to the predecessors of this Government for.  They set a very bad headline by attacking the educational services.  It is true that they did make an offer of a pensions scheme, but possibly they were excluding the provisions which the present Government has made for teachers in convent schools.  The offer they made then would be possibly equal to or as good as the offer made now.  The offer made later was unacceptable, the reason for non-acceptance being the promise of the new Government to go much better in the matter of pensions.  These promises were made by prominent members in the new Government.  The settlement offered by their predecessors was largly rejected on the strength of a promise made by the head of the present Government, and by the present Minister for Finance, who was the keenest and the sharpest critic of the offer made by his predecessors.  The Minister made an offer later on. Great numbers of teachers supported <Col N="522" /> the present Government and helped to get them into office, little thinking that when they got there, while their predecessors chastised the teachers with whips, this Government would chastise them with scorpions.</P>

      <P>That is what happened. Notwithstanding all that we have still faith that the methods adopted by our Government are sound methods, and notwithstanding that the scorpion lashes may make themselves felt upon us, I do not think we will squeal over it.  The offer of the Government was rejected.  What is called the June offer, for which I pleaded when the question of salary cuts was up before was also rejected. The teachers could not believe that from a Government professing to be out for the reconstruction of their country, the first service to be attacked would be education, the very service upon which it was hoped to lay the permanent foundation for the future progress of industry.  That is what happened when the salaries of the teachers were attacked.  What has been done?  They have broken their promise, and they are going to make a handsome profit by doing so, as I will show, at the teachers' expense.  In all the negotiations on financial matters and adjustments in regard to this country that took place since the Pension Fund was established in 1879 by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, the fact was borne in mind that the Government was responsible for three-fourths of the Fund, and that the teachers' share was one-fourth.  That was reiterated by Mr. McElligott, Secretary to the Minister for Finance, when the negotiations were carried on with the present and with the previous Government.  Responsibility for the Fund should be borne in mind in any settlement.  That statement was made and embodies the justification of the teachers' claim.  In a nutshell it is a full justification of the teachers' claim that when they have contributed one-fourth of the pension money, it is the duty of the Government to find the other three-fourths.  It has been said <Col N="523" /> that there is no legal obligation placed upon the Government.  I do not know that in a question of this importance legality should be harped upon.  The moral obligation is still there.  If the Government tries to shield itself on the technical legalities of the case, and to say that they are not legally responsible, then I say their moral conscience must be a very easy one. I challenge them to say whether morally they do not feel the pangs of remorse&mdash;I was about to use a stronger word&mdash;in denying responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have neglected or have failed to maintain the solvency of the Fund. That was not the fault of the national teachers.  At the take-over it was pointed out that the Fund was then a bankrupt Fund and that there was a legitimate claim to £7,000,000 from Great Britain.  A responsible firm of actuaries reported to the teachers' organisation that the amount due by Great Britain was £7,000,000.  That was pointed out more than once to the Free State Government but they neglected to take any steps to secure it in the financial settlement that was made.  We say that they made a bad blunder, and we say that in any financial settlement made in future that £7,000,000 should be kept in mind.  Statements made by Ministers are available to vindicate the claim of Ireland to that £7,000,000 for the Teachers' Pension Fund alone.  There are items in the figures which we also challenge.  Since 1923, the teachers' side has increased by £855,000.  I should say that the present position is this, that the stock held on the teachers' side, which we are told cannot possibly be realised, and we have no information as to how the stock is held&mdash;although I daresay the information is available&mdash;amounts to £1,081,550 in stock, and in cash to £306,000.  On the Government or endowment side, is stock value for £277,504 and cash £886,000.  That shows a surplus of over £600,000 on the side of the teachers, which they undertake to maintain, and a deficit on the Government side of £224,000. In regard to the amount of the contribution we say that but for Government <Col N="524" /> neglect that position of affairs should not exist.  The amount of contributions now paid annually by teachers is £102,000.  If the new class, lay assistants and junior assistant mistresses, are taken on the fund on the present contribution basis of 4 per cent. it would represent an increase of £15,000, making a total of £117,000.</P>
    <P>We say that instead of increasing the premiums in the way of imposing cuts in our salaries, we could claim a decrease of the premiums by reason of the surplus that exists on the side of our contributions.  The Government are now asking for an annual contribution from the teachers of roughly £260,000.  For what?  To settle the question of the pension fund, which, through the neglect of successive Governments, has been allowed to fall into this bankrupt state.  They come along and say: &ldquo;We will settle this if you hand over to us annually a contribution of £260,000.&rdquo;  They propose to make a 9 per cent cut on the salaries of teachers and, to put a gloss over the gingerbread, they say it is a non-contributory scheme, so that the ordinary person in the street might say: &ldquo;Is it not lucky for the master, who has a grand pension on a non-contributory basis?&rdquo;  They never reveal the fact that the contribution is taken out of the other pocket of the teacher in the form of a cut, which is the worst method because that cut will likely continue.  That permanent cut of 9 per cent. with the previous cut of 10 per cent, imposed by their noble predecessors in office, makes a total of 19 per cent.  When everything is counted, 25 per cent. of the teacher's salary is filched from him in the interest of economy, in one case, and to settle the pension fund, in the other case.  It is all very well to say that the salaries of other public servants are fixed at reduced rate and that their pension rights are, therefore, taken into account.  We say our case is worse than theirs, that it is worse to impose a cut on the salaries of the teachers than to put it on as a premium which they have to pay to secure their pensions.  That is worse and more insidious because it will have a marked effect on the character of <Col N="525" /> those who will enter the colleges in the future to become national teachers. The Government may say: &ldquo;We can get plenty of people from the Gaeltacht, where they have all the brains.&rdquo; I do not think that they have all the brains in the Gaeltacht.  And how is the Government to be sure that they can get teachers from the Gaeltacht? Are they quite convinced that the present method of training teachers is the best one?  Is that the experience of inspectors who are sending out six months' notices like the leaves in Vallambrosa?  These notices provide that if the teachers do not do better within six months, they will be labelled &ldquo;non-efficient&rdquo; and their salaries possibly withdrawn.  Are they satisfied that at present they are getting the best material for the teaching profession?  Experienced hands will tell you that they are not.  At the end of the training course these young people will find that they have not a vocation for teaching, and they will divert their energy into some other channel.  The teaching vocation is one of the most difficult to cultivate.  Every professor of a training college will tell you that, even under the monitorial system, where the student had five years of teaching at school and had two years training in college, there were many indifferent teachers. How much more difficult must it be for the ordinary boy who has never spent an hour teaching in a national school to understand the psychology of the raw material that comes into his hands in the national school? There is doubt as to whether the Government is obtaining teachers through the right channels.  These continued attacks and this continuous harassing of teachers will so turn young minds away from this occupation that the Government will find it difficult to secure the right material, with consequent reaction upon the whole national structure.</P>
    <P>The Government is settling the pension fund by taking this sum of £260,000.  They are taking over the assets of the pension fund, including £1,400,000, roughly, of the teachers' money.  Our pension fund has gone. We are not sorry for that but we <Col N="526" /> want a <i>quid pro quo.</i>  Opinion may be divided on this matter, but we should, at least, see that we get something tangible, something that will ease the minds of those who propose taking up the work of teaching as regards their future.  There are new classes taken in, of course.  We welcome that.  We have long fought for that but we need not be very thankful for it because it was done by the Northern Government.  There has been a boundary, and a very distinct boundary, between the way the Northern Government have treated their teachers and the way the Southern Government have treated theirs.  Those are the broad facts. It cannot be contended, as the Minister contends, that this offer is better than any previous offer.  Under the previous offers, the pensionable salary of a man retiring next month, after forty years' service, would be maintained. Now, his pensionable salary is reduced to the extent roughly of 20 per cent., 10 per cent. and 9 per cent., so that that man, going out after 40 years' service on a pension of £150 or £180, which might be the maximum, loses about £30 per year. That is what all the promises have brought that unfortunate man.</P>
    <P>The figures are involved and the quotation of all of them would be tiresome.  I have, however, stated the position broadly.  I suggest to the Minister that he should hesitate, even at the eleventh hour, to put this scheme into force.  If some of the people connected with the Finance Office had not exhibited such an amount of pique and irritation the present settlement would not be imposed.  It is an imposed settlement and, if it comes into effect, it will cause great dissatisfaction to those affected and it will be very injurious in its educational effects on the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the close of his statement on the last day we met, the Minister for Education used these words: &ldquo;Taking the new scheme, as a whole, I think I can claim that the benefits provided are definitely more advantageous to the teachers than <Col N="527" /> those which they at present enjoy.&rdquo; Knowing the facts, I, to use a favourite expression of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, &ldquo;listened with considerable astonishment&rdquo; to that statement.  The Minister must think that the teachers are even simpler people than they are if he thinks that they are going to swallow a statement of that kind.  I want to put the facts before the House very briefly and in language that the non-teacher members of the House will understand.  Shorn of all verbiage, the position now is that the teachers are to pay 125 per cent. more by way of contribution towards their pensions than they did previously and they are to receive, in pension, 9 per cent. less. I hope the House will remember that. Their contributions are increased by 125 per cent.&mdash;from 4 per cent to 9 per cent.&mdash;and their pensions in the future are to be 9 per cent. less than they are.  That is in the case of all teachers going out three years from now.  Take the case of a teacher with £300 a year.  Up to the present, he paid £12 per annum towards his pension and, if he had 40 years' service undetermined, he got £150, or half his salary.  Henceforward, he will pay £27, instead of £12, per annum, as contribution towards pension and, after 40 years, he will get a pension of £136 10s. 0d. instead of £150&mdash;in other words, £13 10s. 0d. less than he got when he was paying only £12 per annum towards his pension.  If that is not a distinct and definite disimprovement or worsening of his position, I should like to know what is.  Under the existing arrangement, a teacher who had £100 a year paid £4 out of that towards pension.  He retained £96 but his pension was calculated on the full £100.  Now, he will draw only £91 instead of £96 and his pension will be based on the £91 instead of on the £100.  I hope that is clear.  If it is not correct, I hope the Minister will correct me because I am basing these statements on information supplied by the organisation which acts for the teachers.  I believe it is correct.  In other words, the new proposals are the equivalent of inflicting <Col N="528" /> a 5 per cent. additional cut on salaries and a 9 per cent. cut on pensions.  That is another way of putting it.  Across the Border, the teacher with £300 a year will continue to pay only £12 per annum towards his pension and he will still receive £150 pension after 40 years. In other words, he will pay £15 less per annum towards his pension and he will receive £13 10s. 0d. more when he retires than the teacher here. This is the scheme the Minister refers to as &ldquo;non-contributory.&rdquo;  If the teachers get a few more improvements of that kind, they will be rich beyond the dreams of avarice, as the last speaker mentioned.  I have been associated with a great many superannuation schemes.  Some of them were much larger than that of the national teachers and some were very much smaller, but I never yet heard of a scheme which demanded anything like 9 per cent. from the employees. I have before me an Act governing the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Scheme, which caters for all the salaried grades of that company. This is one of the newest of the Pension Acts, having been passed in 1924.  The rates of contribution range from 2½ per cent. to 3¾ per cent., according to the age limit at which employees enter.  The highest contribution from the employees is 3¾ per cent., the company contributing a like amount.  The pensions provided are on the same basis as those of the teachers &mdash;one-eightieth, multiplied by the number of years service, with a maximum of half salary.  In addition to what the teachers get, a lump sum is provided, with a maximum of one and a half year's salary on retiral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first actuarial valuation has taken place and no deficiency has been discovered.  If there is a deficiency the company have agreed to make it good, but they are not a company that are inclined to allow such a thing with their large commitments and, so far, at any rate, no deficiency has been discovered.  A scheme brought into operation later, an almost equally big scheme, gives exactly the same benefits but the rate of contribution is one half per cent. higher.  Thus you <Col N="529" /> have 3¾ per cent. and 4¼ per cent. as the highest from one side.</P>
    <P>If you double that, you still do not get 9 per cent., which the Government seeks to get from the teachers.  The general ownership of this fund, and the contributory character of this fund are recognised by the fact that they are managed by a joint committee composed of an equal number of representatives of the employers and the staff.  The teachers have to subscribe 9 per cent. of their salary and they are not to have one iota to say in regard to the administration of the fund, or the manner in which payments are to be made.  Then there is the consideration that no option was allowed to the teachers operating under the old arrangement.  In connection with any new fund I ever had anything to do with, the members of the old fund were given the option of remaining in the old fund and retaining the old conditions.  A contract has been made with the teachers in respect to the old pensions fund and they have not been given an option to remain in under that contract, and a new contract is superimposed upon them.  Then the amount necessary for pensions, in the future, has to be obtained through a medium of a Vote of Supply.  It is open, therefore, to any member of the Dáil to move a reduction of the Vote, and if this motion is carried that amount perhaps would be reduced, as in the case of any other Vote of Supply.  Surely where there is a contract for the fulfilment of which one side subscribes 9 per cent. of their income, the fulfilment of that contract should not be left to the mercy of a snatched vote in any Parliament. That is the position in respect of this particular pension fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes a lot of credit to himself for having brought in lay assistants in convents and monastery schools, and junior assistant mistresses. He is claiming credit for doing what has been done in what is popularly supposed to be a very reactionary Government on the other side of the Border shortly after they came into office.  What is more, the junior assistant mistresses and all this new class there are only now paying 4 per <Col N="530" /> cent., while in the conditions of the fund here they have to pay 6 per cent. The remaining body of teachers are not asked to subscribe any additional contribution: they still pay 4 per cent., as against 9 per cent. here, and they get higher pensions as a result.  When we talk of generosity towards the workers and special benefits we have here very distinct disadvantage to the workers on this side of the Border as compared with those north of it.</P>
    <P>The delay in bringing the lay assistants and junior assistant mistresses in has, unfortunately, imposed a very great grievance and hardship on a certain class.  I understand a few retired during the last couple of years and even within the present year, I think, a certain number of those grades with 40 or more years' service retired and they are to be deprived of a pension.  Had they remained in the service until now they would be admitted to the fund and would get credit for pension purposes for two-thirds of their school service.  The delay in bringing this into operation was not their fault.  It is not altogether the fault of the present Government either; their predecessors have also to be blamed in that respect.  I appeal to the Minister to see if something could not be done towards taking into consideration the case of those people retired within the last couple of years. Their rates of pay rendered them the least able to make provision for their old age.  The number of persons affected is small and the amount necessary to give them some relief, such as they would get if they had remained in the service until this scheme was brought into operation, would be a comparatively small sum.  When so much additional money has been taken from those who remained in the service, I think the Minister could, without showing any great generosity at all, do something for those people who have been so very badly treated in the past.</P>
    <P>Regarding the general finances of the scheme, there seems to be any amount of confusion.  According to the statement made by the National Teachers' Organisation, which has not been contradicted, and which certainly I am <Col N="531" /> not going to doubt until I see it authoritatively contradicted&mdash;the teachers will, in the future, be subscribing upwards of 75 per cent. of the total pensions paid out.  The Government claim that the Pensions Vote next year will be £370,000.  The teachers say that beyond all doubt they have subscribed £260,000 as their contribution, and the £60,000 interest on their accumulated funds amounts to no less than £320,000 out of that amount.  In other words, the Government will only have to find £50,000 instead of £75,000 they gave to the fund.  I say that would be a saying if this statement is correct, and it has not been contradicted, of £25,000 by the Government instead of making an additional payment as the Minister claims.  If these figures are not correct let the Minister correct them and say what the figures are.</P>

      <P>Would the Senator tell the Seanad whether these figures, which I think are inaccurate, are supposed to apply to 1934 or 1932, because even in these two years a considerable change was made owing to the fact that the fund has not been solvent and the deficiency has increased to a much greater extent now than in 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures are for the next year, according to the statement. I point out to the Minister that the teachers' side of the fund has not been depreciating, but, on the contrary, has been increasing.  When the original increase of salaries was decided upon surely the Government of the day must have known that would involve increased pensions in the course of time, and that it was an obvious corollary when there was an increase of salaries that there would be an increase of pensions, and that provision should have been made as a result.  The late Government failed, and the present Government failed to do that.  In fact, they absolutely failed to fulfil their portion of the contract as far as pensions are concerned.  They now come along to the teachers and want to make them believe that deficiencies which occurred on their side must be <Col N="532" /> shared by those on the teachers' side where there never used to be a deficiency.  At any rate, the teachers will be subscribing £260,000 in the coming year, and there is £60,000 interest on their investments which will bring the amount up to £320,000, so that the Minister's own figures show that he will be only finding £50,000 instead of £75,000 for the fund.  Any sacrifice there, is at the expense of the teachers.  But that may be just what the teachers deserved.  It may, in fact, be too generous for them, but what I do not want to let pass is the attempt made to put it across the House that the Government are conferring a benefit upon teachers.  There is no benefit.  Something of what they possessed is being taken from them in a permanent way.  The scheme that we have before us does not deal with the rate of contribution, but it does deal with the general rules of the fund, the method by which pensions are being paid, and generally with the old Government administration.  There may not be a lot of change in this respect, but there have been changes, and changes of an important character. Many of these will be of great importance in the future, and for that reason I think it is definitely unfortunate that no serious discussion regarding the framework of the scheme seems to have taken place between the Minister and the teachers who are involved and whose money is at stake.  In any scheme of this kind that I have had any dealings with, there have been long discussions with regard to details and before a Bill was submitted to Parliament agreements were reached in all respects.  Here the teachers, who subscribe the lion's share of the money, so far as one can see, have not had one word to say as to the details of the law under which this money is to be administered. That may involve hardship and injustice in the future.  I do not know who is responsible, but in my opinion the Minister responsible has done nothing to be helpful in this respect.  There was a take-it-or-leave-it attitude, and a show of general arrogance not calculated to create a negotiable atmosphere.  I do not know whether it is too late for any discussion <Col N="533" /> to take place between those responsible with regard to the details of the scheme, but the House at present is not in a position to assess the justice or otherwise of the details of the scheme and cannot express any opinion.</P>
      <P>I presume if we held up the scheme we would probably be doing more harm than good, but I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should come down from the pedestal on which he has placed himself and try to act in the same way that a modern employer would who should trust in his employees.  If he is not satisfied with their attitude he can discuss the position with them and also modify to some extent the attitude he has taken up.  He has set an extremely bad example to employers all over the country by flinging this scheme at the heads of the teachers and saying, in so many words, &ldquo;take it or leave it.&rdquo;  I hope the Minister will adopt a different attitude and, if it is not too late, have some discussion with the teachers, and see if they have any alternative proposals or suggestions to make regarding the solution of the scheme itself.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I would like to ask a question in regard to the remarks that have fallen from Senator O'Farrell.  I am, I must confess, very much impressed by the clear statement made by the Senator.  I would like to ask the Minister what is the position in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I understand this scheme originated there. We took over certain pension arrangements which broke down here.  Did they break down in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and if so what remedy was applied and was it in any way on the same lines as the proposals now before this House?  I do feel uneasy about this.  I feel that there has been, unless the Minister is able to counter the Senator's statement, a breach of contract.  That alone makes one uneasy, particularly when so much money is being spent and lavished by the Government in other directions.  If a breach of contract is to be inferred, than I regard that as a very serious thing indeed.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane has really put his finger on a very adequate test that can be applied to this whole matter of the present settlement, as I described it, and of the crux that has arisen in connection with the Irish, Free State teachers' pension fund. With regard to breach of contract, whatever the conditions in Northern Ireland and Great Britain may be as compared with our conditions here, I do not think that if a comparison be made we are going to lose in the comparison.  Generally speaking, I think if anybody takes the trouble to inquire into the present circumstances of the teachers in either Northern Ireland or Great Britain they will find that, in comparison with the revised scales of salaries which we are introducing, implementing this nine per cent. cut, that our conditions here will be found to be quite favourable to the teachers as compared with the conditions that obtain elsewhere.  I will deal with that point at more length perhaps later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cummins dealt with other matters that really do not belong strictly to this question of the settlement of the pension fund.  He referred, for example, to the question of the training of teachers.  I would like to say with regard to that matter, as there seems to be a good deal of misconception regarding it in the country, and as we do not, unfortunately, have as many opportunities for discussing educational topics in the Seanad as we would like, to explain that since the programme for the gradual introduction of Irish as the medium of instruction in the national schools has been introduced, there has been a steady policy of endeavouring to get a larger number of native Irish speaking teachers into the profession.  But even if we were to declare to-morrow that in future we would have no teachers, that we would not train any person for the teaching profession, except persons from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, who are native speakers, it would take perhaps, 25 years or 30 years before we would have changed over completely, and have the position that all our teachers were <Col N="535" /> native Irish speakers.  The position at present is that, roughly, one half of the candidates for teaching come, through an entrance examination, into the preparatory colleges where they get a full secondary education course. Then they go on to the training colleges, with the result that, having had the advantage of a first class secondary education, they are, I think, of a superior standard to the type of candidate that we had heretofore. That is only with regard to half the candidates.  Roughly, the other half of the teacher candidates are selected through the pupil-teacher system. That half is open to the whole country. In regard to the half who go through the preparatory colleges it is not correct to say that the whole of these are from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  The actual position at present is that 40 per cent. of the places, that is less than one-fourth, I think of the total number of places, are now allocated to students from the Gaeltacht, which includes, not the Fíor-Ghaeltacht only, but every district which has been scheduled as either partly or wholly Irish speaking.  That is a very much larger area than the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. A further 40 per cent. is available to students, no matter where they come from, who have secured over 85 per cent. in the speaking of Irish, and the remaining 20 per cent. is given to candidates next in order of merit.  As regards the preparatory colleges, it will be observed that, although we are giving a definite preference to native Irish speaking students, I do not think we have gone so far in that direction as to give them an advantage beyond their natural merit.  In connection with any gradual increase in the number of such students, we have had in mind what we have got from those areas up to the present.  What we have got has been very satisfactory.  There has been a steady increase in the number and quality of the students from those areas, and while they might not, in open competition with the whole country, do quite as well as they do under the percentages that we have allocated, we have kept in mind the question of general merit, and have <Col N="536" /> not gone to unreasonable lengths in giving a preference to those candidates.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the consternation and disappointment with which the announcement of this pension scheme has been received by the teachers.  Having avoided all reference to the conditions in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which might afford a useful basis for comparison in connection with this scheme, the Senator went across to America to find an argument. I would remind the Senator, without finding any fault whatever with the policy for which President Roosevelt stands in America, that he is well aware, as I think all Senators are, that for a couple of years the teachers in Chicago had to stand in bread lines. They got no salary at all, while the teachers in these islands have always had, I think, very ample security in regard to their salaries, and in future they are going to have equal security here in respect to their pensions.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the argument that in some way or another there is an obligation on the State to be responsible to the extent of three-fourths for the solvency of this fund, and that the teachers are only responsible to the extent of one-fourth, I have gone to some trouble to find out what exactly is the origin of this suggestion.  Senators will remember the old saying in Irish politics: &ldquo;What did Gladstone say in 1881?&rdquo;  For a moment we will consider what Sir Michael Hicks-Beach said in 1898.  Speaking in the House of Commons on the 15th July, 1898, I find that he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1877 I was Chief Secretary for Ireland, and I had a great deal to do with the drafting of the Teachers' Pensions Act, which afterwards became law.  I know what was intended, and I know what that Act provided, and I know that it imposed no permanent liability on the Treasury whatsoever in connection with this fund.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, he referred to the suggestion that a liability had been imposed on the Treasury as an extraordinary suggestion based upon the misconception &ldquo;that the Treasury is to make good for all time any deficiency in the <Col N="537" /> pension fund.  There is no basis whatever for such a contention.&rdquo;  Then he went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was clearly intended that this pension fund should be kept solvent by contributions from the teachers themselves, for the payment from the Irish Church surplus was a fixed payment, while the Act itself provided in a schedule the payments which the teacher should make, and laid down in so many words that the rules by which these were fixed might be varied from time to time by the Lord Lieutenant,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and so on, so that the Treasury held that, as well as having complete control of the fund, it had the power at any time to amend the rules with regard to it.</P>
    <P>I pointed out in my opening statement that from time to time, when actuarial valuations were made and when it was found that there were deficiencies, the Treasury on one occasion at any rate, as well as making an arrangement for an annual grant and making a subvention, at the time actually increased the teachers' contributions while reducing their benefits. So that with regard to the history of the fund I do not think there is any justification whatever for saying that we have inherited any obligation from the British Government in this matter. However, I admit, that so far as the book-keeping side of the teachers' fund is concerned, there had been an endowment account and a teachers' contribution account.  It may be argued, and has been argued by the teachers for very many years, that as far as the teachers' contribution side of the account is concerned, it was in a solvent state, and that it was only the endowment account which showed the deficiency.  I would like to say that even if that were the case in respect to these two accounts it does not mean anything.  There was only the one fund.  When the Actuary reported on the position in 1928 he made no reference, so far as I know, to two separate accounts.  He simply referred to the fund as a whole and pointed out that, in order to make it solvent at that stage, if the teachers were to be expected to make up the whole <Col N="538" /> deficiency through increased contributions, their increased contributions, in addition to the 4 per cent. which they were already paying, would have to be 8½ per cent.  Now I cannot agree, with regard to the endowment account and the teachers' contribution account, that that was more than a book-keeping arrangement.  I have nothing to show, and I think nothing has been shown so far, to indicate that the British Government did at any time accept as an obligation upon them that they should be responsible for three-fourths and the teachers for only one-fourth. Even if that were the position at any particular time, say in 1898&mdash;I have shown that it was not so recognised or so accepted&mdash;the trend of events in Great Britain and Northern Ireland has shown that the British Treasury, like ourselves, have had to change their minds from time to time: they have had at different times, as we have, to take into account the whole circumstances surrounding the case at the particular time that a decision had to be made.</P>
    <P>I find that in Northern Ireland, for example, with respect to junior assistant mistresses and lay assistant teachers who were brought in some years ago that they had to pay, if they were to get two-thirds of their back service reckoned for pension purposes, a contribution of 5 per cent.  If, however, they only paid 4 per cent. they only got recognition for half of their back service.  Here we are giving these teachers two-thirds of their back service.  We are giving it admittedly only as an act of justice.  I do not wish to take any special credit for it.  I simply wish to say that it is a liability so far as the State is concerned, a liability which will be of importance in the future and which we have recognised.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator O'Farrell's point that actuarially it should be possible to secure the solvency of the pension fund at a lower rate of contribution than 9 per cent., nothing has been said by anybody, I think, on the Government side to indicate that the whole of this 9 per cent. should be regarded as a pension contribution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> Since the late Government began to discuss the question with the teachers' organisation, it is clear, whatever attitude we may take up now about the matter, that we have to admit that the question of salaries was involved as well as the question of pensions. We are not dealing at the moment with the question of salaries only. Neither are we dealing with the question of pensions only.  We introduced a new and a revised scale of salaries which, in all the circumstances, we think is fair to the teachers, having regard to the fact that we are taking over entire responsibility for pensions; that in future they will be paid from voted moneys and that there is no contribution from the teachers as such.  As far as the taxpayers are concerned they will have to face a very high liability which, in the course of time, will run up to something in the nature of £600,000 annually.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need go into the point Senator O'Farrell raised regarding teachers' pensions being placed on the annual Estimate for Primary Education.  With regard to the pensions of post office officials, they are placed on the annual Post Office Vote.  There is also a separate Vote for superannuation charges.  Except for those in a special position, such as the judges, we have not reached the stage at which we are prepared to put State servants' pensions on the Central Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that they do subscribe.  When civil servants' salaries are being fixed, and when reductions are made, as they are made at present, not alone in regard to the cost-of-living basis, but in regard to whatever opportunities offer for fixing new scales at lower rates, opportunities that are always taken advantage of&mdash;I say that the Department of Finance have always in mind the consideration that civil servants are going to get pensions.  When they are paid a somewhat lower rate of salary than they might get in the commercial <Col N="540" /> world outside, there is in mind the security that attaches to the position, and the pension that their service carries.  If I may say so, I think Senator O'Farrell somewhat unfairly suggested that we have not given the teachers an opportunity of discussing this matter, and that we have placed ourselves upon a pedestal.  As Senators know and as everybody in the other House knows, the teachers are a very strong body, very well organised, and they have plenty of opportunities of saying what they think in either House.  They are well and worthily represented.  No one in either House can suggest that we have been backward in endeavouring to effect a settlement with them.  In 1931 the late Government made an offer of a 10 per cent. cut in salaries.  I should say in justice to the teachers that it was recognised at the time, and was stated by the Government at the time, that there was to be general economy, and that to some extent the 10 per cent. would cover that economy, while at the same time the Government were going to take over responsibility for pensions in future.  The teachers turned down that offer.  In 1932 the Minister for Finance and I met the teachers and we made an offer which was described at the time as being a better offer than the one made by our predecessors.  However, that was not accepted.  The teachers' executive did not see its way to recommend it to the general body.  The alternative is to impose a settlement of this kind.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, in justice to the Minister for Finance and to myself, that we showed the details of the new pension scheme to the representatives of the teachers, and again pointed out that if there was no very substantial financial question involved we were always prepared to amend it, and to meet cases of special hardship among the teachers.  But we made it quite clear that we were going to carry a settlement based on a 9 per cent. cut. A cut of 9 per cent. is better than a 10 per cent. cut.  That was not questioned in 1931.  Conditions have changed since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senator O'Farrell and other speakers point out that since we are <Col N="541" /> going to impose a cut of 9 per cent., or roughly £260,000, that, thereby, the teachers, according to them, are going to pay the lion's share of the future charge, I should like to say, first, that as to the contention that the British Treasury had for some time accepted liability for three-quarters and the teachers for one quarter, under the 1914 scheme, which was devised to secure the solvency of the fund, had the conditions then obtaining continued, the cost of superannuation was met to the extent of half by the Treasury and half by the teachers.  I pointed out that in 1920 there was a new agreement in regard to salaries. Salaries were greatly increased, with the result that, no provision having been made for additional contributions in respect of the increased liability, or for back service between 1914 and 1920, a deficiency began to make itself clear, and before very many years passed it was obvious to everyone the fund would be insolvent.  If it is argued that, in fact, since we are making a cut of £260,000, and that the liability in the coming year will be £371,000, as a picture of the whole case, you have, I suggest, in fairness, to take the whole period until the pension liability reaches its maximum, when it should be in the region of £600,000 per annum.  You have to take into consideration the enormous deficiency of something like £5,000,000, and the fact that not alone from 1928, when the deficiency was investigated by an actuary, to the present day, but that from 1920 the teachers' contribution of 4 per cent. has been hopelessly inadequate.  The fact that an actuary was able to show in 1928 that an additional contribution of 8½ per cent., plus 4 per cent., would be necessary if the teachers were to bear the whole liability in respect of making the deficiency good shows what he considered the liability to be.  I do not claim that the settlement is a perfect one.  The teachers have their own views about it.  Viewing it from the taxpayers' point of view, and comparing our conditions with those in neighbouring countries, I think the settlement should be regarded as very satisfactory.  If the Teachers' Executive <Col N="542" /> cannot recommend it to the general body of their organisation, and if the organisation cannot see its way to accept it as a good settlement, at least they should not set up false issues. They should not start hares which are founded on the assumption that because the British Treasury had at one particular period treated the teachers as a fairy godmother, they would have continued to do so during the last ten years.  I think the fairy godmother would have changed her mind.  That important point is forgotten by the teachers when making up their case.  A perfect case could be made by the teachers from their point of view, but when the figures and the circumstances are gone into, it will be recognised by any fair-minded person that we have done our best to try to make a reasonable agreement.  Having regard to all the circumstances of the case the only regret we have is that the teachers should not have been able to accept it as such.</P>

      <P>I would like if the Minister would answer two questions. As between 1920, when the change of salary scale was made, and 1923, can the Minister tell us what provision was made towards meeting the extra liability that followed the increase? Secondly, the Minister has spoken of 9 per cent. as being not wholly required to make provision for superannuation. Will he say what amount short of the 9 per cent. would be necessary to make provision solely for superannuation, leaving out the question of a reduction of pay?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that he did not pretend that the 9 per cent. cut was solely to keep the fund solvent, or to be contributed solely for superannuation.  Will he tell the House what amount would be required if he was dealing only with superannuation and had no regard to the question of economy or cuts in salaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first question, as far as I know no provision was made between 1920 and 1923 <Col N="543" /> to meet the increased liability which became chargeable on the fund by reason of the increased pension, either by way of an increased teachers' contribution or by way of an additional grant from the State, and no effort was then made to meet the situation.  When Senators ask me what proportion of the 9 per cent. cut we now believe will be necessary to make the fund solvent, I am afraid I cannot give a definite figure.  The figure of a 5 per cent. cut plus a 4 per cent. contribution has been mentioned from time to time.  I am not going to take responsibility for saying that the 9 per cent. cut is, let us say, a 5 per cent. economy cut, and a 4 per cent. pension contribution.  All I can say is that the actuarial report on the position of the fund was that in addition to the 4 per cent. contribution, which the teachers were then making, an additional 8½ per cent. would be necessary to make the fund solvent. That is 12½ per cent.  Having regard to the time that has elapsed, and that a larger percentage would be necessary &mdash;possibly 14 per cent.&mdash;to make the fund solvent now, I think it might be said that roughly we are contributing half and the teachers half in present circumstances.  I am told when liability for pensions reaches the peak point the teachers' contribution will then be less than 40 per cent.  If I am asked what percentage contribution will be necessary to make the fund solvent at present I cannot answer.  On the question of salary the Government, rightly or wrongly, considered this question as bound up with the settlement of the pension fund since 1931. The original basis was a 10 per cent. cut.  That has been, to some extent, taken as the basis since.  We offered 9 per cent. and we are now proceeding on the basis of 9 per cent.  I should prefer if my colleague, the Minister for Finance, would deal with that point.  I regret that I cannot give the Seanad full information as to what extent a cut of 9 per cent. may be regarded as an economy cut as well as a pension contribution.</P>

      <P>In drawing up the statutory rules governing pensions, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach made a statement in the House of Commons which I would like to quote.  This is a quotation from a speech in the British Parliament on the Pension Bill:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From the very commencement of the pension scheme and, indeed, in the communications which took place between myself and the teachers before the Act was drafted, it was understood that the basis should be one-fourth by teachers and three-fourths by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Statutory rules were drawn up in 1898, in which, I understand, these principles were embodied.  These statutory rules should be available still.  Those rules are, I understand, being altered in the present scheme.  I should not wish members to go away with the impression that I was deliberately misleading them.  In 1929, in a communication to the teachers' organisation, Mr. McElligott, Secretary of the Department of Finance, stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In considering the question now raised as to how the provisions of the Act of 1897 should be implemented, I think you will agree that the Minister for Finance must have regard to the acts and intentions during the period from that to 1921.&rdquo;</P>

That, however, has nothing to do with my suggestion about taking No. 4 on the Order Paper.  I made that suggestion with a view to facilitating the Minister for Defence and releasing him for duty in the other House.  If there is any objection to the adoption of that suggestion I have no objection to going on with the Central Fund Bill now.  I should like, however, to have a ruling as to the power of discretion in the Leader of the House as regards indicating the order of business.  Is he bound to conform to the strict order as laid down on the Order Paper, or can he ask the House to take business in an order which may be more convenient?</P>

The House is the judge.  It is generally agreed, on the suggestion of the Chairman, to comply, as of course, with any variation in the order which may be suggested by the Leader of the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand that procedure.  The responsible Minister has the right and duty to conclude a debate, to explain any point upon which information is sought and to counter any criticism which may appear to him to be without justification.  While that is a Minister's right and duty, it is not fair to this House to adopt that course, especially when the Bill before us comprehends something which was not embodied in Defence Forces Bills since the Act of 1923 became law.  The Minister having refrained from making any explanation, one is in a quandary as to how to proceed to discuss the Bill.  I think it is pertinent to refer to the new force which is in process of formation.  Under the Defence Forces Act, which is being continued under this Bill, the Minister has power to go back upon this enterprise.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to state under what section of the Act of 1923, which is now being continued, power is given him to proceed with the formation of this new force.  That question was put in the other House but I cannot find that definite information was tendered in reply.  This is one of the reasons why I consider that the Central Fund Bill could have <Col N="549" /> been dealt with with greater advantage before this Bill.  The formation of this new force raises a large question of policy which, I think, would be more adequately dealt with on the Central Fund Bill than on this, more or less, technical Bill to enable the Minister's Department to bring its operations into compliance with statutory regulations.</P>
      <P>I think we ought to have some explanation, and some very full explanation, from the Minister in regard to this new force.  I may say I regret very much that there appears to be within the existing regulations and Acts, and in the Act we are now proposing to continue, power to enable the Minister to embark upon the formation of this particular new force.  It is a subject, I think, of sufficient importance and sufficiently concerns State policy to warrant a definite and separate piece of legislation so that it could be examined closely in detail instead of being brought more or less in a casual way before us, as it is now. I think there is a very considerable question as to the wisdom of the step that has been taken, and I have even greater grounds for doubting the necessity for this force.  I believe that if this new force had to be sanctioned by a special Bill, this House would have been very fully justified in rejecting that Bill, and would have got the general approval of the majority of the citizens of this State in doing so.  We ought to know what particular purpose this force is to serve.  I think that this House ought to realise, and make the Minister realise, that we are part of the Oireachtas and that he should explain here definitely what his proposals are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to what has not yet happened here, as far as I <Col N="550" /> am aware.  In the other House the Minister explained and attempted to justify the formation of this new force. We are asked to pass this Bill without a word of explanation from the Minister, and without any information such as was given to the other House.  I think we are entitled to demand full and satisfactory information from that point.  We have had declarations from Ministers who, when in Opposition, deprecated expenditure on the Army. It is true that men rise on their dead selves to better things, and it may be that any discrepancy that exists between the attitude of members of the Government when they were in Opposition and when they took over office marked their transition from the baser to the higher altitudes of life.  We are entitled to ask for some explanation of the extraordinary variations or contradictions in some of them.  For instance, the President of the Executive Council in 1931 speaking as Leader of the Opposition on the 18th of March, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Looking at the Estimates this year we find that the Army and Army Pensions Estimates reached the old figure of £1,600,000.  The Estimate for the Civic Guards is at the old figure of £1,600,000.  We ask the Minister whether he really believes that the cost of these services cannot be reduced without really reducing efficiency and without interfering with the purpose for which these services are maintained.  We believe that any purpose for which the Army could be justified could be achieved at the cost of not more than £1,000,000 a year. We believe that within that figure you could provide the Army services which are needed here at the present time.  There is in that item alone an opportunity of making an economy of £600,000 a year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in 1931 when President de Valera was Leader of the Opposition. I find that the Army Estimates, as published in the White Paper a few days ago, are given as £1,476,731.  Have the military exigencies and the military interests of this State changed so much in that time that while the then Leader of the Opposition and now President of the Executive Council thought that £1,000,000 would be sufficient for a total <Col N="551" /> expenditure on the Army we must now have £1,400,000 odd?  I presume President de Valera on that occasion spoke with the fullest assent and cognisance of his Party.  I want to know what has changed in this State that the attitude of the then Leader of the Opposition has so radically altered.  We are entitled to have that explained. We are entitled to know why if this £600,000 could be saved in 1931, it is impossible to consider any such economy at the present time, and instead to enter upon the formation of a new force which involves additional expenditure.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, if I had time to take the trouble, I could have found similar statements by other Ministers on the same matter, but I had intended to reserve any comments I had to make on this particular Bill and the matters pertaining to it until I had heard the speech of the Minister explaining the Bill.  I made no preparation for the discussion of this Bill, but only keeping myself more or less informed.  It is difficult now to make a definite and conclusive argument one way or another in the absence of the Minister's statement. We are entitled to have, first of all, an explanation of this contradictory and conflicting attitude now on the part of the present head of the Government as to these matters and when he spoke as Leader of the Opposition in 1931.  These rival and contradictory opinions in these two years were, I am sure, shared by the present Minister for Defence, and so, therefore, if there is an explanation he should be able to furnish it for this extraordinary change of opinion.  Then we want some justification for the new force and the manner in which it has been inaugurated.  We have had a lot of denunciation of the idea of a private army in this State and all kinds of alarms have been sounded as to the danger of such things.  So far as every impartial and detached citizen can view these matters, it would seem that the new force is a private army got up at the expense of the Saorstát taxpayer.  If there is one thing that it is important to secure in <Col N="552" /> this State, and one thing above everything else that is desirable, it is to keep any tinge of Party politics from entering into the forces of the State. If there was one thing that seemed to give a direct Party bias to the new force it was the way in which some 20 gentlemen were enrolled to inaugurate the recruitment of that force.  I have read the statements of the Minister in the other House, and outside the House, that this new force was to be kept above politics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite realise that Senator Moore would love me to be ruled out of order on this particular point.  I have read the statements of the Minister speaking about this new force when he said that one of the functions of the new force was to be the bringing together of old comrades who had been separated by the bitterness of the civil war.  I think it is questionable, indeed, if this particular form of organisation is the most desirable or the most effective for that class of objective, and if that is the policy of the Minister or his Government can anyone reconcile such a policy and such an objective with the definite promise of securing as the 20 men to organise the force in its initial stages, 20 men who went out and took up arms against the State and for all we know are still animated with the same desire to smash it?  This is a serious question of policy and it certainly necessitates a much fuller explanation than the mere formal comment of the Minister on this stage of the Vote.  If there is one thing I make no pretence about, though speaking for a certain political Party and in the interests of a political aspect of life in this country, I have, since this State came into existence, always stood for the existence of this State and for the belief that it was something above Parties, and for that I still stand and it is because I am apprehensive that a certain political Party now in power by accident of circumstances and as a result of promises which they <Col N="553" /> themselves, when they do not try to ram them down the throats of the ignorant, cynically disavow.  It is regarded as a joke to remind Ministers of the promises they made which secured them power.  Does any citizen of this State believe that if, when they first sought power, instead of going to the electors with the plea that they were going to reduce taxation by £2,000,000 they were going to present them two years afterwards with an increase of £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 or perhaps more, that they would have been returned to power?  It is only fools or knaves who would pretend such simplicity.  Because I believe they secured power under false pretences and false promises and that they are still wedded to the ideas which they proclaimed before they came into power of smashing the State and because they are using inside, devious and questionable methods to secure the smashing of the State which they failed to secure outside that I demand and insist upon a full and satisfactory explanation from the Minister of the purpose and the necessity for the new force before this Bill passes this House.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the statement of Senator Milroy with regard to the establishment of this new army or volunteer force, and the area administrative officers, I think they call them, I might state what actually happened in fact with regard to one of them from the point of view of the freedom of this force from politics.  In my part of the country&mdash;Wexford&mdash;the man chosen by the Government to organise this force in the Leinster area was sent for to Australia.  He arrived in this country, I believe, on January 31, and he was met at Rosslare by the combined forces of Fianna Fáil and the I.R.A. with a great flourish of trumpets.  For almost three weeks he attended functions, dances, and receptions which were organised by the same parties, making himself as one of them.  He went on a political platform to a meeting organised by Fianna Fáil and the I.R.A., and addressed the meeting with a Fianna Fáil member.  When I read the Minister's public statement about the new army, I was amazed when I saw he had said that it was to be <Col N="554" /> organised on strictly non-political lines, knowing as I did what was happening as regards the leaders, and what was also said, that these men had finished their training.  Now that statement was made less than a month after this man about whom I am speaking arrived in the country, had finished his training and was surrounded by his friends of the I.R.A. and Fianna Fáil recruiting for this supposedly non-political force.  These are actual facts which I can prove, and I think they are sufficient answer to the Minister's claim that this is a non-political army.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave us a very long explanation, but I suppose he said to himself that he had given all the explanation necessary in the other House and outside, and he assumed that we read our papers and the debates and that we would know all about them.  That is the attitude he took up.  Some time, but it does not look to be in our time, I fear, the country will come down to the necessity of facing the realities.  We have had extraordinary unrealities since we started our independent career, and this new conception is only one more, but it happens to be really more senseless than any of the others from a military point of view and from a civilian point of view as well.  The formation of this volunteer force which the Government has undertaken is unnecessary, undesirable and unreal, and in its present formation it is more or less useless.  We are arming ourselves just at the time when everybody is cutting down arms and when the President of the Executive Council is at the head of the League of Nations. We are doing all we can do to set up a new and entirely unproductive luxury and we cannot afford that.  If money is available as the result of tariffs and over-taxation in different directions, that money should be used towards levelling up the standard of living in the western counties, whose betterment has been entirely neglected by the present Government except that they have maintained the existence of the people by various charitable relief works to offset the damage done to trade as a result of what is called the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> Another point: in a world war the question of neutrality would be exploded very quickly.  We saw that in the case of Belgium.  When some first-class Power applies proper, perhaps I should say serious pressure, in the way Germany applied pressure to Belgium, resistance is very easily overcome.  The new force is supposed to be non-political and now I think there is not one suggestion that any person with experience of the wide world or of real military service in the field other than the guerilla warfare we undertook during the struggle for freedom, should co-operate in the formation of the force.  No doubt that is done because it was decided to keep people of that type from cooperation in national affairs.  The force itself is to wear a German steel helmet, a British field service cap, a French overcoat and American gaiters and, finally, it carries, of necessity, British rifles and bayonets, and unfortunately, to my regret, it has appeared in what is called the uniform of the Casement Brigade.  Lastly, if Britain went to war I am perfectly certain 70 to 90 per cent. of the first line would be off to render service to Britain as quickly as ever they could as generations of Irishmen who have a sense of realities have done.  The serious question is the fact that they are dressed in this particular uniform.  It is sad to see young Irishmen who do not realise the rights and wrongs of things dressed in what is called the Casement uniform.  I have asked a number of men of all ages did they know anything about the Casement uniform and I have got not one single answer either fully or partly full.  It is just as well that these young fellows, and a great many fine young fellows too, should know before they wore it what are the circumstances of the formation of this brigade.  Roger Casement, who was a prisoner when he undertook the formation of this brigade, was a British civil servant, serving for many years under the British Crown.  He retired in 1913, was knighted and got various decorations, including the C.M.G.  On his knighthood he wrote to Sir Edward <Col N="556" /> Grey that he was much moved by the confidence which his Majesty's intention of conferring the order of knighthood implied and begged that his humble appreciation of the honour might be conveyed to his Majesty. Mark the word &ldquo;confidence&rdquo;!  Later he seems to have become obsessed by the wrongs of his country and he went to Germany to see what he could do. The Germans, who cared not two hoots for this country, thought that he might be valuable and collected all the Irish prisoners of war at Limburg&mdash; over 1,000 at the camp&mdash;and gave him free access to them.  Among them were men of my own regiment.  Those men were offered liberty, the hospitality of the German Government and an increase of rations if they turned their coats and joined the Casement Brigade; and incidentally, to make things quite safe on both sides, they were promised £10 or £20 in the event of England winning the war and a free passage to America, so that they were secured both ways.  I should say that this offer was made to large numbers of Irish mercenary soldiers who were fighting against the Germans, men who were worn by battle and privation, by hardship and wounds and, principally, by the misery of prison life.  It was an immoral thing to do, particularly when we remember that it was done to men who were undoubtedly unhinged in their mental balance by privation and misery.  But of all the men who were gathered at Limburg I think only 56 of them took this price and were fooled into this liberty as a result of Casement's suggestion.  I think it is a great honour to the Irish race that so few did it; that so many realised that they had entered into a contract and, unlike some people in this country, they had a fine sense of honour in keeping it.  On several occasions Casement had to be protected from the anger of his own countrymen.  Incensed by his reception he on several occasions recommended that those who had spoken against his suggestions should be sent to prison camps and that their rations should be reduced.</P>
    <P>Now it is on ideas such as these that we are attempting to found our new <Col N="557" /> volunteer force.  I can imagine the attitude which Sinn Féin would have taken to men who were confined in Arbour Hill or Kilmainham or in any other British prison if they had accepted the suggestion to change their coat and renege for liberty and better food.  I admit it is difficult to follow the mental processes which change the attitude of mind of a man like Casement. I do not question for a second that at the moment he had a genuine desire to strike a blow for Ireland.</P>

      <P>I would like to make it perfectly clear to Senators, as I have attempted to do on one or two previous occasions, that I am against all soldiering. I am a pacifist pure and simple.  I thoroughly disapprove of all armies. I agree with a statement the President made some years ago that the strength of the Army here could be reduced.  I should have thought that every patriotic person would be glad to see it gradually reduced.  I think nobody really could object to the attitude the President took up in 1931 on this question, <Col N="558" /> but instead of acting on the statement that he then made we now find he is adding to the number of the soldiers in the country.  In my opinion, one of the things that we have to suffer from here is the delusion that the highest form of existence in this world is soldiering.  The Irish have been flattering themselves that they are born soldiers.  Well I will leave it at that, but I would not train them as soldiers.  Senators know what we are doing now.  We are giving these young men a trade for which we have no use in Ireland, at least I hope so.  We may have, but I would sincerely regret it and I am perfectly satisfied that everyone in this House would regret it. Since we are giving them a trade for which they will have no use, what are we going to do with them?  Make wild geese of them.  Do Senators think that is a desirable thing from the Irish national point of view?  I certainly do not.</P>
      <P>I think that one of the most patriotic things that all sides in this country could strive for is to lessen that anxiety for military glory that seems to obsess large numbers of our youth.  There is no prospect that we will have to fight anyone but ourselves, and, unfortunately, we are quick enough to do that.  From the psychological point of view, I think this measure is one that is very likely to be injurious to the youth of Ireland, because the effect of it will be to impress on their minds the honour and the glory of a military life, forgetting altogether the hardships of that life, and that in many countries where military service is taken the soldier's pay is very poor indeed.  If we examine the records of our own countrymen, of the wild geese from this country, we will realise how objectionable it is to try and hold up before youngsters the glory of a military life.</P>

      <P>I would not like to agree with either of the two Senators who have spoken before me.  I think that we must have an adequate defence force in this country.  Nobody can say what the future will bring, and nobody can say that there is any country that will not be called upon to defend itself. <Col N="559" /> I do not think that it is a really convincing argument to point out that a small country cannot have an army that will stand up to the army of a big country.  If a country is small, and if its resources are meagre, then the treasures from the material point of view, at any rate, that the army is called upon to defend are relatively small.  What it is possible to have is a defence force proportionate to the material things that have to be defended, and generally, I think, if there is going to be an attack on a country from any angle it is going to have some sort of a material basis. Therefore, I personally should not see any objection to the formation of a volunteer force here.</P>
      <P>As I have said, nobody can foresee what the future may bring.  I would be glad to see a volunteer force here if it were to be a national force and were to be a non-political force.  Why I feel that we cannot let this Bill pass without question is because of my own uncertainty&mdash;I might put it stronger than that&mdash;about the volunteer force that is being formed.  This Bill, I think, must be passed by the Seanad. The Army Act, under which Army discipline is maintained, and under which the Army operates, expires at the end of this month, I think.  The Bill is introduced at a point which leaves us very little time for the framing of amendments.  Year by year this Bill is passed without amendment, and I do not suppose that any question of amendment would arise until the Minister was able to introduce a permanent measure if it had not been for the steps that have recently been taken.  I think these steps, at any rate, give us ground for considering the introduction of restrictive amendments to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be glad to see a volunteer force formed if it were formed on a strictly national and non-political basis.  The Minister has announced, and the official attitude taken is, that the Government desires this force to be non-political, but acts speak more plainly than words, and I am afraid that the acts of the Government and the particular steps that they have <Col N="560" /> taken indicate that the intention is to create a political army, an army which will give allegiance to them beyond the allegiance that an army owes to the constitutional Government of the State.  I do not know whether it is intended to create a new force on a political basis to replace the existing Army which is a loyal and a constitutional Army, but if the Government had wanted to form a non-political volunteer force, such as anybody who takes the general view about defence that, for instance, I, and I think the majority of the citizens of the State take, they would not have taken 20 men with the records of the 20 officers who have been placed in charge of the formation of this Army.  They have had guerilla experience of sorts, but these men have not had the training or experience to make them fit for the uniforms or the commissions of regular officers.  It would have been preferable if they had selected officers from the regular Army and had put them in charge, or if they felt that they could not take officers who had served in the civil war against the I.R.A. then there are quite a lot of young officers who have gone into the Army in the last five or six years, who could have been selected: men who were university graduates or who had passed Civil Service examinations, men of capacity who have received since they went into the Army the professional training which would have enabled them to take charge of this particular work.</P>
    <P>I want to go even a step further about meeting the Government point of view.  If they felt that they must bring in men like these, they should not have chosen as area administration officers from this type of men.  At least they would have mixed them, or made them half and half.  They would not have put into positions such as these, people that many decent young men would not like to be under in the Army; who would not demean themselves by going in, because they would not like to serve under or to be in contact with them.  That is the position. Whatever the Government may say in words, their acts are designed to get into this force all those who are in political sympathy with them.  They <Col N="561" /> have got these 20 men, who will select recruits, form committees, and run the whole show as far as they are capable of running it.  It seems that we can give no other reading to what the Government has done than that its intention is not to have a constitutional Army, which would do its duty by any Government, but a force created at the public expense, a new political force, a sort of new I.R.A.  I think that is a very serious danger and that it cannot be let pass without notice.  It makes us, in doing our duty, consider whether we will not amend a Bill which gives the Minister power to carry on this force.  If he does not give us an undertaking to amend the Bill, so that this force will not be run in that way, I do not know that we should not take steps to prevent him running it at all, unless it is to be run in the interests of true freedom.</P>

      <P>This debate is taking a rather surprising turn.  This Bill is one to continue in force the Army Act.  I do not regret anything that has been said in the course of the debate except what has been said by the last speaker. So far as I can remember, the idea of all Nationalists from 1916 to the present time was to have this country defended by a voluntary force.  We were told that a standing army in the continental sense or in the Imperial sense was entirely unsuited to this country, that the cheapest and the best method of defending an island like this so far as it could be defended, was to have a voluntary force that would be able to give a good account of itself in case of invasion, that would so conduct itself that it would not be worth while for the greater nations to attack us again.  That is what we have been taught, and I think it is sound policy. In pursuance of that policy a voluntary force is being organised.  What are the objections that have been raised in the course of this debate?  I will start with the objections raised by Senator Miss Browne.  Apparently she objects to one officer.</P>

      <P>He has an area in the proposed new force.  In any case, before there was any trouble he was a well-known man there.  There is no reason why he should not have charge of an area in regard to the volunteer force, having regard to the fact that he is more experienced perhaps than regular Army officers, of how a volunteer force for purposes of defence should be organised.  Take the next objection, that of Senator The McGillycuddy.  His objection, so far as I could understand it, is that officers who served in other armies have not been appointed.  I would like to know whether any of the gentlemen who served in other armies have sought employment in this volunteer force.  Senator The McGillycuddy is a soldier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Asked to co-operate?&rdquo; Does the Senator mean that he should have been asked to advise the Government as to the organisation of the new force, simply because he was a great officer in the army of another country? If the Senator had come forward with such a suggestion, I am perfectly certain that it would be received with the respect that it deserved.  But that is no real objection to this measure, which is a National measure.  There was talk about uniforms.  I am sure the uniforms selected are suitable and are good uniforms.  I will not go into the question of the Casement Brigade. Perhaps the Minister will deal with that.  Lastly, I come to what Senator <Col N="563" /> Blythe said.  The Senator perfectly fairly said that he agreed with the establishment of a volunteer force; that he agrees that we should have a force to defend the territory of this country; and because we are a small nation, that is no reason why we should be a defenceless nation.  Coming from a man in his position, what he said is rather serious.  Before the force is organised at all he cast a reflection upon it.  I am sure he has fully considered what the effect of his words might be, to cast a reflection on the 20 men who have been appointed to organise the various districts.  These are men with considerable experience of the class of warfare which an Irish Army would be expected to wage against a powerful invading force.</P>

      <P>Guerilla warfare.  They might not alone be shot by machine guns but be poisoned by gas.  I am sure the Senator knows many of these men.  I know a few of them.  I think they are good men.  I do not know of any young recruit in Ireland to whom it would not be an honour to associate with some of these men.  There is where I take exception to what Senator Blythe said.  It is the only thing that pained me in the course of the debate, that these 20 men are not good enough to be associated with raw recruits in the volunteers.  I thoroughly agree with what Senator Blythe said that this volunteer force should be a national force, that it should be a non-political force.  No volunteer force is any good unless it is national.  I hope it will not be influenced or actuated by Party politics.  We have an example in the police force that was recruited by the Government which preceded this Government, and also in the Army. We have there an example of loyalty to the State.  These forces were recruited under the Government of which Senator Blythe was a leading member.  Why should he not give to his opponents credit for the same sentiments, for the same line of conduct, and for the same results as those pursued in the previous ten years?  There is no reason to suppose that a volunteer <Col N="564" /> force composed of young men will not be national first and national always.</P>

      <P>Before Senator Blythe made the charge that he made in the course of a rather impassioned ending to his speech, he should have been more specific.  Has he an objection to any man?  What can he say of any of the 20 men who are in charge of this force? I am sure he will not deny that they are good soldiers.  He has not denied that any one of them is not a man of the highest character.  I think it is unfortunate that at this stage, and without descending to particulars, Senator Blythe should have made a general attack against this new force.  It is a terrible thing.  It is wrong to attack or to belittle in advance men who are expected to perform public services. If they are found to be wrong, or if any fault can be found with them in the discharge of their duties, then is the time to come before Parliament to challenge them or their actions.  On the Second Reading debate Senators ought to think better of it, and should not risk discussing this Bill any further than is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing the Senator said that makes it clear I should explain my position to the House.  When I was dealing with these officers I was not dealing with anything connected with their private characters. I was dealing with their public acts in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister, when replying, to deal, if he can, more or less with the point of military technique raised by the last speaker.  I spent a good many years of my life in the army, and I cannot quite appreciate the special qualifications that Senators suggest are required from these officers for training a voluntary force.  Whenever it was my duty to deal with men of a volunteer character, I always sought men experienced in military technique, who had been well grounded in discipline, and who spent many years in an organised force, to train raw levies.  It seems an extraordinary <Col N="565" /> doctrine that men should be selected whose military experience has been of an entirely guerilla character. I am not dealing with the political section at the moment.  I hope the Minister will deal with this matter from the point of view of military science.  I would like if he would give some idea of the contemplated organisation, or if it is going to be really a guerilla force. I can conceive something on the lines of the Boers in South Africa, or of some of the old American systems where the men kept their rifles in their own homes, being likely to be summoned for service at any moment.  Is that the intention?  If not, how is it proposed the arms should be held?  In view of the rather disturbed conditions and in view of the possibility of other political armies, I think we should like to know how the arms of the new force are to be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to touch upon a somewhat different aspect of this question.  The Minister drew attention to the fact that this is a Bill to re-enact the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1923.  Quite frequently I have called attention to the fact that this Act of 1923, containing 246 sections and eight or nine schedules, was passed without five minutes' discussion in either Dáil or Seanad, and has been passed, year by year, without amendment, on periodical promises to introduce a permanent Army Bill.  I do not know in how many years that promise has been repeated, but it has been repeated very frequently since 1923.  Though that Bill has been passed every year for 11 years, Senator Blythe comes along, and because he has a serious criticism of the administration to make, suggests that the Act itself should not pass without amendment. This is the middle of March, and quite obviously, the Act could not be amended so as to become law before the end of March.  After the end of March, there would be no authority to enforce discipline in the Army. Senator Blythe is aware of that.  It was the practice of the last Government to bring the annual Army Bill before the Seanad later than this date. <Col N="566" /> It was seldom brought here before the first or second week of March, and occasionally it was brought later.  I hope that the Seanad will realise that, if Senator Blythe's suggestion is carried out, on and after the 31st March there will be no authority to enforce discipline in the Army.  I daresay that would commend itself to Senator Milroy.  <i>(Interruption.)</i>  The Blue Shirts and the I.R.A. would line up and, I suppose, the various propagandists of the two bodies would attempt to rally the disbanded Army into their respective force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it would be an army then.  The Minister said, repeating the promises of his predecessors, that he had hoped to introduce a permanent Bill before this continuation Bill was brought in.  I ask him not to embody in the new Bill a provision which will enable him to do what he has done in the way of forming a volunteer reserve in this manner and as was done by his predecessor in forming the other volunteer reserve which, I suppose, fulfilled all the conditions that Senator Blythe suggests should be fulfilled in forming a volunteer force, but failed.  It is not with the point of failure that I want to deal. I want to raise an objection to giving power to the Minister in any new Act, as power is given in this Act of 1923, to form, under a regulation, a volunteer reserve force by enrolling men in the Army for ten minutes, making them soldiers, and then transferring them immediately to the reserve. That was the procedure adopted by the predecessor of the Minister, and this House approved of that procedure. The present Minister has followed out that procedure.  I think it is a wrong procedure.  I think that a bad precedent was established, and I hope that power will not be taken in the next permanent Bill to do such a thing in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter in 1930 and Senator Milroy was very strongly in favour of the procedure then adopted <Col N="567" /> by the ex-Minister for Defence.  I think that it is shown now, from the criticism levelled against this new force, that the criticism I advanced then as to procedure was well founded.  The proposal to form a new army or a new branch of the Army should come before the Oireachtas in a formal manner before the event and not after the event.  The procedure adopted in 1930 has been followed by the Minister.  In both cases, I think it was bad procedure and I hope that power to do such a thing in the future will not be taken in the new permanent Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Government justifies the formation of this new army owing to the possible necessity for such a force in the event of invasion, when the next great war takes place.  Have they given any consideration to the fact that most countries are now coming to regard the aerial weapon as one of the principal weapons of defence?  If any invasion of this country takes place, in the event of a great war, I fancy it will be in the form of air raids to break down the morale of the people, to destroy munition factories which might be supplying one of the combatants&mdash;I believe we are to have a munition factory here &mdash; or to destroy the Shannon electrical scheme so that the electrical energy of the State would be put out of commission. What effective reply can a guerilla army offer to attacks of that kind?  If we are going to spend a considerable amount of money for defence purposes, we should spend it in the way that is going to give us the best and most effective return.  I should imagine that the development of our air force and expenditure upon that arm of most of the money that is to be devoted to the maintenance of this volunteer force would give a far better return to the State if we are considering, mainly, the question of national defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with those who say that when you are selecting officers to train a new army of that kind, you should have regard to more than patriotic sentiment or so-called national outlook. <Col N="568" /> Surely, anybody who joins an army is going to carry out the instructions of his superiors and is going to discharge the function for which he was employed.  Granted the patriotic sentiment, there should be some regard to the military capacity and experience of those entrusted with the charge of that army, unless we are to have an army which will be a greater menace than a means of protection. When one hears of this extraordinary arrangement of local or parochial committees throughout the country entering into the management of the Army, one feels as the Duke of Wellington did when he saw the recruits sent out to him.  He said: &ldquo;They filled me with terror.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>They helped to do that but it was only after a tremendous amount of damage was done.  There may be precedents for this arrangement. I know little or nothing about military matters.  It is the first time I heard of local committees, which may develop into little pothouse political establishments, entering into the management of an army or in any way influencing the control of an army entrusted with national defence.  The greater the centralisation the less risk in matters of that kind.  I see no cause for jubilation in the multiplication of our military forces and the scattering of arms throughout all parts of the country.  Little dogs have long tails and little countries generally have bigger armies than they can well support. You have only to look at Europe to see the wretched condition of the people of many countries which are maintaining huge armies.  Men learn to fight in these countries before they learn to work.  In places such as the Balkans, the women have to do the work which the men should be doing, while the men are capering around in uniform anl learning how to destroy human life.  I am sorry to see that we are developing this military spirit, thinking that we are achieving some great and noble idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resistance that we can offer to any country that will contemplate attacking us will, in any case, be <Col N="569" /> rather of a minor character.  I agree that we should make it expensive for any invader who would attempt to encroach upon our territory or upon our rights but I doubt if the best method of effecting that purpose is to organise an Army trained, in the main, by men with no real military training themselves, men who have been recruited in circumstances which may cause a certain amount of professional jealousy to develop between themselves and officers of the standing Army.  To allow local committees of laymen, recruited <i>ad hoc</i>, to enter into or have any voice in the management or control of that Army is a rather dubious method of ensuring national defence.  Conditions in this country at the moment are not and for some time past have not been such as would make it desirable to scatter arms throughout the country, even though they may be contained in barracks, halls or sheds or whatever other conveniences are to be supplied.  I seriously urge upon the Minister that he should exercise the absolute maximum of caution and conservatism as regards the distribution of these arms. Too many risks are taken at the present time.  Lives have been foolishly wasted for the sake of a rusty old rifle or revolver.  If you have hundreds of rifles stacked here, there and everywhere throughout the country, you can imagine what will happen.  It will be a simple matter for any organisation, having the will to do so, to make a concentrated raid on these halls on a particular night, thus disarming the new Army and creating a new menace in the country.  We are at the beginning of this business and it is better to look ahead now than to make mistakes which will be very difficult to remedy afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest against the contemptible speech made by Senator The McGillycuddy.  I think that a soldier, at any rate, should content himself with slandering the living and should not go on to slander the dead.  Sir Roger Casement was one of the greatest and most honourable Irishmen who have ever lived.  He could not be bought by the British. <Col N="570" /> At all times during his life, he stood for what he thought was right.  He stood up for the rights of the natives of South Africa, when he thought he should stand for them, against all comers.  When he thought that this country, in 1914, should get the freedom that England was mouthing about in respect of Belgium, he stood for this country.  In the course of organising this country to fight for its rights, he went to Germany and there asked the young men who were fooled into the British Army to fight for the freedom of small nations, to join his brigade and to fight for the freedom of one small nation&mdash;their own country.  I do not think that any soldier or any statesman or any decent man&mdash;Englishman or anybody else&mdash;could see anything immoral in that.  It is only the illegitimate type of Irishman we have in this country that could see anything wrong in an Irishman fighting for his rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a lot of points raised here to-day that have already been dealt with.  The first is as to why no long statement was made at the opening of the debate.  It is not usual to do that.  This Bill has been introduced one year after another for ten years. I informed the House it was an annual Bill.  Certain questions are asked now about the volunteer force.  There should be no necessity to answer them because they have been answered 1,000 times, and any Senator taking an intelligent interest in public affairs should be able to answer them himself. First of all, I say this, if the recruits for this new force are confined to one of the two Parties, it is not our fault.  In spite of the activities of Senator Blythe, and those associated with him, we have endeavoured to get all shades of opinion into the volunteer force.  We have succeeded, in spite of Senator Blythe, in getting on the sluagh committee men representing the United Ireland Party and the Fianna Fáil Party and all other grades.  We got them in spite of the fact that their leaders in the Seanad give them a wrong lead.  One of our greatest national necessities is for a real efficient military force in this country <Col N="571" /> under the control of the representatives of the people.  It may be costly, but the evils that may arise from lack of such a force might be much more costly.  Taken from the point of view of national discipline or national defence against foreign aggression, the volunteers, coupled with the Army, will form the most effective defence force possible.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell talked about concentration only on an air force, and he was applauded by Senator Sir John Keane.  The fact is, I am advised, that in order thoroughly to protect this country against an attack by 100 aeroplanes you could not guarantee success against such an onslaught without having 1,000 planes of the same type engaged in the defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have a raid with a much smaller force.  There is one thing that we can guarantee with this new force that if any foreigner tries to put his foot on this soil against the will of the people, this country is going to make it damned hard for him and he will be glad enough to get out of it.  I believe the regular Army, coupled with the volunteer force, gives an ideal combination for this purpose.</P>
      <P>There were 20 officers commissioned recently.  We had a lot of lectures here to-day about the fact that we were starting a political force.  There are some people in this country who think that in order to be fair we must invite our political opponents into everything that is going.  I do not see any reason why, if we think there are plenty of men well fitted for any particular job we should not appoint them, even if they are supporters of the Government.  These men were not asked whether they were supporters of the Government or not.</P>

      <P>Some of them have been neutral for a number of years.  They did not support any side, but they were men who helped to beat England, and when it is asked what are their <Col N="572" /> special qualifications I say there are 20 men who helped to beat the British Army during the Black and Tan war, and that is good enough qualification for me.  Senator O'Farrell spoke of the sluagh committee.  The only function of the sluagh committee is to give advice in the running of the local halls.  They are not going to have charge of the volunteers.  The volunteers are organised in three lines. You have the young men between 18 and 25 who will come in and spend a fortnight every year for five years on a local campaign and, in addition, 30 or 40 additional periods in the year. That first line will not be organised on a war basis except for their annual training or, if called on, general mobilisation. When out for annual training they will be organised in companies and battalions in the local regiments that cover two or three counties.  It is only then they will be organised on a war basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second and third line are the two reserves from the first.  The local sluagh committee is akin to similar committees existing in America and everywhere you have a territorial force. They give advice as to records; they take charge of the different inter-sluagh competitions, rifle shooting, football or hurling or whatever they may be. Generally they arrange for employers to allow volunteers off at a time suitable for training, and all that class of work, but from the military point of view they have no charge whatever over the volunteers.  The volunteers will be controlled by officers over them in the ordinary way appointed by the Minister for Defence.  The 20 officers we have appointed are 20 out of a total of about 500 that are to control the volunteer force as well as the regular Army.  The volunteers are not a separate army; they are an integral part of the national forces controlled by the Minister, by the headquarters staff and other senior officers down the line.  The 20 administrative officers who are appointed are not in charge of the volunteer war organisation.  There are 20 officers of the regular Army that have been given regular Army commissions and they can be changed from that to other work.  They are not acting <Col N="573" /> on their own.  They are acting under an executive officer with the rank of commandant in each military district. They are acting with the assistance of every Army officer attending to that work.  There are 50 officers organising the volunteers and not the 20 newly appointed, as some people appear to believe.  Senator O'Farrell and somebody else spoke about the control of the Army.  We are not so foolish as to throw rifles all around the place at the present time.  The volunteers for the beginning, until things settle down, use some miniature rifles to train.  Their real training will be done when they are called up in the ordinary way for a fortnight or a month each year.  The organisations are not going to be scattered around the country into different sluagh halls or small posts, and they will be concentrated with the existing or ordinary force.  I do not agree with a group of Senators who said we should do nothing while other countries are talking about the reduction of armaments to arm ourselves here.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in Europe at present?  Every country is spending twice as much on its military forces as in 1926.  The same as everybody else, I would like to see international questions settled by conference and argument, and if somebody is going to settle them by force I do not want to be in a defenceless position.  I agree with Senator Blythe and Senator O'Hanlon and other Senators who admit that we could make it a costly proposition for any country to interfere with us here if we set ourselves to do it.  In a broadcast speech a few nights ago I appealed to the young men to come forward and join this force.  I said it was a non-political force, and was to obey any Government elected by the people.  I pointed out that if they did that the volunteers would be the people's bulwark against internal disturbance and their best guard against external aggression.  I believe that, and I believe that any reasonable man who looks upon the situation in the country will say we require a force that is going to be set up to give an example to the young people down the country as to how they should behave.  I believe, from the reports I have already <Col N="574" /> received, that a decent type of young men are coming along and offering their services.  I think that it is much better they should be doing that under State direction, ready to give their services to any Government selected by the people rather than they should be at each other's throats on dark nights.  I believe also from the point of view of this country <i>vis-a-vis</i> with other countries, it is probably a useful national work that we are doing in organising a volunteer force that will accommodate itself clearly in the cheapest and most effective way so that this country cannot be invaded with impunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the quantitative regulation of imports to the Saorstát by the institution of a quota scheme somewhat similar to that operating in the majority of European countries and in respect of some classes of products in all countries. The main reasons why these powers are necessary are twofold.  Firstly, to enable us to institute a system of protection for native industries, in certain circumstances preferable to the system of customs duties and secondly, to enable trade agreements to be made with other countries in a manner beneficial to the Saorstát.  When I say that the institution of a quota system here will enable protection to be given to native industries in a manner preferable to the system of protective tariffs I must not be taken, as certain people have taken me as saying, that a system of protection by customs duties has not proved satisfactory. There are certain classes of goods in respect of which a quota system could not apply and which if manufactured here and it was decided to foster the industry could only be dealt with by a system of customs duties.  There are other classes which can be more satisfactorily dealt with by a quota system &mdash;in the main these which are required in quantity by our people but which are not yet being produced here on a sufficient scale to supply our requirements. Heretofore, we have adopted a rough and ready system of imposing a customs duty and taking power to admit imports under licence.  Under that scheme, we were able to regulate imports to the quantity required in an effective manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that scheme has worked fairly satisfactorily it is obviously desirable there should be substituted for it a more regular system, though there has been no serious complaint made about <Col N="576" /> the present system.  With a customs duty and a licensing clause a wide discretion has to be taken in respect of persons to whom licences are issued, the class of goods, and the times at which imports might take place.  Certain people who were refused licences either for the quantity or at the time they required them naturally felt aggrieved and are sometimes inclined to think they are not getting equal treatment to others.  It has been a remarkable fact that despite the number of customs duties with licensing clauses attached and the extension of the licensing system there have been very few complaints, but whether these complaints are numerous or nil it is, in my opinion, better that we should have a system based on an Act of Parliament which sets out the persons to whom licences may be issued, the quantity of goods, and the times at which they may import, and containing an assurance that the conditions applying to one person shall be made to apply to all.  I will deal later with the actual provisions of the Bill but I want to stress that fact as there appears to have been some misunderstanding in that connection.</P>
    <P>Secondarily, and in a sense of equal importance is the intention to use the Bill for the purpose of securing arrangements where possible with other countries for reciprocal trade. Under present circumstances, in the efforts which have been and are being made to open up new channels of trade and generally to secure preferential conditions for the Saorstát from foreign countries we have found ourselves considerably handicapped because we had not got similar powers to those possessed by foreign Governments with whom we were dealing. International trade has become largely a matter of barter.  One country agrees to take a certain quantity of defined goods on condition that the other country will take a stated quantity of defined goods from it.  That system has been roundly condemned by many international conferences and by people claiming to speak with authority on general grounds.  When however we came in contact with other Governments on trade matters we found the absence of a quota system <Col N="577" /> here meant that we were unable to enter into binding commitments in respect to the volume of trade that might be secured to any one country in respect of any class of goods.  The manner in which the power conferred by the Bill will be exercised under any circumstances must be one for determination by the Executive Council for the time being, but the Bill provides that the Orders made by the Executive Council under the Bill will remain valid only for six months unless they are approved of by the Dáil.  The provisions of the Bill itself are quite clear.  When it is decided to bring any class of goods subject to a quota system an Order is made by the Executive Council called a Quota Order the effect of which is to prohibit the importation of the particular class of goods into the Saorstát except under licence.  In the period of six weeks following, licences to import are issued at the discretion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have a six weeks' interim period of that kind for two reasons.  It is inevitable that goods of the class prohibited should be in transit at the time the Order was made and it is undesirable that traders should be put into a difficult position of being unable to import goods which are actually in transit at the time of the making of the order. It may be true that in respect of certain goods six weeks may not be considered an adequate period, but when such difficulties arise they can be overcome by the manner in which the quota for the first period is fixed and the duration of that period.  During the six weeks period a register of importers of the goods concerned is prepared.  Any person who comes within the categories set out in sub-section (2) of Section 7 can apply and must be placed on this register.  Nobody, except for the reasons set out in Section 7, can be denied the place in the register.  When that register has been prepared the Executive Council makes another order fixing the duration of the first quota period and the quantity of the goods that is the quota which will operate for that period.</P>
    <P>When that order has been made, and <Col N="578" /> the persons on the register know the quantity of goods, they then make application to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for licences to import goods under the quota, setting out in their application the quantity of the goods they desire to import. When these applications have been received the following happens:&mdash;In the first place, if the total quantity of goods applied for by all importers is 75 per cent. or less of the total quota, then every person receives a licence for the total quantity of the goods applied for. If the total quantity of goods applied for exceeds 75 per cent., but is less than 100 per cent., then every person, at the discretion of the Minister, either receives a licence for the full quantity for which he has applied, or licences are reduced <i>pro rata,</i> so that the aggregate of the goods licensed will be 75 per cent. of the quota.  If the total quantity applied for exceed 100 per cent., then the Minister is given discretion to reduce the amounts and to issue licences to the applicants for such quantities as may be considered reasonable, having regard to the interests of the person engaged in the business of importing such goods prior to the date of the Order.  In other words, it is intended that if the total of all the applications for licences exceeds 100 per cent. of the quota, consideration will be given to persons who are ordinarily engaged in the business, and they will receive preference over those who are going into it for the first time.  Objection might be taken to that principle on the ground that it was establishing a vested interest, but no other system is practicable where only a limited quantity of goods can be imported.  It is quite clear that every person desiring to import might apply for the whole quota in the hope that they would get substantially more than they required and would be in a position to barter the licence to others for a consideration and it is obviously undesirable that that should happen.</P>
    <P>The circumstances are, therefore, that where 75 per cent. or less is applied for everybody gets what they apply for; over 75 per cent. and less than 100 per cent. everyone gets either the amount applied for or that amount <Col N="579" /> reduced so as to keep the total at 75 per cent. and in cases where the total of the applications exceeds the quota then the Minister has power to reduce the quantity to each applicant, having first regard to the interests of persons ordinarily engaged in the trade or business of importing these goods.  It is clear that when a quota is fixed licences may only be issued for 75 per cent. of the quantity specified in the quota order, so that there will be a certain amount of elasticity in the event of consumption or demand exceeding the quota. It is deemed desirable to have that margin so that the quantity can be increased during the quota period otherwise than by making an additional quota in respect of any quota period.  The Minister will have power to increase the quota, but not to decrease it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody must apply again separately.  I was going to deal with that point, but I want to mention one further matter in this connection so that I can get on to the special features of the measure.  Power is taken, in the event of a person to whom a licence is issued, not being able to avail to the full of the licence in the specified period due to causes outside his control, such as a shipwreck or a strike, to grant to that person, subject to conditions, the right to import those goods in a subsequent quota period outside the quota fixed for that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the main quota with which I have been dealing up to the present, there are two other matters provided for in this Bill.  One is the special quota provided for under Section 4.  The other is the additional quota about which Senator Douglas has been asking.  In the case of a special quota, goods can only be imported from a specified country.  For the purpose of convenience, let us say that a quota of 100 units is fixed in respect of any class of goods.  Then it may be prescribed that 25 shall come from a specified country, the remaining 75 coming from any other source. Where a special quota is fixed in respect <Col N="580" /> of any quota order a separate application must be made for a licence to import under the special quota as well as under the main quota.  The procedure would be that a person who desired to import goods up to a certain quantity would, no doubt, apply for a licence to import them under the open quota.  In the event of his not being allotted a licence to import all the goods he required, he would then have to seek permission to import under a special quota or, alternatively, he might make application under each quota to import a certain specified quantity of goods.</P>
    <P>The procedure, however, will be that where a special quota is made, the licence to import goods under it will confine the importer to bringing those goods from a specified country: that is, goods manufactured in the specified country or goods consigned in that specified country, or goods which are both manufactured in and consigned from that specified country. If, during the quota period, an additional quota is made, then on the announcement of that additional quota applications for licences to import under that additional quota must be made separately by persons on the register.  For the importer, therefore, the procedure will be that when a quota order is made he first of all makes application to get his name on the register of importers. Having done that, he awaits the announcement of the commencement of the quota period and of the quota fixed for that period.  If there is a special quota fixed, he then applies for a licence before the commencement of the quota period to import goods either under the main quota or under the special quota, or under both.  He gets his licence to import goods at that stage: that is, before the commencement of the quota period.  If, during the quota period, an additional quota is provided for, then he applies separately for permission to import under that additional quota.</P>
    <P>Apprehensions appear to have been raised in certain quarters arising out of the fact that people have tried to contemplate how they will stand personally in respect to certain classes of goods if those goods were bought subject <Col N="581" /> to quota orders.  These apprehensions arose where the goods concerned were of a nature that could not possibly be made subject to quota orders. There are many classes of such goods, as I am sure Senators will understand. They will see at a glance that they could not be regulated quantitatively and in the manner contemplated under this Bill.  Machinery, obviously, would come into that category.  One cannot say that so many hundredweight or so many tons of machinery will be required within a certain period.  The demand for machinery fluctuates from week to week, month to month, or year to year.  There may be a demand for a particular machine which may perhaps be only procurable in one place, and may perhaps not be procurable at all except 12 months after the order for it is placed.  It is quite clear that quota orders could not be made in respect of that class of goods.  They can only be made where goods are imported in considerable quantities and with regularity. Obviously it is possible to apply quota orders to commodities such as flour and sugar, which are more or less standard in quality, and which came in formerly in considerable quantities.  Their importation was fairly uniform all the year round. In respect of these articles the manner in which a quota system can be worked is, I think, easily understandable. There are other classes of goods concerning which difficulties may arise.  It is contemplated that where a quota order is made in respect of these classes of goods the period of six weeks which will elapse before the first quota period commences to run will be availed of for the purpose of having a full discussion with all interested parties so that possible difficulties may be obviated.</P>
    <P>Power is taken under the Bill to require that goods imported under a quota order shall be consigned by a specified route.  That particular section caused some misgivings, but it is an obvious and a necessary provision in a quota Bill, because if we confine importers to getting certain goods from one source we must at the same <Col N="582" /> time take steps to ensure that they are sent in by the most economic route, in a manner which will involve importers in the least possible expense. The simplest way to put the matter before the House is perhaps by sketching an impossible situation in which we required importers to take a certain quantity of flour from France in every year, and that for some peculiar reason the French exporters decided to send the flour to Ireland via New York.  There are a number of reasons why this provision is considered necessary. One special reason is because there is the possibility of developing an export trade with certain countries if advantageous freight rates can be secured.  From these countries we are at present importing considerable quantities of goods which come here after transhipment in other countries or after they have been warehoused in other countries.  The possibility of getting advantageous freight rates for goods going outwards depends on the possibility of return cargoes, and it might be deemed desirable to use the power given by this Bill to ensure that where such trade possibilities exist return cargoes will be available.  It is also desirable to terminate where possible, the system of importing goods secondhand into this country.  It involves us in needless expense.  Where direct importation is possible there is nearly always a saving in costs.  As many Senators are aware, many classes of goods from different parts of the world at present reach us through commission agents in Great Britain and in Continental countries.  They are very frequently warehoused before being transhipped here so that so far as these goods are concerned we have got to pay not merely the expenses of the commission agents but also the warehousing costs.  Power is taken under this Bill to eliminate, where it is found feasible to do so, these unnecessary items of expense. Power is also taken under the Bill to prescribe the percentage value that must be added to any class of goods in a country in order that they should be entitled to the description of being manufactured in that country.  That is the ordinary procedure which <Col N="583" /> operates in respect to preferential custom rates at the present time.</P>
    <P>In order to be entitled to these preferential rates, goods must have a definite percentage of value added by a process of manufacture in the country enjoying the benefit of the rate.  A similar provision is being enacted here. The final matter to which I desire to refer is the section concerning the persons to whom it is intended to confine registration on the register of importers to be set up.  There is, first of all, any individual who is a national of the Saorstát; secondly, any partnership more than half the capital of which is owned by Saorstát nationals, any company registered in the Saorstát, no matter by whom it is owned, or any person carrying on a manufacturing undertaking in the Saorstát, no matter what his nationality.  That section is necessary so as to insure that licences will be issued only to persons in business here.  It is preferable that that should be so rather than that we should have to issue licences to persons who might apply from Great Britain, France, Germany or from any other countries.  The intention is to confine the register to people who are in some way associated with business in this country.</P>

      <P>Any limitation that takes place upon the right to import goods or any order made that confines persons to import certain classes of goods from a particular country does not confine an importer to one source of supply.  He is confined only to a country, but within that country he is entitled, of course, to purchase the goods to the best advantage to himself. It may be that a provision of this kind may operate to eliminate certain elements of competition and may have the effect of increasing prices.  That is a factor that must be taken into account, but there is no alternative to that.</P>

      <P>I welcome the speech of the Minister, particularly that portion <Col N="584" /> in which he referred to reciprocal trade.  There are many countries outside the British Commonwealth to which we could sell goods if we were in a position to buy goods from them. Owing to currency restrictions these countries are unable to pay cash for our goods unless we are in a position to trade with them.  I gather that reciprocal trade will be encouraged under the Bill.  Whatever objections there may be from others, from my point of view there is certainly no objection to anything that tends towards reciprocal trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is possible to have reciprocal trade, as Senator Parkinson suggests, I welcome it in every possible way.  In the light of contemporary economic history we must consider the fact that in recent times we have had two economic phases, one which arose out of and continued after the Napoleonic wars, and one which developed from the teachings of the free trade movement. Now we are only at the beginning of another phase, which has arisen out of the confusion of the Great War and the rapidly increasing mechanisation of industry.  Scientific development is still gathering such momentum that measures of economic adjustment and efforts of economists like the Minister for Industry and Commerce can be little more than palliatives.  At the present time these are taking the form of tariffs and quota restrictions. Having made ourselves one of these entities, naturally we have to conform in our legislation in order to trade with the others.  I understand that while control has been exercised hitherto by means of licences and duties these have not proved to be entirely effective as a means of developing our industries in a satisfactory manner.  This Bill seeks powers for quantitative and discriminative control.  It may be useful, as a weapon for bargaining or, as Senator Parkinson pointed out, for reciprocal trade and treatment.  But, as the Minister said, it is not a new phase in the so-called economic war. That is a question I have never raised in this House.  I have avoided it.  So far as I can see, we have come to the point that no single act of the Administration <Col N="585" /> can be taken without having some bearing on the economic war.  I think the Minister has been justified in dismissing that question as lightly as he did.  It is hard to see how a Bill of this kind can operate in our case except to restrict British imports.  As a matter of fact the Minister referred to that fact when discussing this measure in the Dáil.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The bulk of goods imported to this country in the past came from Britain.  We have no favoured-nation treaty with Great Britain and, so far as the changes in the direction of trade must take place, in consequence of the operation of the Bill, they must necessarily be at the expense of British exporters.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the Statistical Abstract interesting figures will be found.  In 1932 Great Britain took 96.3 per cent. of our total exports in value, and all the remaining countries under 4 per cent.  On the other hand we only imported 76 per cent. in value of our requirements from the United Kingdom, whereas we took 24 per cent. from other countries, and incidentally 3.1 per cent. from the United States of America which only took 0.4 per cent. from us.  The intention is to try to redress the disparity of the other countries' figures by bargaining, admittedly at the expense of Great Britain.  Is it not quite possible, I suggest, in the light of statements made on the other side, and of ordinary human conjecture, that discrimination on our part may lead to defensive discrimination by the other side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid I find it very difficult to distinguish between the operation of the Emergency Duties and the obvious results which will follow the working of this Bill.  The arrangements with other countries are to be on a reciprocal basis, such as bargaining, but the difficulty is to see what we have to offer that European countries and America have not got already.  Quota legislation to be of any real worth implies that you have a surplus of commodities and manufactures to spread over a number of other countries in considerable quantities, and that each country requires <Col N="586" /> a certain type of article in exchange.</P>
    <P>Suppose we consider the possibility of a reciprocal arrangement with the United States of America, and the effect it will have on employment here, employment in America, and in Great Britain, which at present is taking a great quantity of our stuff admittedly under the quota arrangement.  The 1933 Abstract gives our import figure from the United States as approximately £1,049,000 worth of goods, made up of cereals, £272,000; tobacco, £121,000; oils, £451,000, and other items.  Against that they took from us goods to the value of £42,500, so that we have to start by correcting in advance an adverse balance of £1,007,500.  We are making that more difficult by objecting to the importation of cereals in order to support our wheat scheme.  That wipes out a good part of the first figures, and also makes the American think that it is a case for reciprocity.  You have to give away, to some extent, in that matter.  Again I gathered from the well informed Labour Party in the Dáil that it is proposed to import some 2,000,000 tons of coal from the United States.  That is an item which appears in the Abstract as being landed from other sources in the past at about £1 per ton.  I suppose the coal will come here in American ships, manned by American sailors, of which I believe 80 per cent are of German and Scandinavian extraction; that it will give work to some 8,000 American miners for one year.  Of course, we can bargain for an increased quota for the spirit trade, but from the labour point of view, the distilling and the malting industries combined employ only about 1,000 men.  So far as I can see, even if the number was doubled, the advantage to labour is going to be on the American side. The remaining figures are so inequitable as not to be worth worrying about.  Naturally there is a disadvantage to British labour.  The more money British labour has the more likely it is to consume portion of our goods.</P>
    <P>The other big item, the oil trade, can be placed elsewhere.  The crux in every case will be the American question: <Col N="587" />&ldquo;What is there you have that we want?&rdquo;  That is a question we shall be hard put to answer.  The advantage being given to American labour is a serious thing as regards our smaller ports, but I do not want to labour the point.  The coal must come to the bigger instead of to the smaller ports. If we are arranging matters we should see that the labour is distributed as far as possible and is not concentrated in one place.  It may be that the Executive Council calculate on the political effect which the further loss of the trade will have on the British shop-keeping mind, and that eventually they will send a suitable negotiator, who will say: &ldquo;Give us back our trade and you can forget the annuities and all your other obligations.&rdquo;  The Bill embodies a principle that &ldquo;those who trade with the many will have a fuller economic life than those who trade with the few.&rdquo;  That is a general principle, but all these principles should not be accepted as dogmas.  Rather must they be considered in the light of circumstances which obtain in a particular business in any country.  In our case the circumstances are very clearly set out in Table 97.</P>
    <P>I think the late Administration made very little attempt to face the American quota on human beings, and as a result the unemployment which must result in this country.  To a certain extent I am not one of those who consider the unemployment figures here are entirely due to this Government. Of course not.  The present Government realised that this is a question that had to be tackled in some way, and not in a normal way, but they seem to have entirely nullified their efforts by their unnecessary sacrifice of our export trade.  The Minister can justly claim to have established, and to have got moving a considerable number of industries in this country. He has done that by means of tariffs and licences.  There is undoubted scope for further development in many directions where the consumption and the return would justify the investment of capital.  He seeks to accelerate that development by the use of the powers conferred under this Bill.  I cannot see <Col N="588" /> how this end can be achieved if the general scheme implies, as the Minister admits, a further diminution of our trade with Britain.  That would nullify his argument.  That is my case, that the danger of this Bill lies in the Minister's avowed intention to carry discrimination further.  He is already discriminating in a matter of import permits to the detriment, in some cases, of trade and employment.  If we travel that road we are going to do so at the nation's expense.</P>
    <P>If it does not weary the House I will give an instance of how the granting of import licences works to the detriment of trade.  I do not want to make political capital by bringing a case of this kind up in the House.  I know that I lay myself open to that suggestion.  I want to maintain the attitude that when a citizen puts his case in full, as was done here, regarding import permits it should be seriously considered. The Minister is not always in a position to consider it.  I want it to be clearly understood that I am not suggesting, as was done elsewhere, that there is any political bias, any dishonesty or any corruption, but that a licensing system may cause individual hardship and national loss, and that the danger will be accentuated when this quota legislation, which can only affect Great Britain, is brought into being.</P>
    <P>The case I want to quote is a very simple and short one.  In December, 1933, an Irish trader applied for a permit to import free of duty a crude oil engine as a power unit for his saw-mill, as the steam engine with which he worked his saw had become practically worn out.  He got back a stencil form regretting that he could not get the permit.  This was one of a number of these stencil forms which were then going out.  He applied again and he was supplied with a list of firms in the U.S.A., Germany, France, CzechoSlovakia, Belgium and other countries who could supply what was required. The Minister warned the trader that he would take no responsibility for the commercial or financial standing of any of the firms.  The trader immediately circularised the whole of the 38 firms and stated his requirements in detail. <Col N="589" /> At the same time, he wrote to an English firm, Messrs. Ruston and Hornsby, Ltd., Lincoln.  From Messrs.  Ruston and Hornsby he got a quotation by return of post for a crude oil engine, complete, delivered at the railway station in his town for the sum of £ 10s., subject to a discount of 7½ per cent., and 2½ per cent. for cash in one month from date of invoice.  That works out at £285 3s., plus an emergency duty of 20 per cent., £57 0s. 8d., which leaves the final cost at £342 3s. 8d.  Among all the others, the trader got only one firm quotation of £441 f.o.b. Hamburg.  Accessories were extra at a cost of £14 13s. 3d. f.o.b.  Hamburg. That worked out at £455 13s. 3d. Delivery was to be effected in from one to two weeks.  The terms were 50 per cent. cash with order and balance against shipping documents.  The interest on £227 16s. 7d. paid in advance at 5 per cent. per annum, for one month, would add 19/- to the item. The net cost of the engine complete f.o.b.  Hamburg would be £456 12s. 3d., plus freight and carriage, £23 18s. 8d., making the final cost £480 10s. 11d.</P>
    <P>We must remember that, whereas we all know Ruston &amp; Hornsby, the Minister would give no guarantee in regard to the others.  My point is that the Minister cannot really examine these things.  The saw-mill in question is the only one in the district.  It serves the wants of a number of contractors, farmers and others, and it provides employment, directly and indirectly, in the cutting and carting of timber, for a considerable number of men.  About 12 men are constantly employed about the mill.  The engine, in addition to providing power for the saw-mills, also provides power for crushing home-grown grain for local farmers.  The trader has now been notified that his engine is no longer safe and that his insurance company will not bear any further risks.  He may close down at any moment.  As a result, no native timber can be utilised and, while a number of men are consequently on the unemployment register and others will be also losers indirectly, the small farmer in the district must fall back on the alternative <Col N="590" /> of imported timber which gives employment to other nationals only.</P>
    <P>I think that the position will be accentuated when we come to the quota legislation.  In arriving at conclusions as to the use which will be made of the powers granted under a Bill of this kind, we are justified in taking account of public pronouncements made outside the Oireachtas by Ministers.  On the 13th February of this year the Minister is reported in the Press as telling a Dublin audience that interest in his efforts was not confined to this country and that he hoped to give the other peoples of the world some guidance which might help them to solve their difficulties.  On the same occasion he said that &ldquo;the real test of efficiency was not the comparative cost of production but the effect which any undertaking will have on the internal organisation of the State.&rdquo;  Where, on balance, our people are given additional employment without undue cost to the community as the result of new undertakings, I am heart and soul with those undertakings. But as they are fostered at the expense of the cattle trade, the horse-breeding industry, the greyhound trade and other exports, the balance is, seemingly, on the wrong side. Surely it would have been possible to maintain the agricultural side of our economic complex, with the employment it created, while developing the industrial side, which could be done more rapidly and easily by the use of the money earned by agriculture instead of paying out of our own depleted income for the increased 70,000 persons who are now in receipt of home assistance, as compared with the number in 1931.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a charming speech in Cork the other day.  He started off by telling the audience how delighted he was to find the optimistic spirit which, he said, obtained in the many parts of the country to which his business took him.  He then referred to the report of the association which he was addressing.  Unfortunately, the people of Cork had not considered their drafting as they should.  They put in the report the words: &ldquo;Surely <Col N="591" /> the time has arrived when a real effort should be made to recover the valuable market lying at our very doors.&rdquo; That was quite enough for the Minister. They had given him just the jumping-off ground he wanted.  If they had referred to such portion of the market as quota legislation would allow us to recover from the other side, then it would be quite different. All the Minister had to say in the circumstances was that it was quite clear to anybody who had taken even a passing interest in the development of the economic policy of Great Britain that unrestricted entry into the British market was not open to us or any other country.  The Cork people had to be satisfied.  It all depends on the way you jump off, and the Minister knew that very well.</P>
    <P>The most serious part of the Minister's speech when he was speaking to the Dublin audience was the bald statement that a nation's prosperity cannot be measured by its export trade alone.  Of course, taken by itself, without consideration of other income and financial reserves, a statement of this kind means nothing.  Probably the majority of those who listened to the Minister took the remark at its correct value.  But when considered in connection with a Bill which reinforces the emergency duty legislation and the Minister's warning in the Dáil, the obvious inference is that what is left of our export trade will be deliberately sacrificed by the Government's policy in the struggle for sovereignty.  This Quota Act will be merely another weapon to help on to this finale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly disappointed with the speech of The McGillycuddy.  That speech shows that he understands this question, but he has not said the things he could have said.  He says that the quota system is one of the evils resulting from the Great War.  We are, I think, the last nation to legislate in this matter of quotas.  As I understand, the Minister has introduced this measure merely as protection against the quota system of other countries. <Col N="592" /> The Bill is drafted with extraordinary skill.  Nobody has questioned the form of the measure but Senator The McGillycuddy, and others have dealt with the policy underlying the measure. Senator The McGillycuddy said that this Bill will have only the effect of diminishing still further our trade with Britain and injuring her export trade with this country.</P>
      <P>Senator The McGillycuddy might have said that Great Britain was the first to introduce a quota system against the cattle trade of Ireland.  Senator The McGillycuddy might also have said that while tariffs on one side and the other side were fair, a quota by Great Britain against Irish cattle is unfair.  Senator Sir John Keane, who will speak after me, will, I hope, say that.  Senator The McGillycuddy and Senator Sir John Keane know that it is unfair.  We all know that the most profitable trade Britain has is the trade with her Crown colonies and her mandated territories.  The profits of that trade come into English ports and, through English ports, filter through to agriculture.  Hitherto, they have penetrated to the help of agriculture in Ireland.  We do not object to their tariffs in the course of the dispute which is not yet settled.  They have made no objection to our tariffs, which were really protective and defensive. But they introduced a quota in respect of Irish cattle which they know to be unjust.  It is unjust for this reason: the trade they have with their colonies and dependencies was acquired as much by Irish blood and treasure as by British blood and treasure.  We have no alternative but to introduce a measure authorising quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister rightly said that this is not a measure arising out of the economic conflict between Great Britain and the Free State on the question of the annuities.  It is not. It is a measure of protection, introduced in order to defend ourselves as well as we can against the unjust quota imposed by Great Britain against Irish cattle.  Now Senator The McGillycuddy knows that.  Why did he not elaborate it?  It lies in his mouth to say the word and the same <Col N="593" /> applies to Senator Sir John Keane. They say you will further diminish British imports into this country and they say we are endeavouring to injure British trade.  They know we are only doing this in self protection.  Why do not men of their ability and knowledge on this question stand up and say something against Great Britain?</P>

      <P>Of course we want markets to develop our industries and our export trade to pay for the imports that we receive.  We must pay by way of exports&mdash;our cattle amongst other imports not merely by tariffs. Tariffs are fair in an economic war, but if Great Britain imposes upon us not merely tariffs, but a quota, how can we pay for our imports unless we endeavour to find markets elsewhere? These quotas were first established on the continent, and the object of them is to keep within the territory of an empire or a nation all the products or all the advantages derivable from the resources of that nation; that is what it is.  It is a new idea.  The next phase will be that nations will be reduced to a system of barter, and the third phase is this, that the interests of the various nations will become so individualistic that wars, and great wars, must inevitably result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>He is an excellent authority, and if Senator Comyn finds himself backed by Senator Sir John Keane one would require considerable temerity to express a different view.  I am not very convinced that in spite of all that has happened we are going to get into the calamity of war.  I think it is possible that this country might be just the one party to keep out of it. I do not regard this Bill as part and parcel of the economic war.  I do not think it was so intended.  Incidentally I do not agree with Senator Comyn that tariffs are fair in an economic war.  I think they could be more unfair than quotas.  If quotas are to be used for purposes of antagonism or hostility between two countries, then I pity the small country that started the war of quotas.  Nothing but disaster could occur, especially to the smaller of the two countries.  But where you have conditions that we have to-day, and the conditions in this country, it may well be that judiciously used we may obtain some benefits from quotas.  But if they are to be used as a weapon of hostility, if they are used in that way, Britain would regard them as hostile, and if a war of that kind came on between us and Great Britain we would come off very much the worse.  I have seen nothing whatever to indicate what the Minister has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> One thing I am certain of is that this Bill is going to mean an extraordinary amount of trouble for the Minister and his Department and for a very large number of people in this country.  Partly from the present policy of the Government, and partly from world conditions, the difficulties of trade are very great indeed and very heavy expenses are involved.  This Bill will inevitably add to these difficulties, and in the case of the smaller traders the difficulties will be greater still, because of their small staffs, and because of their inadequate opportunities to deal with the problems in volved.</P>
    <P>I have never suggested, or charged, that in the Department the Minister is concerned with there has been any discrimination at all.  My experience is entirely to the contrary.  I have said so before, and I have nothing to suggest and I have not heard anything, not even the vaguest rumour, to suggest the Department has acted in any way but scrupulously fair.  But I think the Minister will find a considerable difficulty when, with the best possible intentions, and acting absolutely fairly, he is dealing with applications which are in excess of the quota.  I would like him to indicate what steps he proposes to take in order to ascertain what business was done heretofore by applicants.  The matter is causing some uneasiness and I would like to ask what kind of test or proof he will require so that applicants may satisfy him or his Department so that they should get preference in this matter.  For instance, you can take the import of similar goods for a year or the previous year. That would be unfair or might be unfair.  It would certainly be unfair in the case of firms who are buying larger portions of Irish products in particular commodities that others, who are perhaps increasing their business find themselves unable to do.  The Minister knows there are certain commodities that Irish firms cannot supply at the present time.  It would be unfair to take the imports of the previous year because that would give a benefit to the firm that had bought <Col N="596" /> nothing from the Irish manufacturer in that period.  It also would be unfair in many cases because in the last years it is extremely difficult to get anything of what would be regarded as regular evidence.  Perhaps that is an exaggeration.  At any rate, business is not done regularly. A person has to purchase certain quantities of goods, to get a price at certain markets, and instead of being able, as one did 20 years ago, to place an order for an approximate amount, taking delivery each month over a year&mdash;that has become quite impracticable. Therefore, I think it would not be fair to depend solely upon the imports of the previous year.  I am not suggesting that the Minister said so. If that were done it would not be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I would like an indication how the Minister intends to discriminate.  I am satisfied he and his Department will be scrupulously fair, but I think their difficulties will be very great.  If this was for the Minister a whole time job and that he could give his whole time to the Department and to confine himself, say, for instance, to the shirt trade, then I think probably he, as well as anyone I know, could manage it.  But added to the duties that he has already in hand, this inevitably will have to be carried out by officials and they will have to have an indication as to the grounds on which they will discriminate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of reciprocal trade with foreign countries, I am not very sanguine about that. I agree it is the duty of the Government to try it.  I go further and say that should have nothing to do with the economic war.  It would be a good thing for this country to have done more trade in the past with other countries outside England.  I say that without the tiniest hostility to England or any suggestion of hostility.  It is a good thing to develop other markets not as a matter of retaliation, but as a matter of practical policy.  But I would point out to the Minister, though I think he knows it, although it is not recognised in other quarters, that very considerable difficulty arises in doing a foreign trade as against doing an <Col N="597" /> English trade.  It may be that the Government may have to get a considerable amount of expert advice to assist the manufacturers here in their foreign trade if as a result of this Bill he is able to make reciprocal arrangements in foreign countries.  This applies both to purchasing and selling goods manufactured here not sold to England, and, therefore, to be paid for with foreign money.  It varies with the countries which generally require long credits on foreign trade.  In every country other than England you have the uncertainty of the exchange, which makes business rather precarious.  If paid in three months' time you may not get anything like the money you expect and you may lose.  Many countries have restricted quotas; the amount of money is limited and you may find many difficulties.  On the other side in connection with purchases from England there can usually be credit for from one to three months. Trade with other countries must be cash with orders or immediately that the goods arrive at the port.  With solvent firms that is all right, but with those with limited capital it is difficult. I am not suggesting there are insurmountable difficulties, but there are difficulties that will have to be solved.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister if anything is to be done, as has been done already in some other countries where there are exchange restrictions, to try to make reciprocal arrangements between those purchasing and selling in the country.  That, I believe, is done elsewhere.  If a firm here is selling goods where there are Government restrictions on the amount of currency sent out of the country they could arrange to exchange the credit so that there would be the minimum exchange of currency.  That would be of great advantage and would reduce the number of credit on both sides.</P>
    <P>In his speech to the House, Senator Comyn said he believed the Bill was admirably drafted and that nobody could find any fault with it.  After that statement I feel a certain amount of temerity in venturing to find any flaws in the drafting.  I am, however, rather puzzled by the provision that</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" />&ldquo;for the purposes of the Act, importation shall be deemed to take place when the importing conveyance is reported under the Custom Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If anyone smuggles dutiable goods into the country it can be shown that they have not been imported within the meaning of this Act and therefore they would not have broken the quota.  It would seem the goods have not been imported unless the forms are filled and handed in.  That provision does not seem to be perfectly clear.  Then again, I think a difficulty may arise from another section inserted by the Minister in the Dáil.  Section 5, sub-section (2), brings us back to the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876. Section 42 is applied, as amended and extended by subsequent Acts.  I have not read all the British Acts which might apply to Section 42 but I have read Section 42 itself and I find that it reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The goods enumerated and described in the following table of prohibitions and restrictions inwards are hereby prohibited to be imported or brought into the United Kingdom save as thereby excepted and if any goods so enumerated and described shall be imported or brought into the United Kingdom contrary to the prohibitions or restrictions contained therein such goods shall be forfeited and may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as the Commissioners of Customs may direct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems that entering the papers is importing the goods and that therefore the goods may then be forfeited or shall be forfeited&mdash;there is no option in the matter.  The insertion of that section is introducing something really far too drastic and I suggest to the Minister he may find himself tied afterwards by it.  That is the reason I mention it at this stage.</P>
    <P>What seems to be clearly desirable is that where there is any doubt, there should be no penalty whatever on a firm who imports goods not knowing that they are to come under the quota system.  We know that under the tariffs this is extremely difficult, and with the <Col N="599" /> best will in the world you may make a false or inaccurate description or one that is not applicable.  I think, therefore, the provision inserted in the Dáil is, as far as I can see, much too drastic. There is a danger of its interfering with the Minister's power to give licences. He proposes, I take it, that where goods are in transit or have been ordered the importer will be given a licence under this section for something which ought to be forfeited.  There is probably an explanation there, but as sometimes happens when new sections are added to a Bill, errors may creep in.  I suggest that the Minister might have it looked up in his Department. I would like to ask the Minister is there no way of meeting the fears of traders with regard to <i>bona fide</i> orders for goods which may come in almost immediately after the fixing of a quota order.  When you are buying from a manufacturer outside this country it is almost impossible to fix an absolute date for delivery even if you had reason to fear a quota, and traders often find goods consigned to them a month later than they expected, and also they all know from experience that you almost always have some goods in transit on which you have to pay a considerably high rate of duty.  If you are aware of the coming of the new duty the goods would not be imported.</P>
    <P>In the case of goods which it may not be possible to sell elsewhere or which the manufacturer refuses to take back, it might, as well as involving a loss of profit, be ruinous.  I think if anything could be done the Minister ought to take steps to give that kind of relief under the Bill before it passes into law. I know that the Minister's answer is that he will do his best and he will give every reasonable help in cases of hardship. A promise from the Minister in my experience is given in good faith, and I know he would endeavour to carry it out, but people cannot always have the same confidence in every Minister that happens to be in his position. If some amendment could be inserted which would provide as a right that where a <i>bona fide</i> order was made before a quota order, there might be some provision made by the Minister <Col N="600" /> which would remove a great deal of apprehension and a certain amount of uneasiness and hostility to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister two specific questions.  In the first place, I have tried to discover the meaning of the expression, &ldquo;a person born in Saorstát Eireann, or in the area now comprising Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  He did not know when I asked him on a previous occasion.  I have been asked what it meant, and I have been unable to say clearly, but I want to ask him does it mean this: From the time the Treaty was signed until the Six Counties opted out, about a year elapsed, and is it an effort on the part of the Government to allow persons born during that year to come in?  If that be so it seems absurd, but if it is not so I wish he would tell us what it means, because it is absolutely beyond me.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions I have endeavoured to secure that a person born in the Six Counties might be treated as a citizen, but it is quite plain that the Minister's Party and about half of the Party opposite do not agree with me.  I am going to ask him to consider a different provision, which is this: Where an Ulsterman comes to reside here he should only have to reside to qualify.  He should not be asked to wait five years.  I came across a very interesting anomaly in connection with that point.  One person likely to take shares in a concern here was born in the Six Counties and was not residing here.  He was willing to come and reside here, but he would have to wait five years before he would count as a shareholder. This man has resided in Ireland all his life and was unable to participate, but we found a person who has resided in London since he was two years of age.  He was born in the area now comprised in the Saorstát, and under the one head or the other he will be quite right, but the person who has resided here does not count.  That is not only an anomaly but an absurdity.  I cannot see why a man born in Belfast should be excluded while a person who likes to live anywhere else should be <Col N="601" /> included.  This matter, I think, should be remedied, and persons in the Six Counties who are willing to come and reside here ought not to be obliged first to reside here for five years.  The other question I wish to bring before the notice of the Minister is the question of branches.  I was to-day asked by a firm, registered in Belfast, who have carried on a branch business in either Drogheda or Dundalk for something like 15 years, if I could explain their position.  They think they would be excluded, in the event of a quota, as a wholesale business.  My reading of the Bill is that they will be excluded, but I may be wrong, and I would be glad if the Minister will look into it.</P>

His attitude always is, if I might paraphrase: &ldquo;The times are out of joint, O happy fate, but I was born to set it right.&rdquo;  He seemed almost to enjoy getting into the metaphysics and the quagmire of all this newfangled economics, and to hear him speaking to-night it almost looked as if he had assumed the position of <Col N="602" /> economic dictator.  He has got, one way or the other, the powers of a dictator, but he talked to-night in relation to transport and other advantages that we got from adopting certain routes in terms of &ldquo;we.&rdquo;&ldquo;We will find an advantage in getting return freights&rdquo;; &ldquo;we will find advantage to prevent the warehousing of goods in Great Britain.&rdquo;  Apparently he has completely overreached the ordinary attitude of mind to trade, but people in trade are far better judges of the methods of transport and the other business connected with carriers than any academic dictator even with the editorial &ldquo;we.&rdquo;</P>
