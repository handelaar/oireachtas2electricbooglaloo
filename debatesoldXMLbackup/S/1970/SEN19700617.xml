    <Title>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1970: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Sections 1 to 7, inclusive agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="598" /> SECTION 8.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 proposes to raise the limit of the amount that the Minister for Finance may subscribe for shares in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company from a maximum of £8 million to £17 million.  I want to question whether this sum will be adequate in view of the programme prepared by SFADCO which was placed before the Mid-Western Region Organisation and approved by that body.  Under that development programme SFADCO propose to build 128 industrial units or industrial buildings at a cost of £9.75 million in the next four or five years.  This estimate was arrived at some 15 to 17 months ago and having regard to the substantial increase in all costs in the interim period I wonder if the limit now placed on the Minister for Finance to take up shares in exchange for capital is adequate.  Certainly the sum does not appear to be sufficient to finance the scheme proposed by SFADCO for the mid-western region, which includes Limerick City and County, Clare and North Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to raise this ceiling figure substantially.  I believe it should be increased from £17 million to £25 million.  I do not think this is an exaggerated figure having regard to SFADCO's plans and the potential development in the Shannon region.  Though the sum of £9 million sounds a substantial one, that estimate does not make any provision for the acquisition of land or other expenditure; it seems to be related solely to the provision of advance factories and building units as proposed by SFADCO.  The time has come when we must have a bold and imaginative plan for the development of the entire mid-west region including the Shannon estuary.  I suggest to the Minister that the sum of £9 million in this context is wholly inadequate to develop this region in a realistic manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The SFADCO proposals provide for the creation of 7,500 additional jobs during the years 1969 to 1974 or an <Col N="599" /> average of 1,500 new jobs per year. This is more than approximately three times the rate of the number of jobs provided during the ten years in which SFADCO have operated from the coming into effect of the 1959 Act.  It is obvious that these proposals would cost a sum far in excess of the £6 million or £7 million that it cost to provide the 4,500 jobs at the Shannon Airport industrial estate.  For this reason I submit to the Minister that he should reconsider this provision and introduce an amendment on Report Stage to provide for a sum of about £25 million.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in replying to points raised by other Senators and by myself on Second Stage, the Minister said that he thought it was a good system that enough funds would be provided for two or three years at the end of which time SFADCO would come back to the Minister for further funds.  I suggest that in this day and age the provision of funds for a period of only three years is taking too short-sighted a view when one realises that planning, of its very nature, must be done on a long-term basis.  Therefore, the figure of £25 million I have suggested would be more realistic than a ceiling of £17 million.</P>
    <P>I might mention as a matter of interest that one of the Scottish development boards, I think it is the Scottish North-West Development Board which operates in the Inverness area, is planning to spend a sum in excess of £40 million on a development programme to provide industrial and other undertakings.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note, too, that the Litchfield Report on the mid-west region anticipated that between the years 1966 and 1986, the population of that region will have increased from 265,000 to 325,000, an increase of 60,000 persons.  The Buchanan Report put the estimate at the higher figure of 371,000 persons by 1986.  Therefore, it is obvious that if industrial development in the area is to be kept in line with the projected increase in population, the necessary finances will have to be provided to keep pace with the job requirements.  Perhaps the Minister will reconsider this section and bring <Col N="600" /> in an amendment on Report Stage to provide the necessary additional finance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise to a certain extent with the Senator's approach to this matter but let me say that I cannot see any justification at this stage for an amendment.  As I pointed out in reply to the Second Reading discussion, while one can claim justifiably that the proposals in relation to the operations of SFADCO in future years must be aimed at, the system that has operated and which I propose to continue to operate has much to recommend it.  That system is on a two to three year review basis so that it is left open for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come back to the Oireachtas at the end of that period and to seek approval for the provision of additional moneys for further development in the area.  This, in turn, will give an opportunity to the Oireachtas to debate this and to consider the amount of progress that will have been made by SFADCO in that time.</P>
      <P>In this section the provision is being increased by more than 100 per cent. The amount set out in section 2 of the Act of 1968 was £8 million for the development in the airport region.  I can see the Senator's point in that the extension of the functions of SFADCO now take in the entire mid-western area and, on the face of it, this would appear to justify the provision of more than an additional £9 million but I consider the manner in which it is being provided to be satisfactory for the reasons I have mentioned.  It is preferable that this should be done than that a far greater amount of money should be provided over a longer period which would, in its own way, act to inhibit the Oireachtas from commenting on the progress or reviewing the progress that would have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that the additional £9 million that is being provided will not enable SFADCO to make the forward planning beyond the two to three year period I envisage at this stage. I do not think at any stage lack of money will prevent them from planning. <Col N="601" /> I have no reason to believe that there would be any reluctance in coming back to the Oireachtas seeking the additional moneys if such were required. I feel there is not any need for me to commit myself to making provision for any more than that.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned raising the ceiling from £17 million to £25 million. I do not think this is necessary. If I thought it was necessary I would have had it written into the Bill originally. It is far preferable that we should have a particular amount that might be seen to be needed over a two to three year period, so enabling me to come back to the House at the end of that period seeking additional moneys and at the same time providing the Oireachtas with the opportunity of discussing the activities of SFADCO in the mid-western region in the mean-time. It is because of that and because of my being fully satisfied that the amount of money provided under this section is sufficient to meet the requirements of SFADCO and the developments that they can envisage over the next two to three years that I could not agree to what the Senator suggests.  I consider the amount of money provided under this section is sufficient to meet the requirements in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has allayed some of my fears in regard to the possible shortage of capital in that if I interpret him correctly he has said it is desirable that SFADCO should plan for a longer period than two to three years and they certainly will not be discouraged from so doing.  The Minister obviously has accepted my point that planning for two or three years is not sufficient.  We have got to plan for at least five years ahead.  The Government have accepted that planners should look at least five years ahead and having regard to that, what the Minister, in effect, is saying is that SFADCO are free to go ahead and plan five years ahead but the Government will only assure them of sufficient capital to carry them on for two or three years and they can then come back to the Minister before that time is up looking for additional capital to complete their plans or expand their <Col N="602" /> plans as the case may be.  The Government will see how they are getting on in the interim period and on that basis they will decide whether further moneys should be voted.  There are certain merits in that approach but I do not agree with that.  If you encourage a semi-State organisation or anybody to plan five years ahead it is essential that they should know the capital will be available for five years ahead.  The Minister does not accept that as a proposition.  All I can say is I am glad to have the assurance that SFADCO will be encouraged to push ahead with plans on a longer-term basis.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister did not touch on the larger issue, that SFADCO up to now, according to the terms of the Bill, are being encouraged to go ahead with their programme for building advance factories.  I visualise them going much further afield and acquiring land, say, in the Shannon estuary area for development on a massive scale. Certainly this sum would be wholly inadequate for such plans.  We have got to be bold and imaginative if we are to tackle this problem of the south and the west and SFADCO are the obvious agency to do that.</P>
      <P>Every Senator who spoke on the Second Stage, and the Minister joined them, praised SFADCO for their expertise. They deserve every encouragement. The greatest encouragement I can think of as a businessman apart from being a Senator is to be assured that adequate capital is available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In line 20, before &ldquo;for&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or places under military control or custody.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> On the Second Reading I made the point, which the Minister apparently did not think was made seriously, that under section 2 of the Bill as it stands there is no qualification whatever placed on the type of alternative places which the Minister may provide for the detention of juvenile offenders.  I made the point that it seemed to me that under the provisions of section 2 of the Bill as drafted it would be open to the Minister to order the transfer of juveniles to military custody.  The Minister, as I say, did not seem to think that that point was a serious one.</P>
    <P>I made it clear I accepted fully in advance that that was not the intention of the Minister, that that was not the intention of the Bill, but when we are legislating it is intended that the legislation which we enact will outstay the term in office of any particular Minister or any particular Government. While I accept fully that it is not the intention of the present Minister and that it is not the intention behind this Bill that the present Minister for Justice or any Minister for Justice should have power to transfer juvenile offenders to places under military control or custody I make the point which I consider is a valid one that if the Bill remains as drafted that power is inherent in the section.  It was only this morning that we got the official report of the Seanad debate.  I had only an opportunity of a quick read of the Minister's reply to the discussion. So far as I can recollect the Minister by way of interjection suggested that if a transfer was made to a place under military custody that would be a prison and that the framing of section 2 provides for the transfer to places other than prisons.  I do not think that is an answer at all.  Detention under military custody does not necessarily mean detention in prison.  It is not necessary to labour that point.  I think it is self-evident.</P>
    <P>In replying to the Second Reading discussion the Minister went on to make the point that under this Bill it is being provided that the Minister for Justice will have the authority to make regulations governing the management and general rule of places to which <Col N="604" /> juveniles might be transferred under section 2.  That is so.  The Minister is quite right in that.  As I see it, that does not of itself preclude the Minister from transferring to military custody. It may be that he would have to get agreement from his colleague, the Minister for Defence, to do that but it is open for him to do it.  That is what I want to provide against by this amendment.  As I see it, the situation is a simple one.  Either the Minister intends&mdash;and I am sure he does not intend&mdash;that there should be power under this Bill to transfer juvenile prisoners anywhere including to military custody, or the intention is not there.  If the intention is not there, why leave the section drafted in such a way that something could be done which is clearly against the intention of the Minister and of the Government in framing the legislation?</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts my amendment it will put the matter beyond doubt.  If the Minister has no intention that this Bill should at any time in the future be used for the purpose of transferring juvenile offenders to military custody then the acceptance by him of this amendment will not weaken the Bill or weaken the section in any way. It can only weaken the Bill or the section if it is the intention of the Minister or of the Government to utilise this Bill at some stage for the purpose of transferring juvenile offenders to military custody.  I accept that is not the intention and because I accept that it is not the intention I would find it difficult to understand why the Minister would not accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator O'Higgins on this amendment. I think he has put forward valid reasons for inserting the words proposed to be inserted.  The only qualification is on the words &ldquo;provide places other than prisons&rdquo;.  The purpose of these places is the promotion of rehabilitation of offenders.  It could be argued that places of military detention could be regarded as places for rehabilitation.</P>

    <Col N="605" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I do not so regard them.  It would be possible to so regard them.  Like Senator O'Higgins, I do not think it is in the mind of the present Minister that juvenile offenders should be transferred to places of military detention but it is possible.  As legislators we should close that loophole by the insertion of the phrase referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I am prepared to accept any amendment which I think is either necessary, desirable or reasonable.  That is borne out by the fact that I put down amendment No. 3 on the list of amendments today on a suggestion which Senator O'Higgins made the last day.  The suggestion which he made in regard to section 7 was well founded.  Equally, if I thought that his suggestion with regard to section 2 was well-founded I would either put down an amendment to that effect or accept the Senator's amendment.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied, having examined the matter in some detail since the debate last week, that the amendment proposed is neither necessary nor desirable. The situation is perfectly clear.  As Senator O'Higgins rightly points out and as he accepts himself, I have no intention of ever placing anybody, or attempting to place anybody, in military custody under the provisions of this Bill.  More important than that, even if I so desired or if any successor of mine so desired, it would not be possible to do it under this Bill.  It is made perfectly clear that by virtue of section 3, which one must read in conjunction with section 2, it is the Minister for Justice who makes the regulations relating to the administration of places of detention established under section 2.  If there were any question of military custody it would have to be the Minister for Defence who would make those regulations. In any of our enactments relating to military custody it is clearly spelt out that the Minister for Defence is the ultimate custodian and that the Minister for Defence makes the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take the point adverted to by Senator Bourke, the interpretation that any reasonable person would <Col N="606" /> put on the fact that section 2 specifies that the provision of places under that section must be for the purpose of promoting rehabilitation is that it would be quite impossible to promote the rehabilitation of offenders in military custody.  They would be in the custody and control of the Defence Forces.  While the Defence Forces have very definite functions to fulfil, they themselves would be the last people to suggest that one of their functions could be the rehabilitation of offenders.</P>
    <P>One could go further and say in regard to almost any section in any Bill relating to prisons that one must accept that any Minister for Justice, who is responsible to the Oireachtas for the exercise of his statutory powers, will approach these matters in a reasonable fashion.  I could make the point that, for example, there is no provision specifically in our prison legislation which would prevent me as Minister for Justice from directing that all the staff in our prisons should be serving soldiers.  In a sense, therefore, without this Bill at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has an opportunity to put in the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I could, in theory, ensure in this way that every prisoner held in our prisons was held in military custody.  However, a certain degree of reasonableness and rationality is expected from any Minister for Justice in dealing with prisoners and the care of prisoners.  It would be unthinkable that I or any successor of mine would do that. Equally, it would be unthinkable that I or any successor of mine would try to use section 2, as it now stands, to transfer people of 17 to 21 years or of any other age into military custody. If one were to bring the argument to its logical conclusion there is no specific provision in our present legislation which prohibits me as Minister for Justice from appointing persons with say, the most appalling perversions as members of the staff of all our prisons but naturally I will not do it.  Neither will any successor of mine.  One takes a certain amount for granted.  One must do that.  One does not legislate against that sort of thing.  That is what <Col N="607" /> Parliament is there for.  If a Minister were to try to use this section to the effect that Senator O'Higgins has suggested both Parliament and our courts would deal with him very quickly. Since, in my view, there is no possibility under this Bill of the section being used for the purpose for which Senator O'Higgins suggests it might be used, I feel I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>It was interesting to note that the Minister said that he would accept and, if necessary, put down amendments himself where they were necessary, desirable or reasonable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it for granted that everything the Minister said was relevant.  However, if the Minister <Col N="608" /> thinks the only portion of his remarks relevant to this discussion was on the question of whether the amendment was necessary or not, I shall deal with it on that basis.</P>
      <P>The case I make is that, as it stands, on the face of it, the section, if it is left unaltered, implicitly contains the power for the Minister to transfer juvenile offenders to military custody. I do not think the Minister can argue about that and I do not think he has endeavoured to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, those powers are contained in the section because they are not excluded. There is no phrase, there is no word, there is no sentence in the section which excludes them.  The only possibility of exclusion lies in the phrase to which Senator Bourke has referred, the qualification that the transfer must be for the purpose of promoting the rehabilitation of the offenders, and as Senator Bourke has argued, and I agree with her, it is possible&mdash;I do not say it is necessarily reasonable&mdash;that it could be held that the transfer to military custody was for the purpose of rehabilitating the offenders.</P>
      <P>The Minister argues that the interpretation could not be taken by any reasonable person.  I do not suggest that the Minister is unreasonable but it is relevant to point out that the person who will be interpreting the provisions of this section will be the Minister for Justice, either the present Minister or some future Minister.  The Minister for Justice will be his own judge and jury in deciding what that particular phrase means.  It is open to him to come to the conclusion&mdash;and he may do it quite reasonably, he may do it for reasons which are not apparent to me or to the present Minister at the moment but which may be revelant in the future&mdash; that the particular circumstances of the day make it desirable, for the purpose of rehabilitating the offender, to transfer him to military custody.  If a Minister in the future comes to that decision the case I am making is that he will have those powers under the section if the Minister does not alter it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> Any doubt can be removed by accepting the terms of my amendment. I know the Minister is genuinely appalled at the thought that any Minister would interpret this section in that way but I do not think it is so outrageous at all.  Remember, a very short while ago the Minister's predecessor introduced the Criminal Justice Bill, 1967.  In section 45 of that Bill there was specific provision being made for the transfer of civilian prisoners to military custody.  If the present Minister does not recall the precise terms of that section I have them here and I can read them out to him.  He is correct in saying that that section did provide that where there was a transfer to military custody the Minister for Defence would have the responsibility for making the regulations in relation to the places and manner generally in which the people would be detained but there was provision made in that Bill at section 45 for the transfer of civilian prisoners to military custody.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister recall the reasons which were given for the inclusion of that section in the Criminal Justice Bill, 1967?  The Bill we are dealing with at present, as the Minister is aware, deals, in part, with the question of overcrowding of civilian prisons and contains in later sections power to deal with the question of overcrowding by means of transfer.  The argument made by his predecessor when he introduced the Criminal Justice Bill, 1967, in relation to section 45, which sought to give power to the Minister to transfer civilian prisoners to military custody, was a possible lack of accommodation and overcrowding if a substantial number of people, in furtherance of a protest or something of that sort&mdash;I am sure he did not put it that way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;were put into prison at the same time, that the place might become overcrowded and there might not be sufficient accommodation or sufficient staff.  That was the suggestion. I have the Minister's Second Reading speech here if any Senator <Col N="610" /> thinks that I am misrepresenting him, but I certainly do not want to misrepresent him.  Possibly the best thing would be to refer the Minister to it. He will find it dealt with in page 31 of the typescript of the Minister's Second Reading speech which was circulated in the Dáil.  I do not think that I am misrepresenting the position when I say that the case made was because of the possibility of overcrowding and not having sufficient accommodation when it was thought that the accommodation would only be required for short-term purposes. What interests me about it in relation to the particular matter here is that on re-reading that section of the Minister's Second Reading speech it did not occur to me that it was very much on the cards that if a substantial number of people were sent to jail in the particular events he described, those people, or a number of them, would be in the younger age group and probably a number of them would be juveniles, so that it seemed to me that it was contemplated in relation to the Criminal Justice Bill that juveniles might be transferred to military custody.</P>
      <P>I do not think that it is at all too far-fetched in this context to say that the present Minister, although I doubt it, or some other Minister for Justice may, in the context of a situation which was visualised by his predecessor in relation to the Bill of 1967, come to the conclusion that the power of transferring to military custody exists by virtue of section 2 of the present Bill.  I think that I have made it abundantly clear that I accept fully the good intentions and the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister in relation to this but I would very strongly urge on him that he is legislating now not merely for himself but for future Ministers for Justice also and that it is his job and our job to see to it that in our legislation we say what we mean and we do not put into the Bill something we do not mean.  If it is not the intention of the Minister to have the power to transfer prisoners of this kind to military custody let him be quite clear about it and provide it in the Bill.  Let him exclude that power and put it down quite clearly.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the very clear case made by Senator O'Higgins.  If we are really sincere in endeavouring to pursue this concept of rehabilitation, the Minister must be quite definite about what he wants to do in section 2 of the Bill.  Also I think that this is where the money must be spent.  Some years ago a big mistake was made not just in closing some of the old barracks in Cork, Sligo or Naas but in not replacing and modernising some institutions.  The Minister very kindly allowed me last week to see the prison in Portlaoise and, on the point that has been raised, I think that the big drawback there is the fact that there are prisoners there who are there for varying crimes and there are even people there who are on remand.  This is a big mistake.  At least we should ensure that under section 2 of this Bill young offenders whom we hope to have rehabilitated will get a fair crack of the whip and that at least there will be some effort to segregate.</P>

      <P>Very briefly I want to say that the premise on which Senator O'Higgins's argument is based is that it is open to the Minister for Justice under this section and under the Bill in general, presumably, to transfer persons to military custody; and if that premise were correct there might be some validity in his argument and in his amendment. But because his premise is totally incorrect there is therefore no validity in his subsequent argument or in his amendment.  It is impossible under the section as it stands for the Minister for Justice to transfer prisoners to military custody.  Therefore the rest of Senator O'Higgins's argument does not arise. Furthermore, as Senator O'Higgins has pointed out to this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told <Col N="612" /> the House why it is impossible, and the most basic reason of all is that on an ordinary straightforward reading of it it would be impossible to put the construction on the section of the Bill that Senator O'Higgins attempts to put on it.  I want to point out further that in the course of his latest remarks and of his amendment Senator O'Higgins states that in a matter such as this the sole judge and jury on the question of transfers is the Minister for Justice.</P>

Senator O'Higgins knows that as well as I do. His arguments are quite attractive to someone who accepts this premise, but his original starting ground is totally erroneous and therefore everything he says subsequently is not relevant.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that it is impossible for him to do a particular thing&mdash;to transfer civilian prisoners to military custody under this section.  He relies on his earlier argument which he made as proof of that. I do not think that it is any proof. Let us take the section as it stands.  I do not think that the Minister would dispute that the Minister has under its wording got a degree of discretion under this particular section.  &ldquo;The Minister may ...&rdquo;&mdash;this means that under the section as it stands for the purpose of promoting the rehabilitation of offenders, for a particular purpose, the Minister is being given discretionary powers.</P>

      <P>And as I pointed out, the person who is going to interpret that at the time the act of transfer is being done is the Minister and nobody else.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that you can go in next day or next week or next month or next year to the courts and seek a declaration either by way of the procedures which the Minister mentioned or by another procedure from which the Fianna Fáil Government have suffered from time to time, of seeking a declaration that the powers given to the Minister are unconstitutional.  That is all very well but at the time the Minister makes his decision to transfer the prisoner the Minister and nobody else is the person interpreting and entitled to interpret that particular power.  We have established that the Minister gets discretion under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What discretionary power is the Minister being given to provide places other than prisons for the detention of persons?  What are the limitations and qualifications attached to that power?  The only limitation is that these places must be places other than prisons.  It does not say they must be places which are under civilian jurisdiction and authority, only that they must be places other than prisons.  In my view the Minister is at liberty to transfer prisoners to places which may be under military control.  They must be places other than prisons.  That is the only limitation to the places that the Minister may select.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us to look at section 3 in relation to this, it is interesting to note that the regulations which the Minister may make under that section of the Bill, and which have to be laid before the Oireachtas, have nothing to do with the places so far as the actual locale is concerned. The regulations which may be made <Col N="614" /> under section 3 are for the rule and management of the places and not the actual situation of the places.  That cannot come back before the House. Only the rule and management of the places and the classification, treatment, employment and control of the persons detained in it can.  This is what we are concerned with and we have to regard the legislation being enacted in this House at the present time as meaning what it says.  It is no answer for the Minister to say that a person can go along to court and get a declaration. It is not reasonable to put that meaning on it although it is there on the face of it that there is no limitation imposed on the places that the Minister may select.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

There are no limitations on the places that the Minister may select other than that they should not be prisons and that the power should be exercised for the purpose of promoting the rehabilitation of the offender.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said my premises are completely false.  Perhaps they are, and if they are it is the fault of this section because I am taking this section at its face value.  I am looking at the section which the Minister has served up to us.  I take it if the Minister says that he wants power to transfer juvenile civilian prisoners to any place other than prisons that that is exactly what he means and he is asking us for authority to transfer them to any place including places of military custody.</P>

It is quite clear to me that the only person who could provide places for detention under military control or custody is the Minister for Defence.</P>

While it is true as Senator Ryan has said the Minister could not direct the transfer of prisoners under section 2, he can only provide places under that section, under section 5 he has power to direct the transfer of prisoners to those places which he has provided under section 2.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that if he happens to meet the Minister for Defence and asks him if he has a suitable barracks in which to house a number of young persons that he wants to transfer from St. Patrick's and the Minister for Defence says, &ldquo;Yes, I have such a place and not only have I such a place but I have a whole lot of soldiers knocking sparks off the barrack square and if you are in any difficulty about staff I can give you the staff to do it&rdquo;, as long as he has this authority and as long as he has a Minister for Defence willing to go along with him, there is nothing in the world to prevent him under section 2 of this Bill from providing, by means of the willingness of the Minister for Defence, this place under military custody?  Is that not true?  All I am saying is that the power is there.  That is what was contemplated by the Minister's predecessor when he introduced the Criminal Justice Bill of 1967.  Section 45 of that Bill sought the power to transfer civilian prisoners to military custody and the Minister argued the case there. He had dealt with the suggestion that military custody might be more harsh or severe than civilian custody and disposed of fears in that regard.  He went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for the suggestion that a transfer to military custody is a harsh or punitive measure.  The question <Col N="617" /> remains: why is such a provision necessary?</P>
    <P>The answer to this is that I hope it will never be necessary to use it but that there is a distinct possibility that it may be needed.  We are living in a time when it has become almost a fashion for groups of one kind or another to engage in planned and systematic breaches of the law in order to create a situation in which, ultimately, they have to be committed to prison.  That is what they seek and, under the system of law we have, we must accept the fact that if any group of people are determined to get themselves into prison, they are likely, ultimately, to succeed.</P>
    <P>I agree with him on that.  He then went on:</P>
    <P>I now come to the heart of the problem.  Our prisons have neither the accommodation nor the staff to cater for a sudden influx of any substantial number of persons and we have already experienced the situation in which the available accommodation and staff resources were taxed to the limit.</P>

I have made what I believe to be a relevant and valid point that in the context of the situation as envisaged by the Minister's predecessor, the persons likely to become involved in these breaches of the law and who would find themselves committed to prison are young persons.  Under section 45 of the Bill of 1967 it was deliberately and positively contemplated by the Minister that such persons could be transferred to military custody.</P>

The fact is that the Minister for Justice cannot do so anyway regardless of whether this House may or may not give him such power because the Minister for Justice has no jurisdiction whatever in so far as the military are concerned.

However, I would ask the Minister to consider the following hypothetical situation. Despite his assurances is it not theoretically possible that a successor of the present Minister for Justice could decide that he has the power under this section to transfer somebody to some establishment, maybe to military custody, and if such a person should take an action in the High Court for <i>habeas corpus</i> the court, because of the particular circumstances and because of the division of powers, as well as because of a certain lack of clarity in the drafting of this Bill could decide that this future Minister was right in using his powers under this Act to transfer a person in this way?</P>

Admittedly, the Senator has put forward a hypothetical case but his suggestion is still inconceivable.  This is borne out by the fact that specific provision for military custody had to be made in section 45 of the Criminal Justice Bill.  This provision was spelled out in great detail.

      <P>With reference to what the Minister said on the Second Reading in the Dáil I take it although he might not envisage large rehabilitation centres that he has not stopped himself from setting up other centres. I did not read his comments on the last day here but I take it that he does not envisage any other rehabilitation centres at the moment apart from Shanganagh and that in fact he leaves himself open to the possibility of experimenting in this area of providing small centres and providing open prisons on the lines of those in Scandinavian countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out we have a relatively small prison population and one which is not as dangerous or as difficult to cope with as that in other countries.  We are lucky in this and we could not only improve our rehabilitation work but give a <Col N="621" /> lead to other countries.  I would not like to think that this was just a confirmation of the existence of Shanganagh. I would like to think it leaves the way open to a possible study in this area and the introduction of small rehabilitation centres.  I would like some comments from the Minister on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Miss Bourke says.  In the Dáil I said that unfortunately, much as I would wish it was otherwise, I could not promise the Dáil or the Seanad that we would be able to establish another centre similar to that at Shanganagh in the immediate future but that it was certainly my intention that a similar centre would be established, first of all, as soon as we found a suitable site&mdash;because it is not easy to get a suitable site&mdash;and, secondly, as soon as we have sufficient money to do it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of large rehabilitation centres, experience in other countries has shown that large centres of, say, 100 or more people are not as successful as the smaller centres of around 55, as we have in Shanganagh, and rather than increase the population of Shanganagh I would as a matter of policy prefer to open another separate centre.  If I may broaden my remarks on this section somewhat I would hope that open centres, where the institutionalisation is less than in the traditional type of prison, would play a much more prominent part in our criminology from now on and that, in particular, non-institutional methods would have, if at all possible, a major role in rehabilitation because I believe the greatest hope of success lies there. Strangely enough and happily enough, because this does not often happen, what is socially most desirable and most successful both from the point of view of society and from the point of view of the individual offender fortunately happens to be the most economic from the point of view of the Exchequer.  So, we have a happy combination there which I trust will allow me to ensure that non-institutional approaches to rehabilitation will play a very prominent part.</P>

      <P>Further to the Minister's <Col N="622" /> remarks I assume he will interpret the words &ldquo;places of detention&rdquo; in that sense that we have been calling his attention to.  If that was construed narrowly it might mean institutionalisation in the sense of full detention, whereas if it is construed in a broader sense it may mean a more open type of detention.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (a), line 24, before &ldquo;age&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;general suitability,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a matter I also raised on the Second Stage discussion.  I want to say to the Minister I am not particularly insistent on the particular words I have chosen for this amendment.  My point of view in relation to this is that the Minister has been rather too restrictive in the drafting of section 3, subsection (1) (a) in that the regulations which he may make under that particular subsection can only have regard to the age and sex of the class of persons to be detained in those places that may be provided.  The regulations can only specify those classes by reference to age and sex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume it is generally conceded <Col N="623" /> that if the pattern being contemplated is a pattern on the lines of the open centre at Shanganagh there will be a necessity for a very definite amount of screening and selectivity in deciding on what prisoners would qualify for transfer.  I do not think I am being too optimistic in saying that in this screening and in this selection the Minister, the staff or whoever is directly concerned in making the actual selection of the people who may be transferred will have regard to a whole lot of relevant factors concerning the basic character of the persons concerned to make sure they are people who are likely to benefit from rehabilitation in a place such as the open centre at Shanganagh. In other words, there will be factors other than the sex and age of the prisoners which must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I would feel happier in any event, although I can see the argument might be made that it might be dangerous to give any Minister the power which I am suggesting here, if the Minister as the head of the Department of Justice at least had the authority to make regulations in a broad way which would establish the classes who qualify for transfer in a more general way than is suggested here in one sense but in a more particular way in another sense.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be entitled in making his regulations not merely to have regard to the age and sex of prisoners but he should be entitled to set out guidelines which could be acted on as regards the general suitability of prisoners falling into particular classes, and should be entitled to have regard to their general conduct and demeanour and should also be entitled to have regard to the question of whether or not the prisoner is a first offender and whether he has a good record both prior to actual imprisonment and during imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister will say that obviously these are the kind of things which will be taken into account and that there are trained personnel who will be able to advise on these matters.  The Minister may say that there are visiting committees who will <Col N="624" /> be able to advise on these matters and that all these things will be taken into account when the individual selections are made.  I think it would be a good idea not merely from the point of view of the individual selections but so that everyone will know where he stands if the Minister had authority to have regard in the general regulations to such matters as general suitability.  I have chosen that particular phrase as being one of the fairly general nature. If the Minister felt there was some validity in this point of view I do not want to be committed or to commit the Minister to that particular phrase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Senator O'Higgins is getting at in his amendment.  For a number of reasons I think it is not really suitable.  That is a bad word to use because &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; is the word used in the amendment.  The main reason I feel that way is that one is dealing here with individual human beings, all of whom have particular individual characteristics and all of whom have to be assessed in some depth by a number of qualified people who have observed and studied them intensely over a period.  If the Minister for Justice tries to lay down abstract rules covering the transfer of people to the open centre at Shanganagh it would be impossible to do so.  It would be impossible to make regulations in the abstract which would ensure that justice was done and that the proper rehabilitative effect was achieved in each case.  The best thing we can do is to leave it to the psychologist and the governors and welfare officers attached to the institutions concerned who are in the best position to judge and to make decisions and advise the Minister in the best interests of the offender concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be possible for a Minister to make positive regulations of a general character setting out the sort of people who should be transferred.  It would be very difficult to word that.  It might well be that there would be an appreciable number of people who did not come into the prescribed category but who were well worthy of transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The easier way might be to set <Col N="625" /> out certain negative conditions, in other words, to say that certain people who came into a particular category should not be transferred.  It would be easier to draft but one could envisage cases where even that could cause hardship in an individual case.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins's suggestion of trying to spell out these things in advance and lay down hard and fast rules runs counter to what my predecessor and myself have sought to establish at Shanganagh, a very flexible type of administration where the complicated detailed prison rules which exist in our other institutions do not exist.  It has been found to operate far more satisfactorily in practice with these sort of flexible rules rather than by rules whereby everyone must do things according to the book whether it is right to do them or not or whether it is for the benefit of a particular person or not.  That concept must be dropped.</P>
    <P>The governor, psychologist and welfare people are there for the purpose of rehabilitating each individual offender to the greatest extent possible.  I think we would hinder them in their work if we tried to lay down too many regulations as to how these people were to go about their work.  Very often the authorities are dealing with difficult people with unusual individual characteristics.  It would be an unnecessary complication in the work of those who are trying to ensure the rehabilitation of these people if one were to be too precise about what is to be laid down as guidelines.  That is why the regulations I propose are going to be minimal in a sense and give the greatest possible discretion and freedom to people who are well qualified to act in the interests of the individual offenders.</P>
    <P>There is a very technical reason why that could not be accepted because paragraph (b) of subsection (1) would create a rather strange situation.  Then if somebody absconded from Shanganagh he therefore could not be regarded as having been generally suitable and having regard to what paragraph (b) says he might claim that he was illegally detained there in the first instance.  There might be an interesting <Col N="626" /> Constitutional action which would entertain lawyers for a few weeks but would not achieve much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not committed to the actual wording.  I appreciated the Minister's argument.  This is not a matter which I regard as being in any way controversial.  It is the kind of thing on which a number of heads are better than one.  It seems to me under the subsection as drafted all the Minister can say effectively in his regulation is that Shanganagh, for example, should be open for the reception of male prisoners not over the age of so many years, and really that he cannot do more than that.  It may be that the Minister is right in thinking that is as far as he should go and that it should be a question for the experts to select the actual prisoners.  The selection of prisoners must be on expert guidance and on the kind of intimate knowledge that the people in charge and the experts have.  The whole purpose of this Bill and the purpose of the open centre at Shanganagh is to provide a place for rehabilitation for people who are likely to benefit from it.  The whole emphasis here is on rehabilitation and on the opening of the centre in Shanganagh for people who are likely to benefit from it.</P>
      <P>The Minister, as head of the Department of Justice, should be entitled to do a bit more than simply to say it should be open to people not over a certain age and of a particular sex. To stop there limits the power which the Minister should have in this kind of thing.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that Minister should make the selection but it would be a pity if things went wrong because the wrong kind of person was sent to Shanaganagh and I feel that the Minister may, in future years, if anything goes wrong there, regret that he did not have the power to say in regulations that this centre shall be open to male prisoners not over the age of such and such and who have been, for example, certified by the authorities in St. Patrick's as capable of benefiting from the facilities in Shanganagh.  However I am not pressing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to oppose <Col N="627" /> this amendment for the reasons given by the Minister.  I feel it is inappropriate to use a Ministerial regulation to try to set out something that is subjective and is different for each individual. I consider the Minister is right in confining his powers here to prescribing the sex and the age of persons who will be sent to such centres.  The best people to decide on suitability are those who are involved with the individuals concerned and who are aware of their possibilities of benefiting from rehabilitation.  I can see what Senator O'Higgins is getting at but I feel that an attempt to define suitability, to set out classes of suitability or qualifications which would make a person suitable would become a straitjacket which would, in fact, hinder those who would best know the type of person who might benefit from the centre.  Therefore, I feel the Minister is right in not trying to assume the power to do this in regulations and I oppose this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got a specific amendment down but I note that under section 7 when the Minister is exercising his power to transfer detainees from St. Patrick's to a prison he does so after consultation with the visiting committee at St. Patrick's Institution but under section 3 where he is making detailed regulations relating to these rehabilitation centres he is not consulting anyone.  I wonder whether, especially under subsection (2) where the Minister may make regulations for the classification, treatment, employment and control of persons detained therein which is quite a specialised task the Minister intends to set up an advisory committee or whether this will be done in some way in consultation with expert bodies of this nature and whether this needs to be written into the Bill.  I would be happier to know that this would not be done merely at the Minister's discretion, that he would, in fact, be consulting experts in this field as to the <Col N="628" /> control, employment and rehabilitation work going on.</P>

      <P>I can certainly give an assurance to the Senator that I will. The fact that I am not consulting the visiting committee to Shanganagh in connection with the regulations to be made under subsection (2) of section 3 is that, unfortunately, as Senators will be aware, there is not yet a visiting committee, so I cannot consult them but certainly before I make the regulations under subsection (2) I will have the views of those who are best qualified to give views and I will also have the benefit of seeing the regulations for various similar centres in Britain and on the Continent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Classification&rdquo; as such will not have to be specifically mentioned in the regulations which will apply to Shanganagh.  Inside prisons the object of classification is to segregate prisoners having regard to their age and temperament and with a view to maintaining good order and facilitating training and, of course, with a view to keeping unconvicted prisoners out of contact with convicted prisoners as far as this can reasonably be done. The Senator will appreciate that that sort of division or &ldquo;classification&rdquo; would not be as necessary in Shanganagh because the offenders sent there would more or less all fall into the same classification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  Section 17 (3) of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914 gives a court power to commit direct to prisons.  As I said in the Dáil we have found it desirable that the courts should not be given that power in relation to Shanganagh because experience has shown that a court has not got the facilities available to it correctly to assess the suitability or otherwise of a particular offender for committal to a place such as Shanganagh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of that Act is a transfer provision which authorises the Prison Commissions, that is now the Minister for Justice, if he is satisfied that a person undergoing penal servitude or imprisoned in consequence of a sentence passed either before or after the passing of the Act, might with advantage be detained in a borstal institution&mdash;&ldquo;borstal institution&rdquo; is now taken to read &ldquo;St. Patrick's Institution&rdquo;&mdash; to transfer him from prison to what is now St. Patrick's, there to serve the whole or any part of the unexpired residue of his sentence.  The provision in subsection (2) is that the power of transfer given by section 3 of the 1908 Act is not to apply.  It makes it plain that the only power of transfer out of Shanganagh or a similar place to St. Patrick's Institution will be that <Col N="630" /> provided under subsection (1) of section 5.  The effect of subsection (1), incidentally, is to prevent me transferring to prison someone who was originally sentenced to detention in St. Patrick's. For example, if someone sentenced to detention in St. Patrick's and transferred by me under section 5 (1) to Shanganagh misbehaved himself in some way in Shanganagh, I would have to transfer him back to St. Patrick's.  I could not transfer him from Shanganagh to a prison.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to this.  It deals with what I mentioned on Second Reading.  It does flow from this that in the future persons in the 19 to 21 age group will be sent on transfer, and I want to ask the Minister two questions arising on section 6 &mdash;first, if he has a timetable fixed in his mind for the making of an order bringing this into operation; and, secondly, if there is any reasonable possibility in what I might call the reasonably foreseeable future of providing separate quarters for the 19 to 21 age group&mdash;I know that there is a separate section of Mountjoy set aside &mdash;but I mean separate quarters in the sense of a completely separate building. Once this situation has arisen where they cannot be committed or even sent, except possibly by transfer back, and cannot be sent to St. Patrick's, I think a desirable thing would be if possible that there should be a separate centre, a separate building entirely for them.  I know that there is a question of cost and all that involved here, and I am wondering if the Minister could give some indication of his thoughts on the subject of whether or not it is possible in the foreseeable future that such quarters might be provided.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Senator I have no precise date in mind for the making of an order bringing section 6 into force because it is dependent on the availability of separate quarters and I do not want to bring it in until I am in a position to keep the 19 to 21 group apart from the remaining prisoners.  The work of providing a particular section of Mountjoy Prison for the occupation of the 19 to 21 group is in hands but I am not quite clear when it will be completed. I will make the order as soon as it has been completed but not earlier than that, because I do not want to put them in with the ordinary adult prisoners in Mountjoy.  I accept in principle, as indeed it is easy to do, Senator O'Higgins's suggestion of a separate building if possible, a completely separate institution rather than a separate section in Mountjoy.  What I have in mind would be that if we were lucky enough and things worked out that way and we were able to afford it we should have a completely new institution for the 16 to 19 year group and get the 19 to 21 group back into St. Patrick's.  I think that would be the more satisfactory way.  The prospect of success is bigger with the 16 to 19 year age group, and we should therefore spend more money on them.</P>

I might be wrongly construing the section, but it is open to the interpretation that the Minister could specify the number of prisoners who ought to be transferred to prison on his sole discretion without consulting the visiting committee, and that these might not necessarily be the persons who ought to be transferred to prison.  It is also not clear in this section on what grounds the Minister would chose a particular number or even particular individuals, and I would like some clarification on this.</P>

      <P>The reason the section does not contain a provision that I shall consult with the visiting committee is that the visiting committee are a part-time, unpaid voluntary body most, if not all, of whom are working and the necessity to transfer under the section would arise at very, very short notice.  It would be impossible to get the committee together to consult with them but I would of course consult with the governor and the welfare officers connected with the prisoners. I would normally accept their advice about the number of persons and also the choice of individuals.  I assume their approach to the matter would be to <Col N="634" /> transfer the most unruly people or the people less likely to benefit and that would be my approach too.  I assume they would recommend the transfer of those who were a bad influence and not benefiting from the place.</P>

      <P>As Minister, I must ultimately take responsibility for the transfer of each individual.  As an individual person, I am not likely to interfere with the transfer of any person.  I shall accept the advice given. But, as Minister, I must accept responsibility for the transfer of each named individual.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to get the things which the Bill gives me power to do started and having accepted the Senator's amendment I shall have to go back to the Dáil with it and this will hold the Bill up for some time.  I am not certain if there is anything arising out of the Committee Stage.  I have been reasonable about this and other Bills in allowing them to be put back but I would urge the House to give me the Report Stage now.</P>

      <P>I am not going to refuse to agree to the Report Stage but as a matter of principle I am asking the reason why it is sought.  I do not think it is a good idea for Government Ministers or anybody else to take it for granted that they will get all Stages immediately.</P>

      <P>The Senator said that last week.  As the Senator is new to this House I would like to <Col N="635" /> tell him that we have got on very well here with the system which has obtained for many years.  This House is not precisely like the Dáil and it is not customary to put up obstructions when there is no serious intention of making any further amendments on subsequent Stages.  If the Senator would co-operate a little more we would get a great deal more business done but if this continued obstruction persists it is not going to be very nice.</P>

      <P>I am sure all Senators are grateful to Senator Ó Maoláin for his lecture.  Perhaps at some stage he will elaborate on the statement I understood him to make about the practice of obstructing in the Dáil and the fact that that was not followed here.  The point I want to make, and I do insist on this, is that as far as I and those associated with me in this House are concerned we are going to insist, when we deem it necessary, on obtaining time to give proper and full consideration arising out of discussion of Bills whether it be Second Stage or Committee Stage. It might happen that no amendments spring to mind following on a Committee Stage discussion but after consideration Senators might want to put forward amendments.  I simply want to retain the rights of Senators to do that.  As far as I am concerned on this particular Bill and on this particular occasion I am quite agreeable to give the Minister the next Stage now.</P>

      <P>There is no question of a concession.  If the <Col N="636" /> Senator feels he has something to say on the Report Stage he should insist on his right to say it.  I am only suggesting to the Senator that common sense dictates we should work together instead of standing on one another's toes.</P>
