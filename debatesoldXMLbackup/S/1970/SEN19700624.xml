    <Title>International Health Bodies (Corporate Status) Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the incorporation in Ireland of any international body, the functions of which under their constitution relate wholly or mainly to the health of persons, health insurance, the care and treatment of the sick or infirm, medical (including dental) research or the administration of health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is of general application but it will in the first instance be used to enable the incorporation in Ireland of the International Federation of Voluntary Health Service Funds.  This body had its origins at the first International Conference on Voluntary Health Insurance <Col N="639" /> held in Dublin in September, 1966 at which the delegates decided to establish an international federation to promote co-operation in the development and and study of voluntary nonprofit making health services throughout the world.  At the second international conference held in Sydney in 1968 a constitution was adopted and it was also decided at that meeting that the headquarters of the newly constituted International Federation of Voluntary Health Service Funds would be in Dublin.  The Council of Management of the Federation discussed the question of the incorporation of the federation so as to give it a legal existence and decided in the first instance to seek incorporation in Ireland if that were feasible, or otherwise to seek incorporation in another country suitable for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The federation at present consists of 83 organisations providing health services broadly speaking similar to those which are being provided by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board which is the Irish organisation in membership. The General Manager of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is in fact the first Secretary General and Treasurer of the Federation.</P>
    <P>I consider it desirable that an international organisation of the standing and potentiality of this federation should be encouraged in the establishment of headquarters in Ireland and facilitated as respects incorporation in Ireland.  Existing legislation, including the Companies Act, is not suitable for the purpose and hence the necessity for the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have of course a secondary objective. The Bill is, as I have said, in general terms and can be used to facilitate other appropriate and suitable international bodies in the health field who may wish to be incorporated here to do so.  I would hope that the International Federation of Voluntary Health Service Funds would be the first of many such organisations who might be attracted to come here.</P>
    <P>The House will readily appreciate the significance to the country and to the economy in prestige and economic <Col N="640" /> terms if we were to become a recognised centre of international activity in the health field.  We have much to offer in location and facilities.  The fringe benefit to our tourist industry would indeed be significant.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is straightforward enough and in view of its size and directness calls for little explanation. The Minister for Health will be the appropriate Minister for the purposes of the Bill and the bodies concerned will be international bodies with functions relating to health or the administration of health services.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that any such body may apply to the Minister for Health to make a corporate status order in relation to that body.  On the Minister's deciding to make a corporate status order that body will then be a body corporate with perpetual succession and with power to sue and be sued in its corporate name and to hold land. There are other minor requirements that may be imposed by the Minister in the order such as the title to be used by the body and the provision of a seal and its authentication.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention, however, to the provisions of section 8 of the Bill which provide that before any order granting corporate status is made a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.  In other words the Houses of the Oireachtas individually will have the opportunity of examining each such order before it is made and will have the right to veto any such order.  This procedure will ensure that incorporation under the Bill is publicity seen to be subject to the full scrutiny of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires that any such body granted incorporation will be obliged to maintain an office in the State and shall supply to the Minister for Health any such information regarding its activities or accounts as he may reasonably require.  The Minister is obliged to maintain a register of such bodies and this register will be kept open for public inspection during normal office hours.  With the register will be kept <Col N="641" /> for public inspection, copies of the constitutions of the bodies and the address of the office maintained by the registered body.</P>
    <P>A corporate status order may be revoked, in either of two ways.  First, on the application of the organisation to which it relates, and provided the Minister agrees, and secondly, when the Minister considers it would be in the public interest to do so.  Provision is made for particular requirements to be included in the revocation order so as to safeguard the interests of the body itself and of those with whom it has dealings.  Again, I might point out that the revocation order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House within the next 21 days in which the House has sat the order shall be annulled.  Provision has been made in the Bill for the expenses of the Minister.  These expenses will be of a very minimal nature.</P>
    <P>As already indicated I consider this Bill is desirable.  I have built in adequate safeguards in the Bill itself which should allay any fears Senators may have in relation to the type of body which will be incorporated.  I would therefore commend it to the House for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I really have not got any doubt about the desirability of the Minister and the Government seeking to encourage the establishment of this country as a venue for bodies such as the federation to which the Minister has referred.  In that sense I not only appreciate the value which a Bill of this sort may be but I feel that it is desirable to have machinery which will assist in that particular objective, but I think it is only right to say that I am in some considerable doubt to know (1) the necessity for this Bill at all and (2) what situation the Minister envisages arising so far as bodies corporate are concerned under an order which will be made on foot of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his introductory speech says bluntly:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing legislation, including the Companies Act, is not suitable for <Col N="642" /> the purpose and hence the necessity for the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given any explanation for that, good, bad or indifferent. He simply says that the existing legislation including the Companies Act is not suitable and leaves it at that.  I want to ask the Minister why in his view the provisions of the Companies Act are not suitable, are not adequate, to deal with the particular type of situation which he wants to deal with under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to be an expert by any means in company legislation but it is true to say that a very great deal of the credit for this goes to the late Deputy Gerry Sweetman.  It is true to say also that we have in recent years up-dated our company law to a very great extent.  It is probably as up-to-date and as comprehensive as the company law code in England.  The provisions under the Companies Act, 1963 are very detailed not merely as regards the incorporation of companies here but as regards the management, control and general running of companies in the State.  It goes into very great detail with regard to the responsibility and duties of officers of companies and such matters as the winding up or liquidation of companies and dealing with their assets and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to contradict the Minister when he implies that our company law code is not suitable for this particular purpose but I think it is right if the Minister comes in and makes that case to the House that he should be in a position&mdash;no doubt he is&mdash;to tell the House in what way we fall short of what is desired so far as the company law of the land is concerned.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to go on to the next point and I would ask the Minister to accept that what I am saying is not in any way intended as critical of the desire to have the particular federation to which he referred, or similar bodies, establish themselves in this country.  It is a very desirable thing to see and I agree fully with the remarks the Minister made with regard to it but, having asking the Minister to give information in explanation of <Col N="643" /> it, I want to go on to ask him whether, instead of introducing a Bill of this sort, if our company legislation falls short of what is needed, it would not seem more appropriate to tackle the job of amending or expanding that as may be necessary to cover such cases as are intended to be covered in this Bill rather than to introduce what, I think, must be regarded as part of a company law code having reference to a particular field only, that is, the field of health services or health research. Would it not be better that the company law standing on its own should be comprehensive and cover cases of this sort?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister must look at this from the standpoint of his position as Minister for Health rather than having regard to considerations which might be more relevant to other Ministries, but it does seem to me that it is in some way an anomaly, if our company law is not adequate at the moment to cover this situation, that the Bill before us should concern itself with health organisations only. Granted the desirability of the objective which the Minister sees and about which he has spoken, it occurs to me that the same objective and the same reasons may be valid in relation to fields other than health, in relation, for example, to labour organisations of one sort or another.  I wonder would it not be more appropriate, instead of having a Bill dealing generally with organisations in the health field, to have a Bill simply dealing generally with organisations, regardless of what particular field they fall into?</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister also what form, roughly, does he visualise the orders which he might make under this Bill would take.  I have mentioned that under the company law code there are very detailed provisions regarding the control, management, running of companies, of corporate bodies. There are provisions dealing with such things as the conduct of meetings of boards or meetings of directors, the duties of directors, the duties of officers of companies&mdash;the secretary and so on. Does the Minister intend that these kinds of provisions should be incorporated <Col N="644" /> in orders which he will make or is it intended simply to make an order by which the constitution of the body which wishes to establish itself here will be adopted as the appropriate instrument for the control of the affairs of the corporate body in this country?</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 5 of the Bill for a register to be kept and in section 5 (2) (b) it is provided that:</P>
    <P>with the register, there shall also be kept available for public inspection copies of the constitutions (including amendments) of the registered bodies.</P>
    <P>I would take it from that that what the Minister has in mind is that these bodies will supply copies of whatever constitutions they have drafted and that the order which the Minister might make under section 3 will, in effect, adopt those constitutions to be the effective instruments of the control and management of the bodies in this country. If that is so, it seems to me that this Bill should in some way provide for consultation between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Industry and Commerce because I feel that at least one should query a situation arising whereby, no matter how desirable they might be and no matter how desirable their objects might be, you could have a system in this country in relation to corporate bodies that some of them are controlled under the provisions of the Companies Act and must comply strictly with the provisions of the Companies Act and others, by virtue of this Bill which we are discussing today, may have provisions in their constitution which would simply not be allowed or might not be allowed under the provisions of the Companies Act.  I cannot off-hand think of a good example of that because I have not had occasion to refresh myself on the Companies Act recently but the kind of thing that might arise, for example, would be the provisions in the Companies Act which would make it unlawful for a company to buy its own shares.  Supposing there was some provision in a constitution drafted outside the country and drafted with an eye to continental law, which might have had <Col N="645" /> no application in the context of our Companies Act, which ran counter to that and which enabled a corporate body outside to purchase its own shares.  That would seem to me to raise a conflict between two different codes once that body is established in this country and it is the kind of thing on which I would feel there should be consultation between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Industry and Commerce before any order under section 3 of the Bill is made.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides in subsection (6) for the courts to take judicial notice of the seals of any bodies that were established under a corporate status order under this Bill.  It goes a bit further than merely taking judicial notice.  It provides, in effect, that any instrument bearing the seal of such a body shall be accepted as evidence without proof unless the contrary is shown.  I do not know what effect the last few words would have because obviously if the contrary is shown it would mean that in fact the instrument had not been sealed or had not been properly sealed at all.  I may be wrong here but I feel that that goes very much further in relation to the use of a seal than is the position as regards bodies incorporated under the Companies Act, 1963, and I am wondering what is the purpose of it.</P>
    <P>There is one particular provision in the Bill on which the Minister has commented and it is worth noting.  It is the provision under section 8 whereby before any order under section 3&mdash; that is what is called here a corporate status order&mdash;is made it will come before each House of the Oireachtas in draft form.  I am delighted the Minister has put this provision into the Bill. Far too often we have to deal with legislation depending on Ministerial orders when a situation exists under the legislation that an order is made by the Minister and the only power the Oireachtas has in relation to it is to put down an order seeking to annul it as is provided in subsection (2) of section 8.  It is a vast improvement on the normal situation that the draft order should come before each House of the Oireachtas and that the actual order should not be made until a resolution <Col N="646" /> to pass it has gone through each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>My attitude to this Bill is that the object is certainly desirable.  I have nothing to say against it but I should like to have much more information about the Bill in general.  I should also like to know why our company law code is regarded as being inadequate to deal with the situation.  I query whether or not the Minister is correct in having a general Bill dealing purely with health organisations instead of bringing in a Bill to deal with the particular organisation in question, for which the companies provisions are apparently not sufficient.  If it is regarded as desirable to introduce a general Bill would it not be better to make it general in the true sense and not confine it merely to health organisations?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I can see the reasons put forward by the Minister for encouraging the setting up of international bodies in this country. It is, in fact, a continuation of the general idea that Dublin is becoming a world centre for international conferences. This is very good for us&mdash; very good for the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>Like Senator O'Higgins I have some difficulty in understanding the Bill itself. I understand the reason why international organisations such as this do not fall under the Companies Act, 1963, because of the definition of &ldquo;a company&rdquo; in that Act which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;company&rdquo; means a company formed and registered under this Act, or an existing company...</P>
      <P>Further on in that Act there is another definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;existing company&rdquo; means a company formed and registered in a register kept in the State under the Joint Stock Companies Acts, the Companies Act, 1862, or the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly these international bodies would not qualify under either of the definitions in that Act.  This seems to me to be a technical reason for excluding such international health bodies from the operations of the Companies <Col N="647" /> Act.  This is regrettable because much of what is contained in the 1963 Act is not merely regulations for companies but is very much for the protection of third parties who may be creditors of these companies or may be involved with these companies in some way.  When one looks at the provisions of the Companies Act such as the provisions relating to civil or criminal liability one finds that it is the duty of directors to furnish annual accounts, balance sheet and an auditor's report.  These provisions are all for the protection of third parties.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 3 states:</P>
    <P>A body to which a corporate status order relates shall, by virtue of the order, be a body corporate with perpetual succession and with power to sue and be sued in its corporate name and to hold land.</P>
    <P>These corporates will have status to sue in our courts and have power to hold land.  They will be involved in contracts and agreements with creditors living here.  It seems to me that under the Bill as it stands third parties who will be dealing with these international organisations will not have the protection they would have under the Government Act.  I wonder whether there is a certain danger here.  I imagine the type of institution which the Minister is contemplating will be a world organisation of high reputation.  Nevertheless, it is possible that an international health body might set up in this country and be financially insolvent and third parties would be completely at a loss as regard civil remedies.</P>
    <P>I do not think the provisions of section 7 of this Bill allow the Minister to make the necessary or expedient provisions consequential on revocation as to the dissolution of the transfer of property rights or the rights of such a body.  I would like to know who will assume the liability to third parties if an international health body did default? Why should international bodies be excluded from providing the safeguards for third parties required under our general companies law?  It seems to me that they do not fit within the <Col N="648" /> Companies Act because of a technicality of the definition.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister why he has decided to introduce this particular type of legislation in relation to health institutions and what protection he envisages under the Act for people in this country who will have legal relations with these companies?</P>

      <P>I have discussed this legislation with doctors and they all agree that the Bill will be of great benefit to Irish medicine especially in the fields of research and post-graduate work.  They, like Senator O'Higgins, wonder why these bodies could not be covered under the Companies Act but that is the only point the doctors I have spoken to have against the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was also asked to inquire if there is any provision in the Bill to cover fraudulent activities?  I should also like to know if any tax concessions will be given to attract these bodies. The members of the medical profession who asked me to make these points welcome this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I am going to be somewhat out of tune with the almost universal welcome to this Bill.  Of course I agree with the leader of my party in the House when he says that it is very desirable that we should have the headquarters of this International Federation of Voluntary Health Service Funds established in Dublin, but I am quite unable to accept the assertion&mdash;for assertion it simply is&mdash;by the Minister in his introductory statement that existing legislation, including the Companies Act, is not suitable for the purpose and hence the necessity for the introduction of this Bill.  We need to hear a great deal more than is contained in that assertion for this House to be satisfied that this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best thing about this Bill, I think, is that it is being introduced <Col N="649" /> in the Seanad, and it is over a year since we had a Bill introduced here, the first Bill introduced here since I became a Senator.  I am sorry if the Minister will find himself irritated by the fact that I will be making quite a number of points.  I am sorry to say, sorry for all Senators, that I will have to make some legal points but while I was able to take my coat off and hang it on the stand outside the Chamber, I was unable to leave my skin behind and I cannot fail to make use of any information that I have that I think is appropriate to the consideration of this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up the first point made by Senator Bourke, if I may, to dispose of it as I think it should be disposed of.  The Senator says that the Companies Act cannot be used, if I understand her correctly, because the definition of a company contained in section 2 of the Act, as being a company formed and registered under this Act or an existing company, does not apply.  Of course this federation can become a company registered under the Companies Act if it chooses to do so.  The Companies Act, and the Companies Act before the Companies Act of 1963, have long contemplated that there would be established bodies such as this federation and people dealing with such bodies have suitable protection.  Section 24 of the Companies Act provides in subsection (1):</P>
    <P>Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Minister that an association about to be formed as a limited company is to be formed for promoting commerce, art, science, religion, charity or any other useful object, and intends to apply its profits, if any, or other income, in promoting its objects, and to prohibit the payment of any dividend to its members, the Minister may by licence direct that the association may be registered as a company with limited liability, without the addition of the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;teoranta&rdquo; to its name, and the association may be registered accordingly and shall, on registration, enjoy all the privileges and (subject to the provisions of this section) be subject <Col N="650" /> to all the obligations of limited companies.</P>
    <P>At this point I think it is appropriate that I should point out a very important matter, and that is, that every body corporate which is established by order under this Bill if enacted will be a body corporate which by the law will give to its members limited liability. Chartered corporations, such as this body, will be such that the members of any such body will enjoy limited liability without the public knowing that they enjoy this limited liability. This is important.  If such bodies are established under the Companies Act, and the Minister has considered that it is appropriate that they should be registered without the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; being used, this does not thereby deprive the people dealing with such bodies of the benefit of the Companies Acts.  The Companies Act, unlike this Bill which runs to three pages, contains nearly 300 pages of provisions protective of the public; and when we are dealing with corporations I have a short quotation which applies to them&mdash;&ldquo;There is no place for simpletons when you are dealing with corporations.  There always seems to be scope for the unscrupulous, the rake, the shark, and so on.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got it to hand but it is taken from the <i>Cambridge Journal</i> and the writer on Friendly Corporations is named Marsh and the date of publication is May, 1951, as I recollect it.  If a more exact reference is required I will be glad at another stage to provide it.  That is the best I can do at the moment.  If you like to have it used as my own words that might dispose of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I continue with what I was saying?  I am very disappointed indeed that here we are provided with a Bill which contemplates the establishment of various bodies corporate for which section 5 provides that the registrar shall have available for public inspection copies of the constitution of the registered bodies.  We are told that there is one particular federation in existence. That is already a legal institution, <Col N="651" /> incidentally, even if it is not incorporated.  It has legal existence as such.  Do you not think that it would be an aid to the Seanad and later to the Dáil that they should be informed what the terms of its constitution are so that we could be looking, before we passed this Bill, at the kind of body which would in fact be affected by what is contemplated?</P>
    <P>If this body is established, as I read the Bill, on the point made by Senator Ahern, there seems to be no provision here and there is nothing in the Companies Act which would prevent or catch this body from inviting subscriptions from the public in Ireland without being obliged by the prospectus provisions of the Companies Act.  This is an important point. This altogether worthy body may not contemplate looking for any such subscriptions, but another body may come into existence and be looking for such.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to find that the Bill contains no definition of the word &ldquo;international&rdquo;.  I have in the last few months personally incorporated a company which has got the word &ldquo;international&rdquo; in the middle of the title and I would like to know what is meant by the word &ldquo;international&rdquo; in the Bill?  The Interpretation Act of 1937 does not come to our assistance and does not tell us what is &ldquo;international&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If a body is incorporated under this Bill it would be bound by the <i>ultra vires</i> rule.  That means that if it acts contrary to its constitution persons dealing with it may suffer as a result of its failure to keep within the scope of the constitution.  However, if this body were established under section 24 of the Companies Act then all the persons dealing with it would have got the benefit of a previous section, section 8, of the Companies Act providing that a person who is unaware of the fact that the body is acting contrary to its powers, or of what its powers are, will not suffer, that is to say, unless he is actually aware of the action being in excess of its powers the person will not suffer.</P>
    <P>If this body is established, I would direct the attention of the House to <Col N="652" /> the fact that it could be, notwithstanding the provisions of this Bill, under the Companies Act of 1963, it could be wound up.  But it could only be wound up compulsorily under the court, with all the deleterious consequences of that operation and process.</P>
    <P>I do not find in this Bill, though perhaps there is some general statute which covers the point, anything giving the Minister the necessary power to make regulations.  How does one apply to the Minister?  In what form does one apply?  I do not find in this Bill any provision whereby any body corporate or any association of persons which chooses to get this body corporate status here could ever be charged fees for being given this privilege, fees which it would find it would suffer to a considerable degree if it were being incorporated by Private Act of Parliament or by charter.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill for certified copies of the constitution in question being made available.  There is no provision as to who will provide the certified copies and in what manner. There is no provision in the Bill requiring the constitution of the body to be in a language that would be understood by the Irish people&mdash;either the Irish or the English language.  If the body were established elsewhere it might not be in a language that would be understood by the Irish people, for example in Sanskrit.  Perhaps some Minister&mdash;not the present&mdash;might not particularly want it to be understood.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill for the publication of a list of directors and secretaries.  There is no provision for a register that would be open to inspection and which would give the names and addresses of persons on whom due processes of law could be served.  How would one institute proceedings and recover against such a body whose members are limited in liability?</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill that the name of the body corporate is to be listed or put on the top of letterheads.  There is no provision to indicate that the body has been established under this Bill if enacted.  There <Col N="653" /> is no provision in the Bill for such eventuality as the body being set up by a wholesome and splendid team of people but which would be run later by a team of people who might not be wholesome and splendid or who might not bother to comply with the provisions of its constitution.</P>
    <P>I have some doubt as to whether the Minister will have constitutional power to revoke the corporate status under the provisions of section 7.  It seems to me that subsection (2) of that section represents an attempt by the Executive to take power to determine rights of persons <i>inter se</i> to decide who is entitled to assets in accordance with the law.  I doubt if that section would stand examination.</P>
    <P>Neither is there any provision for the publication of accounts.  Why is there no such provision?  Why is the Minister alone to see these?  Why should they be concealed?  If people are dealing with such bodies they have a right to know how strong they are. The Minister does not appear to be taking sufficient power to require such information as would be required.  As far as I can see they need not have an auditor.  It was only in 1963 that it became necessary for Irish companies to have an auditor.  Why must they not have one?</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I must conclude with my opening observation that the best thing about the Bill is that it is introduced here.  I find it ill-thought-out and ill-designed.  Its outstanding feature is that it has more defects than sections. Unless the Minister is able to give very particular reasons why the Companies Act is not being used for the purpose of establishing this body and unless, even granted that such reasons are convincing and valid, unless this Bill is substantially amended in Committee, it is my opinion that if enacted, it will represent very bad legislation indeed.  I am obliged to say this although I would prefer not to have to say it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first saw this Bill, I did not know exactly what it meant.  I spoke to several Senators of different political persuasions, including the Leader of the House, but none <Col N="654" /> of them seemed to understand this Bill fully.  I telephoned the Department of Health and spoke to officials there about it.  When I received a memorandum purporting to be an explanatory memorandum, it consisted of two paragraphs and what one could get from that memorandum is less than what one could get from the Bill.</P>
      <P>Some of us have discussed the Bill outside this Chamber.  I consider it to be within the province of the legal profession to deal with it rather than anyone whose main interest is health. This is a legal matter.  Prior to speaking here now I have listened to three legal mentors about the relationship between this Bill and the Companies Act.  Senator O'Higgins brought up this point as did Senator Bourke and Senator FitzGerald.  Senator O'Higgins has said that in the normal way this would come under the Companies Act but if that Act is not wide enough to cover the section of the Bill, the Companies Act should be brought not only to include such an international body as the one in question but also to include other international bodies.</P>
      <P>If the Companies Act were broadened so as to include all international bodies, there would be no need for the nonsensical attitude that is now portrayed in having this Bill brought before us.  At future dates there may be such bodies as the International Labour Body brought before us and by simply expanding the Companies Act we could be ready to embrace any such institution or company who may wish to establish themselves in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not averse from the idea behind the Bill in so far as the body should be established in the State.  I agree that it would bring many fringe benefits to the country as would any type of international body who established headquarters here.  For that reason, I am not opposing the Bill but I think the method being applied might be different.  It is very difficult for one not trained in law to go into such detail as have the Senators who have already spoken.  I see their point and on the basis of what they have said as to its not being a correct legal enactment, one should oppose it but, <Col N="655" /> as I have said, one must also have regard to the fringe benefits that we would derive from the establishment in this State of any international body.  If the Minister takes into account the various points raised by Senator FitzGerald, Senator Bourke and Senator O'Higgins and can in his reply guarantee the safeguards they are looking for then I do not think the Bill will be opposed.  However, I think there are loopholes in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>I consider the method of the introduction of the Bill is wrong.  I am not suggesting by that that no Bill should be introduced in the Seanad.  I am delighted the Minister has used this House to introduce this Bill and I wish this would be done more often. My point is that this matter should be covered in a different way.  It should be covered by expanding the Companies Act.  If the Minister accepts the points raised by the three former speakers on this side of the House and plugs all the loopholes which exist in the Bill we are prepared to agree to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Bill, at least on its Second Reading.  I was very interested to see that the reason for bringing forward this Bill was for the establishment of the headquarters of an international organisation working in the health field in this city.  An establishment like that would be of enormous benefit here.  I am familiar with the working of international organisations in health matters in various other places.  There are the WHO in Geneva, the Food and Agricultural Organisation at Rome, the International Atomic Energy Authority in Vienna, the Council of Europe at Strasbourg and the new International Organisation for Cancer Research in Lyons.  On at least two of those there have been distinguished Irishmen as directors in recent years. We are making a very fine contribution in organisations like that by way of the personnel we make available for work in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would, if this type of organisation were set up here, derive even <Col N="656" /> further benefit.  We might expect to have a considerable number of the staff appointed locally.  We would expect to have a constant stream of visitors attending conferences here on the scientific aspects of those organisations and we would expect to have considerable stimulus to local development in the various areas that those organisations might cover.  This of course is what the Minister refers to in paragraph 3 as a secondary objective in introducing this Bill.  The secondary objective might prove even more important than the primary one, though it would be difficult to get the secondary one off the ground until the primary one had been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I see that there are obvious objections on the part of our legal colleagues to various aspects of the operation of this sort of situation and I am quite certain the Minister will be the first to see that where any dangers of this kind exist they should be dealt with and preventive measures taken to make sure no undesirable situation arises.  I am sure that will be done and when such steps are taken I believe it will be to the greater benefit to this country to have such machinery put into operation here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will of necessity be very brief on this Bill.  As one who is interested mainly in the health aspect involved in this I want to say that when I received this Bill and read it several times I was as unenlightened as I was before I opened my post and having subsequently received the circular from the Minister, which endeavoured to clarify matters, I was considerably further in the dark.  I came in here today, as I am sure many other Senators did, wondering what in fact this Bill was all about.  After I listened to the Minister's speech I was a little more enlightened but having heard the various contributions, especially that of Senator FitzGerald, I am now considerably more enlightened and considerably disenchanted with the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obvious questions which many of us who are primarily concerned with health matters ask in relation to the setting up of bodies such as those mentioned, are the type of questions <Col N="657" /> asked by Senator Mrs. Ahern, that is whether this Bill gave to international bodies setting up here any special concessions from the point of view of tax reliefs or from the point of view of allowing such bodies to collect money and perhaps not be directly accountable for the manner in which such money was spent.  I hope the Minister will clarify this matter for us.</P>
    <P>This is something which comes up in relation to the setting up of any international health bodies in this country.  The people involved in the setting up of those bodies would be apprehensive about this.  We all know from time to time that international bodies with very impressive titles have operated and quite often the funds directed by them did not find their way directly into the proper fields of health for which they were originally intended.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the point made so excellently in the sweetly reasonable tones of Senator FitzGerald that one could have an international body setting out to carry out some very commendable task and run by very admirable people but that circumstances can change and you could have after a number of years a completely different set of people with completely ulterior motives operating within that body.  I must say I agree with the point of view put forward by Senator FitzGerald that it would be extremely necessary that any body operating in the health field set up in this country under this Bill, when enacted, should be obliged on all its letter-headings to set forth a list of the directors, patrons or sponsors of the organisation and indeed the specific enactment under which it had been set up in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to be perfectly honest and say that while I am someone who has a fair amount of interest in health matters I know absolutely nothing about the International Federation of Voluntary Health Service Funds.  I would be extremely interested to hear what in fact its purpose was and how it went about it.  If we had been given such an explanation by the Minister on the introduction of this Bill we might be considerably more enlightened as regards its main purpose and intention. <Col N="658" /> As it stands I will have to bow to the superior legal knowledge of my colleagues and express great apprehension of the Bill as it is now drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid some Members of the Seanad in opposition to us have not understood the purpose of this Bill at all.  I may as well be quite brutally frank about it; this Bill has been framed in such a way that we encourage international organisations of an utterly respectable character, consisting of people engaged very largely in the public health service or controlled by governments in their own countries, to discuss health services, health insurance and similar matters.</P>
      <P>The simple answer to everything that has been said is that if we were to lay down all the regulations proposed by Senator Alexis FitzGerald any international body of a respectable kind, with the kind of respectability which would make it possible for me to place a resolution before the Seanad prior to making an order admitting them as a body to whom this Bill applies, simply would not come here.  That is all. It is quite simple.  They will not come here if all these provisions in the Companies Acts, all kinds of powers, are invoked in order to ensure that they do not peculate or swindle people in this country or anywhere else.  They simply will not come here.  The safeguard in all of this lies, first of all, in the revocation section in the Bill and it lies, secondly, in the fact that I will have to come before the Oireachtas with a description in considerable detail in regard to the particular organisation which wishes to join and the Oireachtas will have to be satisfied, when their constitution is laid before the two Houses, that it offers the normal safeguards that can reasonably be expected in the case of a non-profitmaking organisation deriving its funds from subscription and not engaged in doing commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the particular body which is likely to come first before the House the constitution provides a great deal of information and when the House comes to examine the constitution, the incorporation, the aims and purposes, the character of membership, <Col N="659" /> the organisation of the body, the holding of a general assembly, the methods of holding meetings, the council of management&mdash;the operations of the council of management are given in considerable detail&mdash;the powers of the secretary-general and the treasurer, the audit and auditors and the subscriptions and the interpretation of and alterations to the constitution and arrangements for the possible dissolution of the body are all indicated.  That need not be discussed here today because it is not part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister can require information under section 6 of the Bill.  That means that I could require that documents in the Sanskrit language if ever there were such&mdash;it is not a recognised international language&mdash;be translated into Irish or English or both.  It is not in the least likely.  The kind of bodies that are likely to have their place of residence here, to be incorporated in this country, are bodies that make use of three or four well-known international languages.  English, French, German and Spanish are the four principle ones nowadays.  Other bodies under certain circumstances insist on automatic translation of all their major documents into the language of any member of the particular federation. The practice varies from area to area according to the nature of the body and the decisions of those who direct it.  So that the information can be provided under that head.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question in regard to the Companies Act and the possible use of the Companies Act.  I should like to say to Senator O'Higgins and to Senator Alexis FitzGerald that the Companies Act is not in any way inadequate. Its provisions are not suitable for the international body with which we are initially concerned or for other bodies which are likely to be concerned. These are essentially associations of bodies with similar interests whose income will essentially be subscriptions and whose functions will essentially be the increasing of knowledge and the furtherance of causes related to health matters.  The constitution of this body is already drawn up and, as Senator FitzGerald <Col N="660" /> knows, the Companies Act provides for the drawing up of memorandum and articles of association whereas in this case and in most other cases the constitutions of these bodies are likely to be drawn up before they apply for incorporation here under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald asked a question about the section relating to the seal.  This is taken from the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, section 3 (6). We regarded the section as suitable for application to this particular Bill. I wish, myself, that I had been able to persuade the Minister for External Affairs that this should be a general Bill covering all kinds of international bodies but the Minister for External Affairs explained that this might not be desirable, that we had better confine the Bill to health purposes because if we had an omnibus Bill it might be difficult to operate it and it might be difficult perhaps sometimes to exclude organisations that were not considered desirable here.  He would have to think this over very carefully and so it is not a general Bill covering all types of international bodies.  I hope some day we will be able to do this but it was not possible on this occasion.</P>
    <P>When I speak of the fact that I know that this international organisation would be likely to go elsewhere if we tied them up in a great many legal formalities, all designed to protect the public against virtually nonexistent dangers, I should like also to say that if we are always delaying an application by a body to incorporate here, if they have to have lawyers examining the whole of the company law in this country to see how it related to their own concepts, they will not come.  The Bill is, in fact, in its simple form, an advertisement or an inducement to international health organisations to set up here.</P>
    <P>I will consult the Minister for Industry and Commerce in order to make sure that the constitution of any body desiring to incorporate here would not in any way be in conflict with the Companies Act to the point that might result in difficulties being created but I can assure the House that the kind of organisations that will want to incorporate here will be organisations <Col N="661" /> where it would be patently easy for the Dáil and the Seanad to see that they are respectable, that they are formed from respectable sources, that they are concerned with international matters of a philanthropic character and if there should be any kind of disaster in respect of a particular organisation by the section of the Bill revoking the order that can be accomplished if it is considered that an organisation is developing undesirable trends, characteristics or actions.</P>
    <P>So, while I thoroughly respect the legalistic arguments put forward by Senator Alexis FitzGerald&mdash;if he were speaking of a commercial organisation, for example, some huge international company to undertake health insurance on an international basis, I would entirely agree with him&mdash;the whole object of the kind of associations which we hope will apply for incorporation here is purely philanthropic, discussing all sorts of matters such as, in the case of this particular body, how reciprocal can health insurance be.  They can discuss it and make recommendations to the countries which are not engaged in reciprocal insurance but before that can be fulfilled in practice a Bill making it possible for reciprocity to be given would have to be passed.  For example, in the case of our social welfare legislation we have a considerable degree of reciprocity with other countries in the matter of insurance.  This could be discussed and recommendations made but obviously they could not engage in commercial practice.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made the distinction between an international body of the kind which is going to request corporation and the kind of bodies where considerable safeguards would be required, and where the Minister would demand and would be unable to get information and the power to revoke an order would obviously be insufficient.</P>
    <P>I know very little about the law and I have probably not explained it in as satisfactory a way as Senator Alexis FitzGerald would have if he were on this side of the House.  I have done my best to explain the position.  When the resolution comes before the House in respect of the first body we can have <Col N="662" /> a further discussion in order to satisfy the whole House that the constitution of the body is an adequate one and one which would prevent abuse or corruption of any kind having regard to the objectives of the organisation.  As I have said, it is the objectives of the organisation likely to be incorporated which really make the decision to have a simple Bill of this kind operative in my view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said he would agree with the argument put forward by me if the body concerned were to deal in a big way with health insurance.  One of the provisions of the Bill is that it will cover any international body dealing amongst other things with health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The body concerned would only discuss and debate the possibility of mutual health insurance arrangements.  No body will come under this Bill which proposes to operate insurance on a commercial basis.  I would agree completely with what Senator O'Higgins has said that once you start to receive large sums of money for disbursement for insurance purposes on an international basis we would need to consider that body in relation to the Companies Act and there would obviously have to be protective provisions.  This body will only discuss the possibilities of insurance reciprocity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the particular body or the federation, but the point I am making is that this Bill will be of general application.  We know from what the Minister has said what he has in mind is to deal first with the particular federation which he mentioned but the Bill itself will have a general application including an extension to bodies dealing with health insurance and the treatment of sick people.  I could see the Minister's point if he were bringing in a Bill limited to dealing with the particular federation which he has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Those bodies will be purely deliberative.  If they operated a service and as a result engaged in the receipt and expenditure of large sums of money I agree with Senators the <Col N="663" /> Bill obviously would not cover that position.  This body might sign a convention, for example, that certain countries would themselves engage in reciprocity for health insurance purposes. They could only sign a convention whereby these countries would agree to do this; these countries would then have to sign their bilateral or multilateral agreements and work out the whole principle.  There is no question of this Bill applying to bodies which are operative in the sense of engaging in business to the point where the Senator is right in saying that there should be a direct connection with the Companies Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister clearly intends when this Bill is enacted to confer body corporate status on one particular federation which has at this time a constitution.  Would the Minister consider circulating copies of that constitution to Senators before the Committee Stage of the Bill so that we would be able to see exactly what sort of body it is proposed to incorporate, the sort of constitution it will have, how it will be in a position to interpret Irish law and the rights which Irish citizens would have under the Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>While I think the constitution of the body which desires to be the subject of an order under this Bill will have to come before the Seanad, in fairness to the body concerned what I should do is circulate the constitution completely anonymously without the name of the body purely as an example.  I do not think these international organisations would like to feel they were being bandied about in Parliament when they have not yet formally applied legally to become incorporated.  If I circulate this simply as an example it must not be taken for granted that it will necessarily be the final constitution but it might satisfy the Senators.</P>

On the face of it it is clearly wide enough to relate to health insurance and care of the sick.  If we are introducing a Bill for this purpose it ought to appear on the face of the Bill that it is a deliberative body and not be left to the discretion of the Minister when such a body applies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 of the Health Act, 1970 requires that regulations be made by the Minister for Health specifying the number, title, functional area and membership of health boards which will be responsible for the administration of the health services in the State.  The section further requires that before the regulations are made, the Minister must consult with the Minister for Local Government and with each county council and county borough corporation and Dún Laoghaire Corporation. The Minister is further required by section 41 of the Health Act, 1953 to consult with the National <Col N="665" /> Health Council about the regulations. Having completed this round of consultations, I am now asking this House to approve of the draft regulations which I have recently laid before it.</P>
      <P>In order to help Deputies and Senators in their consideration of these draft regulations, I have had published an explanatory memorandum which deals generally with the changes in administration of the health services to be made under the Health Act, 1970. I considered that it would be helpful to explain in the memorandum not only the changes which arise from the establishment of the health boards but to sketch in broad outline the type and functions of the other bodies to be established under the Act and to set out the inter-relationships between these bodies and the health boards.  The explanatory memorandum deals very tentatively with the bodies which will be established for the co-ordination of hospital services.  I recognise that Members of the House will naturally want further elucidation about the roles of these bodies.</P>
      <P>For that reason I want to make it clear to Members of the House at this stage that the draft regulations dealing with the establishment of Comhairle na nÓspidéal and the three regional hospital boards will be the subject, not only of a separate debate in each of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but of considerable consultation between now and the time the draft regulations are finally laid for consideration by the Dáil and the Seanad.  In fact, at this time, a preliminary draft of these regulations together with explanatory material is being prepared in my Department and I would hope to circulate this as a basis for discussion to many interested bodies fairly soon but, in order to keep these bodies informed of developments, I have circulated to them copies of the explanatory general memorandum which I have circulated to Members of the Oireachtas and made it clear that I will be having a separate round of consultations with them about Comhairle na nÓspidéal and the regional hospital boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask Senators to avoid the understandable temptation to deal at some length with the hospital bodies <Col N="666" /> during the course of the debate on this motion and to concentrate as far as possible on the content of the draft regulations dealing with the establishment of the health boards.  There will be plenty of opportunity later for everyone to make his views known to me about the hospital bodies before the regulations are made.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline some of the reasons which influenced me in proposing that there might be eight health boards with the functional areas set out in the draft regulations.  I aimed at having each health board responsible for providing services for at least 200,000 people while at the same time ensuring that each board's functional area would be reasonable from the point of view of convenience of administration.  I also had in mind that distances from an administrative centre for the board to other parts of the area would not be too great and I decided, early on, that counties would not be split for the purpose of forming a functional area of a health board.  Naturally I had regard to the way in which the country has been divided into regions for other purposes, for example for tourism and planning.  Generally speaking, I found that I could keep pretty well in line with the planning regions and, where I did depart from them, there were reasons specifically associated with the problems of health administration in so doing.</P>
    <P>In deciding not to divide any county for administrative purposes, I had regard not only to the traditional reasons for leaving county boundaries undisturbed but also to the practical consideration that the county is the basic unit for local government administration. It will considerably ease the transitional difficulties which we will almost inevitably encounter if we continue to avail for some time of the close links which exist between health and local government at county level at present.  The changes we are making in the administration are substantial by any reckoning and where it can be avoided there would be little point in adding further to the transitional problems.</P>
    <P>If I am to judge by the reaction of <Col N="667" /> local authorities to the proposed grouping, then the criteria on which I have based my proposals must have been reasonably valid.  Most of the local authorities accepted the suggested groupings but there were one or two instances I might mention where alternative suggestions were made.</P>
    <P>During the informal consultations which I had with local authorities during the passage of the Bill, Carlow County Council indicated that they were not entirely happy with the proposal to include them in the South Eastern Health Board as they felt that because of their almost total dependence on Dublin for the provision of general and maternity hospital services they would prefer to be associated with the Eastern Health Board.  I had a very satisfactory discussion with a deputation from Carlow County Council about this matter, and I put it to them that it was, in my opinion, in their best interests to be associated with the South Eastern Health Board as they could not reasonably expect, in view of their size, to have any considerable say on the Eastern Health Board.  I accepted that the county was in a rather unusual position in so far as the northern part of the county tended naturally to look towards Dublin rather than to any centre in the south east and that because it does not have a county hospital of its own it was very much dependent on Dublin for its hospital services.  I explained that there would be nothing in the new arrangements to stop Carlow patients from continuing to avail of the services in the Dublin hospitals, and in acknowledgment of the special situation which existed for Carlow in relation to hospital services I have undertaken that the county would have a special representative on the proposed Dublin Regional Hospital Board.</P>
    <P>When Carlow County Council submitted its formal views to me on the draft regulations it stated that it would be agreeable to forming part of the South Eastern Health Board area provided that the major hospital for that area would be located in Kilkenny.  I could not at this stage, in respect of this or any other area, give any undertaking or guarantee about the siting <Col N="668" /> of the major hospital as this is something which will have to be examined fully in consultation with all the bodies and interests concerned and it would be totally premature for me at this stage even to voice an opinion as to where the major hospital for any area might be.  Having regard, however, to the fact that Carlow can continue to avail of hospital services from Dublin and that it will have a reasonable representation on the South Eastern Health Board, I propose that Carlow should be included in the functional area of that board.</P>
    <P>At my meeting in Cork with representatives of the constituent local authorities of the Southern Health Board, the representatives of Kerry County Council suggested that there should be a separate health board for each of the counties of Cork and Kerry.  I did not accept that the population of Kerry justifies its having a separate health board.  It was also suggested to me that part of North Kerry should be associated with the Mid-Western Health Board in view of its proximity to Limerick and the extent to which it avails itself of hospital services there.  Again, I had to reject this as, apart from the fact that I had decided that counties should not be divided for administrative purposes, it seemed to me that most of the population of Kerry regarded Cork as the most convenient regional centre.  Furthermore the splitting of a county's representation between two boards would weaken its voice in regard to its health services since each part of the county could hope to have only a very small number of representatives on the health board for its area.  In the case of Kerry, there was still a further consideration, in so far as the plans to provide a new general hospital at Tralee is based on the assumption that it will cater for the population of the whole county.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other suggestions made to me during my discussions with local authority representatives about possible changes in the proposed grouping but these suggestions were not formally taken up by the counties concerned.  I think that, generally speaking, county councils are <Col N="669" /> happy with the proposed set-up and I am sure that the counties now brought together for health administration will willingly work together for the ultimate betterment of the service.</P>
    <P>One of the major difficulties which I have had in this whole exercise is in trying to reconcile the need to give adequate representation on the health boards with the desirability of keeping the boards to a size where they will have a reasonable chance of being effective in carrying out their work.  I stated fairly early on in the discussions on the changes that as far as possible I would try to keep the size of the boards to about thirty and while there is nothing magical about this figure I am convinced that once this number is exceeded the chances of ending up with an ineffective board are increased. I was, therefore, forced to turn down many requests for representation or for an increase in proposed representation and where I have exceeded this figure of thirty I have done so only on the understanding that the likely benefit arising from increased representation will outweigh the possible disadvantages of having an unwieldly board.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately curtailed the size of the boards in order to ensure that they would be effective instruments in the discharge of the functions with which they are being entrusted.  There is the danger that in a major reorganisation such as we are undertaking here, sight can be lost of the fact that all the changes are essentially and primarily designed to improve the service which will be available for the recipient. The point has, I think, been made in this House during discussion on the Health Bill that the patients will not be concerned with the actual administration of the service but with the quality and intensity of the service provided.  This, of course, is quite true but the quality of the service is very much dependent on the effectiveness and efficiency of the organisation administering the service.</P>
    <P>In the re-organised health service administration, the health boards will, as I have said before, be the essential nuclei of the service.  I would hope to see each board operating as a corporation <Col N="670" /> which has been given the task of providing the best possible health services for the people within its areas in so far as its resources permit and of ensuring that the resources which are made available to it are used in the most effective manner possible.  I think it was Senator Alexis FitzGerald who said during the Second Stage debate of the Bill in this House that we can all benefit from discussion if we listen to one another and it will be of vital importance that members of a health board, irrespective of the capacity in which they serve on these boards, be prepared to listen to the other members' contributions and accept that they can benefit from them.  The local authority member, the hospital consultant, the nurse, the dentist, the pharmacist&mdash; each of them will have his or her own particular contribution to make and the board as a corporate entity will then, by various processes, come to decisions based on a wide spread of advice and experience.  This is how I hope to see the health boards working and I am sufficiently optimistic to believe that this is how they will work.</P>
    <P>This brings me to deal with the question of the balance between the local authority and the professional representation on the boards.  A considerable number of the local authorities indicated to me during consultations that they felt that they should have a greater majority than that which I have proposed on each of the boards. On the other hand, the professional organisations felt that they were entitled to a somewhat greater say on the boards.  I have said before that I do not think there will be many occasions on which there will be a clash of interest between the local authority members and the other members of the board.  On each of the boards there will be one dentist, one pharmacist, one general nurse and one psychiatric nurse.  When, therefore, there are suggestions that the professional representation is excessive it boils down to considering the representation which is being given to the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Once it has been accepted that the profession should be represented on these boards, then that representation must be sufficient to allow the major <Col N="671" /> branches of medicine to be represented, while at the same time allowing the members of the professions democratically to select, for appointment, people in the profession whom they consider have a definite contribution to make in their own right.  I am quite sure that the members of the medical profession appointed to the first boards will be conscious that they are part of a very significant sociological development and that while they have a definite contribution to make because of their professional expertise, they can receive very valuable help and guidance from their fellow members representing local authorities who have the advantage of having been associated for many years with the administration of health and local government services.  This fusion of administrative and professional experience can hardly fail to produce very worthwhile results and I am sure that all the members appointed to the first boards will, above all, try to ensure that the development in the administration which we are pioneering in this country will be successful in maintaining and improving the services which are now provided.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities and the National Health Council recommended to me during my consultations with them that steps should be taken to ensure that professional representation is fairly evenly distributed among the constituent counties of each health board.  I fully accept the validity of this suggestion and I am hoping that in requesting nominations for the first boards and in making the regulations governing selection to subsequent boards, I may be able to do something to meet this point.  However, I could not accept that this should be a primary consideration in selecting professional representatives to the boards as we must first of all try to ensure that there is a good spread of doctors among the many categories in the profession and that, as far as possible, the best qualified people are appointed to each board.  I will take up this point with the nominating bodies and I will have regard to it when I am making my own appointments to health boards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> In the draft regulations, I have proposed that the Minister appoint three members to each health board.  There have been some suggestions, not very many indeed, that this was a disproportionate number for the Minister to appoint.  I cannot accept this view, particularly when, taking into account the contribution made through the agricultural grant, as well as the health grants, the State is bearing, over the country as a whole, up to 75 per cent of the cost of health services. I think that I should also make it clear that no officers of my Department will be appointed to the health boards.  In making my appointments, I would have to be influenced by a number of conditions which may arise, including the possibility that some particular vocational or area interest might not otherwise be represented. I have indeed already received a considerable number of representations on behalf of people who wish to be appointed to these boards and I have consistently replied to these representations on the lines I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>In giving their views on the draft regulations which are circulated a number of local authorities raised points which were not directly related to the draft regulations now before the House.  I have not as yet considered all these points but I shall do so in due course and I will then have replies sent to the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>I have had a very long round of consultations on my proposals for these health boards, and I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who made a contribution during these consultations. For many reasons, some of which I have outlined during this opening statement, I did not find it possible to accept all the suggestions that were made to me, but no one should think that because their suggestion did not lead to a change in my proposals it was not worthwhile. Every such suggestion made forced me to look with a more critical eye on the proposals which I had made.</P>
    <P>What I am now putting before the House for consideration is what I believe to be, having had the benefit <Col N="673" /> of all this constructive criticism and advice, the best administrative structure for our health services now.  What is now proposed need not forever be regarded as unchangeable and, if it is considered necessary, new regulations can be introduced when we have had an opportunity of seeing how this new system is operating in practice. I would, therefore, ask the House to approve of the draft of the Health Boards Regulations which I have put before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the memorandum in explanation that the Minister has given us.  It is certainly far more elucidating than the memorandum we received on the International Health Bodies (Corporate Status) Bill.  The Health Act was before us as a Bill and we spent many days going through it. These regulations pertain in particular to section 4 of that Act.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister had in mind the actual constitution of the Dublin Health Authority when he decided to establish eight regional health areas.  From our experience of the work of the Dublin Health Authority, we can say that he was right in bringing eight regional health areas into the Act because the Dublin Health Authority have been a complete success.  Though many people may say otherwise when they receive their rates demand, those of us who have worked on the Dublin Health Authority realise how successful they have been.  I believe that the Minister has used this authority as a prototype for his regional health areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact the Eastern Regional Health Board is only increased by the addition of Counties Wicklow and Kildare&mdash; not a big increase in population but a big increase in area.  I notice that in forming the Dublin health area the Minister has compromised between population and accessibility.  One must agree with the Minister on this to some extent.  It may be that one would like to see representation on the basis of population.  At first sight it may appear that this is as it should be but there is also a case to be made for accessibility and the distances that must be travelled.  In this connection, I am not <Col N="674" /> talking about doctors but about patients.</P>
    <P>I shall take up one or two points in succession.  I do not know as yet what the Minister has done about resolving the representation for Dublin city.  I read in the Dáil Debates that he said he had consultation with the various Deputies from Dublin city.  I cannot remember his exact words but they were to the effect that there was a tentative agreement that persons should be appointed by the commissioner on a proportional representation basis.  It was mentioned somewhere also that the various Deputies representing Dublin city might well be nominated by the commissioner to act on the Eastern Regional Health Board.  I do not know what the Minister has decided but when he is replying I should like him to be specific as to how he intends the representation of Dublin city to be on the Eastern Regional Health Board.  This is something that everybody especially the people of Dublin city want to know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>Nobody else need raise this particular question.  I have got agreement from the Minister for Local Government that he will make arrangements under his powers to appoint seven people.  Of course, they will have to be politically on a fair representative basis.  One of the ways of doing this is actually to appoint Deputies and I imagine that is how it will be done.  Anyway I can assure the House that the Minister for Local Government has agreed in respect of the Eastern Health Board that persons will be appointed to represent Dublin Corporation on a fair and equitable basis.  It will be the Minister for Local Government who does that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if this will be equitable in many ways.  I am not suggesting that the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Health will do anything wrong.  I am just looking at the principle here and not personalities.  This is the first intimation I have had of how this will be done.  I will reserve judgment on that for the moment.  There is a reference in either the last statement of the Minister or in the memorandum we received about County Carlow objecting to having the headquarters in Waterford.  I am not taking sides in this but it seems to me that Kilkenny would be a more accessible centre than either Wexford or Waterford and that it would be more central to the board itself.  This is only a suggestion I am making and I do not think it is of great import if the centre is in Waterford.  This matter must be taken into consideration with the general hospital which will be in Waterford. In arranging the centre for the South Eastern Health Board, one should consider Kilkenny.  However, this brings up the question of the regional hospital board which will be in Ardkeen, Waterford.  I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the accessibility of the capital of each health authority.  Normally it should not be on the coast.  It should be as central as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know the Minister has made provision to allow a local authority which he is putting into one particular health area to opt out of that area and join another area after some experience.  This is a very good provision.  I also want to compliment the Minister on having a preponderance of local authority members on the health boards.  When one speaks about health one always speaks about doctors, surgeons and physicians and certain people may feel they should have a preponderance of representation on those boards.  In fact, it is better and fairer&mdash;the Minister has agreed with <Col N="676" /> this&mdash;to have a preponderance of local representatives on the health boards because those are the people who are accountable to the public.  The doctors, surgeons and physicians are accountable in a different way to the public. They are accountable for their skill but they are not accountable for administration to the public.  Therefore, it is correct that local representatives should be in a preponderance on health boards.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to state what is the duration of the appointment of representatives on the health boards.  I can understand the duration of the appointment of local authority members on health boards would only be from local election to local election. What about the duration in the case of the other representatives on the health boards?  Do they cease to be members of health boards when the local authority members cease to be members?</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the representation of various local authorities on the health boards.  I allow the Minister certain latitude in his digression from population by appointing members from local authorities on the basis of accessibility but to me his digression from this point is far too great in many places.  Take, for instance, Dublin city.  I am open to correction on this but I think there are only seven representatives for Dublin city.  I feel that is too low.  The population of Dublin city is almost 700,000; Wicklow has 60,000 and Kildare about 66,000.  It seems to me that the representation for Dublin which is only twice the representation which Wicklow and Kildare are getting is too low a representation.  I also think that four for Dublin county is too low.  In the allocation of membership of boards throughout the country one can bring points to the Minister's notice about the inequality of representation from the constituencies and rating authorities on the various boards. I have given the Minister one particular example where I consider there is inequality and I would like the Minister to reconsider this if possible.  The Minister's reply will depend on whether we are going to oppose those regulations or not.  As long as I have <Col N="677" /> seen the Minister before us in this House he has always been co-operative and in no sense has he tried to be vindictive. I am sure that he could be co-operative now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding many of the misgivings which many of us might have with regard to the various provisions of the Health Act which we discussed in great detail some months ago we should all accept at this stage that the Bill we discussed then has now been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and has become law.  We must accept it and make the best of it.  I should like to join with the Minister in the latter part of his speech where he asked the people involved in seeing to the formation and getting off the ground of the new health boards that they should approach it in this light and should give of their best.</P>
      <P>One of the main apprehensions many of us had, and I hope it will prove to be unfounded, was that members of the board might concentrate more on pressing their own local issues or their own specialist field of medicine or allied fields rather than on trying to view the overall development of the health services in their area.  I hope the various people appointed under these regulations, whether they are from the local authority or, appointed on the recommendation of the representative group in the medical field or in its allied fields, will approach their appointment to the board in the proper spirit, looking at it from the point of view of the development of a proper modern health service in their own functional area without any overemphasis on one particular part of that area or another or any particular field of the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a way it is rather a pity that we must discuss these draft regulations while not having before us the draft regulations which would set up the other boards which the Bill envisages &mdash;the regional hospital boards and Comhairle na Óspidéal.  I appreciate the difficulties involved in this but I feel it would have given to this House and presumably to the other House <Col N="678" /> and to the many people involved in the health services at present a far clearer picture of what was in the Minister's mind in the implementation of the proposals if they knew what was in the Minister's mind in regard to the hospital boards also and Comhairle na Óspidéal.  However, presumably these regulations will come before us in the near future and we will be able to discuss them at least in the light of our experience having discussed the regulations for these health boards.  It might have been a useful thing if we had been able to discuss them side by side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is absolutely right.  Perhaps I could explain to the House that it is simply a question of timing and the resolution in regard to the regional hospital boards and Comhairle na Óspidéal will come before the Oireachtas in November or December.  I can say, as an excuse, that legalistically, as those who have studied this Bill know, the health board could go into operation without ever having a regional hospital board or Comhairle na Óspidéal.  They are additional bodies and the entire operation could proceed without those additional bodies so that at least there is some logic in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I do not want to press it.  I do not want to drift away into fields which are not directly related to the regulations.  In regard to the business of staffing it would have been far more healthy if the staff had seen the proposals for the regional hospital boards as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I discuss briefly again the proposals for the eastern region which is to have a board of 35 members to serve a population of 921,000 people? It will be the area at present served by the Dublin Health Authority plus the counties of Kildare and Wicklow. All of us who are members of the Dublin Health Authority were rather pleased that the Minister agreed to increase, even to a small extent, the amount of representation from the local authority members but I am rather upset by the Minister's reliance on this magical figure of 30 which he spoke about so often when he was discussing the Bill and which he still <Col N="679" /> seem to be intent upon as being the only real figure to provide effective administration by a board.  He has allowed the Eastern Health Board to grow to a figure of 35 members whereas, in fact, if he agreed to the eventual proposals put forward to him by the local authorities from all the areas which will go to comprise the eastern region, he would have a board of 39.</P>
    <P>I thought it was rather a good thing and I was sure it was something the Minister would have welcomed very much that representatives of Dún Laoghaire Borough, Dublin Corporation and Kildare, Wicklow and Dublin County Councils got together at the suggestion of the Dublin Health Authority and thrashed out the pros and cons of the new eastern board and eventually agreed on behalf of each of their local authorities on a figure which they would accept on the new health board.  That figure would have given us a total of 23 local authority members.  The Minister's proposal at that time was 16 and presumably following receipt of our suggestions he increased the local representation from 16 to 19.  There are some obvious words that come to mind to describe the idea of going from 16 to 19 but not as far as 23 but I shall leave that be.  It is just a pity that when there was this degree of co-operation, which I thought augured very well for the initial success of the eastern board, the Minister did not feel himself in a position to agree to these proposals.</P>
    <P>If one looks at it on factual grounds, the grounds of population and area in square miles to be served by the Eastern Health Board, one discovers that it will serve a population of 921,000 in an area of 1,800 square miles.  The nearest proposed health board in square mileage to that is the North-Eastern Health Board with an area of 1,950 square miles, 150 square miles larger but which will serve a population of 237,000 people, approximately one-quarter of the number served by the eastern board.  Yet it will have 16 local authority members and the Dublin board, serving four times as <Col N="680" /> many people, will have but three more. It is as well to bear in mind that the eastern board will cover five different local authority areas, so there are 19 members from between five local authorities whereas the north-eastern board covers only four local authority areas and will have 16 members serving a population only one-quarter of that served by the eastern one.</P>
    <P>Bearing all these things in mind, I would have thought that our suggestion should have been acceptable to the Minister.  I presume that at the stage at which we now are there is no hope of the Minister changing his mind in this regard, so I do not suppose there is much point in discussing it further but it is as well to let him see that some of us are still a trifle disappointed.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably will not welcome this very much but I should like to hark back again to the position regarding Dublin Corporation.  There is a certain amount of uncertainty here. We can accept that the Minister for Health is approaching the problem of Dublin Corporation's representation on the Eastern Health Board in a spirit of goodwill and we hope that he has persuaded his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to approach it in like fashion.</P>
    <P>Our apprehension at the Minister's reply in another place and here again this afternoon is that the representatives appointed might all be members of different political parties representing the Dublin area.  A large number of members of Dublin Corporation have never sought election to the Dáil and have no desire to do so but they had a definite and real interest in serving the people of Dublin city even though they had no wish to go into politics.  They were content to give of their time and energy to the corporation and its constituent bodies like the health authority.</P>
    <P>If members who do not belong to a particular political party are to be excluded from the board it will be a great pity.  Speaking from memory I recall that out of the 45 members of Dublin Corporation 15 members belong to the Fianna Fáil Party; 13 belonged to the Labour Party&mdash;one <Col N="681" /> of those members has since died and another has joined the Fine Gael Party&mdash;and the Fine Gael Party had 11 members.  One of our members also died but we have recently had this addition from the Labour Party. The Ratepayers, who have quite a strong voice in the affairs of Dublin Corporation, had three members and there were three Independent members.  One of the ratepayers' representatives was the most diligent and hard working member of the health authority.  He was obviously a man interested in the health services of the city and he was prepared more than most of his colleagues to give of his time to attend meetings and visiting committees in an attempt to provide a better service for the community. In recent months we have invited ex-members&mdash;everyone knows why they are ex-members&mdash;of the health authority to come back and serve with us on the visiting committees of various hospitals and this particular gentleman was the first to answer that request. As far as I can recall he has attended every meeting of the visiting committee since he was appointed.</P>
    <P>According to the suggestion outlined by the Minister this man would automatically be excluded from being a member of the board because he has never had any interest in standing for election to Parliament.  I would find a system where it was possible for non-Parliamentary members to become representaives on this board far more acceptable.  I feel sure such members would work far better for the new Dublin Corporation which we all look forward to seeing very soon.  Fianna Fáil had three-ninths, Labour had almost three-ninths and Fine Gael had almost three-ninths.  Seven places are to be given to each of the parties and one place is being given to an Independent.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the eastern health region comprises of the greater Dublin area, Kildare and Wicklow and manages to take in County Meath.  It has been stated that the reason why County Meath has been included is that Meath runs out along North County Dublin as far as the coast and the development of Dublin Airport has inevitably involved Meath in major proposals in <Col N="682" /> regional road and rail networks.  We believe that the eastern health region is too big without having Meath included in it.  Government Departments will find it more and more difficult as they attempt to rationalise their services to provide greater efficiency by having services on a regional basis. They will discover that what is thought to be a suitable region from the point of view of health services does not coincide with or suit the arrangements for regionalisation which another Department is trying to make.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to a pet topic of mine which I spoke about during the Second Reading of the Bill, that these new health boards, or indeed any Department which is attempting to rationalise its operations, do not have to rely on county boundaries if one can believe what was said by a former Minister that county boundaries were of no consequence and were not respected by the people living in them; they were imposed upon us by an alien dominion and should not therefore be respected by the Government.  I would not go so far as to agree with that, but Government Departments in future will have to decide what the most effective region would be without taking into account things like county boundaries but instead taking into account features such as rivers, mountains and road and rail networks.</P>
    <P>I have considerable difficulty in seeing how members of the south-western region appointed from County Kerry and County Cork will manage to travel to a meeting and get home again on the same day.  A man who had to travel from the Dingle Peninsula to Cork city for a meeting, then have lunch and attend another meeting would find great difficulty in getting home that night.  That is one obvious difficulty which is bound to cut across any attempt at getting new boundaries or delineations.  Once we accept the fact that the Minister was basing his assumptions on existing county boundaries the regions are the best we can hope for.</P>
    <P>I should like to inquire, because the regulations do not mention it in any way, as to the effective date of the operation of the new health boards.  I <Col N="683" /> know that it is envisaged that they will be established on 1st April next and, as it were, effectively come into being without executive power on 1st October next, but the difficulties which the 19 elected representatives and the 16 appointed representatives on the Eastern Health Board will obviously have in gradually assuming power and taking over the lines of control from the three different health authorities in authority at present are difficulties which are very much in the minds of all those people at the moment.  I think that everybody throughout the country, and not just here in this House, would be extremely interested and not a little relieved to hear what suggestions the Minister has to make as to how this might most smoothly be carried out.</P>
    <P>This obviously applies also in the matter of making new appointments. We all realise that this is, under the present process, taking a considerable length of time.  It does not involve the Minister directly, but it is one of the things giving rise to some concern and which we would all like to see expedited by whatever means is possible.</P>
    <P>The last thing on that particular point is the question which I do not think any public representatives are sure about, and that is, who is responsible for the preparation of the estimates for the financial year 1971-72?  Will it be the existing health authorities or the new members as proposed under these new draft regulations?  If it is to be these members how effectively can they make an assumption in an accurate way about an area over which they have no control, and if it is to be the existing members how can they effectively work out what the amount might be for a board that they in fact will be replaced by?</P>
    <P>Looking at the set-up, the comparison between public representatives and others on the various boards, it is, of course, gratifying to notice that the Minister did accede to the strong representations made to him that the public representatives should be given a majority, but on some of these boards the majority they have been given is of the barest and shakiest nature.  I think I would not be mistaken if I said that <Col N="684" /> on more than half of the boards the public representatives coming from three, four or five local authority areas will have a majority over the others of one.  Taking into account that you may have absences due to illness or people being out of the country or on holiday the effective working majority in that case is absolutely nil.  On the other hand, as I began by saying, I sincerely hope that we will very rarely have a situation where there is a confrontation between the collective public representatives and the collective others.  It would be a deplorable state of affairs, if any of the health boards were to operate in this way, and I sincerely hope that the approach will not be of this nature.</P>
    <P>As I look down the various health boards I see that there will be nine doctors on the eastern, seven on the midlands, six on the mid-west group, seven on the north-east, six on the north-west, and eight on the south-east &mdash;it seemed to begin with seven but another was sneaked in after the explanatory memorandum was printed &mdash;and seven in the west.  One thinks of the approximate 2,500 or 3,000 doctors in the country.  Those doctors must feel tremendously grateful to the Minister for this representation that he has given to them on these new boards&mdash; nine out of 35 on the eastern, eight out of 31 on the south-eastern.  This is very generous representation, and I hope it will be representation that will be approached in the proper manner by the appointing bodies when they come to appoint their representatives to the board.</P>
    <P>In comparison with these figures the representation afforded to nurses, that long forgotten branch of the health service, is fairly skimpy.  On each of the boards there will be one general nurse and one psychiatric nurse.  Yet, in any health service or in any hospital the number of nurses and their contribution is always for greater than the contribution made by any of the rest who are involved in the service.  If, heaven forbid&mdash;I know that there are others who would quarrel with me about this, but I agree with the Minister on it&mdash;the Minister should ever decide to increase the number of <Col N="685" />&ldquo;others&rdquo; rather than public representatives on the health boards, the field he should look to to give increased representation is our nurses, and I would say increase the representation of general nurses.</P>
    <P>Might I again mention to the Minister and to the House that it is a pity that, again presumably for very understandable reasons of difficulty touched on by the Minister in his speech, the Minister was unable to give us in fairly clear terms the administrative centres from which each of these health boards will operate and the centre in which each general hospital will be.  Obviously this would have improved our knowledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The health boards will have the first decision as to their centres, and I cannot make a decision. As far as the hospitals are concerned this has nothing to do with the Health Act, which merely makes it possible to build general hospitals and which did not mention the location of the general hospitals.  It is not related to this.  The health boards will have their own choice as to their centres.  If they cannot make up their minds then I will choose a centre for the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that this is an aspect of the Act which I did not realise: that it would be up to each board to choose their own administrative centre, but I would presume that the centre for the eastern board would be in Dublin, and I was given the mistaken impression from listening to conversation between people from some southern counties that there was a controversy as to whether the administrative centre would be in one of the deeper southern counties or in one of the more northerly ones, and I thought that the final decision rested with the Minister.  Perhaps what they had in mind was that he would have the final decision in the event that they were not going to get agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister set out the idea, which was a very laudable one, that each health board area would cover a population of at least 200,000 irrespective of the square mileage or the area involved.  This is a good thing and is more or less in line with what is a generally accepted standard as to <Col N="686" /> what the functional area of a health board should be, but the only thing that the Minister did not mention in his speech&mdash;and that would have been far more interesting to the members of the eastern health board area&mdash;was the simple fact that if you are specifying a minimum or anything you obviously must presume that there should also be a maximum.  The Minister did not define the maximum, and to my mind the maximum here, which is at present about 921,000, quite obviously will in the next 10 or 15 years run to 1,250,000 or perhaps more, and, if so, there will be extreme difficulty in carrying on in an effective way. Recently what I thought was a very interesting suggestion was made to me, that consideration should be given to the idea of actually dividing the city of Dublin in two, basing one health area on the northern side with some adjoining area, County Dublin, perhaps, and Meath as well, and another area which would include south Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and perhaps part of Dublin county.  It is obvious that this would have created vast administrative difficulties for the existing authorities and for the Department in endeavouring to sort out this type of situation but if one is to have regard to the continuing expansion in the population of Dublin city and county, perhaps one would agree that it might have been the bravest and, in the long term, the most clever step to have taken.  However, this has not been done and we must accept that, but I say to the Minister in all sincerity that the eastern health board area is very large, population-wise, and all the indications from the planning officers of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council are that the population will increase rapidly during the next ten or 15 years. Therefore, the size of the eastern health board area in relation to population ought to be taken into account by the Minister's Department in future years.</P>
    <P>Finally, while there were many parts of the Bill with which I did not agree, I agree in principle with these draft regulations.  All of us must support the idea of regionalisation and the endeavour to have a more effective, a more efficient and a more modern health service for all our people.  On <Col N="687" /> that aspect, we are in agreement on the principle of the need for rationalisation. We may not always have been in agreement with regard to the number of representatives from any particular area but, presumably, it is a healthy sign when suggestions are put forward from one side of the House and when they can be opposed and debated from the other side.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued by the idea that a board cannot function properly if it is composed of more than 30 members. One often reads in the newspapers of 79 or 80 people meeting for hours to discuss some matter.  I do not see why the eastern health board cannot, if they so desire, have upwards of 79 or 80 members.  However, we must accept that we have 35 members.  I would hope that some Members of this House as well as of the other House will be among those 35 and I would hope, too, that the seven representatives in the Dublin Corporation area will not all be either from the other House or from the other House combined with this House.</P>
    <P>For my part.  I wish the measure every success and I shall do all in my power to assist the eastern health board to get off to a good start.  I sincerely hope that it will result in the provision of a more efficient, more modern and more effective health service for our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these regulations implementing the Health Act of 1970.  I should like to refer to the composition of the health boards and to what has been said about the proportion of professional and the public representatives on the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he says he does not think there will be any occasion on which there will be a clash of interests between the two types of representation.  I recently had the experience, with Senator Boland, of serving on a body in the eastern region of Dublin.  This body was set up for the purpose of reaching some conclusions on a matter not very far removed from the objectives of the Health Act of 1970 and on that body there was almost 40 per cent medical <Col N="688" /> representation out of a membership of almost 30.  We have not had many meetings so far but it is quite clear that there will be close co-operation between the medical and the other representatives.  I can see no reason why there should be any confrontation between the interests of the two parties. I never cease to be intrigued by what would appear to be a conflict in the minds of certain people about the effectiveness of doctors as representatives on bodies like that.</P>
    <P>People blame doctors for not taking sufficient interest in pressing forward improvements in health services and for not advancing the interests of the public in health matters but, on the other hand, when the question arises of giving them an opportunity for doing this, it usually meets with less than the same amount of enthusiasm. Perhaps there is some explanation for this conflict but I cannot understand it.</P>
    <P>At the moment, I have the pleasure of supervising a student in a dissertation on the effectiveness of doctors in making changes in health services and in improving and developing these services. It has been part of my job to ensure that this student was put in touch with various medically qualified persons who are interested in politics and in public administration.  This student has been amazed at the enthusiasm with which doctors whom she has visited want to be involved in these matters but it was also apparent that the opportunity for crystalising their ideas has not always existed.</P>
    <P>These boards with a relatively high but not too high a proportion of professional representation will provide an opportunity for this type of crystalisation. It will encourage doctors to take an interest in these matters and this, in turn, cannot be anything but good for the development of the services.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that the training of a doctor is defective in this particular regard.  Primarily, a doctor is an individualist. He does the best he can for individual patients, one at a time, and the concept of the greatest good for the greatest number is not part of any medical curriculum.  He starts his professional life as an individualist and it <Col N="689" /> requires a good deal of moulding of his particular kind of character to make of him someone who will press forward on an administrative basis and who will endeavour to put matters on a broader front&mdash;someone who will keep the interests of all the people prominently in mind.</P>
    <P>Among these representatives I welcome the appearance in each medical group of at least one medical practitioner who is working in the field of preventive medicine.  This is very important. As I have said before in this House, it is important to involve preventive and social medicine in the health services.</P>
    <P>There will also be another satisfactory dividend from this type of involvement and that is in relation to the training of doctors both as students and as graduates.  This brings me to the last point I wish to make and that is that in three of these regions, the eastern region, the southern region and the western region, there are medical schools.  In the eastern region there are indeed three medical schools.  I hope somehow or other when the machinery is arranged for those people to be appointed to serve on the board representatives will be found who are involved in teaching and training doctors, both at the undergraduate and at the postgraduate level.  The type of person who has this involvement brings to his service on a board like this a different type of experience and a different type of outlook from someone who has not got it.  This is an improvement in the general working of the body.  It also has the reverse effect of preventing the people who are involved in this section of medical education from being in an ivory tower, from getting themselves separated from the general applied aspects of the subjects which they teach.  It is very easy if you work inside what is sometimes referred to as the cloistered atmosphere of an institution like that to get away from the practical application, particularly of many of the scientific subjects.  We cannot afford to do that now and the more we can involve people who have this sort of expertise in making this available by letting them serve on <Col N="690" /> boards like this the better.  I welcome those regulations.</P>

      <P>Senator Boland told us that in general the provisions in the draft regulations had already been discussed at length when we discussed the Health Bill some months ago but then he proceeded at length to give the same speech he gave then. I have no intention of doing that.  I am glad the Minister has reassured us that those regulations and those regions are not so sacrosanct that they will remain for all time and if experience and time prove that they must be changed he is prepared to make the necessary changes.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was in the Cork region North Kerry asked him to put North Kerry in with the Shannon area. He explained to us the reason why this could not be done and we accepted his reasons and explanations.  We are quite sure that when the time comes if we are not in the correct region he is quite prepared to let us switch.  We are prepared to take the present region as a basis for working.  Time may prove that the Minister is right and we are quite confident if the region and the regulations do not suit the medical world they will be changed by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on the regulations.  First of all, I want to begin, not unnaturally I suppose, on a parochial note and to protest most strongly at the under-representation of Limerick city on the proposed mid-western health board. As the Minister is aware, like every other county borough, Limerick city does not enjoy any abatement of rates and therefore the ratepayers in Limerick pay the full amount for health charges.  The Minister, who, to give him his due, has taken into consideration geographical and population considerations has, as far as I can see, completely ignored financial considerations. Furthermore, the city of Limerick which now has 60,000 people and will, according to Professor Lichfield and Mr. Buchanan, have another 15,000 to 20,000 by 1985, is entitled to at least equal representation with the county of Limerick, the <Col N="691" /> part county of North Tipperary and Clare County.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for increasing the representation of Limerick County Council which was grossly under-represented in the original proposals but I would like to ask him even at this late stage at least to bring the representation for Limerick city up to the same as that enjoyed by the contiguous counties with which it will be working, namely, County Limerick, County Clare and Tipperary North Riding.</P>
      <P>I would like to agree with the other speakers in that I do not think any conflict of interest will arise in the discussions which the various health authorities will be carrying out from time to time.  It might be inferred from that possibly, although I would not like to infer it, and I am sure the Minister would not wish it to be understood, that there was any conflict of interest in the four existing joint health authorities because the medical and other professions were not represented on those bodies.  As a member of the Limerick Health Authority for the past ten years I should like to pay tribute to the manner in which the public representatives&mdash;as the Senators know it was only the public representatives who were on those boards&mdash;worked together in the general interests of all the people in the area they served and to the very happy relationship which existed between the public representatives and the unrepresented medical and other professions.  If I were to express what is probably a lone view, if I were in the Minister's shoes I would have been inclined to build on the existing joint health authorities and to continue the existing arrangement which had been proved over the past ten years.  However, the Minister in his wisdom has decided, and obviously he has been strongly supported by the medical and other professions, to give representation to the medical and nursing professions and on balance I think this will prove to be a good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has agreed to give a majority on each of the health boards to public representatives but the majority, in some cases a meagre one, would <Col N="692" /> hardly be regarded as overgenerous. During the debate on the Health Bill recently in this House I suggested a fair division of representation would be two-third public representatives and one-third medical, nursing and other professions.  The idea appears to have got out that the public representatives want to have an over-riding majority because they want to use it to vote against the medical or professional representatives.  I do not think that situation will arise.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration in this which the Minister has apparently overlooked.  The success of those boards rests very largely on the dedication, the hard work and the co-operation of unpaid public representatives who are prepared to give their time and their efforts to serving the public. Many of those men on various boards throughout the country, and I am sure the Minister will agree with this, have given this service down the years at no cost to the public or local exchequers. The only thing I regret is that the Minister did not accept the proposition that the widest possible representation for the public representatives would ensure that the boards would work in closer harmony with the people they serve.</P>
    <P>I can see in the case of Limerick city now where we are asked to nominate only three representatives on to the mid-western board that there will be extreme difficulty in electing those representatives, particularly in the present political composition of the Limerick City Council.  I hope the Minister will agree, even at this late juncture, to bringing the level of representation of Limerick city up to the level of the contigous counties.</P>
    <P>I should like on the whole to join with the other speakers in supporting the idea of regionalisation.  In this day and age we must accept that the larger unit is more likely to give an efficient service to the people in the groups it represents.  It is a very welcome change in Limerick because we had the extraordinary situation there where a certain institution in Limerick was prohibited from taking into the institution patients who happened to live in one of the contiguous counties, say, County Clare, which is only two <Col N="693" /> or three miles from the institution concerned. These institutions will now be open to people living in Limerick city and county, North Tipperary and Clare.  That is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>It is possibly a little outside the regulations which, I understand, strictly speaking, are the only matter under discussion and the Minister in the Dáil resisted any efforts to speak on anything else, but perhaps he would give some indication in his reply as to how it is proposed to appoint the key figures in these health boards&mdash;the chief executive officers.  Will they be recruited from the staffs of the existing health authorities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. Andy O'Brien Mr. Andy O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andy O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is sticking to the magical figure of 30 or about 30 members for these regional boards.  That is rather poor representation for the ratepayers in one area at least.  Nineteen elected representatives on the eastern board means one elected representative in respect of 48,000 people, whereas in another area there is one elected representative in respect of about 11,000.  I know it can be argued that the eastern area is a more compact area but nevertheless one representative for 48,000 people means that the unwieldiness of which the Minister was afraid at the top is coming in at ground level.  A board to cater for a population of approximately one million, an area which has more people than the next four boards on the list, should be well in excess of 30 to 35.  The Minister should have seen <Col N="694" /> to that.  These nineteen representatives should not be expected to look after such a huge number&mdash;to make representations on behalf of individuals in respect of hospital bills and for families who claim general medical service cards.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the Minister has indicated that the professional representation on these boards will be based on the areas they represent as far as possible because in different areas because of the population set-up different problems may arise and need attention.  A county which is being depopulated always has a high percentage of elderly people.  That question arose some time ago in Cavan when representations were being made about a grant to provide a hospital to cater for the aged.  The county has an inordinately high percentage of elderly people on account of the emigration of the middle age group and of people in their early 20s.  I feel it is absolutely necessary to have professional representation to cater for the various classifications of population within a regional area.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave as the reason why he must have three representatives on the regional board that different Departments contribute 75 per cent of the total cost of health. That would lead one to think that the Minister feels that the nominees will, in fact, be able to look after the official end but on the next page the Minister goes on to state his intention of ensuring that vocational areas that might not otherwise be represented are, in fact, represented.</P>
      <P>I take it the Minister is aware that great attention will be centred on his three nominees.  If the Minister is lucky enough to make three appointments in each case which are accepted by the people as being evidence of the Minister's desire to ensure that the best possible set-up is brought about the Minister will have gone a long way towards getting the regional board off to a good start.  If, on the other hand, people are dissatisfied and feel these people were appointed for reasons other than their devotion to health it might get the board off to a rather bad start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> I am prepared to concede, from the progress the Minister has made with the Bill from the beginning, that he is doing his best.  I am sure the Minister will give great attention to the selection of the three nominees for these boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>Senator O'Brien referred to the number of local authority representatives in relation to population and he also referred to the representational work that they would naturally do.  Of course, I explained in the House before that the members of the local county advisory committees are perfectly entitled to make appeals for people who they think are not getting adequate service.  In fact this is one way in which they can exercise their guardianship in respect of any particular county.  It is one of the things they can do.  In fact anybody can make representations. Deputies can make representations and members of county councils or local authorities who are not themselves members of a county advisory health committee or a health board can make representations.  Therefore the opportunity to make representations, while I hope it will be largely centred on the members of the health board and the county advisory committee, is there for others too, and in that way I think there will be adequate representation for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator J. Boland referred to the transitional problems.  They do not directly arise on these regulations but perhaps the House and Senator Boland would like to know that the new boards become responsible for the services on 1st April, 1971.  A transitional arrangement will be required and there will be a liaison committee of county managers working with the chief executive officers who by that time will have been appointed for the purpose. County councils will act on an agency basis for the time being in order to provide what might be described as a transitional service.  The estimates will be initiated at a very early date.  In fact preparation of the 1971-72 estimates is already being done by the staff of the existing health authorities. <Col N="696" /> They will continue with this work until the health boards are set up.  The finalising of the estimates will be a joint operation up to the 1st April, 1971 for the health boards and the existing authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton referred to the position of Carlow.  Carlow did not object to the headquarters of the health board being situated in Waterford if the health board so choose.  They only made the point that the general hospital, if there was to be one as suggested in the FitzGerald Report, should be in Kilkenny and not in Waterford.  I do not need to tell the House how difficult the choice of the midland hospitals will be.  One can jump from Monaghan to Cavan, from Mullingar to Tullamore and from Kilkenny to Waterford.  If the FitzGerald Report is accepted representations will be made from the other excellent general hospitals and if one accepts their suggestions then the rest of the FitzGerald Report recommendations must go.  It is a kind of game of chess which I do not look forward to playing at all.  Each local authority will have its own point of view and they will probably be in contradiction to each other.</P>
    <P>The period of duration of the health boards will be five years.  The second election of the health boards will be in 1972.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Senator Belton and Senator Boland asked about the position of the Eastern Health Board. It is fair to say that 35 members for the Eastern Health Board with a population of 929,000 does not compare too badly with the 27 members on the Dublin Health Authority which at present serves 795,000 people.  I know that kind of statistical comparison can be challenged but all I can say is that I did my best.  I did not want to go up to 40.  I agree there is no magical number.  Senator Boland and Senator Belton also spoke about the necessity of having to work the Eastern Health Board through a number of committees with a considerable derogation of authority to the chief executive officer.  Senators <Col N="697" /> will admit the whole administration is extremely complex and cannot be related only to the number of members; it has to be related to the method of administration.</P>
      <P>If it is felt that the numbers are too small in order to perform effectively there is nothing to prevent a health board, if they get my consent, from forming a committee to which certain powers can be derogated.  These committees can include people who are not members of the health board.  This is a very valuable provision because it provides flexibility.  One would have to make quite certain it was not misused because it could cause confusion and bring about inefficiency but if it is used wisely it means that a health board of 35 or 32 can have some of their work conducted by people whom they appoint on a sub-committee. These may include people who are not members of the health board but are expert in some particular field and to whom some minor powers can be derogated.  I shall have to see how that works out and use my discretion in agreeing to that in order to make sure that it is in consonance with efficient organisation.  Senators also spoke about the fact that I did upgrade the number of represenatives from counties of low population.</P>
      <P>Senator Jessop spoke about the valuable contribution which could be made by the medical profession and I quite agree with him.  A number of the medical profession are already interested in administration as I know from the 30 consultative boards of one kind or another attached to my Department. I have found the medical profession able to speak clearly about a situation and able to make suggestions about how to develop a particular service.  I look forward to the contribution they can make.  I agree with Senator Jessop that they are inclined to be individualists.  I am very glad that Senator Jessop in a totally different capacity from being a Senator is working for a greater teaching of social medicine to undergraduates so that when a doctor receives his degree he knows far more about social medicine and social behaviourism as a whole in relation to the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> Senator Ahern referred to the position of Kerry on the Southern Health Board.  I want to make sure their position is taken care of and that they do not suffer through being a small partner on a big board.  I do not think a Kerryman would ever admit he is small in stature compared with a Corkman even though the numbers may be smaller.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell referred to the numbers of representatives of Limerick proposed under the regulations for Limerick Corporation.  It is fairly easy for three people to represent a city the size of Limerick.  I have examined the position very carefully.  I have increased the number for Limerick County Council and I am afraid that is all I can do.  I would also inform Senator Russell that the advertisements for chief executive officers who are to be appointed entirely by the Local Appointments Commission have already been appointed.  We hope the chief executive officers will begin to operate some time in October or November so that they can take part in the changeover from the health authority to the regional health boards and make sure that the administration can work satisfactorily.  They will be working for the health boards from October onwards in a consultative capacity only.  They will not become legally operative in their new function until 1st April, 1971.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland was right when he said that the health boards had not been designed so that everybody could travel from home to a meeting and return home on the same day.  I did my best but I cannot do anything more. Senator Boland said he thought the majority of local authority representatives may be too small but he countered that statement by saying he hoped there would be no confrontation between local authority representatives and the professionals and I hope so as well.  So far as absences are concerned, there may be absences on both sides. The Senator also referred to the work of nurses.  I should like to have appointed representatives from the various groups but I found it impossible to do so.  I should like to say that although it is not a matter related <Col N="699" /> to these regulations I hope everybody concerned with health on the local authorities will encourage the formation of a committee in every hospital where nurses can give advice on the running of hospitals so far as the nursing profession is concerned. This is not to be found in a great many hospitals even in the year 1970.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have referred to the growth of Dublin.  That will be taken care of by future amendments to the regulations when required.  I think I have dealt with all the points raised by Senators.</P>

I must admit to having made inadequate reference to it but in column 435 I did point out that under the existing Act the provision for conviction on indictment was that the person was liable to imprisonment with or without hard labour for six months and that this was omitted from this section.  I must admit that my mind was not directed very fully to the question of the type of punishment that might be appropriate to get proper enforcement of this Bill which I am sure the Minister wishes should be secured.  I can only submit that it would be the right thing for this House to do to reconsider this section if someone who had at the Committee Stage indicated dissatisfaction with the nature of the penalty being imposed becomes more clear subsequently as to the type of punishment that would be most appropriate, even if he made no such reference.  I am in the hands of the House but I would submit that it is not unreasonable for me to ask the House now to listen briefly to what I might say in reference to this particular penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 15 and 16 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  On the sale or in the contract for the sale of any goods in respect of which the Minister has made an order under section 2 of this Act, the vendor shall be deemed to warrant that the goods have been packed in compliance with the terms of such order.</P>
      <P>(2)  A contract, whether made before or after the passing of this Act, by virtue of which a vendee would be directly or indirectly deprived of his right to obtain relief under this section shall be void.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is before the House and there is therefore no point in my reading it to the House, nor, indeed, is there any point in my repeating what I said on the Committee Stage, except perhaps to say in support of the amendment that I think I am correct in my statement of the law on this matter that, if someone delivers goods in a container not complying with an order of the Minister made under this Bill and is not fraudulent in his so doing, the person receiving the goods will have, under the existing state of the Irish law, no remedy in damages for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain cases where innocent misrepresentation might render the vendor liable to the vendee. I do not think any such cases arise in this particular instance but a law has been introduced and passed in the United Kingdom to which, perhaps, I may be permitted to refer.  This law indicates that this is a problem understood elsewhere to be very real.  It is <Col N="702" /> called the misrepresentation Act of 1967.  It deals with this question of somebody who is innocent, that is to say, somebody who does not intend to defraud but who does, in fact, deliver goods which are in contravention of an order.  The person receiving the goods must act quickly.  He may be required to open the first container in a whole series supplied to him to discover that this series of containers are not packed as they should be packed.  He then has the opportunity of sending the lot back but if he adopts the order he makes the mistake of not being sufficiently alert.  In Ireland at the moment such a person would have no right to damages but the position in the United Kingdom is otherwise.</P>
    <P>I shall not bore the House by reading the entire section from the 1967 Act but I shall simply summarise it by saying that the position in Britain at the moment is that such a person, if he receives goods in a container that is not packed in compliance with an order made under this Act, is entitled to damages from the man who sold him the goods.  May I say at this point that the particular draft that I have made is not necessarily the most appropriate form of drafting amendment to this section; it could be done as the English have done, in a different way but they have gone on to provide in subsection (3) of the Misrepresentation Act of 1967 that any agreement whether made before or after commencement of the Act containing a provision that would exclude or restrict any liability to which a party to a contract may be subject by reason of any misrepresentation made by him before the contract was made shall be of no effect and so on.  In other words, a person would have a right to damages as a result of misrepresentation even though the misrepresentation was something short of fraud.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should say that any lawyer is extremely slow to lay any proceedings in connection with fraud. In fact, the dicta of the judiciary impose serious burdens of responsibility on solicitors, both professionally and in conscience.  Of course, the laying of any claim to fraud against a person is of a very serious nature but <Col N="703" /> innocent misrepresentation is a different matter.  When I put down my amendment I did not know about this provision of the Misrepresentation Act of 1967 but now that I have discovered it I am supported in my subsequent drafting on this.  This is the only additional recommendation I make on the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this particular amendment put down in the names of Senators FitzGerald and Kelly and I am mindful of the statements made in this regard on Committee Stage.  However, something which I find myself having to point out again is that this Bill is designed to protect the consumer but we now find ourselves involved in protecting the retailer as such against any damage that he might suffer by having had a successful claim from the consumer or as a result of an action initiated by the Minister leaving him without recourse to go back to the supplier.  As I see it, this particular clause that is being advocated by the Senator is not really necessary.  It has not a great deal to commend it.  However, it is possible that its inclusion in the Bill might make somewhat easier the task of a trader in recovering damages and from that point of view I can accept that there are no compelling reasons why I should reject it.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, in extending the argument in favour of the inclusion of the amendment the Senator spoke specifically today about the fact that the British had introduced a section in their Misrepresentation Act of 1967 to cover this particular eventuality.  The difference here is that this is already covered, as I have said before on Second Reading and on Committee Stage, under section 17 of the 1887 Act whereby the retailer has recourse to the law if somebody supplies him with something that does not measure up to its trading description.  As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the need for its inclusion in the Misrepresentation Act of 1967 arose from the fact that the United Kingdom repealed section 17 of the 1887 Act.  Despite this I am willing, at this stage, to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> The Senator points out that he is not fully satisfied with the drafting of the amendment and that it can be amended to read better.  From that point of view, in preparation for acceptance of the amendment I have a revised version prepared by the Parliamentary Draftsman. Let me say, first of all, that the Senator's proposed wording in fact would have had the effect of avoiding the entire contract and would be applied even to contracts already made. There is specific reference to retrospection in this regard.  The revised version provides only the offending clause and does not have the retrospective effect. I propose to accept the Senator's amendment in a revised form.  What is the procedure in this regard?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 26 and 27 to delete &ldquo;under the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 to 1931, or&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> Again, I made a case for this on the Committee Stage.  I said to the Minister that I would consider the question of whether I would press for this amendment in the context of consideration that this merchandise marks code which goes back even earlier than 1887 has always been defective in its operation. Senator Nash made the case, that convinced me, that all those powers which are in this section, which are rather more extensive than you would find in similar Acts were appropriate to the type of operations which would be envisaged by this Bill.  There are all sorts of offences under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, which the Minister has assured us, and which assurance I accept, will be extensively amended in due course, and I hope at an early date, which might be committed by small persons engaged in modest operations.  Section 2 (1) of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887 states:</P>
    <P>Every person who</P>
    <P>(a)  forges any trade mark; or</P>
    <P>(b)  falsely applies to goods any trade mark or any mark so nearly resembling a trade mark as to be calculated to deceive; or</P>
    <P>(c)  makes any die, block, machine, or other instrument for the purpose of forging, or of being used for forging, a trade mark; or</P>
    <P>(d)  applies any false trade description to goods; or</P>
    <P>(e)  disposes of or has in his possession any die, block, machine, or other instrument for the purpose of forging a trade mark;</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the Act which has since been amended to some extent, &ldquo;trade description&rdquo; means:</P>
    <P>any description, statement, or other indication, direct or indirect,</P>
    <P>(a)  as to the number, quantity, measure, gauge, or weight of any goods or</P>
    <P>(b)  as to the place or country in which any goods were made or produced, or</P>
    <P>(c)  as to the mode of manufacturing or producing any goods, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> (d)  as to the material of which any goods are composed, or</P>
    <P>(e)  as to any goods being the subject of an existing patent, privilege, or copyright.</P>
    <P>We can take a particular view of the criminal code operative in this country, and the law here is British law essentially.  The presumption is that the person is innocent until proved guilty and is protected by procedures which mean he is not allowed incriminate himself.  It is one thing to be liable civilly but it is another to be liable criminally.  Innocent men may say things which could provide evidence against themselves.  They may produce books which are kept by people that have not been adequately under their control and pretend to mistakes for which they are not responsible.  A whole build-up against them can create a situation which by one fact associated with another makes someone look as if he had committed a crime.  I feel it is not necessary for the purposes of this Bill to have these powers which are given, in my case somewhat relucantly, to the Minister's authorised officer for this particular authorisation but I am convinced that if people are producing pre-packaged goods there is a whole series of pre-packaged containers involved, and it is right that the powers should be very strong.  I should like to see the powers of the authorised officers, or whoever they might be under the new code, considered in the context of what would be these new offences.  I say that as one convinced that there is a necessity to have new offences, convinced that the merchandise marks code is inadequate to protect the consumer. I do not think the Minister loses anything if he simply excises from this section the words which I have suggested, seconded by Senator Kelly, might be excised and leaves the authorised officer simply all the powers, which are already extensive, which are proposed to be given to him for the purposes of this Bill and this Bill only.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment mainly for the reason I <Col N="708" /> gave on Second Reading and again on Committee Stage&mdash;that this particular piece of legislation is being introduced in an effort to protect the consumer. On Second Reading, Senator FitzGerald and a number of other Senators criticised it from the point of view that it was not extensive and suggested to me that this was just a Merchandise Marks Bill and that I had other legislation in the pipeline designed to protect the consumer. Senator FitzGerald earlier on claimed that the merchandise marks code had been notorious and that it had not been enforced.  This provision to give authorised officers more power under this Bill is deliberately included in order to enable the previous Act to be enforced.</P>
      <P>The Senator in speaking just now to his amendment made the point that it is all right to give powers to authorised officers for any of the provisions under this Bill but that he was disinclined to see those powers being extended to the authorised officers for operation under previous Acts.  I am afraid I do not find the amendment acceptable from that angle.  I am certainly most anxious to give that additional power to the authorised officer to enable him to enforce the merchandise marks code as it was always intended that it should be enforced.  For this reason I am opposing the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 28 and 29 to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  Every person guilty of an offence against this Act shall be liable to forfeit to the State every container in his order, possession or procurement, packed in contravention with the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under the Principal Act, the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, one of the consequences of a person being found guilty of an offence against the Act was that the offender would forfeit:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> Every chattel, article, instrument, or thing by means of or in relation to which the offence has been committed.</P>
    <P>Talking of teeth, I cannot think of anything that would bite more deeply into anyone who is engaged in the business of pre-packaging goods if the effect of his pre-packaging was that every chattel, article, instrument or thing by means of or in relation to which the offence has been committed was forfeited for the benefit of the Central Fund and of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am opposing the withdrawal of teeth, what the Senator is seeking here is, to my mind, asking for too much.  The position is that a packer can be charged again and again with an offence under this Bill if he continues to sell substandard, subweighted articles.  From that point of view I do not think this is quite necessary. A moment ago the Senator was endeavouring to protect the authorised officer from too much investigation and turning the whole stock upside down and now in this amendment he is going in the opposite direction.  He can argue I suppose that I am arguing in the opposite direction too but I do not think he can justifiably do this.  It would be for the authorised officers to follow up those matters after prosecution to ensure that those goods or similar goods inferior in quality or weight should not be presented again. The Senator in his final words visualised the State getting very useful acquisitions as a result.  I feel that if somebody is found guilty of an offence under this Bill the penalty as already spelt out is sufficient deterrent and penalty for the offence without adding to that the penalty of taking possession of all stuff which is in contravention of the Bill.  I feel it is sufficient to take action against him for the original offence and if he were to continue committing the offence the penalty provisions are such that he is still liable to very serious fines and to quite serious detention.  I cannot see the necessity for the inclusion of this section in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are creating a new offence by this Bill <Col N="710" /> which is an amendment of the Principal Act.  If somebody is found guilty of an offence under the Principal Act he is liable to forfeit every chattel, article, instrument, or thing by means of or in relation to which the offence has been committed.  Therefore, every offence, except an offence under this Bill, will be subject to this particular clause and this particular effect.  Why should an offence under this Bill be free from liability when there is liability in respect of every other offence under the Merchandise Marks Code?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Senator's contention in this regard. Here we have a situation where a person commits an offence and there is a penalty for so doing.  This is spelled out in the Bill.  We have a situation here where an official is going in to check a stock or consignment of goods and taking samples from a consignment of goods, which is a very long operation.  As I understand it, under the amendment outlined by the Senator, every container has to be examined and tested to ensure that it in its own way is against the Act.  It would be far better if an offender has been prosecuted, found guilty and penalised in the appropriate way that he should have the responsibility of putting his goods in order.  I cannot see the necessity for this additional penalty here.</P>

I find it difficult to accept the logic of that.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 46 to 54 and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where a person is charged with an offence under this Act in relation to goods packed in a container, it shall be a defence to the charge for him to show&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that he took reasonable precautions against committing, in relation to the goods, an offence of the kind with which he is charged,</P>
      <P>(b)  that at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, he had no reason to suspect that the packaging, importation or sale as the case may be, of the goods was in contravention of the provisions of this Act or of an order under this Act, and</P>
      <P>(c)  that the packing, importation or sale, as the case may be, of the goods in contravention of the provisions of this Act or of an order under this Act, was due to a because beyond his control.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>A director, manager or other similar officer for the purposes of this section shall include any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors, committee of management or other controlling authority of a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons are accustomed to act.</P>
      <P>I must say I consider this an important amendment.  I have some familiarity with arrangements under which persons can manage to run companies and institutions of one kind or another without their names ever appearing anywhere on the notepaper.  I have tried to use the language which appears in section 190 of the Companies Act, 1963.  I should start off by saying that the definition of &ldquo;director&rdquo; which is given generally in the Companies Act, 1963 was not apparently thought by the draftsman to be sufficiently wide to take in a case where you really wanted to get the director to make a full declaration of his interest in the company. The definition of a director in section 2 of the Act states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;director&rdquo; includes any person occupying the position of director by whatever name called;</P>
      <P>The draftsman of section 190 was concerned to have available to the shareholders of any company when they attended a general meeting, a full disclosure of the directors' interests in the company.  They went on to say that for the purpose of section 190 they would give a new definition to the meaning of the word &ldquo;director&rdquo;.  In subsection (11) (a) they state:</P>
      <P>Any person in accordance with whose direction or instructions the directors of a company are accustomed to act shall be deemed to be a director of the company;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all heard about guineapig directors.  I am a guineapig director of <Col N="713" /> a number of companies.  There is no question about what my duty is.  I have to do what the real director of the company tells me to do.  That is my duty.  Under section 190 he would be required to disclose his shareholding interest but under this section he would be a director of a company which I would be the formal director of.  I would be guilty of the offence and he would not.  I am suggesting that in such a case I would be fairly soon off the board and that he should, by definition of the section, be found guilty of an offence of which he was really guilty, as culpable as the person in accordance with whose directions that company was accustomed to act.  As the section is drafted we have to take in not merely directors but directors, managers or other similar officers.  I shall read my amendment:</P>
    <P>A director, manager or other similar officer for the purposes of this section shall include any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors, committee of management or other controlling authority of a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons are accustomed to act.</P>
    <P>That is to say where an offence under the Act is committed by a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons and it is proved that it is committed with the connivance and consent of and attributable to the neglect on the part of any person, whether he appears on the notepaper or the records of the company or the committee of management or the bodies in question as a director or manager or other officer, if he is a person who gives instructions and directions in accordance with that body corporate or an unincorporated body, that person is the person who should be found guilty of the offence and liable to be prosecuted against and punished accordingly &mdash;of course, not unless he is proved guilty of the offence in question, not unless he is proved to have consented to, connived at or contributed by neglect to, the commission of the offence by the body corporate in question. I think the amendment is a useful one and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>As in the case of the other amendments which the Senator has put down, I have looked as carefully and closely as I could at the possible justification for the inclusion of this amendment and, on examining it, and seeking all the advice I could generally in connection with it, I am opposed to accepting this amendment, on the basis that the wider definition which the Senator specifically picks out, section 190 of the Companies Act, and particularly other sections&mdash;195 and 196, which deal with the register of directors' shareholdings&mdash;is not used in the Companies Act in that section dealing with offences.  From that point of view I feel that there is no necessity for including this particular provision here.  Therefore I am opposed to the acceptance of this amendment on the basis that it just is not necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the section to which I refer and which gives this definition in fact does provide for an offence.  The section says:</P>
      <P>If default is made in complying with subsection (7), the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £50; and if default is made in complying with subsection (1) or subsection (2), or if any inspection required under this section is refused or if any copy required under this section is not sent within the proper period, the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
      <P>That includes a director and a person in accordance with whose directions a company is accustomed to act.</P>

      <P>The section does contain a fine and will catch the person who is responsible for the offence, a person in accordance with whose directions and instructions the company is accustomed to act, so that it is not correct to say that this particular definition of a director is excluded from sections where there are offences committed, because the very definition that I have taken is taken from a section which provides for offences and for fines against persons of this kind.</P>
