      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 1 and 3.  In order to take No. 2 we shall have to comply with Standing Orders by having a resolution to that effect, and I move that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Standing Orders relating to public business, the Social Welfare Bill, 1970, shall be taken today.</P>

      <P>I object most strongly to this whole procedure.  We adjourned the Seanad last evening and I certainly had a clear understanding that we were adjourning the Housing Bill debate until 10.30 this morning.  I think that we are being made shuttlecocks in this House.  I understand that we are going to be faced not only with these two important Bills which are now on the Order Paper but with nine Bills which the Seanad will have to complete between now and the conclusion of the session.  We have just heard from you, Sir, a report that Dáil Éireann has accepted amendments which we have made to other Bills. Therefore, the Seanad has a role to play in relation to serious Bills if we have an opportunity of putting down amendments to them.</P>

      <P>I should like to agree wholeheartedly with the remarks of Senator FitzGerald.  I should like to ask the Leader of the House whether it is intended to take the remaining Stages of No. 1, the Housing Bill, today. While I appreciate the difficulties of <Col N="896" /> the Leader of the House and of other people who are trying to arrange the Parliamentary business, it is most unfair to Members of this House to be asked suddenly to take up one of these important Bills that have been for a considerable length of time in the other House.  As Senator FitzGerald has pointed out, we have just been notified of the other House agreeing to amendments put by us to Bills.  There are two other measures at present tabled before the Dáil with amendments by the Seanad and this is proof that this House has a contribution to make. It is very difficult to make that contribution if we are suddenly told that the Social Welfare Bill has to be taken today and presumably we will be asked to go through all Stages today.  It is virtually impossible in these circumstances to prepare amendments.  I appreciate the difficulties which the Leader of the House is faced with, but I feel I must convey the disappointment and annoyance of the Members of this House about the way in which we have been treated both yesterday and today.  Presumably it will be the same for the remaining few days of this session.</P>

      <P>I explained last night the difficulties with which we were faced in regard to the Social Welfare Bill and the Housing Bill.  I thought we had reached an agreement that we would take the Social Welfare Bill today&mdash;it has to become law in order that the payments may be made at the end of this month&mdash;and that we would take the Housing Bill also and complete it so that it could also become law and be returned to the Dáil not later than tomorrow.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Boland's protest about the delay, I am quite sure that he is aware, as are all the Members of the House, that it is not the fault of myself or the people on this side of the House that these Bills have come in such quick succession to us at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> The Senator is aware that for the last couple of months there has been in the Dáil a filibuster which has prevented the normal passage of several Bills through the House.</P>

      <P>If I am to explain why we now find ourselves in the dilemma that the Social Welfare Bill is coming to us at this late stage I must explain that Bills were delayed deliberately in the Dáil for the last couple of months.  Otherwise, we would not have had these Bills coming to us at the end of the year.  Now that we have them we have to face up to the situation. I sought agreement last night from the Leader of the Opposition and I thought we had got agreement that we would take these Bills as they come along during the next week thus enabling us to complete the business before us.  I agree completely with what Senator Boland has said.  It has always been generally agreed that it is most unfair for this Seanad to be faced with the mountain of legislation at the end of the term, but that seems to be the natural order of things because of the way in which the Dáil does its business and by reason of the situation which obtains in regard to the Dáil going into recess.  We have to wait for business from the Dáil.  If the Dáil continues to work up to the end of July we will continue to be faced with situations like this.  I agree thoroughly with Senator Boland and join with him in expressing the hope that some means will be found whereby we are not faced with a situation of this nature again.</P>

      <P>Might I just say that at quite a late hour last night I was made aware of the agreement whereby I understood that the Committee and Final Stages of the Housing Bill would be taken today.  This necessitated my spending several hours during the night attempting to prepare amendments to the Housing Bill.  At the same time, I understood that it was also proposed to take No. 3, which is also a cumbersome Bill, because it was considered essential that this should be debated. <Col N="898" /> I feel, however, that this will place a big burden on us and will make it very difficult for us to have a proper discussion on that Bill.  I wonder if the Leader of the House could conceivably arrange the business so that we would not have these Bills following each other?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) (for the Minister for Social Welfare) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) (for the Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>The three main purposes of the Bill are to extend the social insurance system by the introduction of new schemes of death grant, invalidity pension and retirement pension, to provide two new social assistance schemes of allowances for deserted wives and for incapacitated old people and to implement the proposals announced in the Budget for improvements in the existing social insurance and the social assistance scheme.</P>
      <P>As is usual in relation to social welfare legislation, the Bill consists mainly of amendments of the existing legislation and may, therefore, appear obscure in places, but the very full explanatory memorandum which I have had circulated will, I trust, be of assistance to Senators in clarifying its provisions.</P>
      <P>The Bill is divided into three parts. Part I deals with general matters common to the Bill as a whole.  Part II with the new schemes of both social insurance and social assistance and Part III with the Budget improvements in both social insurance and social assistance schemes.</P>
      <P>The first of the new schemes on the social insurance side in Part II of the Bill is the scheme of death grants. Under this scheme a grant of £25 will be payable on the death of an insured person or the husband, wife, widow or widower of an insured person, £15 on the death of an insured person's qualified child aged between five and 18 years, and £5 on the death of a younger qualified child.  Only one grant will be paid on any one death, even though title could be established on two insurances&mdash;for example where a man and his wife are both insured and one of them dies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurance for death grants will apply to all insured persons who are covered for disability benefit and old age (contributory) pensions at present. The scheme will commence on 1st October next and, being a completely <Col N="900" /> new development in the social insurance system, only contributions paid after the scheme commences on 1st October next and which contain an element towards death grant will be accepted towards satisfying the basic contribution condition which requires 26 contributions to have been paid. Grants will therefore only be payable in respect of any deaths occurring after the end of March, 1971, when 26 weeks will have elapsed from the commencement of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Invalidity pension is being provided from 1st October also under the second new social insurance scheme.  This pension will be payable to insured persons who are or become permanently incapable of work and who can satisfy the contribution conditions.  These conditions are that at least 156 contributions have been paid and at least 48 contributions have been paid or credited in the most recent contribution year.  Insurance for invalidity pension will apply to all persons who are insured for disability benefit at present. Persons with the necessary insurance may under existing conditions continue to receive disability benefit for as long as they are incapable of work, but they are required to submit medical evidence periodically and they are paid by cheques issued from the head office of the Department.  Under the invalidity pension scheme, it is intended to dispense with medical certification or examination except on rare occasions, and to pay pension at the post office of the pensioner's choice by weekly orders in pension order books.</P>
    <P>The contribution conditions for the pension will be largely the same as those now required to qualify for disability benefit on a long duration basis while the rates of pension&mdash;£4 10s for the pensioner, £3 3s for an adult dependant, 18s for each of the first two qualified children and 13s for each additional qualified child&mdash;will be the same as the rates of disability benefit. As the pension scheme is a development of disability benefit it is intended that any insurance under the Social Welfare Acts since 1953 which counted for disability benefit purposes will count for invalidity pension.  If that were not done it would be at least three <Col N="901" /> years after the scheme commences before any person could have the 156 paid contributions necessary to satisfy the first condition for pension.  Arrangements will be made to allow paid insurance under the former National Health Insurance Acts prior to 1953 to be used to qualify for invalidity pension where necessary.</P>
    <P>Regulations which I will make will define what constitutes being permanently incapable of work and what I have in mind is that permanent incapacity would involve being totally incapable of work and the likelihood of being so incapable for a lengthy period and certainly for one of not less than twelve months.</P>
    <P>The third new social insurance scheme is the retirement pension scheme, also to be effective from 1st October next.  This will provide pensions for insured persons aged 65 and over who have retired and who have a sufficiently good record of social insurance to satisfy the contribution conditions. The conditions require that the person must have entered insurance before reaching age 55, must have paid at least 156 employment contributions and have been paid or been credited with an average of 48 contributions a year up to age 65.  These conditions are similar to those for old age (contributory) pension but are applicable five years earlier.  The rates of pension will be basically the same as the rates of unemployment benefit &mdash; personal rate £4 10s, and additional £3 3s for a wife or dependent husband, with 18s each for the first two qualified children and 13s for each subsequent child.</P>
    <P>Retirement pension, will to a large extent replace disability and unemployment benefit for insured persons in the age group 65 to 70.  It will be payable by means of a book of pension orders cashable weekly at a post office without the necessity of attending at an employment exchange to sign the unemployed register and without the necessity of submitting medical evidence of unfitness for work.  Insurance for the new pension will apply to those persons who are insured for old age (contributory) pension, and contributions under the Social Welfare Acts since 1953 which count for the purposes of the latter pension will <Col N="902" /> be taken into account for the purposes of the new pension.  This will enable retirement pensions to be payable immediately the scheme commences to persons who have retired. Regulations will define what is meant by retired and broadly the intention is that the definition will require a person to show that he has ceased permanently to be employed in insurable employment of work which, if not insurable, is of that nature, and that he does not intend to resume such employment.  It will of course be open to a person to surrender his pension if he should wish to resume employment at any time between 65 and 70.</P>
    <P>There are a few general points I should like to mention in connection with these new schemes.  First, they are contributory or insurance schemes requiring the satisfaction of contribution conditions by insured persons before title can arise.  In view of the value of the benefits payable these conditions are the minimum necessary and they are in line with contribution conditions for the existing contributory schemes and for such schemes in other countries generally.  Secondly, persons drawing invalidity or retirement pension will be credited with contributions which will count for the purposes of the other social insurance benefits Finally, arrangements will ensure that there will be no duplication of payment of pensions either as between the new pensions or with the existing pensions&mdash; a person may draw invalidity pension up to age 65 and may then draw either invalidity or retirement pension but not both.  At age 70, a person must choose between old age (contributory) pension and whichever of the other pensions has been in payment.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the new social assistance schemes, the first of these in Part II of the Bill is the old age (care) allowance scheme.  This will extend to persons who are not pensioners under the schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare the arrangement whereby £2 15s a week is paid in addition to pension to an incapacitated old age or widow pensioner, aged 70 years and over, who require full-time care and attention by a prescribed female relative and who would <Col N="903" /> otherwise be living alone.  The new scheme is designed to cover persons aged 70 and over who are similarly situated but whose means although too high to permit them to qualify for non-contributory old age pension are less than £299 15s a year.  Means will be assessed for the purpose of this limit in the same way as for non-contributory old age pension.  The conditions of the new scheme generally will be the same as those applicable in the existing schemes and like them will be set out in regulations.  The definition of a female relative for this purpose was broadened last year to cover not only daughters and step-daughters but also sisters, half-sisters, granddaughters, daughters-in-law and nieces.</P>
    <P>The other new social assistance scheme provides for payment of weekly allowances to certain married women who have been deserted by their husbands. The problem of deserted wives is a problem which has aroused much interest generally during the past few years and the aspect of it which the Department of Social Welfare is attempting to deal with in this Bill is that of the long-term hardship caused to the wife and children where the husband has abandoned them for a considerable period and has failed to contribute to their maintenance.  At present, cases of hardship may be taken care of by the home assistance authorities but it is felt that when the situation is long-term it should be dealt with on a more permanent basis.  The new scheme of allowances proposes broadly to treat deserted wives as if they were widows claiming non-contributory pension.  The same conditions as to the rates of payment, the calculation of means, the conditions of qualification of children, the methods of claiming and paying, will apply. This means that the maximum rate of allowance payable to a wife with no assessable means will be £4 5s a week plus 15s for each of her first two qualified children and 10s for each subsequent qualified child up to 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The allowance scheme will differ from the widow's pension scheme in that the allowance will not be paid if <Col N="904" /> the deserted wife is under the age of fifty years and has no qualified children.  It was originally intended that the allowance would cover only mothers of families which had been deserted, but it has been broadened to cover elderly deserted wives aged over 50 years who have no dependent children or whose dependent children have grown up and who may find it difficult because of their age and other factors to obtain employment.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which a woman will be regarded as deserted will be specified by regulation.  I recognise that the framing of these regulations will present many difficulties in attempting to arrive at a definition that will be precise enough to prevent collusion between husband and wife to obtain the allowance and at the same time broad enough to include all genuine cases.</P>
    <P>There are some basic factors which must be borne in mind when dealing with this question.  The first of these is that, as the allowance scheme is in effect a pension scheme, the governing consideration, that is, desertion, should be firmly established and be more or less permanent as, for example, widowhood is in the case of widow's pension. Secondly, the allowance scheme must never even appear to be a possible factor inhibiting a reconciliation between husband and wife.  For that reason, I feel that before title to the allowance could arise, the wife should have availed in so far as is practicable for her, of whatever legal or other processes are open to her, to effect a reconciliation or to oblige the husband to meet his responsibilities to support her and the family.  I do not think that there can be desertion in the sense we are seeking to deal with if the husband is in any way regularly contributing towards the maintenance of the family.</P>
    <P>There are no easy solutions to any of the problems involved but it is necessary at this stage to adopt a pragmatic approach so as to get a reasonable scheme into operation as soon as possible.  Accordingly, the legislation has been framed to give a certain flexibility to the scheme and allow it to be readily modified, where <Col N="905" /> necessary, to effect improvements which experience may show are desirable.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals mainly with the improvements in the existing schemes of social insurance and social assistance announced in the Budget Statement on 22nd April, 1970.  These increases will give an extra 10s a week to all existing non-contributory old age and blind pensioners making the maximum personal rate of old age and blind pension £4 5s a week.  The increase of 11s 6d in the weekly rate of widows non-contributory pension will eliminate the existing differential between that pension and the non-contributory old age pension thus making the maximum personal rate of widow's pension £4 5s a week also.  Orphan's non-contributory pension will be increased by 7s 6d to £2 5s a week.  The increases in the maximum rates of these pensions will enable the scale of means and rates of pension to be extended in each case so as to give additional rates at the bottom of the scales and thus make pensions payable to persons whose means are at present outside the limit for pension.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployment assistance for persons in urban and rural areas are being increased by 10s 6d a week for the recipient.  The maximum rate will be £3 12s for a single person and £6 8s for a married couple in an urban area and £3 6s for a single person and £6 for a married couple elsewhere.  These increases of unemployment assistance at the maximum will automatically extend the means limit for qualification for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The upper age limit for orphans and qualified children under the social assistance schemes which I have mentioned is being raised to 18 years.  The rates of payment for qualified children are also being increased by 2s 6d in each case making the overall payment 15s for each of the first and second child and 10s for each additional child.  These improvements will all come into operation on the first pay day for the particular scheme next August.</P>
    <P>Under the Budget proposals also the rate of children's allowance for the <Col N="906" /> third and each subsequent qualified child in each family under the general scheme of children's allowance will be increased from £2 to £2 5s a month with effect from October next.</P>
    <P>The Budget improvements in the various social insurance benefits and pensions will come into operation at the beginning of October also.  They will provide an extra 17s 6d a week for recipients of old age contributory pension thus making the maximum rate £5 a week for a pensioner personally £8 10s in all for a married couple. Recipients of disability benefit and unemployment benefit will get an additional 15s a week making the new rates £4 10s a week for a single person and £7 13s for a married couple.  The rate of maternity allowance is also being brought up to £4 10s a week. The basic rate of widow's contributory pension will be increased to £4 10s a week also whether or not the widow has any qualified children.  The orphan's contributory allowance is being raised to £3.  The rates of payment in respect of qualified children are being increased by 2s 6d a week in each case while the upper age limit for orphans and qualified children is being raised to 18 years.</P>
    <P>Certain rates of unemployment benefit which are payable where unemployment continues for more than 156 days are linked with the maximum rates of unemployment assistance in urban areas and are being increased from the beginning of August next.  To meet the extra expenditure on the increased rates of benefit and pensions and the cost of new social insurance schemes dealt with in Part II of the Bill, the social insurance contributions payable by employers and employees are being increased from the beginning of October next.  The increase proposed is 5s 5d where all the insurance benefits including the new schemes are covered, with lesser increases where the benefits covered are restricted.  The various rates of contribution are also shown in decimal currency terms to be effective from 15th February, 1971.  The overall weekly employment contribution payable in respect of men in ordinary industrial or commercial employment from October will be 33s 8d made up <Col N="907" /> of 30s 6d in respect of social insurance, 2s 2d in respect of occupational injuries insurance and 1s in respect of redundancy payments.  In the case of women in such employment, the overall weekly contribution will be 31s 5d made up of 29s 1d for social insurance, 1s 7d for occupational injuries insurance and 9d for redundancy.  A table showing the present and proposed rates of contribution appears in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the social insurance system generally in the Bill, the occupational injuries benefits scheme is also being improved by increasing the rates of the main weekly benefits and allowances and the raising of the age limit for qualified children to 18 years.  These changes will not involve any charge on the Exchequer as all these benefits are met out of the occupational injuries fund which is financed by contributions paid by employers only.  A minor adjustment of the contribution necessary on conversation of the contribution to decimal currency terms in February, 1971, is all that is required to meet the extra cost of the improvements.</P>
    <P>Improved facilities for printing insurance stamps and pension order books make it possible this year to bring the improvements in the social insurance schemes into operation from the beginning of October, which is three months earlier than in previous years.  The time-lag between the increases in rates of payment on the social assistance and social insurance sides is, therefore, reduced to two months&mdash;August and September.  During that period, however, cases will still arise where non-contributory pension would temporarily be more favourable than the corresponding contributory pension.  There is a provision in the Bill therefore to prevent a person switching from contributory to non-contributory pension during the two months period in cases where the advantage would be a temporary one only.  The right of a pensioner to switch where the advantage would be permanent will not be affected.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill includes a provision to make a minor modification of the <Col N="908" /> means test for non-contributory old age and widows' pensions to permit the value of a labourer's cottage to be disregarded where it is being purchased by way of an annuity.  At present a person who is paying rent for such a cottage is not assessed with any means from the cottage for pension purposes, whereas a person who is purchasing such a cottage by way of payment of an annuity has the value of the cottage assessed against him although the annuity may be the same amount as the yearly rent.</P>
    <P>I will be moving an amendment on Committee Stage to meet a point raised in the Dáil in regard to section 36 which deals with this provision.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the proposals in the Bill on the social assistance side will be £6,409,000 in a full year, all of which will fall on the Exchequer. The gross cost to the social insurance fund of the proposals on the social insurance side will be £9,815,000 in a full year, of which increased contributions will bring in £7,698,000 to the fund, leaving £2,117,000 to be borne by the Exchequer in a full year.</P>
    <P>These are very substantial amounts but the improvements which they make possible in the services administered by my Department are also very substantial. I have much pleasure, therefore, in recommending the Bill to Seanad Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>

I think I am speaking for the House in general when I suggest that you, Sir, would convey to Deputy Brennan and to his family our sympathy on the death of his daughter.</P>
      <P>In his statement the Minister stated &ldquo;A table showing the present and proposed rates of contribution appears in the explanatory memorandum&rdquo;.  I do not recall having received this explanatory memorandum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to say that we give this Bill only limited assent because we are not entirely satisfied with all its provisions.  First I want to talk about means tests generally. These tests are applied by the Department of Social Welfare, but they are also applied by the Department of Health and the Department of Local Government.  They are a great irritant to people who are due various benefits under the social welfare, housing and health codes, because so many investigators appear in their houses asking similar questions.  I suggest that there should be one investigator who would cover all the questions and that there should be a central office&mdash; perhaps in the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;through which all the necessary information obtained by one investigator could be processed.  From that office all the information necessary to assess the eligibility of a person for these benefits could be obtained. This would prevent irritation to people in an area like Cabra where people are due several benefits.  A multiplicity of investigators is an annoyance.  I do not believe that the means test itself is the real annoyance.  The real annoyance is the number of means tests for the different benefits.  All of us, no matter what the state of our finances, understand means tests and nobody could cavil at one means test.  No one could object to a lesser number of means tests.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of this and to see whether there could be liaison between the Departments of Health, Social Welfare and Local Government in this regard.</P>
      <P>We do not intend to oppose the Bill, but we are not happy at the extent of it.  It only nibbles at the problem.  The Bill may be divided into two parts&mdash; the new benefits which people will get and the extension of the old ones.  The death grant, the invalidity pension, the retirement pension and also the old age care allowance and deserted wives' allowances are new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The death grant is welcome.  What happens in a case where the deceased had a system whereby he contributed to funeral expenses?  Those contributions towards funeral expenses could <Col N="910" /> have accumulated over the years.  Is the £25 death grant still paid?  In dire poverty the local health authority bear some of the expenses of burial.  Is that amount taken out of the £25 grant?  Is the health authority recouped out of the grant for its expenditure?  The amount of £25 is typical of the Bill. One could not get a grave dug and closed for £25.  With all the other incidental expenses attached to a funeral, I do not see to what extent this goes to meet the expenses of burying a person.</P>
    <P>There are other pensions like those in respect of incapacity, invalidity and inability.  They all mean practically the same thing.  Perhaps there is a slight technical difference between the words. The introduction of the invalidity pension is welcome but it does not go far enough.  The Minister in his statement referred to people drawing invalidity pensions.  He said:</P>
    <P>Secondly, persons drawing invalidity or retirement pension will be credited with contributions which will count for the purposes of the other social insurance benefits.</P>
    <P>This is only right.  When a person draws invalidity or retirement pension he must be credited with stamps.  He must be credited with contributions for the purpose of other social benefits.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to care of relatives, something which usually falls on a daughter.  This is a serious problem.  A daughter may stay at home to care for an aged relative.  She cannot take up employment outside the home.  It is only right that she should be given some allowance or benefit.  There is more involved in this than a money benefit.  There was a report in an English paper recently about the number of girls who because they are looking after relations are unable to get married.  This cannot be measured in money values.  It happens in Ireland also.  Many people are spinsters simply because they must look after old relations. Under the new Health Bill there may be some provision for domiciliary nursing treatment which may get over the difficulties to some extent.  I hope it will, because every girl of a marriageable age should be able to meet <Col N="911" /> people and should not be confined to the care of an old person for all her marriageable life.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see the introduction of some benefits for deserted wives.  The Minister has pointed out that there are dangers inherent here. There is the great danger of collusion. For example, a husband may go to England, stay away for a long time, but send £4 or £5 a week which would not be declared.  In such a case the supposedly deserted wife would receive benefit under this Bill.  Generally, however, one has to accept this risk of collusion in order to provide the benefits of the Bill by operating it correctly.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a very welcome innovation that deserted wives should be treated just as widows are treated. It is probably correct, too, that a deserted wife who has no children and is under 50 will not be eligible because she probably would have some means of earning a living herself.  I agree in general with the Minister's idea, but perhaps it may be too rigid. The likelihood is that a person over 40 years of age with no children deserted by her husband can get employment, but is the Minister being too rigid?  I do not know whether it would be worthwhile putting down an amendment to this on Committee Stage.  It is not too easy for a woman over 40 to get employment, especially a married woman deserted by her husband. She is not as agile as people in their twenties or even their thirties and would not obtain employment as easily.  This is a question I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into and see if it is desirable to reduce this 50-year limit to something less, say, 40 or 45.</P>
    <P>As I said, I agree with the Minister that we must go ahead with this even though there are inherent dangers.  A second danger is that it may inhibit a reconciliation of the husband and wife. I can see that danger, but I am afraid we will have to take a chance there just as we have to take a chance on collusion.  Those who will benefit under the Bill will far outnumber those who seek to take unfair advantage.</P>
    <P>Generally, the increases in social welfare benefits are not high enough. <Col N="912" /> In his introductory statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Budget improvements in the various social insurance benefits and pensions will come into operation at the beginning of October also.  They will provide an extra 17s 6d a week for recipients of old age contributory pension, thus making the maximum rate £5 a week for a pensioner personally and £8 10s in all for a married couple.</P>
    <P>I do not know how one breaks down £5 a week, even for a pensioner of 70 years of age, when he has to eat, house, clothe and fuel himself and probably buy some tobacco and maybe travel. Of course, he gets free travel, usually in the buses, but there may be occasions when he has to pay for travel.  I do not see that £5 a week goes far enough in this.  Yesterday, Senator Dermot Honan, when dealing with the Housing Bill, said we have to cut our cloth according to our measure.  Maybe we have.  It depends on the resources available at the time.  Still I think it is rather a poor show that a person should have to live on £5 a week at the present time.  I do not see how it can be done.  The increases are necessary, but they do not go far enough.</P>
    <P>We are not opposing this Bill but we are not entirely satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>Taxes were imposed in the Budget this year to provide for these social benefits.  These taxes came into force the day after the Budget but some of the benefits do not come into force until March, 1971, and others, such as retirement pension, until after a term of three years.  You start the contributions on 1st October, 1970, and you must have at least 156 contributions.  For the death grant there must be 26 contributions. Since the first contribution counts from 1st October, 1970, the benefit will not be effective until 1st April, 1971, because you cannot get 26 contributions until then.  In some cases it may not come in until after that.  If money has been voted in the Budget for these benefits, and the benefits are not going to come into operation, in one case until the end of the year and in another case for 3½ years from now, what has happened to this money?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> As I said, we will support this Bill with reservations, because to oppose it would be wrong.  Something is being given and to the extent that it is given we accept it.  However, we do not believe it goes far enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that time is pressing on and that the urgent thing is that these increases and new measures, which I welcome, should be paid as soon as possible.  However, I should like to raise a couple of points which might possibly be constructive for the future or possibly would be points that could be borne in mind in the administration of some of the new provisions.</P>
      <P>First, I am very conscious at any time when I ask for increases or any kind of improvements in the field of social development that this development has to be paid for from one source or another.  I am very dissatisfied on many occasions that the savings of the community play such a small part in the promotion of social developments.  One of the matters that I would like to refer to is the actual method of assessing means for some of the social benefits, which in my view inhibits to a larger extent than is desirable the accumulation of savings which in the long run could make perhaps a major contribution to social development.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the National Savings Committee and this committee is concerned particularly with matters of this kind.  In our dealings with the general public one of the strongest arguments used against saving is that there is in existence a provision in the social welfare assistance scheme dealing with non-contributory old age pensions which takes into account for the purpose of means the yearly value of savings.  The provision is as follows and I quote from page 26 of the <i>Guide to the Social Services,</i> 1969:</P>
      <P>The principal items constituting means are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  yearly value of investments, capital or property not personally used, calculated by excluding the first £25 of capital value, taking <Col N="914" /> one-twentieth of the next £375, and one-tenth of any balance...</P>
    <P>It is very important that this provision should be reviewed and that the method of assessing the yearly value of savings should be revised so as to ensure that only those persons possessing considerable capital would be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I take it as an encouragement that, in his opening speech, the Minister did say that in a case connected with the agricultural community he would make a minor modification in the means test for non-contributory old age and widows' pensions.  I am arguing for another modification of this kind because it seems obvious to me that the improved standard of living that we as a nation enjoy today is partly the result of savings of the past, and yet we punish a section of the community today because they saved in the past.  As I have indicated, a person more than 70 years of age and who holds savings in excess of £25 may suffer a certain reduction in his pension.  This is wrong.</P>
    <P>If a person has money in a bank or post office the average rate of interest on that money will be 4 per cent but, as matters stand, when a pensioner's income is being assessed, any sum of money between £25 and £400 is calculated to give a yield of 5 per cent while any amount over £400 is calculated to yield 10 per cent.  If a person has £700 in the bank his actual income will be £28 per year on that amount, but for pension purposes his income is assessed at £48 15s per year.  This seems unjust. It was a point that was made eloquently in this House from time to time by the late Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  In connection with this Bill its is a point worth making again.</P>
    <P>If I could put forward a concrete suggestion: I think I have come across different ways for calculating means from savings in the context of the payment of social welfare benefits.  I should like to refer to a recent publication by HMSO in Britain, the new supplementary benefits handbook published by the supplementary benefits commission and the Department of Health and Social Security in Britain.  I notice that in this handbook they indicate a <Col N="915" /> method of assessing income from capital and there is a very interesting table at page 11 which, if my calculations are correct, would seem to indicate that someone who has a capital of £325 but less than £350 would be adjudged to have means in the region of £2 12s per year, whereas here the same capital, for pension purposes, would be adjudged as yielding an income of £15. This emphasises the type of injustice I am talking about.  We are penalising people too heavily.  If the example I am quoting were studied I am sure it would be found that the means used by the supplementary benefits commission in Britain is a more fair method of assessment than the one applying here.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the new allowance that will be payable to deserted wives.  This provision is to be welcomed because, unfortunately the problem of deserted wives is becoming greater.  For example, I understand that last year as many as 900 Irish wives were deserted.  This is a staggering figure.  The Minister's clear recognition of the difficulties involved is only right because it will be very difficult to establish who exactly is a deserted wife and what is her income at any one time.</P>
    <P>In his opening address the Minister made clear once again that any wife who finds herself in this position should have availed herself in so far as possible of any legal or other processes open to her either to effect reconciliation or to oblige the husband to meet his responsibility to support her and the family.  My understanding is that at the moment the most a man may be ordered to pay by the courts in terms of maintenance is £4 10s per week regardless of his income or the number of children.  This figure is only 5s more than the maximum allowance payable to deserted wives under this Bill.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the provision I do not consider it to be adequate and I hope that the Minister for Social Welfare will do all in his power to get the Minister for Justice to agree to bring in up-to-date legislation governing the <Col N="916" /> marital situation and, in particular, the legislation governing maintenance of wives by husbands who leave home.</P>
    <P>In this regard I stress the advantage of tackling this type of problem in a legal way and again I refer to some of the precedents from the United Kingdom. In the handbook to which I have referred it is interesting to note how they deal with the problem of deserted wives and they stress the advantage of dealing with such matters through the courts.  In Britain any order made in favour of a deserted wife by the court will not lapse if the wife no longer needs supplementary benefit&mdash;for example, if she went out to work.  There seems to me to be an advantage in dealing with problems of this kind in a legal way instead of in a social welfare way.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we have enough social welfare officers to deal with this new situation.  Obviously they are going to have to deal with very difficult personal problems; in some cases social welfare officers may have to try and find the husband.  Social welfare officers may find themselves acting as marriage guidance councillors.  This will require a new approach in the training and qualification of social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the scheme whereby a person aged 70 years or more may get a weekly allowance for the provision of full-time care and attention by a female relative.  This is a welcome extension to an existing allowance already payable to old age pensioners and certain widowed pensioners. I wonder if it is necessary to confine the scheme to people who are relatives.  Daughters, cousins and nieces who spend the major part of their time helping incapacitated relatives often become social casualties themselves when the relative eventually dies.  They may not have any particular training for a job outside the home.  Though they were quite capable of caring for the aged they may not be able to find other employment.  Their mental and physical health may be impaired. Surely the important thing here is to provide care and attention in the home, regardless of who does the work?  In some cases this can be provided by an outsider happy to do the work for the <Col N="917" /> small sum involved.  I understand in some cases in the past without the strict benefit of legislation home assistance officers have been able to make arrangements of this kind on an informal basis so that help could be provided for incapacitated people.</P>
    <P>The increase in children's allowances is welcome.  I am conscious there may be a poverty problem here which we are not tackling as well as we might.  We may not even be fully aware of the type of poverty which exists in some families.  A major re-shaping of the present system of children's allowances may be necessary because, even though we are in a time of inflation and wage increases, major increases in allowances cannot lift the unskilled worker with five or six children out of the poverty line.  If the Minister and his Department are not already familiar with it, I would recommend them to read the studies of the Child Poverty Action Group in Britain.  In the recent survey carried out by the Northern Ireland group on poverty in Downpatrick I was interested to find the group fully supported the campaign in Britain to raise children's allowances to 35s a week per child including the first child.  At page 16 of this survey they state:</P>
    <P>By including the first child we recognise that expenditure on the first born is the heaviest for most families.  It can even provoke a crisis.  This again is especially relevant in a province in which an exceptionally large number of small families may be in poverty as a result of low wages.</P>
    <P>The same may apply on this side of the border and we may find we need a complete re-thinking of our children's allowance schemes.  I have corresponded with the Parliamentary Secretary about this matter and he knows my interest in all the research and investigatory work going on in the Department of Social Welfare in an endeavour to improve benefits and schemes of all kinds.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to speed up this research and investigation work so that the next time we have a review of the Third Programme we shall read of <Col N="918" /> considerably more plans and proposals in this regard.  Even if we are at a stage where our plans are years in advance of our capacity to implement them, they are an encouragement and incentive to people to work towards the day when the economy will be able to bring them to fruition.</P>
    <P>I have tried constantly to convey to the House my consciousness of the difficult problem of sorting out social priorities in an effort to get money to people who need it most.  Under this Bill a death grant of £5 in the case of the death of a child under five years of age, £15 in the case of a child from five to 18 years of age, and £25 in every other case is being given.  I can see the point in giving this grant in the case of adults who, apart from funeral expenses, may suffer interrupted wage earning.  It is important that a sum of money should be available to tide the family over during the traumatic time of death in the family.  But in introducing death grants are we really using money in an effective way for those who need it most, or could the resources be used more effectively elsewhere?  I may have missed the arguments in favour of the death grant.  We have not had a full circulation of the complete debate in the Dáil but I understand the death grant may well become a permanent part of our social welfare system.  I would be most interested to hear more about it so that in recommending the Bill, as I shall gladly do, and in trying to see that people gain the most from the benefits it offers, I shall have a full appreciation of what it is intended to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  While it does not provide all the benefits we would wish, we must have regard to the capacity of the community to bear the cost.  In that regard a valid point was made by the Minister in the Dáil when he said that increasing social welfare benefit should come from the increasing wealth of the country as a whole and the expanding economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains some innovations that are welcome and which have <Col N="919" /> already been referred to by previous speakers.  I should like to refer specifically to the death grants which are an innovation so far as State-assisted social welfare schemes are concerned, although they have been in existence for a number of years in schemes operated by private and public firms. The rate of benefits appears very small and I have no doubt that at the earliest opportunity the Minister will increase the sums, which vary between a maximum of £25 to £5 for the death of a younger qualified child.  I do not think any Member of this House would be happy that these limits would continue permanently in this part of our social legislation.  However, it is a step in the right direction and as it is now on the Statute Book I have no doubt that the present and future Ministers for Social Welfare will take the earliest opportunity of bringing the payments into line with modern requirements.</P>
    <P>The invalidity pensions are a welcome innovation and those of us who have had experience as members of local authorities will agree they are long overdue.  One provision referred to in the Minister's statement, about which I am not happy, is the provision stating that the benefits will be paid by cheque issued from the head office of the Department.  This raises a wider issue to which I shall refer at this juncture, namely, the growing centralisation of the operations of the Department of Social Welfare.  I can remember some years ago, as I am sure other members of local authorities do, when various social welfare payments were made at local levels.  I consider the discontinuance of that practice and the continuation of the present arrangement of paying social welfare benefit by cheques from Dublin to be a retrograde step.  I have known of cases where the recipients would have been virtually destitute were it not for the help given by the home assistance officers. I am sure Senators will agree with me that the administration of our social welfare code should, as far as possible, be localised, or at least regionalised.  While welcoming the provisions in the Social Welfare Bill I would suggest to the Minister that its administration would be greatly improved <Col N="920" /> and expedited if more of the operations of the various schemes were delegated to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago we discussed in this House the new arrangements for regionalisation of health administration and I think a similar type of organisation in regard to social welfare would be worthwhile.  Presumably it does not arise under this Bill but the question of administering the benefits is valid to discussion of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The retirement pension scheme is a worthwhile innovation and I should like to congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  Already, a growing number of private and public bodies operate retirement pension schemes.  It is obvious that to bring this retirement pension scheme into line with modern conditions the qualifying age for the old age pension should be reduced to 65 years.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would indicate when he is replying what will be the position of firms where pension schemes with death benefits are already in operation.  Is it intended that the new State scheme will supplant these schemes, or will it continue side by side with existing pension schemes where they are operated by private and public firms?</P>
    <P>The scheme in regard to care of the aged is a worthwhile innovation.  I hope I will not be regarded as facetious if I suggest that this scheme might be extended to include certain types of male help.  At the moment the definition of the person to assist the aged is confined entirely to females, and, on the face of it, this appears to be right. However, I can visualise a situation where the only relative of an old person might be a male who, perhaps due to disability of some kind, was not able to work full-time and such a person might welcome extension of this scheme.  I would ask the Minister to consider, if not in the present Bill at least at a later stage, extending the provisions of this Bill to include certain males who might be of assistance in caring for the aged.</P>
    <P>In connection with deserted wives, it is a sad commentary on our society that we must give a welcome to the provision made in this case but it is all too necessary.  We all know of cases <Col N="921" /> where unfortunate women and families have been deserted, but could a case arise where the husband would be the deserted partner?  While it might cause a certain amount of laughter, I can visualise a case where the woman would be the breadwinner&mdash;perhaps the husband was physically or mentally handicapped&mdash;and in the event of the wife leaving the husband I could well see a case here for payment of benefit to the husband.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery referred to childrens' allowances and I should like to support him in his comments.  The Bill gives welcome, if modest, improvements under every facet of our social welfare code.  I do not think any Senator would feel that an increase of 2s 6d is adequate in respect of children's allowances.  This country of ours is one of large families.  We have a special obligation to assist the parents where there are a large number of children&mdash;any number from five upwards.  I would strongly criticise the meagre increase of 2s 6d a week.  The allowance for the first and second child is 15s and it is only 10s each for the additional children.  Any Senator who has been involved in social work will agree that the larger the family the greater the expense.  As a personal view, I would reverse the order and, as the family became larger, I would increase the social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the net cost to the Exchequer.  It is a very substantial amount.  Social assistance is to cost an additional £6.4 million in a full year and the net increased cost of social insurance will be £2.1 million, or a total of £8.5 million to be borne by the State.  This represents a substantial increase in the bill for social welfare but one which we, as a society, must accept as a very necessary and humane obligation.  I should like the Minister to state, when replying to the debate, what is the present position of the social insurance fund.  What moneys are in the fund?  If the fund stands at a substantial figure, I think that a very strong case could be made for paying certain benefits at an earlier date, particularly one of the new benefits such as the retirement or the death benefit. <Col N="922" /> Death can happen at any time, but this new benefit will not become payable until March, 1971.  Every effort should be made to bring this particular benefit into line with the payments which begin on 1st August next.  I think that any extra cost which would be involved would be very readily accepted by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Claiming as we do to be a Christian and humane nation, we must accept that the cost of adequate social welfare schemes should be borne by the stronger section of the community and by those in better circumstances.  This burden will tend to increase because the proportion of old people and young people in this country is very high.  I think I am correct in saying that the proportion of such people in our community is among the highest in Europe.  This means that fewer people during the working years of their lives will have to provide for social welfare services for more old people.  In the final analysis, our reputation as a Christian nation will be judged by our concern for the aged, the sick, the young and the disabled in our community.  It is vital that the benefits under all these headings should be the highest we can afford and these benefits should increase <i>pro rata</i> as our economy expands and the standard of living of our people rises.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the place of voluntary bodies in the general welfare code.  However beneficent the State or the local authority is, nothing can supplant the care and the human touch which the voluntary worker brings to bear on his task.  We would all like to see the State and the local authority give every possible encouragement to these young men and women.  We all agree that today the young people are taking a great interest in the less fortunate in our society.  Every encouragement should be given to them in this work.  I hope there will never be a clash between the central authority in any bureaucratic sense and the voluntary work which is unpaid, unhonoured and always unsung. There is a growing awareness among the younger people that participation in social work is not only a community obligation but brings with it a real sense of personal satisfaction <Col N="923" /> in promoting happiness among others. Long may that spirit continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome what has been done in this Bill.  We would all like to see more being done under the various headings.  We have the sobering fact of the costs involved. As pointed out by Senator Russell, the total increased cost involved this year is almost £8 million over previous years. This would be regarded as a reasonable increase were it not for the strong inflationary forces at work.  These will offset most of the increases under the regular headings.  The increases will be eaten up by the increased prices.  I appeal now, as I did before, to have the provision of increased finances for social welfare schemes tied in with specific taxes on luxury items such as drink and entertainment.  In that way the taxes on those items would be more acceptable.  It is only fair retribution that a fraction of the money spent on luxuries should be seen to go directly to relieve cases of hardship and to improve social welfare benefits. Another penny on the pint or an increase in income tax would be accepted much more readily by the community if it was labelled as making a big breakthrough in the social welfare field.</P>
      <P>Many of us are not satisfied with the slow improvement which has come. The time has come when there should be a big step forward.  That big step forward should be accomplished by means of designated taxes, tax increases for these specific purposes, if necessary tax increases introduced in a supplementary budget which would emphasise and underline much more forcibly that this was a redistribution of money from the better-off sections to the welfare requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many desirable features and innovations in the present Bill. The first I would like to turn to is the question of old age care allowances. This is extending to what we might call the genteel poor the benefits already available to those who qualify by a lower means test.  The ceiling has been fixed here at just under £300 per annum for those who are incapacitated and over 70.  The first point I would make is that the sharp division is <Col N="924" /> wrong.  None of us particularly likes means tests; however, the facts of life are there and we have to recognise them.  But surely it is very unjust that an incapacitated person over 70 who has an income of £299 a year is entitled to about £150 more from the State, bringing his total income to £450, whereas a person who has £301 a year, being over the limit, gets nothing.  It would be much fairer that this should be on a phased relationship so that if a person had an income of £400 a year he would be entitled to the difference so as to bring his gross earnings up to the same level, and that a person with £400 a year would be entitled to £50 from the scheme.  I think that that would be recognised as being fair all round and I do not know why it has not been introduced in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>This, again, is only for incapacitated people over 70.  We are being forced by scarcity of money to make too many distinctions here because people over 70 years of age, I think, are entitled to help of this type if it enables them to avoid loneliness.  I think that as a national objective in the care of the aged we should seek to combat loneliness by every means possible, and the most effective way is to ensure that the old people are living with some others who have some responsibility for caring for them.  In that regard we might take it that these old people are in most cases entitled to enter one of the institutions available if there are places there.  We should be able to calculate quite easily what is the cost to the public, borne by the county rates, per head for each person kept in one of those institutions and we will find that it is quite a substantial figure.  I hazard a guess that it is considerably more than the £2 15s that is provided here, yet this £2 15s is an effort, and a commendable effort, to keep such a person out of the institutions and in a home environment.  Therefore, I think we should have a figure&mdash;maybe the Minister can give it in his reply&mdash;of what is the accepted average cost over and above the contribution got from the pensions of the people concerned for those in the various institutions caring for the aged.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong to have any mention here of relatives.  While relatives <Col N="925" /> would be the normal people whom the old person might turn to for this type of care, in fact any neighbour or anyone providing the care should be recognised and accepted.  I would put it that a qualified social worker in the area would have to certify that the person concerned was a <i>bona fide</i> and acceptable person to undertake that responsibility; but, once we got that certification, then by and large it does not matter what the relationship is between the person providing the care and the old person.  Let us accept it and approve it and treat it on a level plane. This, I hope, will come in shortly because the present provision is already there except for old age pensioners who are incapacitated and it is now being applied to those with incomes above the old age limit of £300.</P>
    <P>Next year I would hope to see the scheme extended and changed.  The changes I would call for include the removal of the term &ldquo;relative&rdquo; altogether, so that this will be applied to all entitled to this type of assistance.  I also question whether we should take too seriously the requirement of being incapacitated.  After all, old age itself is incapacity enough, and certainly if it goes over 75 the very fact of that age should be sufficient to qualify for being classed as incapacitated in the sense of the need for protection from loneliness, the need for somebody having some concern and care for the person concerned, which is necessary whether the person is physically incapacitated or not.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Keery said.  He made the point, very rightly, that there have been these very good charitable people who are neighbours or who cared for long years for relatives. At the end of that period, when the relative dies, they are left with nothing much to do.  Their whole training and experience makes them ideally suited for caring for such incapacitated people.  Consequently, I would call very strongly for the broadening of these provisions in order to include all such people and to avoid the greatest enemy of old age, which is loneliness. The bigger institution is not the solution to that.  The solution to that is the Christian housekeeper who takes in <Col N="926" /> three, four or five such people in a small group where they can have all the benefits of living in small groups and yet have an acceptable level of comradeship and care provided.</P>
    <P>The next thing I would turn to is the deserted wives' allowance.  This is a long overdue provision and one to be welcomed, but again, I think that the provision needs to be substantially improved in the next Budget or in some subsequent Budget.  First of all, the requirement that the woman should be over 40 seems to me too stringent.  The very fact of fully authenticated and certified desertion should be sufficient.  I should like to ask a question about the children concerned.  Are the contributions specified here over and above those to which the children would be entitled in any case under the general children's allowances?  That is probably the case, and of course, it should be the case.</P>
    <P>Such children are orphans in a very real sense, but yet the rates payable in respect of them do not bear any relation to the rates for orphans.  Therefore, a strong case could be made for improving the rates greatly.  There is also the fact that such improvement would not cost very much because, thank God, we would not have too many recipients.  It is one case where we could afford to be generous.</P>
    <P>I am always puzzled by the type of penny-catching that goes on in connection with allowances paid at various rates.  An allowance of, say, 15s a week for a second child, another rate for a third child and so on.  It does us no credit to save 5s a week in a scheme of this sort, but I would suggest that we should simplify the administration of the scheme and treat all children equally.  This, also, would be more just.</P>
    <P>I would ask also in relation to deserted wives if the wife would be eligible for unemployment assistance? It is said here that a wife less than 40 years of age should be capable of supporting herself and her family by obtaining employment.  Does that mean that a person would be entitled to unemployment relief if she could not obtain suitable employment?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> We welcome also the provision for retirement pensions between the ages of 65 and 70.  I hope that the payment of a retirement pension will not in any way inhibit the person concerned from doing some part-time or seasonal work. Of course, I know it would not be payable where a person was in regular full-time employment involving insurance contributions but I would hope that part-time work will not be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The general increases that have been a standard feature of all Budgets are a little more generous this year, but when we take inflation into account the advances are not, perhaps, as good as they were in previous years.  Therefore, next year, when, I hope, the economy will have stabilised itself and the present strike mania will have disappeared, I trust there will be a real step forward in relation to social welfare benefits and that there will be recognition, even if belated, of the high inflation that has occurred during the past two years and which, unfortunately, has eroded most of the social welfare benefits that we have been able to provide.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill so far as it goes but I hope for much better in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Eoin Ryan Mr. Eoin Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eoin Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is the latest in a series of Bills to enlarge the scope of the social welfare code and increase the benefits payable to social welfare recipients.  I am sure that all of us would like to see the scope extended still further and the payments to be given greater.  However, having regard to the resources available, it would be difficult to deny that this is a reasonable effort to meet the problems of those in need of social welfare.</P>
      <P>It is comparatively easy for the Minister to increase the rates payable to recipients if he can persuade the Minister for Finance to give him the necessary money, but what is particularly commendable about this Bill is that a great deal of hard work and thought has gone into extending the scope of the social welfare code to investigate social problems and to deal with these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> There are a couple of points I should like to raise in connection with the Bill.  The first is rather complicated.</P>
    <P>There are three conditions applicable to the retirement pension.  They are, and I quote from the explanatory memorandum:</P>
    <P>(a)  that the claimant entered insurance before reaching the age of 55,</P>
    <P>(b)  that not less than 156 employment contributions have been paid in respect of him since his entry into insurance, and</P>
    <P>(c)  that he has an average of 48 contributions paid or credited per contribution year from entry into insurance until he reached the age of 65.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the third of these conditions is a rather erroneous one and, in certain circumstances, could result in an injustice to a person who had contributed for many years but who, as a result of some misfortune, found that his yearly contributions did not average 48.  This is a very high average and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with this point when replying.  Perhaps there are circumstances in this regard to which I have not adverted.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to make is one which I have made on a number of occasions in the past in relation to other Bills, and that is the difficulty in following the social welfare code.  In his opening address, the Minister said and I quote:</P>
    <P>... the Bill consists mainly of amendments of the existing legislation and may, therefore, appear obscure in places, but the very full explanatory memorandum which I have had circulated will, I trust, be of assistance to Senators in clarifying its provisions.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister was understating the case when he said that the Bill was rather obscure because it is really very difficult to understand.  The Bill is entitled</P>
    <P>An Act to amend and extend the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1969, the Unemployment Assistance <Col N="929" /> Acts, 1933 to 1969, the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1969, the Social Welfare (Children's Allowances) Acts, 1944 to 1969, and the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1969.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, a great number of Acts are involved.  If one is in doubt about a particular section or subsection the difficulty of ascertaining the matter is enormous.  To any one in the legal profession asked to advise on a particular point it is a formidable task. The explanatory memorandum sets out the position in a very clear way and is very useful.  The Department of Social Welfare also issue a guide to the social services every year which gives a broad summary of the benefits available.  I advocate that the time has long since passed when a Bill should be introduced to consolidate the various social welfare benefits into one Bill.  I agree that in a very short time that Bill would be out of date but it would be of great assistance at the present time. I recommend the Minister to introduce a Bill of this kind as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  Our present social welfare system tends to keep people idle instead of keeping the maximum numbers possible engaged in full employment.  I have often thought, looking at the wage rates for agricultural workers and the difficulty of getting people to work in agriculture, that if the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Social Welfare co-operated and, instead of paying £8 10s per week to the worker, his wife and an average of four children, paid half that amount to full-time agricultural workers, they would bring the meagre £13 per week of these workers into line with other wage rates.  This would mean a far greater work force in agriculture, and the vast amount of money spent on social welfare benefits would be much better employed.  I realise it would be difficult to implement such a <Col N="930" /> scheme but the Government should be thinking along these lines because in rural areas there is a limited amount of work.  Even if a man could not be employed for 52 weeks of the year, there should be greater flexibility to enable these people to do work when they are able to secure work.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Keery's point about the assessment of the income of people applying for old age non-contributory pensions.  This is something which has been allowed to go on for far too long.  From my experience as a member of an old age pensions subcommittee it appears to me that pension officers in general get some type of bonus for every applicant they turn down.  When dealing with the poorer sections of the community the benefit of the doubt should go to the applicant every time.  I would ask the Department to do something about this problem because the money involved is not great and the people concerned have devoted their entire lives to the country. The vast majority of them have worked hard and honestly all their days.  The only security these people have for the proverbial rainy day is their pension.  If the Government had introduced old age pensions at 65 years of age all around it would have been much simpler to implement than the system they have introduced with retirement pensions to bridge the five years between 65 and 70 for those who may require it.  When neighbouring countries are able to give pensions at 65 years of age, surely we should be able to give the same benefits here?</P>
      <P>I suppose it would not be proper to anticipate that people would take advantage of death grants, but, when one considers that people have been sentenced to the pledge for five years for bringing about somebody's death, that £25 might be an added inducement. I trust that, if there is any doubt at all the £25 grant will not be paid. The £5 for children is hardly worth paying because it would go nowhere near to meeting funeral expenses.  It would make only a down payment on a grave.  The £5 should be increased to a more realistic figure&mdash;perhaps £25 all around should be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> While I welcome the provision for payment in respect of care of the aged, if the Government are honest they must admit they will make money on this transaction and they could provide a more generous amount than the £2 15s weekly.  We all agree that it is desirable that as many elderly people as possible should be enabled to remain in their own homes and it is unfair of the State to ask that a daughter would return home to care for the aged person for the princely sum of £2 15s.  We cannot forget that an individual's first duty is to himself and his own immediate family.  If the aged person has not got anyone to care for him the State will have to take over and the resultant cost of maintenance in a geriatric home will be in the region of 20 guineas per week.</P>
    <P>The provision of £2 15s is a meagre sum and entirely unrealistic.  We have had this problem for many years and I welcome the fact that the Minister has introduced the scheme.  However, one would hope that it would be brought more into line with present-day needs. We should not forget that the Government stand to make a considerable amount of money when the aged people are cared for in their own homes.</P>
    <P>There are some other points in the sections we can deal with on Committee Stage and, therefore, I shall conclude my remarks for the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary here and express appreciation of the assistance he invariably gives in discussions of this nature, I should like him to convey to the Minister our deep sympathy on the circumstances that have occasioned his absence from this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I must say that I find myself in complete agreement with Senator Belton's statement that people experience a sense of irritation and frustration when they find that their means are being investigated by various inspectors from many of the Departments.  I would add that <Col N="932" /> these investigations result in quite considerable wastage of public funds and quite possibly contribute in some measure to the fact that such a large amount of taxation goes into administration.</P>
      <P>A worker must make a return to the inspector of taxes of his means for the purpose of getting his tax-free allowance for PAYE.  His affairs are fully investigated by the inspector of taxes. If he wants to qualify for a medical card, again his affairs are investigated by the home assistance officer. If he wants to arrange with the local authority regarding his rent, once more his affairs are investigated by a different officer and the same thing happens if he wants to qualify for an old age pension.</P>
      <P>All this reminds me of the loose type of approach one sometimes finds in local authorities themselves: one week they will dig up a road to lay service pipes; six months later the road is again dug to lay telephone cables and later on water pipes are laid.  With proper co-ordination it might well be possible to have the various works carried out at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person's means are investigated in the first instance by a central department&mdash;in the ordinary course of events it might well be by the tax office&mdash;the data secured at the first application should be used for all other purposes.  It would prevent the wastage of a considerable amount of public money which might be diverted into more worthwhile spheres.</P>
      <P>I consider some of the criticism expressed by Senator Belton not fully justified.  Perhaps I may be misinterpreting him, but I thought he suggested that if a person was benefiting from an industrial insurance scheme&mdash;where an individual would pay a certain amount either weekly or monthly and on his death a lump sum is payable-such a person would not qualify for this contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from the Bill that a person would be entitled to <Col N="933" /> both benefits because what insurances an individual might take out privately is a matter for himself.  Senator Belton suggested that the benefits for invalidity would not come into effect for approximately three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation of the Bill is that the contributions made under previous Social Welfare Acts are available for this.  I say that subject to correction by the Parliamentary Secretary. It appears to me that the only benefits that would be deferred are the death benefits, which are the smallest; they will not come into effect until March, 1971.</P>
      <P>I have pleaded on more than one occasion in this House for the self-employed people.  There is nothing provided for them, everything is according to their means.  Such people, who are proud enough to remain self-employed, are hurt when a most detailed examination of their ways and means is carried out.  Many of them, in an effort to help themselves, in an effort to get for themselves the minimum amount necessary to bury them, take out small industrial insurance policies on which they pay a few shillings a week.  I would like very much if those people, instead of contributing to those industrial schemes, would make similar contributions to the social welfare scheme.  If their benefits were not as large as others would get, let them have benefits in proportion to what they pay.  If a contributory pensioner gets 65s per week, at least let these other people get half that amount. If such people have a few hundred pounds saved they should not forfeit old age pensions because of it.  Let us give them half the old age pension if they have made half the contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a section of the population which is very neglected.  Practically all contributory beneficiaries are organised in trade unions.  They are organised in militant groups and can fight their own corner.  Other people are completely unorganised.  We seem to be reaching a state where nobody can get anything <Col N="934" /> except through militancy.  One of the reasons why these unfortunate people cannot get better consideration for themselves under the Social Welfare Acts is because they are unorganised and, therefore, are the least militant section of our community.  I should like to see the day when people can hope to benefit, not by militancy, but by loyalty and effort, and by being interested in the State as such.  I would feel that whatever time I have spent in this House would have been well spent if, in all these years, I achieved nothing more than to get some recognition for these self-employed people, like local tradesmen, local shopkeepers, local small farmers, who are often the backbone of our community.  I should like to see more favourable recognition for them under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators who have spoken, I should like to welcome the Bill as part of the social welfare code.  This Bill introduces some innovations.  I am glad to see that Senators on both sides of the House say there is not enough in the Bill and that the provisions are inadequate.  This is the only way we can approach the Bill, by welcoming it in a limited manner. We must try to contribute ideas.  I should like to mention what Senator Eoin Ryan has said about the social welfare code being complicated.  It is difficult to follow.  It is difficult to relate the provision to whatever Act has been mentioned.  The Senator spoke as a lawyer.  I speak also for the people who benefit under the social welfare code. People who might benefit under this Bill may not be aware of their rights. I know of cases of people, particularly in the country, being unaware of the benefits to which they are entitled.  A consolidated statute, and more explanatory documents from the Department of Social Welfare to inform people of the benefits under the social welfare code are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not very happy with some of the wording of the Bill.  Many of the important definitions will be made by Ministerial regulation rather than as part of the Bill itself.  I refer particularly to the deserted wives allowance. I welcome this provision, which is long overdue, and endorse what <Col N="935" /> other Senators have said about it.  Section 22 says that the Minister may make regulations in respect of these allowances and may specify the circumstances under which a woman is to be regarded as being deserted by her husband.  Is this the right approach to this type of benefit?  Is it to be left to the Minister to specify when a wife is deserted?  The right of the deserted wife is being decided on by regulation of the Minister.  Section 6 refers to the invalidity pension.  The actual scope of this is defined by regulation of the Minister.  Section 6 (2) and (3) reads:</P>
    <P>(2)  The conditions under which a person shall be regarded for the purposes of this section as being permanently incapable of work shall be specified by regulations.</P>
    <P>(3)  Regulations may provide for disqualifying a person for receiving invalidity pension if he fails without good cause to observe any prescribed rules of behaviour.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage I hope for certain clarification of what that means and for a possible amendment of it. It is the Minister by regulation who will define the scope of the rights of people who are going to benefit under the social welfare scheme.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the way the social welfare code is developing. There is too much added on over previous Acts.  There should be consolidation, not only for the lawyers but also for those who will avail of their rights. I am not happy about the way the power to implement the Bill will rest on the Minister.</P>
    <P>The death grant is an innovation. Like other Senators who spoke, I welcome this new benefit, but I think the amount involved is laughable.  It compares with the £5 given to a person who reaches 100 years of age although this has now been increased to £50. Only when the death grant is increased will it be something we can talk of as being a real benefit.  I should like to see the death grant increased in the same way as the payment to centenarians has been increased.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the section relating to old age care allowances, I agree with <Col N="936" /> Senator Professor Quinlan and others who said that this should not be confined to female relatives.  This is an unnecessary and rather arbitrary restriction on what was a very good idea: the idea of providing assistance to take care of aged persons, to prevent, as Senator Quinlan said, loneliness in old age and if possible to prevent the institutionalisation of old persons, which is something we all are not in favour of. We ought to try to encourage the care of the old in their own homes, which is part of the tradition of this country, one of our fine traditions. But this part of the Bill may not be fully implemented if the arbitrary restrictions in it confining it to a relative is continued.  I do not see any logic in this.  It does not matter who the person who provides the assistance is, whether it is a relative either male or female or whether it is, as somebody mentioned, a friend or neighbour, the essence of it is that assistance be provided for the person.</P>
    <P>These are my main points.  Any other points that I wanted to make have already been made by other Senators who have spoken.  I should like to conclude on the point I mentioned already: the important need for liaison with the people who are to benefit under the social welfare schemes.  I am not satisfied from what I have heard, particularly in the rural areas, that those who are to benefit are fully aware of their rights.  At some stage an effective communications system should be set up with those people so that they will be made fully aware of and be fully able to avail of the social benefits under the social welfare code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most significant aspects of the Bill is the allocation of almost an extra £6½ million. That is a substantial amount of money to contribute towards social welfare. We may all say that enough is not yet being done but £6½ million is a significant amount by any standards.  Of course, this money must be provided by way of taxation and while we may complain from time to time about taxation <Col N="937" /> I do not think any of us would grouse because this taxation is going towards increased benefits for the less well-off sections of our community.</P>
      <P>This increase in social welfare benefit is an indication of the sincerity of Government's desire to help the needy sections.  However, such increase would not be possible if it were not that the economy is expanding.  One cannot get money out of a stone.  It is only as a result of hard work and good planning on the part of the Government and the people of the country that this extra money can be provided.  This increase is an indication, also, of the serious intention of the Government to carry out the programmes that they have outlined.</P>
      <P>The death grant, retirement pensions and the scheme for deserted wives are all very welcome.  I heard some criticism of the fact that the death grant in the case of a child up to five years of age is only £5.  I realise the amount of sorrow a family would suffer at the loss of a child but funeral expenses for a child are very much less than in the case of an adult.  It must also be remembered that a grant is only assistance; no scheme provides for 100 per cent of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The retirement pension is very welcome.  It will not cost the Exchequer very much extra and it will save persons of 65 years of age having to sign on at the labour exchange or to get a medical certificate every week.  These people are being given the status of retired persons and are being supplied with pension books which will allow them to collect their money in the same way as every other pensioner, at the post office.  I suggest a scheme should be introduced whereby old age pensioners would be allowed to do temporary or part-time jobs.  A pensioner might be able to do a day's gardening, or something like that. Doctors would agree that this would be very good occupational therapy.  I realise it might be difficult to implement such a scheme but the suggestion is worthy of consideration.  In the past an unemployed person by not signing on certain days was able to do an occasional day's work and still remain on unemployment assistance.  Perhaps <Col N="938" /> the Minister might consider this because, while I accept that it could perhaps lead to abuse, it might be beneficial in the case where the pensioner might not be able to work on a full-time basis.</P>
    <P>The invalidity pension scheme is welcome.  However, I consider the provision that 48 contributions must be paid or credited in the last contributing year as being too restrictive. Take the case of a person suffering from multiple sclerosis where there is no hope of his becoming fit again. During the course of his illness, before he becomes completely invalided, there will be many weeks in which he will have broken employment.  In that case, the 48 contributions might be too high and I can visualise a case where a person would be disqualified on this point.</P>
    <P>Now that the retirement pension scheme has been introduced perhaps the Minister for Finance in his next Budget might consider the possibility of granting free transport and free electricity to people in this category, as is provided for old age pensioners. The provision of free transport would not cost a tremendous amount and it would give those people some little comfort.  There are many buses that are not always full&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, in my area there are buses that are not full. I am sure the Department would be able to work out some plan in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the provision of payment for care of the aged, a married daughter or daughter-in-law whose husband is supporting her will not get the grant.  I know of one case where a lady celebrated her 100th birthday some weeks ago and whose niece has been taking care of her for the past ten years.  The old lady lived away from the main road and would have been deserted had it not been for this niece who brought her to her own house.  Such an aged person will need full-time attention and, although the niece is supported by her husband, I <Col N="939" /> consider that in this case perhaps a grant of half the usual amount could be paid.  It must be remembered that if that old person went to a county home it would cost at least £10 per week to maintain her there.  In addition to that, in many cases the aged person is not happy and would be much more contented to remain in the family circle, surrounded by her relatives.</P>
    <P>Public representatives have frequently encountered very unhappy cases where wives have been deserted by their husbands.  I know that the Department are working on regulations to deal with these cases.  I hope they will not insist on very detailed inquiries to find whether a wife has been deserted or not.  It should be possible to get information from the home assistance officer, the local sergeant of the Garda or the parish priest as to whether a wife has been deserted.  I do not like regulations which must be complied with before a benefit can be paid.  I hope discretion will be given to officers dealing with these cases.  This is a delicate problem.  A woman may not be able to say where her husband is.  It is painful for her to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>There has been mention of the age of 50 years in the case of a deserted wife with no qualified child.  There was an age limit for widows pension which was waived.  In some cases a widow was left a house with a small piece of land.  It might not be possible for her to get employment locally.  A woman in such circumstances does not like giving up the home or going away.  She might not be qualified or trained for a job, having married young.  She could be debarred from benefit on age limit. Nobody likes leaving land.  If a house or land is left, anything might happen to it.  That age limit should be examined in cases where a person cannot get employment and cannot leave the home.  I would like this point examined.</P>
    <P>I got a letter seven months ago about a man named Michael Gorman. I would like to bring his case to the notice of the officials in order to get a decision on it.  Seven months ago the Parliamentary Secretary sent me a letter saying that Michael Gorman <Col N="940" /> was being granted the female relative allowance for his daughter-in-law. Nothing has happened since then.  Perhaps nothing has happened because this lady may be supported by her husband who is on social welfare assistance and a decision was not taken as to whether the female relative allowance applies in her case.  This lady is looking after an invalid husband suffering from multiple sclerosis for the past ten years.  There is a father who has an old age pension and a mother. The wife's father is also with them and he has an old age pension.  He is 83 years of age.  The other pensioners are 78 years.  This lady has two children under 16 years of age.  She is the only person in the house who can look after all these people.  Three of them in receipt of old age pension and one of them receives social welfare benefit. The husband has multiple sclerosis and it cannot be decided whether or not he is supporting her.  No decision has been taken on this point.  The Department may have a letter from me tomorrow, but while the officials are here I would like to say that I feel the case should be cleared up in the next few weeks. This lady is doing a great act of charity.  She cannot leave the house, even to go to the shop.  She is living near the village with all those old people.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on providing an increase in the State contribution to the less well-off sections of our community.  Every aspect of social welfare has been covered.  The Government took office 13 years ago, and every year the Minister for Finance has provided an increase for the old age pensioners.  I hope that this will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it has been mentioned before that it is extremely difficult for people in some parts of this House to hear the Minister who does us the courtesy of appearing here or to hear the Senators.  It is time that some type of sound amplification was introduced into this Chamber. There is a beautiful ceiling and doors, and a very fine fireplace, but the room is very drab.  It looks more like a court-room with two docks than the Chamber in which the premier body of this <Col N="941" /> country sits to finalise legislation.  Having said that, I want to say that in common with all the other people who have spoken, I welcome this Bill, and also in common with everybody else, the only reason that I speak against it in the main is that this Bill does not go far enough.</P>
      <P>I should like also to say that I agree with Senator Ryan that the social welfare code is becoming so complicated that one would almost need to employ a lawyer to examine it, and we who are in local authorities and Members of the Oireachtas who have to advise the people who come to us often find it extremely difficult to say under which section of the social welfare code their cases come.  What must the difficulty be for the people who are not familiar with the debates here, where nearly everything is explained, in interpreting their entitlements according to the code?  I do not know where one can put the blame for this, but I would hope that a Consolidation Bill would be brought in, as Senator Ryan suggested, embracing the entire social welfare legislation.  That would simplify matters.  In fact when I read the words &ldquo;invalidity pension&rdquo; I associated them with an invalid rather than with &ldquo;invalid&rdquo;.  I asked myself &ldquo;What in the world can that invalidity pension be?&rdquo; Having had the thing explained I say that whoever chose the word might have chosen a better one, but that is only by the way.</P>
      <P>As I said, we can say that we welcome the Bill because when governments, whether socialistic or otherwise, accepted the responsibility that in the older days used to be carried out, whether accepted or not, by people of greater means, to help the people unable to help themselves and to provide the necessary money from general taxation, this was a wonderful step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who reads social history will realise that in the past&mdash;I am going back some time now&mdash;there were only the rich and the poor, or the rich and the starving, or the rich and the dying; but when society accepted the responsibility it is grand to think that members of political parties of all shades of opinion at government and local authority level decided that they should do the best they could with the moneys <Col N="942" /> available to them to help those classes of people.  The only thing we can do is to try to ensure that the various classes that do benefit get the maximum benefit in their particular classes, and that the investigation that has to take place is carried out by the right type of people&mdash;people who realise that there must be flexibility in investigation particularly for social welfare purposes and that you cannot lay down strict straight lines and say that you must stay within them.  All social welfare officers should be selected on that basis.  Of course, politically, we often hear that in the social welfare service a person must be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party before he can get a job.  I do not think that this is absolutely true, but even if it were true I would say that the essential thing would be that the individual selected was a person capable of coming to a right decision in the broadest possible way to give the maximum possible to the recipients.  I would ask the Department when selecting people for these purposes to ensure that the persons appointed have the mature experience necessary to make decisions and minds capable of flexibility in giving a service to the people.</P>
    <P>Coming to the new provisions in the Bill&mdash;the death grant, the invalidity pension and the retirement pension&mdash; while we can welcome the death grant surely nobody today will say that a grant of £25 goes any distance in meeting the expenses of burial?  Quite a number of years ago, when some gentlemen in a local hostelry were discussing the cost of living one local character said &ldquo;Well, if the cost of living is going up, the cost of dying is going up too&rdquo; and this is absolutely true.  While the grant will mean something to the people concerned, there is a qualification.  I do not see that small farmers are included in this.  I also agree with Senator Nash that self-employed people are the people who are forgotten by practically every code under which we operate.  These people, small shopkeepers and tradesmen involved in their own business, having to pay all the rates and all the taxes, are almost completely forgotten under our code, and when they try to come in under the shield of the social services <Col N="943" /> for help in any particular way there is investigation which many of these people do not wish to be subjected to and they live all their lives in poverty and die in poverty due because they cannot avail of the services.  This is a matter that we must look into because we are trying to be fair and every Member of the Oireachtas would feel that it is not right or equitable that any section of the people should be left out.  The Minister should give some consideration to this matter.</P>
    <P>The invalidity pension will be in fact a replacement for unemployment benefit and other services.  The retirement pension will be in effect a replacement also, because most of the categories covered by both of these pensions have been covered under various other social schemes; but the qualifications lead to frustration amongst the people and also amongst members of local authorities and of the Oireachtas who are trying to guide the Department so that the individual investigator can give the best decision possible.</P>
    <P>A Senator remarked that it is time we had a central investigating authority that would investigate means for all purposes&mdash;housing grants, social welfare and so on.  Perhaps this is something which the Government should look into.  Senator Dr. Belton mentioned this earlier today and it was taken up by Senators on the Fianna Fáil side of the House.  It is something that should be investigated, because it is a shocking thing to have investigations carried out for old age pension, housing grants, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, by different individuals operating different codes and, therefore, making different decisions.  If the Public Service is to be streamlined as it must be, there should be a central investigating authority set up that would be availed of by every Department.</P>
    <P>We all agree with the provision of all the services covered in the Bill, but I would ask the Minister this question: children's allowances at the moment are being paid on a particular basis and the differential is being increased where there are large families.  I would say that the differential should be <Col N="944" /> greater because, let us face it, the actual amount provided in children's allowances today, even though it might look well on paper, is very little.  It is mainly the larger families who are in the lower income bracket.  Various explanations have been put forward for this.  However, it is the business of the Oireachtas and, in particular, the business of the relevant Department to ensure that the benefits will be increased for these larger families.  If this cannot be done in the present year, I hope that the Minister will see his way to improving the position next year.</P>
    <P>The question of incapacity has been mentioned by many Senators.  It is difficult for anyone to assess physical incapacity but I wish to say to the House that there are many people who are not physically incapacitated but who are mentally incapacitated and many of these people are not able to avail of the benefits under the social welfare code because of the difficulty of assessment.  I would like to see regulations being laid down to provide for proper specialist advice in this regard because a person who is mentally incapacitated is in fact more in need than a person who is physically incapacitated. There is also the fact that these persons suffer greater stress and in most cases they are not capable of putting forward their own case for social welfare.  This is important in relation to qualification for benefit.  We should ensure that the mentally incapacitated are in a position to avail of social welfare benefits.  While incapacity is difficult to define, defination is not impossible.  Our mentally incapacitated are neglected.  Of course, voluntary organisations throughout the country are doing magnificent work in this regard and not matter what social welfare legislation is introduced these people will always be needed to look after the incapacitated.  As our society becomes more affluent there will be more people available to carry out this voluntary work.  We all realise the valuable contribution voluntary organisations are making towards the community and I advocate that, wherever it is possible at Government level to help these organisations, help should be given with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> One other matter to which I should refer before concluding is in relation to old age pensions.  Those of us who serve on pensions committees are annoyed and frustrated from time to time because of the attitude adopted by the Department in the assessment of income.  In rural areas&mdash;I do not know about the city&mdash;old people keep their money under the mattress or some other such place and if they invest it it is usually with the local bank.  The bank pay them interest at about 2½ per cent but when these people are being assessed for old age pension purposes they are considered to be receiving 5 per cent on this money.  This practice is wrong and should be changed so that people would be assessed only on what they actually receive.  I hope an amendment will be introduced to ensure that this practice is not continued in the future.</P>
    <P>The same goes for investigation of means for unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and so on.  An amendment should be introduced to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to delay the House. I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill but I would say to him that the points raised by the various speakers should be considered and also that, as soon as possible, a greater share of the gross national product should be devoted to helping those for whom we are responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Senators who have spoken I welcome this Bill and I have no wish to delay its passage through the House.  Most of us would agree with the various points raised but I should like to refer in particular to the category of persons referred to as &ldquo;prescribed female relatives&rdquo;. There are cases in which there is hardship as a result of a person being incapacitated in the home because if there is more than one relative living with a person, benefit is not paid in respect of the person looking after the incapacitated one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, I know of a case where a girl is employed in her own home. She is not in a position to look after her parents because she must continue to earn her living.  Another sister has <Col N="946" /> come home to look after the parents but because the other girl is already living in the house, the father is not entitled to draw an allowance for this girl.  There is also the case of a woman who is bedridden and who requires two people to look after her.  One of her daughters nurses her by day and the other by night but neither of these girls is getting an allowance.</P>
    <P>We all realise that if these invalided people are put into hospitals or institutions they will impose a charge of £8 or £10 per week on the State but I cannot see why the Departments of Finance, Health and Social Welfare could not agree to devote the money to those caring for such people thereby retaining them in their own homes.  If we do not wish our old people to have to go to institutions we must be realistic and consider what we can do to have them retained in their own surroundings. The Minister does not need legislation to amend the Bill in this way; he can do it by regulation.  The Minister for Finance is here now in another role but I hope he will take due note of this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the other Senators who have welcomed this Bill and to congratulate the Minister on having introduced it in so far as it provides increased benefits for people in the social welfare classes and in so far as there are innovations to help these people.  However, the Bill does not go far enough.  Perhaps it does not go as far as the Minister himself would like it to go.  The Minister must have qualms of conscience the same as the rest of us when he thinks of people who find it hard to make ends meet having to contribute to the national Exchequer in the form of turnover tax on the essentials of life.  I do not want to be hypercritical about the matter, I take it for granted the Minister is as concerned about this as everyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When workers obtain an increase in their wages and salary in most cases the payments are retrospective and in some cases they are made restrospective up to a year.  A tendency has grown up when increases in social welfare benefits are given not to pay these increases until the following August, <Col N="947" /> December or even January.  This may or may not be due to administrative problems but every effort should be made in future to ensure that payments are made as soon after the increases are announced as possible.  The increases visualised in this year's Budget will not become operative until later in the year.  What is happening is that the increase in the cost of living outstrips the increased benefits which the Minister has announced in his Budget.  As a result these increases do not have the beneficial effect they would have had if they were implemented at the time they were announced.  In future I hope attempts will be made to ensure that increased benefits are payable a short time after they have been announced.</P>
    <P>The means test has done more to create mistrust and a feeling of victimisation in our community than anything else in recent years.  I feel sure the Minister would not condone the action of a person investigating the means of an applicant for old age pension in counting hens, ducks, the odd stray turkey, a few pigs and a few cattle. I do not think it was ever intended by the people who introduced this social welfare legislation that such a rigid approach should be made.  Means tests are bitterly resented not only by the applicants themselves but by their neighbours.  These people think the State is going too far in making inquiries of this nature.  I am sure there are reasons for doing these things but the investigating officer could observe and make note of the general appearance of the applicant's home.  I hope the Minister will issue instructions to the people who carry out these means tests that their actions are not in the spirit in which the Minister introduced and the Oireachtas passed the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the raising of the upper age limit of a child from 16 to 18 years of age for benefit under the Bill I should like to know if a child who became 16 at the time the Budget was introduced, and these improvements were announced, will continue to receive benefit because he is under 18 or whether from the period since the date of the Budget until the Bill is <Col N="948" /> passed he will receive no benefit because he was over the age of 16?  Those children who had reached the age of 16 at the time the Budget was introduced should receive benefits continually until they reach the age of 18.  As a member of a local authority I have found the deductions made from old age pensions when pensioners are in hospital for a considerable time are very much resented.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have said that the death grant is not adequate but I welcome its introduction as a step in the right direction.  I trust when our national prosperity increases the grant will be increased.  As I understand it the grant applies to persons in the contributory category; it does not apply to persons who are not in that category.  I should like to know if local authorities will be directed by the Minister to make a corresponding increase in the funeral grants payable to persons who do not come under the scheme.  Local authorities allocate grants to relatives who do not have the means to bury a deceased relative.  It is my opinion that these people do not come under this scheme but I trust the local authorities will be advised about the situation.  It may be that this is an attempt to include every old age pensioner, whether contributory or non-contributory.  I should like some guidance from the Minister on that point.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a point in regard to women employed in agriculture and domestice service.  I understand they must be ten years in employment before they can avail of unemployment benefit and if this is so the Minister should look into this matter.  I consider this period far too long, and this matter might be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would raise is the allowance for caring for incapacitated old age pensioners.  Although an allowance is given to many relatives, including daughter, step daughter, niece and so on, the wife is not included.  While there may be some theoretical reason for excluding her, in view of the work she is doing in caring for the incapacitated old age pensioner she is equally entitled to some assistance.  In many cases these people have a very hard struggle to eke out an existence.  A <Col N="949" /> married daughter or a daughter-in-law who is supported by her husband is not entitled to benefit.</P>
    <P>It sometimes happens, especially in rural Ireland, that instead of the female relative going into the house of the old pensioner to care for that person it is more convenient if they take the aged person to live with them.  In certain cases there is a difference of opinion as to whether the woman of the house is entitled to payment for caring for the old person because the latter is not living in her own house.  Anyone familiar with conditions in rural Ireland knows that in many cases old people live in very bad houses, without heating or water and sewerage facilities.  It is a humane and kind act for the relative to take the old age pensioner into the home and to care for him or her. If difficulties arise regarding payment in such cases I can visualise friction between the husband and wife when payment is not made.  If there is any way the Minister can ease the situation it will be greatly appreciated by many people.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly in regard to people who have obtained all their insurance stamps in England.  In many cases when they return here they find there is a long delay in obtaining benefit and there appears to be a breakdown in liaison between the Department here and the British Ministry in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the long delays that occur but if something could be done about the matter, even at ministerial level, it would relieve much anxiety and suffering.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a comment in regard to allowances paid to small farmers.  This has been worthwhile and has enabled many people to remain on their farms when they might otherwise have had to emigrate.  However, in some cases administration of the scheme appears too rigid.  I have in mind one case that occurred in my own locality.  It concerned a man who wished to give one of his two holdings &mdash;one of the farms was quite small and one was medium-sized&mdash;to his son. The farmer had decided that he and his wife would live on the small farm and the son would have the mediumsized <Col N="950" /> one.  The son was aged 26 years and, unlike his brother who had emigrated, he wished to remain at home. However, the examining officer believed that the farmer and his wife had moved into the small farm solely for the purpose of obtaining the allowance.</P>
    <P>Anyone familiar with conditions in rural Ireland will be aware that young women will not marry into farms where the mother and father are residing. However, the situation is not helped when decisions such as the one I have mentioned are made and where there is unnecessarily rigid application of the provisions of the Act.  When the scheme to grant allowances to small farmers was introduced I do not think it was in the mind of the Minister or of the Houses of the Oireachtas that it would be administered in such a restricted way.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Lyons that means tests are necessary and will remain so for quite a considerable time.  We cannot give grants indiscriminately but where a means test is applied it should be done in a flexible and generous way rather than in a harsh manner.  It is better to err on the side of being somewhat generous to the people who need assistance than to be overstrict and to encourage, among the population, a general distrust of those who administer our laws.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks are of necessity rather scattered, mainly due to the obligation placed on the Leader of the House to begin to produce Bills like a conjuror producing rabbits out of a hat.  I have not had an opportunity of spending as much time as I would like examining the various proposals in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity of bringing one or two points to the notice of the Minister now.  For some time past I have felt that the Department of Social Welfare is one which we could, perhaps, do without in its present form.  It seems to me that in its better operations it travels much the same ground as the Department of Health and the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A rationalisation of these Departments <Col N="951" /> and a transfer to the Minister for Labour of functions in regard to unemployment benefits and allowances and, to the Department of Health of functions in relation to disability and sickness benefits would be something which would probably be welcomed to a very great extent.  This would lead to a more effective and efficient operation of these services.  It is the experience of every Member of this House and of the Dáil, and of every public representative, in no matter what capacity, throughout the country, that they have from time to time been fraustrated at the slowness and delays of the Department of Social Welfare in answering simple queries and in providing necessary information which would enable the public representative to carry out his duties properly.  If our frustration bothers us, what must the frustration be of the people without benefits and allowances, or with missing cheques?  People are asked to fill in numerous forms, often to no avail.  It seems to me that the operations of the Department should be closely examined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are new proposals in this Bill in relation to allowances and pensions. These are welcome.  If they are to be efficiently operated I would suggest that the whole method of assessing claims, processing them and making payments should be seriously examined.  Very often people in public life come across an applicant who has written to the Department of Social Welfare months before and received no reply.  On contacting the Department they are told the Department have no record of such a letter.  If the Department admit to having received such a letter, they insist that it has been transferred to another Department or to another section in the building and that they are no longer concerned with it.  It seems to me that this is not the way that claims from people suffering in any way, through illness or unemployment, should be dealt with.  Consideration and the spirit of charity should be noticeable in processing these claims.  A special type of officer should be employed to deal with them.  It is only recently that the Department of Social Welfare got around to realising the responsibilities attached to the word <Col N="952" />&ldquo;social&rdquo; in the employment of officers in the Department.  The Department of Labour and the Department of Health could much more effectively administer most of the present schemes.  These Departments could perhaps more imaginatively devise new schemes to deal with changing circumstances.  I realise that in making that suggestion I am probably suggesting to the Parliamentary Secretary, who has just arrived in the Chamber, that his job could go by the board.  I would not be surprised if the Parliamentary Secretary was of one mind with me in the suggestion that the Departments of Health and of Labour could more effectively administer most of the schemes at present administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to turn to another topic which has concerned many people in public life.  Senator Dr. Belton referred to it this morning. There are a great many people in this country who derive their livelihood through the simple, if monotonous, process of inquiring into the livelihood and incomes of others.  In all walks of life and in all forms of Irish activity there is someone somewhere with a form demanding to have questions answered, income returns filled, and even to know whether the land attached to the house has been used to grow vegetables and, if so, what income has been derived from that and if such income could be calculated in order to reduce a non-contributory pension. Senator A. O'Brien has expressed an opinion that too often means tests are being applied, in no matter what Department, with a rigid, iron hand and a closed mind.  If an error is to be made, it will be made on the side of rigidity rather than on the side of charity.  In that way the official making the recommendation and the decision is in no fear of being surcharged for dispensing money from the public purse which a senior official might not agree with.  I have some sympathy with these inquiry officers from the various Departments, because they have this <Col N="953" /> obligation placed on them and through fear of being surcharged or being found to spend public money wrongly, they are inclined to err on the side of rigidity.  That is why I say there should be special attention paid to the type of person employed in this field of activity, to their qualifications and to the amount of discretion they are allowed.  In the scaling necessary in the operation of means tests there should be flexibility and in cases involving incomes as small as £20, £30 or £40 per annum the applicant should get the benefit of any doubt there might be.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the ruling of the Chair.  This is why I had intended suggesting that people making inquiries as to whether someone should receive a married woman's benefit or maternity moneys or anything else should be very highly qualified.  To achieve this one would need to have a central inquiry bureau that could process the inquiries on behalf of the various Departments rather than have each Department running its own.

      <P>If there is no means test in relation to the operations of the Department of Social Welfare I wonder <Col N="954" /> what role the many inquiry officers are playing.  I come now to refer to the death grant outlined in the Bill and in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, which is obviously a very welcome thing.  It is a thing of which we have heard so much talk, and I will join in welcoming it unreservedly except to say that this grant, of course, is not a new thing.  It is not something absolutely marvellously new that the Department or the Government of the day have devised to help people meet the high cost of funerals at the present time.  It is virtually the same grant which was in operation for a number of years and was removed by the predecessor of the Minister for Social Welfare under the Act of 1952.  There was a death grant before that and it was removed by a Fianna Fáil Minister in 1952 and now, thank goodness, in 1970 a Fianna Fáil Minister has seen fit to restore it.  We are getting nothing new, merely a return to the <i>status quo</i> of those hard days prior to 1952.  One must be grateful, of course, that the Minister has seen fit to restore this grant even if it is to be restored to the level of £25 which I think the Minister's immediate predecessor is on record as saying would not be of great assistance to a person in relation to funeral expenses.  This is to be the level of the death grant.  We all appreciate the cost of funerals today and that £25 will not cover full burial costs in most parts of the country.  It will, however, be of considerable assistance to many people, especially of the poorer classes, and in that regard it is to be welcomed.  Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he could clarify for us whether in fact this grant will not come into operation for some time.  I understand that it will not come into effect until March or April of 1971, having been funded in the meantime from contributions made through the employees' weekly contributions.  I would like clarification as to whether in fact that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the disparities which exist in the assessment of means for unemployment assistance in various parts of the country.  As I understand it, in the West of Ireland at the moment means are assessed on a valuation basis of £20 income being <Col N="955" /> equivalent to £1 valuation.  In other parts of the country the means test is a subjective exercise operated by social welfare workers.  I think it would be better if one standard was employed and clearly set out and known to operate on a national basis.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that in some part of this Bill an opportunity was not taken&mdash;perhaps it would not be the appropriate measure, but I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will be only too pleased to inform the House on this&mdash;to tighten up the procedure in relation to the obligation of employers to stamp national insurance cards.  We all of us know the very great hardship which arises where employers have either deliberately or otherwise not stamped the insurance cards of their employees and the employees were completely oblivious of the fact and almost invariably were paying their contributions by way of deduction from their pay packets and were happy in the belief that their cards were being stamped by the employer.  The process at present as I understand it is that if a person applies for benefit he will be informed that his card has not been stamped and that he is not eligible, and the only recourse open to him then is to take civil action in the courts.  As we all know, this is a very slow, tedious and cumbersome process, with all due respect to those legal luminaries who happen to be present on every side of me at the moment.  I understand that the Minister's Department are prepared, if application is made to them by the injured party, to initiate the legal proceedings on behalf of the injured party, who is the employee, but all too often there is a quite considerable time lag from the time the injured party discovers that the Minister's Department would be prepared to do this to the time when the Minister's Department eventually accede to his request to initiate the proceedings and the time after that again when this legal prolongation finally reaches its conclusion, usually, I think, successfully, but at the end of that stage, if the injured party has been dependent on the money he should have got by way of benefit he would have starved to death.  There is a case to be made <Col N="956" /> for having failure of employers to stamp insurance cards made a criminal offence with heavy punitive fines and indeed coupled with imprisonment in particularly bad cases, and the Minister's Department or the Department of Labour should be given legislative power to act immediately in such cases against such employers.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest that this Bill could perhaps have been used to initiate a publicity campaign to notify employees of the dangers which exist in not checking that their employers were regularly stamping their cards, and to issue a warning that they should ensure when contributions are being stopped from their weekly pay packets that the employer in his turn is fulfilling his legal share of the bargain and making his contribution by purchasing the stamps and fixing them to the cards.  All too often indeed we know of cases where this is not done and there is long-term suffering both to the employee and to his dependent family.  I would like very much indeed if in replying on this Stage of the Bill the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary could give us some indication as to the Government's thinking on this and whether they intend to take steps to tie up this loophole which exists at the moment.</P>
    <P>The proposed retirement pension as outlined in the Bill is of course very welcome to all of us on this side of the House-indeed especially welcome as this suggestion basically emanated from this side of the House some years ago.  I think that most of the fairer people in other parts of this building would agree that the suggestion first came in Fine Gael policy documents.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister when he is replying will clarify the position in relation to the new allowances to be paid to deserted wives because there is some apprehension that the allowances will be paid only at the equivalent rate of the widows' pension and not at the appropriate rate for widows' and orphans' pensions or in relation to the number of children the deserted wife may have, presumably by the husband who has deserted her.</P>
      <P>I should be glad also if the Minister would clarify the qualifications of old age pensioners for the new retirement pension.  Are the pensions to be confined solely to those who would otherwise qualify eventually for contributory old age pension or are they being extended to the non-contributory categories also?</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset I had very little opportunity to study this Bill but I understand&mdash;I am sure that I will be corrected if I am wrong&mdash;that this Bill outlines the provision for payment to those who are known as home helps.  I presume these are people who are prepared to go to the homes of people who are ill or perhaps the home of a nursing or expectant mother of a large family and who would be paid by the State to look after the house and do a few hours work each day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in relation to this one.  That is the difficulty.  With these few remarks I shall conclude but, of course, I would have preferred to have spent more time on the Bill. However, as I see it, the Leader of the House, through no fault of his own, has been obliged to present us suddenly with a clatter of Bills so that those of us who are faced with the task of trying to prepare speeches on them find that we cannot do the necessary research on three different Bills in the space of 12 hours.  I am sure this is not peculiar to those of us on this side of the House because every Member must have been faced with the decision as to whether he would speak on social welfare, on housing or on reduction of valuation.  Because of the interest that most of us have in these affairs, it is likely that they would have wished to have spoken on all three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point I should like to raise <Col N="959" /> is that there are many social welfare offices throughout the country&mdash;some of us might consider that there are too many.  Many of these are large barracklike buildings.  Would it not be a sensible and useful exercise to set up advice bureaux in those buildings where people could be advised as to their eligibility for social welfare benefits and so on?  This would be a step forward and it would display an awareness on the part of the Department that many members of the general public regard the Department as being more concerned with the proper filling in of forms than with the welfare of the people who find it necessary to complete such forms.  We can take it that each form represents somebody in need of benefit or assistance and very often an entire family wait in despair on a Thursday or a Friday for a cheque to arrive from Aras Mhic Dhiarmada but if that cheque does not come they will find themselves in some St. Vincent de Paul conference room or at the parish priest's door looking for help to tide them over until the Department get around the mechanics of civil service administration.  I notice that more and more, rural Deputies and Senators spend their time each week telephoning the Department in an effort to have cheques sent on to constituents.</P>
    <P>I had no great love for those local officers and now that they are being abolished perhaps it would not be contentious for me to say that very often they were active politicians of one particular persuasion but, at the same time, these gentlemen had local knowledge. They were aware of the needs of the local people.  They did help people to fill the forms which, otherwise, some people might have found difficulty in completing.  A great amount of time is spent by members of every political party trying to straighten out the jumble of forms with the Department of Social Welfare.  I suggest a review of the method in which the forms and claims are assessed by the Department should be carried out before the new schemes are implemented.  A special section could be set up to deal with them.  This <Col N="960" /> would allow for a more humane and charitable approach in the treatment of individual claims.</P>
    <P>It is recognised by all of us here that the social welfare benefits in this country rank among the lowest in Europe and our social welfare recipients rank among the lowest paid and yet probably they have the highest content of forms to be filled in by any country.  It would be a good thing if this Bill and its successors were able to abolish these two reputations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I welcome this Bill.  I am not too happy that it goes far enough.  When I say that I am not being critical of the Bill, I merely want to point out that it caters for people who are not in a position to organise for themselves.  They have to depend on us as their advocates to get the best possible benefits for them.  Workers are receiving as much as £7 a week increase in their salary in order to meet the increased cost of living.  This is recognised and accepted by the employers association and it is being paid even in my own county.  That, in itself, is an indication of how the cost of living is increasing and for that reason we must realise the difficulty that confronts social welfare recipients whom this Bill is intended to help.</P>
      <P>I notice that an unemployed single man in an urban area is paid £3 12s 6d a week and a married couple are paid £6 8s whereas in rural areas a single man receives only £3 6s and a married couple receive £6.  There is only 8s difference but I fail to see the reason for that difference.  The cost of living in rural Ireland is just as high as it is in urban areas.  As a matter of fact the vast majority of people in rural Ireland go to the towns and cities to shop because they get better bargains there.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision being made for deserted wives; it is long overdue. These women suffered a big disappointment in life and very often they are slow to make any representation on their own behalf because they are too embarrassed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the payment of social welfare benefits I know of cases where claimants were waiting six weeks for <Col N="961" /> payment.  It is unnecessary to make them wait such a long time and it causes much hardship.  Sickness or unemployment are bad enough but want of money and food cannot be described as a tonic for sickness.</P>
    <P>The benefit given for care of the aged is both welcome and long overdue. The amount of money necessary to provide such services is very small compared with what it would cost to keep these people in institutions.  I heard it stated by one man who described himself as having a thorough knowledge of the expenses incurred in maintaining a person in hospital that it cost up to £17 10s a week per patient. If that figure is anywhere near correct we are getting away lightly with the amount of money we are providing under this Bill to care for the aged at home.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say that I appreciate the benefits given in the Bill and although I am not satisfied that they are enough they are a step in the right direction.  I sincerely hope the Minister at the next available opportunity will see his way to lighten even further the burden on social welfare recipients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Social Welfare I should like to thank Senator Belton for the kind expression of sympathy he gave to the Minister on his tragic bereavement.  It is much appreciated.</P>
      <P>I was glad to note that Senators welcomed the provisions of the Bill.  I think this would be true of every Senator who spoke.  It would probably also be true of every Senator who spoke that while he welcomed the Bill he would like to see higher benefits.  I share this view but we have to be realistic and provide benefits which we can afford to pay.  I have no doubt that further improvements will be effected as time goes on.  As far as I am concerned the sooner that happens the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators raised questions concerning means tests.  It was suggested that one means test operated by a central office should suffice for all purposes.  This would be ideal if there were a full investigation and disclosure <Col N="962" /> of means recorded centrally and kept up to date but unfortunately no such record is available.</P>
    <P>The income tax records suggested by one Senator would not suffice.  The number of taxpayers whose means have been assessed for income tax purposes is only part of the population and by definition does not include those who are in the lowest income group and those most in need of the welfare services provided by the Department of Social Welfare and other Departments. However, I should mention since it was suggested that there should be one agency operating for the different Departments concerned with assessing means that this occurs to a limited extent.  The Department of Social Welfare carry out investigation of means for some other Departments, for example, for the Department of Defence in connection with special allowances.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned in the Third Programme that the Department of Social Welfare propose to examine the whole social assistance system and the question of standardisation and unification of means tests will inevitably arise in this review.  I would hope, as a result, that we will get nearer to the ideal which has been adumbrated here but I do not expect that we shall reach that ideal.  However, it would certainly be helpful if we could get nearer to it.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the means test for non-contributory old age pensions and to the method of assessing capital.  It is not the interest which the capital earns that is the dominant consideration in this matter.  The annuity which a person can buy at the age of 70 is a more important factor in arriving at the method of calculation.  I would also suggest that in view of the higher rates of interest now prevalent this method of assessing income from capital is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The interest on capital a person may receive is not the dominant consideration. This matter has been considered on a number of occasions and several factors, including the annuity a person could purchase for a certain sum, were taken into consideration.  I presume Senators do not expect that a person will be allowed to leave money untouched <Col N="963" /> in the bank to pass on to relatives and, at the same time, rely on the taxpayers for his support.  A pensioner might reasonably be expected to use some of the capital for his own support and if his capital is reduced as a result he can obtain a higher rate of pension.  It should not be forgotten that the most needy section of the people are those who have no means whatever and those who have some capital are in a much better position than that category.  This fact must be recognised.</P>
    <P>Some criticisms have been made of the rates of payment and of the qualifying conditions for the new schemes to be introduced under this Bill.  For example, Senators were critical of the amount of death grants.  I should like to point out that it is not intended in the case of a death grant to cover funeral costs in their entirety but rather is it intended as a contribution towards the expenses that occur as a result of a death in the family.</P>
    <P>In addition, in some speeches the amounts available under the death grant scheme were compared unfavourably with similar provisions in other countries.  In this connection I would point out that the rate we propose compares not unfavourably with the corresponding grant in Britain and in the North of Ireland, which is £30 with a reduction for a younger person. I should like to allay some fears that were expressed by Senators and to make it clear that the death grant will be payable directly and in entirety to the recipient or his personal representative, irrespective of any private insurance or any claims that might lie against him.  Similarly, payment of private occupational pensions will not affect payment of retirement or invalidity pensions.</P>
    <P>Some criticism was made of age limits and other conditions prescribed in the Bill in relation to the new schemes and to their scope generally. I should like to point out to Senators that these schemes are new and must be regarded as experimental.  In the circumstances it was considered prudent at the outset not to make the provisions too wide or to make the <Col N="964" /> conditions for qualification too easy of satisfaction.  However, it is intended to effect such improvements in the schemes as experience of their working will suggest as necessary; undoubtedly, experience will demonstrate clearly where improvements are necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>One of the matters that will be specially reviewed is the 50 year age limit for childless deserted wives. Reference was also made to the need for a review of the general children's allowances scheme and comments were made on the rates of payment for children under other social welfare schemes.  In this connection, I would point out that, as indicated in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, the general children's allowances scheme has been under examination with a view to introducing a greater measure of selectivity in the payment of the allowances and also to effect other improvements in the scheme.  In addition, as the rates for children under other welfare schemes were linked with the rates of payment for children under the general scheme, the relationship between them will be reviewed in the course of this examination.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was also made that a tax should be levied on luxury and pleasure expenditure and specifically designated for social welfare purposes. I am afraid this would be an unwise step as it would tie the social welfare expenditure to the earmarked tax and it could inhibit the development of our social welfare services if we were to do this.</P>
    <P>Criticism was voiced of the average contribution test for retirement pensions. This test is the same as that which applies in the case of the contributory old age pension and is similar to that applicable in other pension schemes.  The purpose has been to ensure that full pension is payable where there has been full, or almost full insurance.  The average test can be satisfied with contributions that are paid while the person is employed or credited during periods of illness or unemployment or by voluntary contributions where the person ceases in insurable employment.  Where the <Col N="965" /> average of 48 contributions is not achieved, reduced rates of pension are payable in accordance with the average that is achieved and thus the pension payable is related to the level of insurance.</P>
    <P>Senators complained of the complexity and difficulty in understanding social welfare legislation and a suggestion was made that one consolidated Social Welfare Act should now be produced. I must say that I agree that this would be both desirable and useful. Efforts in that direction have been made.  The steady stream of social welfare legislation introducing new and more elaborate schemes in recent years, has prevented completion of the work. There has been at least one Social Welfare Bill each year since 1957. With the many developments and improvements which are being planned at present, I am afraid I cannot hold out much hope of a consolidated Act in the near future.  It would certainly be desirable and useful.  If it cannot be done because of the rate at which we are improving and expanding the social welfare services and introducing new schemes, I imagine that Senators will be prepared to bear with us in not having a consolidated measure, when this is the reason for it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of other points which were mentioned.  The difference between the rates of unemployment assistance in urban and rural areas arises from the fact that in the urban areas concerned part of the cost of the assistance is raised by the rates.  This is not so in the rural areas.  I would also like to make it clear that deserted wives coming under the provisions of the Bill will get the same pensions as widows, including increases in respect of qualified children up to the age of 18 years.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the non-stamping of cards by employers.  As I mentioned in the Dáil yesterday, this is a matter which creates considerable difficulties and to which the Minister for Social Welfare has been devoting a good deal of attention.  We believe that a solution to this problem, reasonably satisfactory to the various parties concerned, is in sight and that it should <Col N="966" /> be possible to produce it fairly shortly. Legislation is not necessary in order to effect this.  It can be done, I think, by regulation.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the payment of old age pensions to patients in hospitals.  In those cases the pension continues to be paid to the pensioner or his agents.  The Department of Social Welfare do not deduct anything from the pension because the pensioner is in hospital.  The hospital authorities, acting within their responsibilities under the Health Acts, may seek to recover some sum towards the cost of the pensioner's maintenance in hospital.  This is not a matter which is controlled in any way by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I have been asked by one Senator to consider the question of a widow drawing a pension who, in addition, takes up some employment to try to help her to make ends meet and as a result becomes liable to income tax. I have been asked whether her pension could be exempt from tax.  I would not like to hold out any hope that this was likely to happen.  In so far as income tax is concerned, there are certain sums which are exempt or treated as not being liable to tax in calculating a person's income.  In the recent Budget these have been increased but I could not undertake to say that it is likely that in the circumstances outlined there would be further special exemptions.  I do not wish to go into details except to say that obviously if such cases were exempted there would be many other cases which would be equally deserving and would also need to be exempted.  The whole income tax system would need to be re-cast if we were to accept this proposal.</P>
    <P>One Senator questioned the drafting of this Bill on the grounds that it is proposed to give power to the Minister to set out the conditions for the various schemes by regulation, for example, the definition of what would constitute desertion.  It would be quite impossibe to draft social welfare legislation in the detailed way which would be necessary, if resort were not had to regulatory powers.  If everything went into a Social Welfare Bill, each Social <Col N="967" /> Welfare Act would be extremely bulky and complicated.  Worse than that, the administration of the social welfare schemes would become excessively inflexible and difficult.  We would have many complaints, far more than we do at the moment, with regard to the method of administration of the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>In relation to the deserted wives scheme, I mentioned in my opening speech that it was necessary to adopt a pragmatic approach so as to get a reasonable scheme in operation at the earliest possible date, as well as to ensure that the scheme would be flexible and readily capable of amendment where experience showed that amendment was necessary.  The definition of desertion has not yet been finalised. Unless a regulatory method were used to deal with this, the scheme would not yet be ready for legislation. Furthermore, I would point out that such regulations are laid on the Table of the House.  They are, therefore, not in the category of regulations which might be made by civil servants, with the concurrence of their Minister, and not subject to any scrutiny or right of revision or revocation.</P>
    <P>Another Senator suggested that part-time work should not disqualify a person for retirement pension.  This would be a matter for the definition of what would constitute retirement, which will be laid down by regulation. The points which were made by Senators will be taken into account in drafting that definition.  I can say that the definition will not be rigid or inflexible. It will take into account some form of work without ruling people out as not having retired.</P>
    <P>The point was raised by Senator Lyons as to whether eligibility for invalidity pensions related only to physical disability.  I want to assure the House that mental disability can operate to provide that a person who has been insured and satisfied the conditions for the pension will get the pension.</P>
    <P>Criticism was made also of the methods of investigation adopted by some of the social welfare officers. <Col N="968" /> These criticisms are not unfamiliar, but I think that Senators, when they think about it, will realise that this is a very difficult problem which certainly cannot be solved by anything you can lay down in a Bill or in regulations or in any written directives to these officers. One has to find the balance in providing such directives between on the one hand the mental state of people who are applicants for social welfare and on the other the dangers of widespread fraud in the making of claims. One can certainly find it possible to devise directives steering a middle course between these two difficulties, but where the problem arises is in the interpretation of these.  With the best will in the world if you produce a directive of this kind and give it to 20 different people you may well get 20 different interpretations.  However this matter was gone into in some detail in the discussion in the other House and some views were expressed on it by a number of Deputies, including myself.  Arrangements are being made to have these remarks circulated to the officers concerned, and I will also have added to that the remarks made in this debate in that connection to endeavour to convey as far as we can to the officers concerned the view that public representatives take of the way the duties are carried out, what are the things they object to, and how they feel the job should be done while doing justice to the State and to the applicants.</P>
    <P>A question was raised also about the raising of the age of allowances in respect of children from 16 to 18, and as to whether there would be a gap in payment between the date on which a child has reached the age of 16 and the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  There will be such a gap.  It is unavoidable because there has been no legal authority for the payment of any sum in respect of such children and there is not any until this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about the delays in obtaining information from the British Minister of Social Security at Newcastle-on-Tyne.  I want to make it clear that these delays are no fault of our Department of Social Welfare. <Col N="969" /> Constant efforts are made to expedite the transfer of contribution records, but the average delay is still about three weeks and can extend to five or six weks.  This is sometimes due to difficulties which the British authorities at Newcastle-on-Tyne encounter in tracing insured persons, but this is mainly due to the fact that relevant insurance cards may be held at local offices in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have dealt with the main points which were raised, but to the extent to which I have failed to do so I presume that the points concerned can be raised on the next Stage of the Bill and I will endeavour to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I am rather loth to let this pass without making this comment: this is an old man who has a daughter or a niece or somebody looking after him, or it could be a male relative, which could happen in some circumstances.  This is the section which provides for £2 15s being paid in respect of a person who has attained the age of 17 years, and it is going to be paid to the old person.  The person really involved in this is the person who looks after the old person. I would much prefer to see it being <Col N="970" /> paid to the person who looks after the old person rather than to the old person himself because the old person, either a man or a woman, may die and the person who has been looking after him may get no benefit out of this whatever.  In my view this should be paid directly to the person who looks after the old person, in other words to the family relative of charitable instinct who looks after the old man or woman for some years and can finally get no benefit out of this at all.  This benefit is given to the old person and not to the person caring for him.  The female relative has no way of knowing whether she will receive any benefit from the £2 15s. I do not know whether it is right that this money should be paid in this way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to realise that this allowance is paid to the incapacitated person because his incapacity is basic to entitlement to the allowance and the prescribed female relative will not acquire entitlement to an allowance in her own right.  This is the legal reason behind the benefit being paid in this way but I think that in practice the female relative would get the allowance.  When I say that I mean that she would get it from the recipient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point the Minister is making.  He is making the case that this benefit should be paid directly to the incapacitated person but it is my opinion that the benefit of the contribution should go eventually to the person who was caring for the incapacitated person or that at least she should be notified that the benefit was being paid to the old or incapacitated person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, in the vast majority of cases the person looking after the old or incapacitated person would get the benefit in practical terms.  In most cases, also, I am sure that the relative would be aware that the allowance is being paid although, of course, she would not have to sign for it.  Details concerning these relatives must be entered on the form when an application is being made.  While it seems to me to <Col N="971" /> be unlikely that the female relative would not be aware that the person for whom she was caring was receiving an allowance, I shall have the Department look at it to see if we can ensure by modification or otherwise that the person in respect of whom the benefit is being paid is notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Senator Belton on this because the entire section is left in mid-air and so much is left to regulations.  I did refer briefly on Second Reading to the fact that there is a saving to the Government when elderly people are cared for at home because to keep them in a hospital or an institution would cost between £10 and £20 a week.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have told us whether the prescribed female relative could also have an income either by way of insurance benefit or from doing part-time work.  This is important. Does the Minister consider seriously that such a person who would probably be in her mid-forties and who should be earning a reasonable salary ought to forego that salary and go home to look after her parents for a miserable £2 15s per week?  I presume the Minister would smoke cigars that would cost more than that in one day.</P>

This male relative might have had some training to enable him to carry out this work.  For instance, he might have worked as a male nurse but for some reason or another had retired or he might have done an intensive Red Cross course so that he would be capable of looking after his parents.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in this Bill.  There are certain difficulties in relation to extending this to cover male relatives which I shall not go into at this stage. All I can say in general about these new schemes that are being introduced are that I visualise they will be expanded in due course and one possible form of expansion of this scheme would be to include male relatives. However, if that is done&mdash;as I say, it is possible that it may be done&mdash;there would have to be stringent safeguards or it would be open to abuse and collusion. I am not ruling out the possibility but what I am saying is that if it is done it will be subject to fairly stringent safeguards.</P>
      <P>With regard to another point raised I should say the income of the person who is giving the care and attention is not relevant at all; it does not matter what income she may have; it does not count towards this payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  There are circumstances in which it might appear that it counts but it is on other grounds.  If the person giving the care and attention were to claim unemployment benefit on the grounds that she was seeking work this could not be accepted because she is already engaged in looking after an old person. Similarly, if she was in receipt of a disability benefit the question of her ability to look after the old person would arise.  This does not arise in relation to the payment of the allowance to the old age pensioner.  As far as that is concerned the income of the person giving the care and attention is relevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stayed out of this debate because I am in complete <Col N="973" /> ignorance of the code.  I wonder if there is any validity in this point.  As I read it the person who would be entitled to receive the £2 15s a week can have an income of £299 15s a year but not more than that.  If she has an income of £299 15s and gets this £2 15s a week she will have a total income of £442 15s per annum.  If by any misfortune someone adds to this income by £1 a year she will lose £142 a year. I know the Minister knows well that in another code there is provision for what is called marginal relief.  Is this sort of machinery impossible to operate in relation to social welfare?  This seems to me to be something that could be very unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The kind of marginal relief which the Senator has in mind does not operate in this scheme at present but it is one of the improvements in the scheme which will be almost inevitable.  This is quite a recent scheme.  It was introduced two years ago and amended last year to extend the range of people who could give the care and attention and we are extending the scheme further this year, but it is still relatively new.  I expect this is an area which would be improved in due course but as of now the position described by Senator FitzGerald is correct; there is no marginal relief.</P>

      <P>I did explain earlier when dealing with the Senator's objection to so much being possible by regulation that the implementation of social welfare schemes is quite complex and requires a great deal of flexibility. The effort to spell the whole thing out in a Bill not only makes it inflexible but makes an enormously complicated Bill.  This provision has been introduced in the past and is in here too, to deal with the nature of the operation of the social welfare scale which necessitates flexibility.  I am not aware that any complaints have been made in relation to the operation of this power under previous Bills.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the sort of means figures I was referring to when I suggested earlier that an amount of flexibility should be allowed to inquiry officers.  There is a table in the Bill setting out the rate of pensions relating to increased old age pensions contained in section 24.  Where the yearly means of a pensioner is nil and he has no qualifying child he will receive an increase of 4s 5d but if he gets £26 5s from anywhere he will get an increase of only 4s.  There is no point in going through the whole table but throughout it units such as 5s are used.  Obviously a social welfare officer not approaching an investigation with an open mind could operate in what would be a very harsh way against the pensioner.  I remember hearing from a colleague about an inquiry officer investigating the means of an old age pensioner.  As the pensioner lived in a local authority vested cottage and had a large garden plot he suggested she use that plot for growing garden produce.  When she pointed out that she was unable to do this he suggested she rent it out to somebody else.  This meant that she had a source of income which was not being utilised and he assessed an income on this which prevented her from receiving any pension increase that year.  I am sure neither the Minister nor his officials intend that the means tests should be operated in this way.  Very occasionally this happens and that is why I am taking the opportunity of the discussion on this section to suggest to the Minister that there should be a deliberate and definite instruction given to officers to realise that they are dealing with old and infirm people and that they should approach the matter of assessing means with an open mind and heart and in the spirit of charity rather than in strict application of Civil Service rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with Senator Boland in this matter.  I have knowledge of people who had a minimal income&mdash;perhaps not amounting to more than 1s per week&mdash;and on this account they lost £25 yearly from the pension.  I do not know if it is possible to do anything at this stage, but <Col N="976" /> I would suggest that a sum of £26 5s might be regarded as the minimum.</P>
      <P>I could mention a case of an investigating officer who visited an applicant. When he asked this lady if she had any money she replied that she had £85 saved to cover the cost of burial of her husband and herself.  The investigating officer did some calculations and reckoned that if this money was invested at 10 per cent it would mean an income of £5 or 6 a year and he disqualified her from the higher pension.  This decision meant that this woman and her husband lost 10s per week.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;nil&rdquo; classification is too harsh because even if a person possesses only 1s he is excluded and if the investigating officer wishes to adopt a very strict line the applicant can be the victim of a harsh decision.  In the case of a person in occupation of a labourer's cottage the investigating officers evaluate the plot as being lettable and they disqualify the husband and wife from receiving the full pension.  While I do not want to overstress this point I think if the sum of £26 5s was regarded as the minimum it would help many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the last two speakers who come from different parts of the country commented on the same point makes it obvious that the investigating officers are far too conscientious in the performance of their duties.  I should like to support Senator Honan's plea that the &ldquo;nil&rdquo; qualification be excluded.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier today that investigating officers must be getting some bonus for the number of people they deprive of the non-contributory old age pension.  In my own area up to last year a pensions officer went so far as to count the number of hens scratching around the cottage and assessed what value he could put on them.  This kind of practice is deplorable when we should be trying to help these old people and give them some comfort in their declining years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appears to have wide powers in this Bill and I would appeal to him to direct the investigating officers to adopt a more lenient attitude <Col N="977" /> and to err on the side of the applicant rather than on the side of the Department. They should give the benefit of the doubt to the applicant in each case. In this matter we are dealing with people who have very little and the pity is that where an applicant has been diligent and has saved for the rainy day this reacts against him.  On the other hand, the person who spent every shilling he earned has no difficulty in qualifying for pension.  The thrifty person who may have accumulated £50 or £60 is penalised for his thrift at a time when the Government are encouraging people to acquire the habit of thrift.  We should get some ruling from the Minister on this very vexed problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider taking power to specify by regulation assets and incomes that could be disregarded for purposes of computing the yearly means of people?  I cite the example of the bonus saving incentive scheme: surely it would be an attraction if people could put their savings into that and the income returning from such investment not included in the yearly means of the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised by Deputy McDonald about thrifty people being penalised is a very old and wide question.  The same argument was made in relation to income tax and death duties; in fact, the same principle applies.  People who have been thrifty and who have accumulated some money suffer deduction on tax in the way people who have spent all their money do not.  As I have said it is a very old and wide problem and I could not go into it in detail in relation to this section.  However, we should be clear on some aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, objection has been taken to the &ldquo;nil&rdquo; category as regards means.  I can understand the objection to it but so far as we are dealing with actual cash there is no doubt that the &ldquo;nil&rdquo; category is absolutely defensible in theoretical terms in that those people have absolutely nothing.  To the extent that they are not treated somewhat better than people who have very little <Col N="978" /> you are reducing the amount available to them: in other words if you put them into the same category as the people in the next category it will cost that much more and so much less will be paid to them.  This is the theoretical basis for the &ldquo;nil&rdquo; category.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that in regard to categories one must draw the line somewhere.  However, a different consideration arises when you come to the question of a person having a plot attached to a labourer's cottage, whether the owner has a few hens or whether he has some potatoes growing on the land.  In practice, certain allowances are made in the assessment of means of this kind&mdash; what I might call means in kind rather than in cash.  I should like to make it clear that, contrary to what some Senators appear to think, the mere fact of ownership or occupation of the plot attached to the labourer's cottage does not of itself constitute means&mdash;it is not counted as part of the means of the applicant.  However, the use of the plot can and does count. It is here that some discretion is exercised and where there is a very limited amount of use it will not be counted. Senators can perhaps think of this as if all the applicants having a plot attached to a labourer's cottage have a half-a-dozen hens running round, but there are other places where people are running market gardens on these plots and making a reasonable amount of money.  This raises the whole question as to whether this can be ignored. Do we drop the idea of trying to gear the social welfare scheme so as to give most to those who need the most? I want to make it clear that mere occupation or ownership of a plot attached to a labourer's cottage does not of itself constitute means.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to a case which was mentioned by Senator Boland and to tell him that if a social welfare officer to whom he referred said what Senator Boland said he said, then he was wrong in what he said.  I would further say that it is not the social welfare officer who decides.  He merely investigates and the assessment is looked at by the deciding officer or the pension committee, who can question <Col N="979" /> any part of the means assessed.  The deciding officer's decision is subject to appeal.  If any social welfare officer said that, he was wrong.</P>
    <P>Something was said by Senator McDonald, to which I should like to refer.  I believe that within the past year or so there has been what Senators would regard as an improvement in the attitude of the approach to this problem by social welfare officers.  I have been told this and I hope it is true.  I said earlier, when concluding on the Second Reading of the Bill, that the difficulties of getting the right approach when dealing with different people interpreting the same thing, are many.  I mentioned the steps being taken to ensure that the views of Deputies and Senators are being conveyed to social welfare officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a remark which could open up a discussion which could keep us here for a long time.  The Minister spoke about the real powers of old age pension committees.  The powers of these committees are strictly limited and curtailed. Decisions are made by the social welfare officer and his recommendation is almost mandatory on the old age pension committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to something which I think Senator Honan said.  I am sure a Minister for Finance must wonder how much money is expended in investigations as to whether somebody has a yearly means of £26 5s or of £52 10s and whether if there was no scale and the maximum figure of £25 was given as the figure without the scaling and without the consequent investigation and elaborate searching into whether or not a vested cottage plot was being worked, I wonder how much would be saved through this lack of investigation, which would go to offset the additional pension payments which would have to be made.  Perhaps we might get an opportunity of talking about things like that some time.  It <Col N="980" /> would be interesting to know how many of the non-contributory pensioners fall into each of the categories set out.  In other words, how much would be saved by pushing 5,000 pensioners down from category 3 into the lower category 4?  This is something which might concern the Minister and the officials of the Department.  There must be an elaborate system in operation into which pensioners can be slotted.  This would also apply to widows and to other people in the various categories.  The most economic thing to do might be to abandon investigation altogether.</P>
      <P>Let us consider for a moment the non-contributory old age pensioner who is living with his wife, who is also a non-contributory old age pensioner. Incidentally, I am quite sure that we will be told all over the country that we are paying people to die now.  Supposing a husband is bereaved during the year by the death of his wife, would the social welfare investigating officer be entitled to take £25 death grant as part of the assessable income?</P>

It might be a very worthwhile exercise for the appropriate Minister to set out a list of things which should not be taken into account by the social welfare officers.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that the Minister drew an analogy between the cottage plot and the market garden which I think was unfair. In practice, I think it is unjust to assess the value of the plot when it comes to the people in the lower categories for these non-contributory pensions.  A person who has no <Col N="981" /> property, or who had a substantial property but signed it over to his son or daughter and continues to reside with them, may draw the full pension, less 5s, and still live in reasonable luxury at home with his family, whereas down the road one can have an unfortunate person in a cottage penalised for this cottage plot which is not much more than a nuisance in this day and age.  Fewer and fewer of these plots are being tilled.  It is not an economic proposition to till a small area.  Some of these plots are bad land.  A good case has been made to allow these people the maximum pension, and to exclude the &ldquo;nil&rdquo; category.</P>

      <P>I think that I have dealt with this point before and I do not think it will help the House if I go back over that again, but there are two things I want to mention.  First there is the question that was mentioned about the death grant being counted as means.  This in fact could not arise because it would be a contributory pension that would be involved.  I also want to say that the question about the cost of this kind of investigation obviously occurs to everybody from time to time but there are some figures available from the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare which I think might surprise people when they look at them.  The total cost of the outdoor staff concerned with these various investigations of means tests, who have many other duties to perform as well, is £399,000.  If we were to abolish the means test in relation to old age and widows pensions this would cost £7 million a year, so there is a fairly simple sum involved in that.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which, in fact, has arisen on our earlier discussion relating to the plots attached to labourer's cottages generally.  The view was expressed in Dáil Éireann by certain Deputies that the mere ownership or occupation of the plot would be assessed as means.  As I have assured the House earlier, this is not so, but in order to reassure the Deputies concerned I undertook to introduce this amendment in the Seanad.  I do not think that any Senator will object to the change.  Acceptance of it will of course mean that the Bill will have to be brought back to Dáil Éireann but I believe, that there would be no difficulty in securing the agreement of Dáil Éireann to this amendment.</P>

      <P>The section reads:</P>
      <P>The Seventh Schedule to the Act of 1952 is hereby amended by the addition to Rule 1 (111) of &ldquo;but for the purposes of this Rule, a cottage (excluding any plot provided therewith) provided under the Labourers Acts 1833 to 1962, and vested in the person or the spouse of that person pursuant to those Acts or pursuant to the Housing Act 1966 (No. 21 of 1966), shall not be treated as property which is personally used or enjoyed by that person or the spouse of that person so long as payment of the purchase annuity has not been completed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In other words as long as the person who is in benefit, or the husband or wife, is still paying the annuity on the cottage the occupation of the cottage shall not be taken into account. Is this the effect of the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the effect of the section unamended I would have to go back a little bit.  In the case of labourers' cottages where they are being rented the annual value of the house is offset by the rent being paid.  Therefore the house is not counted in assessment of means.  Where the cottage has been vested the value of it was being taken into account, but not everybody took in the method under which this calculation of the value was taken.  The effect of the section is to ensure that in a case of a vested cottage subject to annuities the value of the cottage is not counted as means.  Now in regard to the plot, as I have said, the view that I take, and which I am advised is correct, was that the same position was given and it does not count as means.  However, in order to make it absolutely clear to anybody who has any doubt I think that this amendment will do that, though I say that I do not think it makes any difference, but some people think that it does and all will therefore agree that the result is the same if it is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess when I moved the adjournment of the debate last night I did not visualise that it would be nine hours after we began today's sitting before I would get in. If I had known that, I would not have been caught at ten o'clock last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was goaded into intervening in this debate because I felt the debate opened on a provocative note.  I must pay tribute to the Members on the other side of the House who did not continue on the same note but made contributions of a serious, constructive and reasonable nature.  I covered most of the points I wanted to make last night, but I want to re-cap by saying that I do not think the limited floor area will result in substandard houses.  I feel the Minister's objective of providing more houses with the money available will be achieved.  The maximum grant for houses of 75 to 100 square metres <Col N="987" /> is an effort to provide good family houses and family houses are the objective. It is expected that if a person wants a more luxurious house he should be able to pay for it himself.</P>
    <P>Last night I made several recommendations. The first recommendation I made was that as far as possible all existing cottages should be vested in the tenants.  This would give the tenant the privilege and pleasure of ownership and would relieve local authorities of maintenance.  My second recommendation was that people should be encouraged to own houses by offering them grants and loan facilities.  People who build their own houses are able to provide a good deal of the necessary labour from members of their own family.  This would enable them to build their house at less cost.  They are also able to exercise strict supervision. My third recommendation was that local authorities should provide serviced sites where possible so that private individuals by the aid of grants and loans could build their own houses more easily.  It would still be the responsibility of the county council to provide skilled supervisory staff to advise the people during the course of building operations and generally to guard against any shoddy or inferior workmanship.</P>
    <P>I should like local authorities to provide grants for houses for old people.  The grant available for an ordinary house of 35 square metres or more, but less than 45 square metres is £175.  A 45 square metre house is equivalent to 484 square feet.  I consider 484 square feet to be adequate to provide a house for old people.  It would provide a living room and kitchen combined into which neighbours could come and chat.  In addition it would provide one bedroom of 110 square feet and as we provided in the Social Welfare Bill today for the help and assistance of a relative to look after an aged relative a second bedroom should also be provided.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to the Minister that he encourage the building of houses comprising, say, two bedrooms, kitchen, living room and the usual facilities for old people and that <Col N="988" /> they be made available at a reasonable rent.  I also consider that the grant should be increased to £225.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that in all new schemes 15 per cent of the houses should be earmarked for old couples. This type of house would also be suitable for newly married couples and a system might be introduced whereby couples could be transferred to larger houses when they had families.</P>
    <P>I recommend that income levels for grants and loans be increased.  In the booklet entitled <i>Housing in the Seventies</i> it is stated that local authorities may pay supplementary grants not exceeding the amount of the State grant to provide a house for a person with an income up to £1,045 per year.  I regard this limit as too low.  We must encourage people who are earning a a little more than this to build their own houses and, for this reason, I consider the limit should be increased to £1,500.  Taking into account the figure of £100 allowed for each member of the family up to a maximum of four, this would bring the total figure up to £1,900.</P>
    <P>I do not recommend any variation in the valuation as set out for farmers, and, speaking for my own county, I can say that there are very few farmers whose valuation is in excess of the amount specified.</P>
    <P>I shall leave the matter of swimming pools to the Minister as I know he is interested in this subject, but in regard to the provision of recreational areas I should prefer if such areas were sited at the rear of houses.  I say this for two reasons: first, they constitute a hazard for children, particularly if they adjoin busy roads; secondly, I do not agree that they add to the appearance of housing schemes. Indeed, the reverse is the case more often than not.  I might add that in most towns there is a town park or a park used by the local football team and this can be used by the children. In addition, it has been found that very often it is necessary to employ an attendant to look after those recreational areas and this constitutes an additional burden on the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with other <Col N="989" /> Senators in that this Bill does not contain all that we would wish.  There are many features in it I should like to improve but I realise what has been done is a step in the right direction and that the Bill has been introduced and designed to meet changing needs.  Many previous Ministers have introduced valuable and progressive measures but all the problems will not be solved by this Bill, nor will they be solved in the near future.  The housing of the working-classes is a complex matter but a step has been taken in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I take this opportunity of welcoming the Minister to this Huse and I wish him well in his new appointment.  We all realise that the post of Minister for Local Government is a highly responsible one.</P>
      <P>One point which worries me about the housing situation is that there is not sufficient research being done in regard to the type of house or the standard which could be offered by local authorities to the ordinary individual. Are we concentrating too much on the quality-type house?  In 40 or 50 years' time will people be looking for that type of house?  No matter what type of programme the Minister tries to implement, or no matter how the local authorities work to house the backlog of people who are on the housing list, it would be difficult to house them all. I should like the Minister to refer to the type of house which is very well known in the south of Ireland as the Roefab.  We hear very little about it in Dublin or at local authority meetings. I discussed the system involved in the building of the type of house with engineers and they seemed reluctant to commit themselves.  It is a house which is approved by the Department of Local Government.  It takes a short time to erect and appears quite suitable. Local authorities should decide to try this system on some small scheme.  I might be of considerable help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two types of housing, local authority housing and housing in the private sector.  The difference between them is marked by the length <Col N="990" /> of the delay in getting the local authority schemes started.  I often wonder about the clause, adopted in 99 out of 100 cases, which refers to the lowest tender.  When I mention &ldquo;lowest tender&rdquo; I fully realise that it is important to save money.  A local authority may put a notice in the paper seeking tenders for a scheme of houses.  A number of firms will submit tenders.  It is possible that the firm with the second lowest tender might have worked for the local authority and have a very fine record.  Such a firm might be properly geared to build the houses for which the authority are seeking tenders.  As a result of not submitting the lowest tender the firm might lose the contract.  I have seen this in my own locality from time to time.  It is quite possible that a new firm might get the contract and this might cause a delay of from five to 15 months.</P>
    <P>With regard to local authority housing contracts, I fully support the need for a bond.  The time has come when there should be re-thinking on this whole question.  If a local authority is seeking tenders for a housing scheme the bond should form part of the tender.  A firm seeking a contract should be in a position to state that they would be awarded this bond.  I have seen contracts for schemes of houses held up for a considerable time because of delay with regard to the bond.  A firm could be given a contract for 60 to 100 houses but considerable time is lost in relation to the bond.  Six to nine months may elapse before the bond is awarded.  A firm, which may have done work previously and be known to the company which deal in bonds, might have submitted the second-lowest tender and would not have been successful in getting the contract.  There should be re-thinking on this question of the lowest tender. A local authority seeking tenders for contracts should be in a position to know who would be likely to be awarded these bonds.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the question of the sanctioning of loans and the delays in processing them.  This matter requires urgent consideration. As a member of a local authority, I <Col N="991" /> have often had contract with the officials dealing with these loans.  Sometimes one gets the impression that the officials discourage people instead of encouraging them.  Much time is lost in the processing of loans.  A local authority member can spend much time on the telephone trying to have a loan sanctioned for a person.  This time could be more profitably spent.</P>
    <P>An office should be established somewhere in the centre of Dublin city where information would be available to people looking for loans and where people could be helped in regard to loan applications.  Members of local authorities, Senators and Dáil Deputies could devote more time to the important task of legislating if they had not to spend so much of it on the telephone trying to get grants for people.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of the supplementary grant with a ceiling rate for a single person of £1,045.  A married man is allowed £100 for his wife and £100 for each dependant up to four.  We will all agree and appreciate that at the present time a person does not have to be earning a great wage to earn £1,045. The tendency also is that when a person is thinking of getting married and buying or building his own home he will work as much overtime as possible and in that way he may find when he applies for this supplementary grant that he is £100 or £200 over the limit.  Then a problem arises. My own local authority make the effort to meet people where they can submit information that the overtime worked is not likely to occur again or was due to unusual circumstances, maybe because of shortage of staff or something like that.  This is a matter which requires consideration because the grants are going to be increased, and I feel that the rate of the supplementary grant should be increased also.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the National Building Agency, no doubt quite a lot of good work has been done.  Last November we introduced a Bill to give them greater powers.  I was very pleased about that.  The Minister should ask them to try to build houses for those people who may not be in a position <Col N="992" /> to qualify for a local authority house. The local authority, when they are allocating houses, particularly with such a heavy waiting list, will normally have to deal with persons who have three or four children or who may be living in unusual circumstances in the city and county of Dublin.  The National Building Agency might be asked to provide houses which would cater for the person with one child or the person who may be just after getting married and not in a position to build his own home.</P>
    <P>We had some experience of this in Dublin.  The type of house I am referring to is the package-built house.  By arrangement with Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council and with some of the building firms here 100 of these became available to Dublin County Council.  They were allocated to the type of person I have referred to&mdash; the person who had one child or maybe two or in many cases was just after getting married and in the normal way would not qualify for local authority houses for years.  The repayments, I admit, are a little higher than we first expected but, nevertheless, I feel that these houses were a great boom to this type of people.  More of this should be encouraged, and I would ask the Minister to see what he can do about it.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the grants have been increased by something over £100.  This will benefit the people very much.  My own local authority have quite a lot of experience in relation to applications from people purchasing a county council cottage&mdash;a vested cottage. Some of these people may be anxious to build an extension, yet they cannot meet the finances.  As far as I know, a loan can be made available to them in the region of about £600. Unfortunately, £600 does not go very far towards the cost of building an extension, and I often wonder if the local authority could devise some scheme whereby they would build the extension for this type of person, or possibly make a greater amount of money available to him.</P>
    <P>Senator Flanagan referred to parks. This is a very big problem in Dublin. What I am referring to is this question of open spaces when building contractors are not propared to face their <Col N="993" /> responsibilities.  The Planning Act provides that one-tenth of an area should be left as an open space.  Planning permission is granted.  Then when the scheme is completed and it comes to handing over the area the local authority concerned has considerable difficulty in getting these people to hand over this open space voluntarily. The local authority of which I am a member had on a number of occasions to purchase these open spaces so that they could be developed properly for the children of the area.</P>
    <P>I must say that the 1963 Planning Act helped in some way, but yet it has not gone the whole way towards solving this problem.  Quite a number of estates in County Dublin were completed before 1963 but we still have this problem.  The Planning Act does not go far enough to meet this position.  I know that the Minister made a statement about this recently, but I am just wondering if the local authority has sufficient powers to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>Development and building in various parts of the city and county of Dublin where land is available has been held up because it is very difficult to get planning permission.  It is very difficult to obtain planning permission when land is available at a reasonable price. A builder who might be interested and who would be anxious to build a fairly reasonably priced house which the ordinary working people may not be able to purchase finds it very difficult to get planning permission.  I fully appreciate that we have such rapid development over the years that water and sewerage facilities may not be available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill at this time because for the past year or more housing has been one of our major problems.  Driving on the Naas Road, one sees many caravans parked on one of our few dual carriageways.  I often wonder why the Minister for Local Government does not provide serviced caravan parks for these homeless people.  Some of the caravans look as if they cost quite a bit of money and the least that could be done for those people would be to provide serviced sites for them.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are referred to as the housing authorities but I often wonder, especially when the Department send down a directive in connection with some matter such as the rent system, who is the authority?  Councillors often experience great frustration because of the delay in the Department in finishing various schemes whether they are big or small schemes. If we are to tackle the housing problem realistically and keep abreast of it, the Department of Local Government must let up a little on the red tape and allow the housing authorities to get on with providing dwellings for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should encourage local <Col N="995" /> authorities to employ their own architects on a full-time basis.  Housing schemes, whether group schemes of rural cottages adjacent to a village or larger schemes in an urban area, involve a great deal of trouble in getting the project through the various stages of planning and design because of getting the plans from the architects' office to the Department.  Much of this traffic back and forward could be eliminated if the local authorities had their own full-time architects and surely with so much building in progress such appointments would be justified?</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear the Minister say in his opening speech that he has lifted the restriction on the minimum sized room.  I think he said that under the Act no room smaller than 70 square feet would be provided. This may be a mistake because in local authority houses at the present time it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to put a modern suite of furniture into a room without having the bed either under a window or across a fireplace or preventing a door from opening fully.</P>
    <P>I believe that at least one lady consultant should be employed in designing a housing scheme because it is obvious that many men forget the finer points in design and we must build houses that are comfortable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of a housing authority.  I am aware that these authorities sometimes have to shoulder the blame for prosecutions instituted in accordance with the regulations on the owners of condemned or unfit dwellings for reletting such dwellings for human habitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem as it exists in the city is entirely different from the problem in rural Ireland because once one leaves the city and goes into rural Ireland the personal touch is very <Col N="996" /> evident all the time.  Very often we find families who, while waiting for a new council house, do not keep their existing house in as good a condition as it might otherwise be kept.  It is not unusual for families to put extra beds in a room so that, when an inspector comes, the place has the appearance of being grossly overcrowded and these people can succeed in getting their accommodation condemned and, perhaps, they will be allocated new houses.  The next day the landlord may find a distressed neighbour on his doorstep with the pitiful story of having no roof over his head.  If the landlord allows him to move into the condemned house on a temporary basis, the local authority, in order to get the two-thirds subsidy on the house that the original tenant is now in, must prosecute the owner of the condemned dwelling.  In a recent court case in my county a man was fined £40 by the district justice for doing this. We have our order of priorities entirely wrong because the same justice, not so many months ago, fined a man only £7 on a charge of drunken driving and manslaughter.  Those who are not able to provide houses for themselves should be shown more leniency and, perhaps, more charity and the regulations should not be applied so rigidly.  In new local authority houses and, indeed, in all houses built by the local authority and by the NBA, especially the houses proposed for the poorer sections of the community, it should be compulsory to have fitted kitchens with modern up-to-date presses and cupboards.  These would be of great help to housewives who may not be able to afford this essential furniture.  In this regard it would be a good idea to have lady consultants employed in architects' offices to work kitchen designs out in detail.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the ESB on the installation of underground power cables to all schemes of 20 or more houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, it improves the aesthetics of the schemes. The post office should emulate the ESB in this respect.  While communal television aerials are permitted now, it is still quite difficult to get them installed but the sooner this is done the better it will be for the skyline.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an obligation to allow housing authorities in rural areas to make direct contributions or grants-in-aid to group water supply schemes for isolated cottages and groups of rural houses.  The group water supply scheme is nine years old but the Department are reluctant to sanction the erection of rural cottages unless the services are supplied.  Last night Senator Gallinagh was not too kind to the farming community.  He reminded me of Deputy Paddy Smith who at one stage in his agricultural career proposed to lay on 10 fields of inspectors to get the lazy farmers out of their feather beds.  The main reason why a farmer qualifies for a higher grant for house-building than the urban dweller is that when he steps outside the door he usually walks into a puddle, whereas when an urban dweller steps outside his door he walks on a nice pavement provided by the ratepayers.  There is a good case here to continue the scheme whereby farmers with a certain valuation get the benefit of a higher grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support those Senators who advocated an increase in the rateable valuation to at least £75. <Col N="998" /> This is only in keeping with the falling value of money.</P>
      <P>Every possible effort should be made to assist people in the middle income group to provide their own homes.  The Minister is giving maximum grants of £350 and by doing so he is effecting a big saving because if people do not provide their own homes the local authorities are obliged to provide homes for them at ten times the cost. The onus is on the Minister's Department and local authorities to encourage people by offering direct grants and loan facilities to provide their own houses.  This is a great way to encourage people to save.  I admire the way young married couples tackle this rather sizeable problem.  It is wonderful to see people in the middle income group, even guards who do not have fixity of tenure because they are liable to transfer, providing their own homes. These people should get the benefit of generous grants.  It is a pity the upper income limit is not increased.</P>
      <P>I do not think any effort has been made to curb the ever-increasing cost of building.  When one goes into a hardware shop to buy some screws or nails one is presented with about half a dozen in a plastic pack at a price of 1s 6d.  This is sheer extortion because if one bought the same screws or nails by the pound one would get a pound for the same price as the pack.  The Department has an obligation to keep an eye on these prices so that people can afford to maintain their own houses properly.</P>
      <P>I welcome the section providing more grants for maisonettes.  Local authorities should be encouraged to build maisonettes.  It is very important that we provide accommodation for elderly people and people without families.  The logical thing to do is to provide a smaller type of accommodation such as maisonettes.  The one danger I see in the new scale where the ceiling on grant aided development is 1,050 square feet is that we shall get a prototype house all over the country. The Department of Lands made that mistake many years ago and it took a very long time to get away from that one type of monotonous looking structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should encourage people to express <Col N="999" /> their own individual ideas in their own houses.  There should be as much variation as possible in the houses we build. Local authorities should build different sized houses in the same scheme.  This may be a little more costly but local authorities should be empowered to allocate houses to people without families.  It is not good enough that a married couple should be denied local authorities housing because they have no family and the Department should help in this matter.  They insist on rent schemes and systems for local authorities and they should also allow the local authorities to let their houses to childless couples who have been on the waiting list for a considerable number of years.</P>
    <P>The restrictions on the provision of isolated rural cottages have continued for too long.  If the Department persist in their clamp-down on isolated rural cottages&mdash;it is almost absolute at the present time&mdash;they will completely denude rural Ireland.  It is affecting the country because unless people live in the rural areas it will be extremely difficult to have an adequate labour force available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>If a young man wants to live in the country the onus is on the local authority to provide a house and people living in glasshouses in Dublin should not decide against it.  People need houses and we do not want to put them all in caravans.</P>
      <P>I have not heard the present Minister for Local Government speak on this subject but his predecessor gave a direction to local authorities last year that they should provide housing for itinerants.  If the present Minister is of the same opinion, he should allocate to local authorities 100 per cent State subsidy towards erection of these houses.  Local authorities are faced with many difficulties in acquiring and providing sites for this purpose and it would encourage them if the Department of Local Government would undertake the cost.</P>
      <P>I should like to support those who advocated that with each housing scheme we should provide adequate playing facilities for children.  This is generally accepted and when local authorities send proposals in regard to the acquisition of the necessary land to the Department of Local Government they are generally sanctioned.  It is realised that unless we provide adequate recreational centres for children we will have our share of delinquents. We must provide adequate playing centres in our towns and villages.  The provision of simple swings and slides cannot be so expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is already being done.  In any area it is standard practice that if 50 houses are provided playing centres are also provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was made to prefabricated dwellings.  I think this kind of housing development has been a disappointment because at present it is as expensive as the ordinary solid constructed house if not more so.  While it is easy to erect prefabricated <Col N="1001" /> houses at short notice they are still far too expensive and costings into this kind of housing development, especially for emergency purposes, should be investigated.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether in cases where a local authority ask for sanction to provide accommodation for people in urgent need of shelter the Department have some method of short-circuiting the drawn-out procedure and thereby providing shelter in the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>There are one or two other points in the Bill with which we can deal more fully at a later stage and we have tabled some amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as far as it goes but I regret to say that I do not consider it goes nearly far enough.  There are approximately 60,000 families in need of rehousing, either because they are overcrowded or their present accommodation is not considered fit for habitation.  I do not know whether other Members of this House have had occasion to visit houses that were in a bad condition.  I have had such an experience&mdash;although I am glad to say not in Tipperary where housing conditions are good.  However, in various towns throughout the country I have seen houses that were in a deplorable state.  We are constructing about 13,000 houses a year which is an improvement on our average of 9,000&mdash;although it is not as good as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use whatever saying to ourselves that by the mid-1970s we will be building 15,000 or 16,000 houses per annum.  We must build 9,000 houses per year, according to the statistics, to replace houses which will become progressively unfit for habitation and to replace what is expected to be the normal growth of need in our population.  We must get 60,000 houses to house people who are living in conditions unfitting to the dignity of man.  Instead of thinking of 16,000 or 17,000 houses by the mid-1970s, we should be thinking of 16,000 or 17,000 houses for the year 1971 and we should increase the numbers from there on. Taking the normal growth of 9,000 houses and assuming that there is not <Col N="1002" /> any impetus to employment which can cause further houses to be required, it will take us ten years to house people living in poor conditions.  Any family living in a house which is unfit for habitation can look forward to saying: &ldquo;I may have a house in ten years' time&rdquo;.  This is not good enough.  A considerably larger proportion of our current expenditure from taxation and of our capital expenditure should be devoted to our housing programme. There is no good talking about free university education and such matters if the children of this country must be reared in houses which are unfit, with all the possible mental frustration and dangers to their mental and physical health which accompany living in conditions of that nature.</P>
    <P>At the present time the total subsidies from the State towards housing &mdash;given to the nearest quarter million pounds in each case&mdash;is £4.25 million for houses built by local authorities and £3.5 million for houses built by private individuals.  That is a total of £7.75 million and this money has to be raised by taxation.  The contributions of the local authorities are £5 million for houses built by local authorities and £2.25 million for houses built by private individuals.  That £5 million includes also the subvention of rents.  This is where the various tenants organisations who say &ldquo;We are all right now and it does not matter about anybody else&rdquo; can do very considerable damage to the housing programme of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not approve of the militancy of certain groups like the Dublin Housing Action Committee but I can feel that protest of that nature would not arise unless there were grounds for it.  Steps should be taken with a view to housing families living in unfit or overcrowded conditions.  I have very little sympathy for the views put forward here that the size of houses provided for in the Bill is not adequate.  I am conscious of the fact that the economy of the State must balance.  I am not so much concerned with what people will have to suffer who have to pay more tax to provide for the needy.  If they can afford to pay tax, they must pay it.  I am concerned that the economy of the country <Col N="1003" /> should not become overburdened.  One reads in the paper daily that the value of money is depreciating and that we are tending towards inflation because of Government expenditure.  What is meant by Government expenditure which causes inflation?  As many of our colleagues are well aware, the cause of inflation by Government expenditure is not the payment of money to civil servants but the payment of money for unproductive purposes no matter how necessary these unproductive purposes may be.  I do not use that term in any disparging sense but I mean spending for purposes which are not giving a return, such as houses, schools and hospitals.  In any economy the amount spent must have a certain balance and must have a certain relativity to the total productiveness of the country.</P>
    <P>The day of the conventional-built house in this country has nearly come to an end.  That is my opinion.  It is our own fault.  It is the fault of every section of the community in which we live.  It is the fault of the militancy which is being fostered in every section of our community.  For years past if the builder has his ordinary workers to build houses for him, he may not be able to get cement because 600 or 700 workers are on strike and hold up cement production.  If the builder has the workers and the cement, he may not be able to buy goods because the banks are on strike.  If he can write cheques, he may not be able to do his work because the dockers are on strike. We must learn sense.  The section of the community who are sufficiently well educated to come together and discuss the reasons for their differences are giving very bad example.  The people who suffer most are the people in poor houses.  The unskilled labourer is the person who makes the least trouble in our country.  He works for £12 to £16 a week in order to maintain his family.</P>
    <P>I feel that the greater percentage of the capital of this country and of the taxation of this country should go to housing even if something else has to suffer.  I fully realise that when the State pay a subsidy for a house that is not the end of the many charges required. <Col N="1004" /> The ordinary man who builds a private house gets his subsidy which may be anything from £400 to £900. He must then go to the local authority and borrow another £1,500 or £2,000. I would estimate that on average for every £ which must be got from taxation, either from the State or from the local authority, a further £2, £3 or £4 must be got by way of capital investment by the State in housing.  This consists of national loans.  The proceeds of these national loans are given to the local authorities who in turn lend to people building houses for themselves.  I am wondering how with the present system of subsidies further encouragement can be given.  I say with all respect&mdash;I do not claim to be as expert in how the housing requirements of the country can be met as those people who advise the Minister and who give their whole time to the matter&mdash;that a little more imagination should be shown in regard to our housing Acts.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, here in this Bill. Before it can build houses the housing authority will take approximately three years from the date it decides to build the houses until the day the key of those houses can be handed over.  That is not an unreasonable length and does not mean that the housing authority has been in any way careless.  It tries to acquire suitable sites, but all sorts of objections are put in its way.  First of all, the person refuses to give the sites.  Then there must be a local government inquiry to force him to give them.  Having got the sites, the person from whom they take the sites wants a price which bears no relation to the current market value of land even for housing purposes, so they have to have another local government inquiry for that.  All sorts of advertisements have to be put in for those inquiries. To a great extent these steps could be shortened by cutting through the red tape and by expediting the various steps that can be taken there.  Having done that, then they have to put in advertisements for tenders and so on and they have to get the various tenders approved.  One does find then that, perhaps, the contractors do not do their work within the time within which it should be done.  There are various <Col N="1005" /> hold-ups&mdash;possibly strikes, possibly shortages of money.  Many Senators are members of housing authorities or of local authorities.  I am not but I feel certain that they will agree with me that no housing programme undertaken by a local authority can be completed in less than three years.  I think there is something radically wrong where that happens.  The rights of private property should be protected, and adequately protected, but there is a limit beyond which the State could not and should not go where there is a shortage of houses.</P>
    <P>In this Bill also there is provision for the erection of houses for skilled employees.  Now for all practical purposes that will become a fatuity if it is going to take three years, as I say, to erect houses.  Any industrialist knows full well that if he has got to bring into his factory one, two, half a dozen or ten skilled craftsmen to train his men he is not going to have them hanging around for three years while those houses are being built.  This is another area in which a little more imagination could be used with a view to speeding up our housing programme.  That company or factory on its own will acquire a site or sites much more readily and much more rapidly than will the local authority.  It will make arrangements to have houses built, again much more readily and much more rapidly than will the local authority, and if the company or industry which requires houses for its skilled employees are offered the facilities which are provided for under this Bill I should imagine that in a relatively short time many more houses would be built.  This would have the advantage also that many of these companies, instead of borrowing from the local authority for the balance of the money, would put it up out of their own funds, but only upon the condition that they would get, in the first instance, the subsidy which would be given to the local authority for the erection of the same houses.</P>
    <P>I speak, I hope, not too emotionally, but I speak as one who has visited house after house in mean little streets where sometimes the people are suffering from rheumatism, from arthritis, <Col N="1006" /> from all those various illnesses that come from dampness, where the little children are obviously suffering from the lack of proper ventilation in their rooms.  Therefore, while I speak strongly on their behalf, I welcome this Bill as far as it goes, but I would give it a far more hearty welcome if the measure showed a little more imagination, a little more encouragement to private individuals to build their own houses, to factories to build houses for their staffs, and to local authorities to expedite the time lag between when they make up their minds to build houses and when those houses will be completed.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the Senators who welcomed Deputy Molloy, Minister for Local Government, to this House on his first appearance.  I should like also to welcome the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cunningham, who was here earlier.  The present Minister for Local Government was not the architect of the Bill.  Therefore, his only responsibility is to present to the House a measure which he inherited.  On that account I should not like to be hard on the Minister.  I hope that when the Minister for Local Government introduces a future Housing Bill it will be, as Senator Nash quite rightly said, much more revolutionary and imaginative and will do something to help alleviate the existing housing position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Senators referred to this Bill as if it contained just one provision. They seemed to think that by reducing the floor area a further thousand houses per annum could be built.  If that could be done as a result of this measure I would be happy.  I am sure all of us would be happy if we were assured that we were going to get an increase of one thousand houses per annum but I am not so sure that a reduction in the floor area will produce a thousand houses.  I hope I am wrong. I speak as a member of a rural community and of an area with which I am familiar.  I speak as a member of a local authority and I speak as one who has encouraged people to build their own houses under the Small Dwellings Act.  I would say that I have completed as many forms as any other man <Col N="1007" /> in public life, but on only one occasion have I known of an applicant who was in a position or who desired to build a house that was more than 1,250 square feet in area and I think that must be the experience of anybody in a rural community who is involved in helping people to provide themselves with houses.  In general, one finds that the area is approximately 900 to 1,000 square feet.  In a house of that area one would find three bedrooms, a living-room, a kitchen and the other ancillary accommodation.  To very many people such a house is a luxury and they are very fortunate, indeed, if they are in a position to buy or to build a house of that kind.  At the same time, I would regret if anybody who wished to build a better type of house would not be able to do so because of any reduction in grant either for the building or for the purchasing of the better type of house.  If the average cost of house-building is taken to be between £3 and £3 10s per square foot, it will be found that a house of 1,000 square feet would cost about £3,500 but that price would not include the cost of the site or any of the other expenses involved.  In effect, this means that people who avail of loans and grants to build their own houses must cut their cloth according to their measure.  They must build as economically as possible and, at the same time endeavour to qualify for the maximum grants.</P>
    <P>The 1966 Act contained two provisions. One provided that a farmer with a certain valuation who was engaged in agriculture or an agricultural labourer would qualify for a 50 per cent increase in his grant, making a total of £450.  As most local authorities pay a supplementary grant of 100 per cent&mdash;at least the local authority of which I am a member do&mdash;that means that he gets a grant of £900 in all. The same conditions apply to persons building their own houses who would normally qualify for local authority houses.  I am not at all happy that the best way of helping persons to provide their own accommodation is by way of grant because in many cases the grant tends to find its way either to <Col N="1008" /> the person who has built the house and is selling it or to the builder.  For that reason we should examine the position in relation to low interest loans.  In that respect it is no harm to point out that Meath County Council the vice-chairman of which is a Member of this House&mdash;he can verify what I am saying&mdash;provide a 6 per cent loan to a person who undertakes to build his own house and who would normally qualify for local authority housing.  In other words, he would get a local authority house when one would become available but he avails of the loan and grant and proceeds to build his own house instead.  Although only a local authority we provide this 6 per cent loan for that type of person. We find that it works very successfully. I should like the Minister for Local Government to encourage people to build their own houses thereby getting them off the housing lists of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why the Department could not encourage people by way of low interest loan or must we always be tied to this idea of handing out grants?  It is my belief that grants will always increase the price of houses. For that reason I ask the Minister to examine this suggestion.  The Minister for Local Government is a member of a local authority.  He is fully conversant with the problems that confront every member of a local authority.  I hope that with the experience he has gained as a member of a local authority, he will introduce more comprehensive or revolutionary legislation on the lines suggested by Senator Nash a few moments ago because this Bill will do nothing to alleviate or solve our housing problems.</P>
    <P>I hope that loans will be made available at a much lower rate of interest and that the whole price of house-building will be examined and kept under constant review by the Department. At the present time, the demand exceeds the supply.  It is absolutely impossible for people to provide their own house or get a site on which they could build a house.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister in his absence.  I also welcome, with equal pleasure, the presence in the House of his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cunningham.</P>
      <P>Despite the discouraging sounds from the Leader of the House, I was truly humbled by the debate and by the discovery that I knew little about this subject.  I realise now what an experience it must be in understanding our social problems to be a member of a local authority.  This came out in every speech from both sides.  I cannot say that I took in everything but I took in enough to be discouraged and enough to be determined to read it all when it is in print.  I hope that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will take note of all that has been said because there must be great value in all of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, Senators may ask why am I speaking since I have told the House that I do not know much about the subject.  The two points I was going to make have been made for me by the two previous speakers.  I take Senator Nash's primary proposition to mean that he would give absolute priority to expenditure on housing.  It is dishonest not to get our priorities right.  The demands which articulate groups want should be put into second place when compared with the needs of the 60,000 people living in deplorable housing conditions.  Without a doubt I regard the solution of the housing problem as a higher priority than the further extension of expenditure on education.  It is my absolute conviction that we have no right to do anything with our resources but to dedicate them to solving the housing problem.  It is all very well to say that <Col N="1010" /> the problem ought not to have arisen but, as it has arisen, every effort must be made to solve it.</P>
    <P>The problem probably arose because the First Programme for Economic Expansion was planned on the basis that all social problems had been solved.  The people who were endeavouring to make great progress at that time concentrated our resources in the field of production.  It is an economic fallacy that in order to put money into something which produces an income return it is necessary to put money into something that is more productive.  A house yields its own income in the shape of benefits to the occupier just as much as it might yield an income to a landlord if he were letting it.  The important distinction between the two is that the landlord can save the income he receives from it, whereas the occupier of a house is spending for the benefit which he gets out of the house each year.</P>
    <P>I want to develop the point made by Senator Jack Fitzgerald.  I am extremely dubious that the grant system will provide a solution to our housing problem.  I make a distinction between grants which have regard to the means of the people looking for the grant and those which are given without any conditions being made.  There is a case to be made here for the supplementary grant as against other grants. In a situation in which one is dealing with scarce resources one must be able to say where a saving can be made. Senator Nash said that private individual expenditure amounted to £3½ million.  I do not know how many of these would warrant a grant if the people had to establish themselves as below a particular income.  I accept completely what Senator Jack Fitzgerald said about the ultimate beneficiary of grants.  In Dublin where there is a tremendous demand for housing, to pump money in on the demand side can have only one possible effect and that is to increase the price of what is in scarce supply.</P>
    <P>The other side of the equation should receive more attention than it has received in public discussion.  I am sure it has received much consideration within the Department of Local Government. <Col N="1011" /> On the other side of the equation there is the supply factor. What is required to provide a house? Obviously, the first thing required is a site.  A well informed person told me that 37 per cent of the cost of a new house in Dublin is represented by the cost of the site.  There is also the question of the organisation of the construction industry.  Would an improvement in the organisation of labour produce greater results than merely to hand out grants to people, who then make their own deals with the skilful people who sell houses in conditions in which they are well able to sell them to somebody else?  There is also the question of the availability of skilled labour.  The trade unions have restricted admission of people to qualify for these skills.  The trade unions through their continued application of these restrictions may be causing the problem which many of their supporters are critical of the public authority for failing to solve.</P>
    <P>I should like to see consideration given to incentives instead of merely giving grants to builders.  After all, we do not give grants to exporters as such. One of the most successful schemes for the advancement of productivity in industry has been the incentives given to exporters.  They generated incomes by their exertions to get the tax free money and a great deal of tax paying money is resulting from their exertions. If the situation warrants a crash programme why not offer incentives to builders such as special tax rates to encourage them to build?</P>
    <P>The additional value of land in and about Dublin has been generated over the past 20 years because of the growth of the population and the growth in incomes.  The people who own this land have been given a gift by the community. They should be taxed on this and the revenue collected should be used for the benefit of the community. It is difficult to control land prices. The English system has done little more than force people to invest their capital abroad and impede development.  I should like to feel we had some body considering if any schemes could be devised to control prices and to improve the rewards in the building industry <Col N="1012" /> through tax incentives.  I should like to see the Minister, in co-operation with his colleague the Minister for Finance, concern himself with special classes like old people.  We have covenants in favour of science laboratories and splendid institutions are constructed. People are very happy to enter into a covenant if Revenue are paying two-thirds of the cost.  It is extraordinary how attractive that is to the man who wants to do some good with his money. Perhaps, there could be covenants in favour of industrial and provident societies whose function it would be to construct houses for the old.</P>
    <P>I might comment on the relationship in the provision of houses to the development of industry.  I should like to think that this is a matter which is being considered by the Department of Local Government, the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Industry and Commerce. A view held by many people is that in the modern Europe if you have a place where houses are available you will attract to that area the necessary skills which, in turn, draw industry into the area.  We have generally thought in terms of industry going into an area and, subsequently, the community providing houses for the workers.  Perhaps, we should think in terms of establishing housing so that industries would be attracted into an area.</P>
    <P>I view with deep concern a subsection of section 12 of the Bill.  I do not wish to go into detail on this matter in a way that would be inappropriate to Second Reading.  However, as I attach such importance to it, I thought it might be permissible to say this in anticipation of Committee Stage so that the Minister's legal advisers might consider the matter.  As the section is drafted, a large number of people will be in danger of committing a criminal offence without being aware in the slightest degree of the circumstances that could give rise to prosecution. From my interpretation of the section the sheriff himself, clergymen, doctors, lawyers, Members of the Oireachtas, social workers, postmen, process servers, milkmen, and all kinds of people could be in danger of committing a crime by virtue of the fact <Col N="1013" /> that this subsection states that a person who makes an entry into the dwelling may be guilty of a criminal offence.  I shall develop this at greater length on Committee Stage but I thought I should give the lawyers opposite an opportunity to think about the matter.</P>

      <P>This has been an interesting debate. I am sure Senator Alexis FitzGerald will not mind when I say I understood him much better than when he speaks about legal technicalities in Bills.</P>
      <P>The earlier part of the debate seemed to be confined to the Bill but later it moved into a wider sphere.  I do not think this is undesirable because we are all concerned with improvements in housing.  I do not go along completely with Senators Nash and Alexis FitzGerald when they speak of giving housing priority over education.  I have spoken on this subject before and I repeat my comment that it all depends on the education one has in mind.  If it is the subsidisation of higher levels of education, I agree that people could afford to provide this, but in regard to the primary level of education I consider we are not doing enough.</P>
      <P>Perhaps a little more imagination might be displayed in regard to housing.  Senators made reference to the help that might be given to people to build houses.  I agree generally with Senator FitzGerald in his comments in relation to grants and I would add that grants have come to be regarded as a kind of commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought Senator FitzGerald was going to take a leaf out of my book when he referred to incentives.  A breakthrough could be achieved if something like a tax relief incentive on earned income was made available to those who wished to purchase a house.  referred to what the economy can afford and spoke of over-heating <Col N="1014" /> of the economy.  It appears to me that the over-heating of the economy is coming directly from over-expenditure in certain areas.  There is a section of the population&mdash;some of whom live in Dublin&mdash;who have weekly incomes of from £40 to £70 and in many of these cases the ratepayers have contributed to provide them with low rent housing.  This is the section that should be encouraged to save to buy houses rather than have them provided by the local authority in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The real problem is that young people who are trying to save in order to get married are taxed on all income in excess of £6 10s per week. If the young person is living at home and is not contemplating purchase of a house he can afford to pay the tax. However, it is an entirely different situation when a young couple are struggling to save for a deposit for a house.  They have to pay away-from-home expenses and any saving must be done on the taxed income.  Perhaps the Minister might have this question of saving incentives examined in order to relieve the housing difficulties of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Although it is not in his area, the Minister might consider some system which could be worked out which would encourage young people to become owners rather than to rely to such a great extent on local authorities, on ratepayers and on the Exchequer, through the local authorities, to provide them with rented houses, following which they become exposed to elements who want to agitate about the level of rents.  This is the fault of the situation which we have created by the mass-building of corporation houses in Dublin.  The advances of the last 40 years have been very great, but we have gone too far in the direction of the State providing houses rather than encouraging the individual to provide his own house.  As Senator Flanagan said&mdash;and it is no reflection on many who live in those estates&mdash;the young couple who have provided themselves with a house seem to have more dignity and a stronger sense of self-respect than those who are given houses.  I am not reflecting on those who are not in a position to <Col N="1015" /> provide their own houses.  This may be a reflection on ourselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald raised some questions on which the Minister might enlighten me.  I think speculation in land is taxable.  If it is not, it ought to be.  I understand it is taxable within limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Speculation &mdash;yes, but if you are the happy occupier of land which gets the benefit of increased value because of the approach of building to his land it is not taxable.</P>

      <P>I have seen the extraordinary prices to which land has gone, and this is becoming a factor in housing costs.  I should like to see this question settled.  Senator FitzGerald raised a point in relation to the cost factor. Investigations have been done and there have been reports on window sizes, etc.  I get reports from a committee of An Foras Forbartha which does such work.  They have done a considerable degree of research.  The strategical laying-out of areas, not alone in relation to what houses would be available, but also in relation to what other facilities would be essential, such as sewerage, has been examined. This has been done to a considerable extent.  From my experience on voluntary committees in An Foras Forbartha I know that one of the difficulties which we have in Ireland is that there are not enough trained planners.  I was chairman of a committee connected with the training and education and it was difficult to get the education authorities to provide courses for planners.  I do not think this has worked out well.  The fault did not lie with An Foras Forbartha.  The situation seemed to me to be that, apart from Dublin Corporation, very few local authorities in the country have any trained planners to advise them. This brings me to an aspect of this which I think is becoming significant. <Col N="1016" /> Senator Alexis FitzGerald referred to the amount one learns from a debate like this when one listens to people who have actual experience on local authorities.  I do not have this experience. It is a very useful exercise for some of us to hear about the problems which Senator Ryan and Senator FitzGerald and others referred to.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the almost continuous refusal to allow people to build houses in areas around Dublin is what I have come across most.  I meet this problem regularly.  It seems that there are bottlenecks about granting permission for building.  It probably goes back to the problem that there are not enough planners available.  If a man succeeds in buying a quarter of an acre 15 miles from Dublin there should be set rules whereby he can build, even if there has to be freezing of acreage and so on.  People buy sites, and it can be frustrating to be unable to get planning permission.  These people may be only a small number, but it is irritating for people who are interested in building for themselves to be constantly delayed. The more young people we can get to provide houses for themselves the better.  It is better to encourage people to have a bit of initiative than that we should continue to rely on local authorities, the Department of Local Government and the Exchequer to provide houses for them.  I welcome what the Minister has said in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá súil agam go gcabhróidh an Bille seo chun tithe níos saoire a chur ar fáil agus caighdeán réasúnta a chur ar fáil agus níos mó tithe san iomlán a thógáil.  That is the aim.  I would encourage and support the Minister in this.  There has been a great deal of criticism of our housing situation from both sides of the House.  It is good that that is so.  We all know that the day we have not a housing problem we will be in trouble because that means there would not be people with jobs who needed houses.  It is to the credit of local authorities and of private enterprise that there is something of an increase in the number of houses being built over the past few years.  It is certainly not enough, and I would encourage the Minister to go all out to <Col N="1017" /> exceed even what he has in the Bill. There was criticism of the reduction in size of grant houses but I think that this has been answered by Senators on both sides of the House.  All I would say on that aspect of it would be that if the reduction in size is going to mean anything like an extra 1,000 houses, I am all for it.  Even if it only meant another extra 100 houses, I would favour it because the important thing to our community is that those who need houses and have worked hard should be provided with them or that they should, as I have been saying right along, be encouraged to tackle the job themselves.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill as far as it goes, and I welcome the Minister and encourage him in the very difficult work he has before him in solving the existing housing problem.</P>

      <P>I think the House realises that this housing shortage presents a very serious social problem. This problem should be tackled with imagination and with vigour, but I do not think that a very happy note was struck here by Senator Alexis FitzGerald when he referred to priorities. He did say that articulate groups were pressurising the Government to, as it were, advance their own case, and he said that there should be a slowing down in the allocation of support for housing authorities.  I do not think that that was a very happy expression.</P>

      <P>I think that both should move along together.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald would leave thousands living in misery in the slums while we were affording facilities for people in much better conditions.  I do not think that Senator Alexis FitzGerald's interruption is in keeping with the more lofty mood in which he spoke a few moments ago.  I am talking of several hundreds of thousands of people in this country who because of lack of education and lack of proper <Col N="1018" /> investment in education have been grossly suffering for years, when over a million of our people had to leave this country because of what some people term the irrelevancy of comparison made on the question of priorities as between housing and education.  I say that the problem of housing should be tackled parallel with the problem of education, and I do not think that this evening at this stage it should be suggested that one should get priority over the other.  To me they are both great social evils and miseries, when our people were forced to leave this country and are in slums without any housing in Birmingham, in Slough, and in Manchester because of under investment in education and because people were forced to leave the national schools at the age of fourteen or thirteen and a half.</P>

I think it has been taken on its merits and generally accepted to be a measure which will make a substantial contribution towards increasing the number of houses which can be constructed in the country.  I realise, indeed, that the debate has gone on quite long and many points have been mentioned. Indeed the debate seems to have ranged a little bit into a general discussion on housing and away from the actual detail of the Bill but in my concluding remarks I will endeavour to reply to some of the points that were raised.  Many of the other points will come up in the ordinary way on Committee stage if they require further explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, then, I should like, again, to emphasise that the main purpose in introducing this Bill is to enable more houses to be constructed than is possible under the present system, this is within the financial limits that exist, within the sums of money that are available at the present time for this purpose.  This must be remembered in considering this Bill, because it will enable the building of more houses.  The estimates that we have arrived at are that it will enable the building of a further 1,000 houses per year from the same financial pool. I myself, I think, should tell the House that whatever small experience all of us gather as public representatives there is one problem which exists in the country of which all public representatives are very conscious, and that is the need to provide houses for those who are in need of them, and we meet those people so often in our day to day travelling and meetings that we cannot but be very conscious of this great need in the community.  I am, <Col N="1020" /> like the others, very conscious of this need and of the great responsibilities that are on me as Minister in the Department largely responsible for the building of houses in the country.  I can only hope that whatever contribution I make while in this Department will be towards enabling more and more houses to be built and reducing the number of persons who are today homeless to a minimum figure, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>This Bill, then, sets out in the main to give more aid to persons who are providing houses of moderate size.  Because of the demand for houses today, this tremendous demand which is there all the time, and growing, it is imperative that we build more houses and equally imperative that with the scarcity of resources the help which we do give is given to those who are providing houses of a moderate size.  Many Senators during the course of the debate felt that this Bill would be encouraging the construction of houses which would be too small.  This is a very wrong interpretation of the effect that this Bill will have on the construction industry and the effect it will have on the size of houses to be built under this new system of grants. We must keep in mind that the average local authority house being built at the present time is 800 square feet. There is no doubt that these houses are of a very high standard.  There are no complaints being made about quality or standard or the size of these houses.  The one complaint which I hear very regularly is that there are not enough of these local authority houses of this particular size.</P>

      <P>That is right.  As I said in my introductory speech, there will be no restriction on the size of rooms.  The grant will be given on the overall size of houses.  This would give greater freedom to designers of houses and would not inhibit their designs by restricting them to certain sizes per room, because of the many new technological changes in the construction industry itself, and because of new ideas in design.  It is felt, and I think rightly and many Senators agreed with this, that we should give designers a free hand.  You have the open plan as one example of the type of design which is quite popular today in private built houses, and this I think is something which we should allow and encourage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We can deal with it then.  To get back to the point concerning the size of local authority houses and the lack of complaints in this regard, it is not true for anybody to say that we are encouraging the building of houses that are too small.  The Bill aims at encouraging the building of houses of a moderate size.  The State should not assist by way of grants and other financial aids, persons who can afford to build the larger types of houses which, as we all know, are in the luxury or semi-luxury bracket.  In any event, the grant would have very little significance in influencing these people in regard to the type of house they wish to build.  We have a moral duty to provide houses for people of modest means and any available finance must go towards helping this section of the community rather than to help those who are not in any great need of financial assistance to build the larger type houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made also to the high cost of land.  I shall refer to this again later on but I wish to make the point <Col N="1022" /> at this stage that because of the high cost of lands, builders are tending to build houses which are bigger and, consequently, dearer than the size of house which people are actually looking for.  Of course, this is done so that a higher price can be obtained for the house and, thereby, a higher profit. The proposals in the Bill will counteract this particular tendency.  We have already seen a reaction within the construction industry towards building houses of a more moderate size.</P>
    <P>The main need for houses today arises generally from the demand for houses from young married couples. These people do not want larger houses at an early stage in their married life because such a house would place a heavy burden on a young couple in repaying the loan, furnishing and so on.  One of the great effects of the Bill on the building of houses will be that it will meet the greatest demand at that level.</P>
    <P>Under the old system there was a grant for houses of more than the 1,249 square feet area.  It was deduced by some Senator who spoke today that by the introduction of the new scheme we would be denying State grants to about one-fifth of the persons who were building these larger houses and who would normally qualify.  Of course, that is not so because most people, when this new scheme is in operation, will comply with the smaller floor areas as laid down in this Bill to ensure that they will qualify for the higher grants provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned during the course of the debate was that of loan limits.  I should say that this was outside the scope of the Bill.  However, I will say that the attitude of the Department always has been that loan limits are kept under constant review and we are very conscious of the need to continue this practice because of increasing costs.  Despite that, I should like to inform the House that the increase in expenditure on loans from 1964 to 1965 has been from £3 million to £11 this year.  Therefore, whatever argument some Senators might make for a rise in loan limits to qualify more people for loans, the demand shows no falling off because of the present <Col N="1023" /> limits.  Indeed, demand has been growing very rapidly as indicated from these increased figures that I have given.</P>
    <P>Since 1968 then, the maximum loan and the amount of the State and supplementary grants have been increased by £400 per house.  This increase has been brought about through a £300 increase in the loan limit from £2,700 to £3,000 and a £100 increase &mdash;in some cases more&mdash;in the grants. It is not true to say, therefore, that these loans and grants have been stagnant.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should refer to another matter which some Senators do not seem to know about and that is that in assessing income for loan purposes, local authorities were circularised recently by the Department and told to exclude exceptional overtime when assessing income, especially excessive overtime that was earned in the years shortly before a young couple married because some times this extra money is earned as a result of an extra effort on the part of a couple to save money for their marriage.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the £60 valuation being an inadequate limit for farmers to qualify for certain benefits. I want to make the point that 90 per cent of our farmers have valuations of £60 or less, so I do not think that any great case could be made for the other 10 per cent being in need of greater assistance or greater facilities from the State as was stated by Senators who suggested that the £60 valuation limit should be increased to £75.  I cannot accept that at all.  I would also make the point that a farmer with a £60 or more valuation is capable of earning quite a substantial livelihood.</P>
    <P>It was stated that savings will not follow from the emphasis being placed on this more moderate sized house.  I cannot understand why that point was made.  Senator Boland made the point a few times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Savings on the finished house unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>An 800 square foot house is costing roughly £3,200 on average at the present time and a 1,000 square foot house, which would <Col N="1024" /> be an average private sized house, is costing £4,200.  It cannot be denied that much of the difference in price is due to the different size.  Private houses are now costing £4 or more per square foot.  If a house is reduced by 100 square feet in size, some saving must result.  It must be remembered that the many new changes taking place in design and in domestic equipment are bringing about a certain saving of space.  With the installation of central heating and the elimination of fireplaces a saving of up to 60 square feet can be made.</P>
      <P>A distinction must be made between grants and loans.  I was asked to consider having the same limits for grants and loans from local authorities.  It must be remembered that grants are a form of social welfare payment, whereas loans are a form of investment which do not cost local authorities anything because they are repaid with the interest due on them.  There is a definite distinction between those two facilities.</P>

      <P>Some Senators thought grants would inflate prices, whereas other Senators thought grants had not kept pace with inflation.  Builders will tell you that if the £275 or £325 are not coming from State grants it will have to come from somewhere else.  They have been adamant about this.  The Department have kept a very close eye on this matter over the years to ensure that grants and the large sums of money being paid out through grants were of the maximum assistance to the persons qualifying for them.  I have been given an assurance, which I accept in good faith, that if the grant was not provided the price of the house would be increased by the amount of the grant. Houses over 1,249 square feet will operate in a free market as there will <Col N="1025" /> not be any grants available for houses of that size.  The other point made about grants was that they had not kept pace with inflation.  In 1948-49 £.34 million was paid out in State and supplementary grants.  In 1970-71 an approximate estimate is that £5½ million will be paid in State and supplementary grants.  This is a substantial increase in the amount of money being paid in grants.  How did this come about if grants had not to some extent kept pace with inflation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants can now total £650.  In the case of farmers, grants can total £900 and in the Gaeltacht areas they can total £1,100.  To take the figure of £650 which is the maximum grant in most cases, it is more than twice what the grant was in 1949.</P>
      <P>Because of the large cost involved in increasing reconstruction grants, I think it would be better to see how these new grants will effect expenditure on grants and loans before making commitments to increase the reconstruction expenditure.  The whole thinking behind this Bill will affect the construction industry, the size of houses and grant applications in many ways. I would rather wait and see what real effect it has before deciding to increase reconstruction grants.  Our first priority is to increase the existing house stock. We do have an obligation to conserve the stock that exists.  Reconstruction grants have played a vital part in ensuring that the housing stock in the country was maintained at a good standard.  Indeed, it can be said that we were ahead of most European countries in introducing reconstruction grants.  This fact is never quoted when one is making comparisons with international statistics.  I accept the tremendous part that reconstruction grants have played and are playing.  I am disposed towards considering the need for an increase in those grants but I intend to wait and see what effect these new grants will have on grant and loan applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of land prices always comes up when one is discussing housing, <Col N="1026" /> and the seemingly ever-increasing price of housing.  What are we doing to try to keep down the price of houses? A number of things are being done and although they will make some contribution, I am not completely satisfied that everything that could be done is being done.  Large sewerage and water schemes are being processed to provide a surplus of serviced land and this will help to stabilise the price of land.  This is being done at the present time within financial limitations. Local authorities have engaged on a large scale on land acquisitions. As the House knows, they are empowered to do this under the 1966 Act.  A £150 subsidy per site is provided by local authorities to enable them to provide serviced sites for private house building.  In the Dublin area alone over £3 million over the last three years has been provided, and although that was the largest amount all major local authorities had large sums of money made available to them and large tracts of land have been purchased as a result.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record the effects the spending of that money has had.  The land in the hands of local authorities for housing on 31st December, 1967 was 13,616 sites and on the 31st March, 1970 it was 46,920 sites. If the sites which were being acquired at the 31st March, 1970 were added in, the figure would be just under 60,000.  This has had an obvious effect in stabilising prices and when local authorities are able to get the land into their own hands this will play a major part in pegging down land prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not correct. I have not the figures with me but every local authority has had authority to purchase land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A thousand acres was bought in Dublin one year.  How many sites would that provide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thousands of acres have been purchased because of the Government's policy being carried out <Col N="1027" /> by the Department of Local Government to provide special sums to enable them to purchase that land.</P>
      <P>The building of the more moderate sized house which this Bill will encourage will also make a contribution towards reducing land prices per house because there will be a consequent increase in density.</P>
      <P>The matter of international comparisons always crops up when housing is being discussed; comparisons are made between our country and countries in the EEC and also in other places throughout the world.  However, it is difficult to make valid comparisons in this matter because of the many factors involved.</P>
      <P>The point was made that we compare unfavourably with other European countries but this is not altogether true.  The main need for houses arises from the demand from newly married couples and in this country the number of married persons as a percentage of the population is lower than in most countries in Europe.</P>
      <P>Reconstruction grants have been available here for longer than in the European countries and they have played a major part in reducing the degree of obsolescence in housing.  It is generally recognised that houses in Ireland are, in the main, larger than in many of the European countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put this to the House.  Which is more beneficial for us&mdash;to have 15,000 houses with 6 bedrooms each or 30,000 houses with 2 bedrooms each?  I think we would opt for the former.</P>
      <P>There is much less overcrowding in Irish houses than in countries that are often regarded as models we should imitate, the number of persons per room being less than the European average.</P>
      <P>Some Senators sought extra subsidies but this is outside the scope of the Bill.  In passing, I should mention that if we use money for subsidies, less is available for building and the first priority is to build houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators referred to the part co-operatives <Col N="1028" /> were playing in the building of houses.  I have personal experience of this and I hope to be able to effect some improvement in the different processes the co-operatives have to go through before they get to the actual building.  I agree with the idea of encouraging people&mdash;especially skilled tradesmen&mdash;to come together and build their own houses.  They will, of course, qualify for all the grants and I shall be happy to do what I can to help such groups.  Perhaps we have not given sufficient attention to the role this kind of joint building effort can play and this is a matter that will have my attention.</P>
    <P>Credit unions are one of the most important institutions in the country. They play a major part in enabling people to save money to purchase their greatest asset, namely, their homes and I recommend the credit unions to all people, especially young couples who are interested in building their own homes.  I should be glad to see credit unions operating throughout the country.  Generally, I agree with the remarks made regarding co-operatives and credit unions and I hope to see their activities extended.</P>
    <P>Reference was made, particularly by Senators Honan and Flanagan, to the need for strict supervision in the construction of houses.  I am aware of the ease with which certain faults in construction can be covered up with a dash of plaster and I appreciate the necessity for more strict supervision.  I can assure the House that I intend to investigate this matter and I shall do what I can to ensure that houses of a satisfactory standard are provided in all cases. Perhaps it may not be fair to refer in a derogatory manner to one aspect because sometimes reflection is cast on the entire industry.  That is not the position in this instance but the need does exist for a more strict supervisory system of inspection of houses.</P>
    <P>The matter of package-deal house building&mdash;mainly in Dublin&mdash;was referred to, and Senator Belton spoke on this subject at some length.  This is an admirable arrangement between building societies and the assurance companies and it ensures that houses, which those agencies would have <Col N="1029" /> financed in any event, will be put on the market at a cheaper price than in the normal way.  As the arrangement was made with the local authority, it means that the purchaser has the benefit of bulk-buying and, consequently, a cheaper house.  This arrangement also is of assistance to those with lower incomes who possibly might have been priced out of the market.  Where it is feasible I would recommend this course to other local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have not referred to all the points raised but in view of the late hour, perhaps, Senators will not hold that against me.  When I came into the Department this Bill was already there: I was happy with it and I have already commended it to the Seanad.  I now wish to make some personal observations on the housing situation generally and what further measures could be taken to improve it.</P>
    <P>I have already initiated special investigations into the different types of system-building and the various kinds of prefabricated construction to see if there is some method whereby we could build houses at a lesser cost. There is a demand for houses that it is essential we meet and, consequently, if cheaper methods of construction are available we will be in a position to build more houses.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the price of land.  This is a matter that requires investigation.  I am aware of the speculation that has gone on in the buying and selling of land for building which has been serviced by the local authority and, consequently, has increased substantially in value.  Large profits were made by persons who made no contribution whatever to the services which brought about the increase in the valuation.  There is room for tightening-up here and I want to mention to the House that I consider it is worthy of investigation.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that in the past number of years there has been a very rapid increase in the output in the construction industry but that, unfortunately, in the bigger towns and cities, where the main housing demands exist, much of this has been in office block accommodation.  The Local Government Temporary Reduction of Valuation <Col N="1030" /> Bill, 1970 will phase out the remission to people who build office blocks and should help the situation. The withdrawing of that concession may encourage people to invest their money in the construction of flats for renting.  I hope to study this and to see what I can do to encourage private investors to invest more money in the construction of flats rather than office blocks.  In some countries where planning permission is granted there is an obligation on a developer, where he is constructing industrial-type buildings, to build dwellings also.  People should think more about this point.  There is great need to provide jobs in this country.  Anybody with any practical experience knows that jobs and housing go hand in hand.  Building the factory without building the homes for the people who work in it is only doing half the job.  There must be some co-operation between the people establishing the large industrial concerns and the house builders.  The factory builders must be obliged to make some contribution towards the provision of dwellings as well.</P>
    <P>I am keen to ensure that adequate recreational amenities are provided where large housing schemes are erected.  I intend to examine whether it would be feasible to include, in permissions for large housing schemes, a condition which would make it obligatory on the developers to include proper recreational facilities.  I would go as far as to ask them to build a swimming pool with each large scheme of houses.  There are also many other amenities which are essential and which are often left out.  We know the difficulties which this creates.  The State is making a great contribution to housing but I believe that a greater part can be played by the private sector of the community than it is playing at the moment.  I have in mind the building societies and insurance companies which are at the moment investing in the building of houses.  We could introduce some incentive to encourage people to invest more money with the building societies.  I am examining how we could give more incentives to the building societies themselves to ensure that all the money which was invested with them would <Col N="1031" /> go into the building of houses.  These things can be done by tax incentives and in other ways.  I thank the House for the reception which they gave the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Committee Stage will be taken tomorrow.  I know there are some amendments which have been put down, some of which I have not seen yet.  What I have heard in the debate has been very interesting for me, being new in this position.  Senators made <Col N="1032" /> useful contributions and I feel I can look forward to continuing co-operation from all Senators in the House. Collectively we can make a substantial contribution towards improving the housing situation in the country. We can work together to improve the standard of living for all our people.</P>
