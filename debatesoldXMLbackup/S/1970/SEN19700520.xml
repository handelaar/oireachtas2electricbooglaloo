      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Cathaoirleach in a position to say if this House will be given an opportunity to discuss these communications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get your guidance.  This is the first notification given to this House of changes in the Government and it seems to me that at some stage it would be desirable that this House should be given an opportunity of discussing not simply the changes, which concern the Dáil rather than this House in so far as the approval is obtained in the Dáil rather than in this House, but it seems that this House should be given an opportunity of discussing the events which brought these changes about and which have so badly shaken the people of the country.  It is important that we, as a House of the Oireachtas, should have the right to discuss these matters.  Perhaps the Leader of the House would give some intimation if it is intended to give the Seanad an opportunity of engaging in a discussion.  If he cannot give such an intimation, I would ask you, Sir, to examine the situation to see whether, arising out of these communications, it is possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate that the communications are read merely for the information of the House and that no discussion or business arising out of them comes at this time before the House.  Whether the House subsequently decides to discuss any matter is not a matter for the Chair but for the House to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Senators are more experienced than me in this field but, in some shape or form, these communications will be brought before the House.  I should like to have an opportunity of moving that the communications be noted for the purpose of initiating a discussion on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, open to the Senator to put down a motion in relation to the communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first indication, or intimation, that has been given officially to the Seanad that these changes are being made.  If necessary, I am prepared at short notice to move now that the communications be noted and that I am prepared to speak on that motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing specifically in Standing Orders in relation to such a discussion.  These communications are merely for information <Col N="87" /> and nothing arises out of them.  If the Senator wishes to put down a motion, that is another matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the announcement does not appear on the Order of Business today it would seem to me that Senator O'Higgins would be quite in order in proposing a motion now, which similarly is not on the Order of Business, that these announcements be noted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this context I wish to draw your attention to Standing Order 26 (1) and to ask your permission to introduce a motion, without notice, that the Seanad be adjourned in order to discuss the following definite matter of urgent public importance, that is, the implications for the country of what the Taoiseach has described as &ldquo;a matter of national importance,&rdquo; involving the dismissal of two members of the Government and the impact of these events on our relationship with Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>When making your ruling on this, as you must do, I respectfully ask you to bear in mind that this matter has not in any way ceased to be urgent since it was debated at such length in the Dáil.  There are some other people in this House who believe that it has become even more urgent since then. Indeed, as a discussion is going to take place in Stormont today on the debate in the Dáil I suggest that gives it an even greater sense of urgency.  If we are not given an opportunity to discuss this matter today I submit a precedent will have been established which bodes very ill for institutional democracy in this House and in this country in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for having given me as is the custom of the House prior notice of his intention to request to move the adjournment of the Seanad on a definite matter of urgent public importance. I have considered this matter <Col N="88" /> carefully but I must rule in accordance with the precedent that the motion is not one contemplated by the Standing Order.  This ruling is, of course, without prejudice to the right of the Senator or indeed any Senator to give notice of a motion in the usual way.</P>
      <P>I should explain to the Senator that the matter which it is desired to raise under this Standing Order must be some sudden emergency as to be seen to be <i>prima facie</i> urgent and it must be of such a nature that a delay in discussing it might prevent effective action being taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Are Senators debarred by Standing Orders from discussing the import of the message the Chair has just read out until a subsequent day?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The message is purely for the information of the House and does not give rise to any discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Chair's ruling that this is not a matter of national importance as described by the Taoiseach? If the point that Senator Horgan has made that the situation between the north and south is deteriorating, it may very well be that not to discuss it might prevent effective action being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The urgency insisted on under the Standing Order must be such that, unless it is discussed without any notice being given, the delay in discussing it that would ensue by having to give notice in the usual way would prevent effective action being taken.  I am ruling only that this is not that type of motion, not that it is not a matter of national importance.  It is simply a matter that under Standing Orders it is not the type of emergency which would mean that something irretrievable would happen if it were not discussed today. It is open to any Senator to put down a motion.</P>

      <P>Surely the fact that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson, has called a general election in Great Britain and Northern Ireland has a significant bearing on whether it is of national importance or not?

      <P>The Leader of the House has told us on previous occasions that we were unable to take motions because of the acute shortage of Ministers but now that we have a full Cabinet I feel it is a gross injustice to this House not to allow Senators to debate these motions.  The button is in the hands of the Leader of the House but he is very unwilling to press it and give the House the opportunity it wants to play a responsible role by discussing these matters.  Can the Leader of the House give us any indication when the motion passed by this House, that on days when the Government had business before the House motions could be taken, will become operative?</P>

      <P>Senator Bourke is new to this House.  She does not understand the difficulties which older hands would appreciate.  I am the most generous man in regard to pressing the button to try and get Ministers here so that motions can be discussed.  Many Senators on the other side of the House realise the technical difficulties which can arise.  There are technical difficulties today and tomorrow in regard to that matter.  In particular there is a motion which in my opinion takes precedence.  That is motion No. 8. We hoped to have that discussed today, or before today.  The Budget debate is not finished.  That precludes the discussion on the motion.  I have arranged for it to be taken next week. The same thing applies to the other motions on the Order Paper.  The Seanad can be assured that there is no lack of goodwill or of effort on my part to have these motions discussed and to have arrangements made for Ministers to attend to discuss them.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the House has mentioned one of the motions.  Many of the motions have been down on the Order Paper since September.  Various Ministers are involved. If there was real goodwill, some of the Ministers would be available to come to this House of the Oireachtas so that we could fulfil a responsible role as one of the Houses of Parliament and debate these matters in the national interest.  Could I get assurance that this is the last time the matters will be postponed?  We at least know that next week a motion will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purposes of the Bill are&mdash;firstly to increase the limit of authorised capital expenditure by the ESB for general purposes and, secondly, to provide for certain amendments in the superannuation code of the ESB employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> Under existing legislation the board are entitled to incur capital expenditure for general purposes, that is to say, for all purposes other than the electrification of rural areas, up to a limit of £225 million.  While actual expenditure up to 31st March, 1970, amounted to about £187 million, the board, of course, must enter into commitments for substantial expenditure some years ahead.  The House will appreciate that, in general, it takes five years from planning stage to commissioning stage for generating stations. Therefore, at any given time, the board are committed to expenditure on generating plant up to five years ahead. Capital for transmission and other expenditure does not have to be planned quite so far ahead.  I propose in this Bill to increase the limit to £290 million.</P>
    <P>The board's total installed generating capacity at present amounts to about 1,410 megawatts.  They expect to commission 706 megawatts of additional capacity, half of which will be oil fired, to meet the demand up to 1974-75.  This additional capacity includes a 40 megawatt extension to the milled peat fired station at Shannonbridge, County Offaly.  This will absorb the production of the last major bog suitable for harvesting by Bord na Móna's advanced methods.</P>
    <P>The additional capacity also includes the 280 megawatt pumped storage scheme at Turlough Hill, County Wicklow.  A pumped storage project depends on the utilisation of relatively cheap electrical energy available from thermal generating stations to pump water during the night from a low level reservoir to a high level reservoir. This water is utilised the following day to produce peak load energy and in this way the station acts as a storage centre for electricity.</P>
    <P>While the scheme has received a certain amount of publicity, the House may not be fully aware of the magnitude of the work being carried out. The scheme, which qualified for a loan of about £6 million from the World Bank, and which will cost over £12 million, was largely designed by the board's own engineers and is regarded as being unique in civil engineering <Col N="93" /> projects in Ireland.  Turlough Hill will be the sixth station of its kind in Europe and only two others in the world are technically more complex, in terms of the height and quantity of water used.</P>
    <P>I think the board have perhaps tended to be unduly modest with regard to the Turlough Hill project. They have every reason to be very proud of this development.  Senators should take the opportunity to see the scheme for themselves, as I did, and I have no doubt that the board would be delighted to show them around.</P>
    <P>When the Turlough Hill area was first proposed as a location for the project, there was considerable disquiet about the dangers to the amenities of this beautiful part of the country.  It is, therefore, necessary to point out that the board have so designed the scheme that virtually nothing will be visible from the road.  On their own initiative, the ESB engaged a most eminent landscape architect to advise on the problems associated with the project and, despite a number of public statements to the contrary, they have closely followed the recommendations made and have every intention of doing so in the future, if at all practicable.</P>
    <P>Controversy at present surrounds the proposed routes of the transmission lines from the scheme.  I do not propose to add fuel to this controversy except to point out that the decisions in this case will be for the appropriate planning authorities, from whom the ESB have sought planning permission, and that interested parties can lodge any objections they may have with the appropriate planning authority.</P>
    <P>Also included in the additional capacity being provided in the next few years&mdash;and another innovation as far as the ESB are concerned&mdash;are two 13 megawatt gas turbine units at Pigeon House.  These small sets can be started independently of outside electricity supply and would reduce the time required to restore supply to the Dublin area in the event of the main Dublin stations being temporarily out of action.  They can also be utilised for peak load, thus avoiding the <Col N="94" /> necessity for installing large uneconomic units&mdash;&ldquo;peak lopping&rdquo; as it is called.</P>
    <P>The question of erecting nuclear stations has been posed from time to time both in the Press and here in the House and I take this opportunity to explain the position.  The competition posed by nuclear power generation for conventional thermal stations has led to rapid and substantial improvement in the technology of thermal generation in new, larger, higher temperature units, giving greater efficiency and hence lower cost.  In our circumstances, it is necessary to bear in mind the size of station suitable to Irish conditions. The more competitive nuclear stations erected abroad have so far all been of very large capacity, approaching our total installed capacity.  There is a problem in accommodating large generating units on the ESB system because of the base load running which they require, and the risk involved in overdependence on single units.  However, the continuing growth in demand for electricity in Ireland is making it possible to use larger and larger units so that the time when nuclear generation may become viable is moving closer.  In addition, producers of nuclear generators are now tending to give more consideration to the production of competitive medium and smaller sized units.</P>
    <P>Apart from pure economics, we are becoming to a greater extent each year dependent on oil, and generation from native sources of energy, already practically fully developed, now represents an ever decreasing percentage of output. Diversion into nuclear generation would be a safeguard on security grounds.  It is in the national interest to lessen our dependence on any one energy source.</P>
    <P>The ESB have already arranged for the training of some of their engineers in nuclear technology and are continuing to study the overall situation.  Ireland may well have its first nuclear power station before the end of the seventies.</P>
    <P>The demand for electricity continues to grow at a remarkable rate.  The rate of increase over the past four years was as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>By way of comparison, the increase in demand in European member countries of OECD has averaged between 5 per cent and 6 per cent in recent years; further comparisons show that, in the five-year period ended March, 1968, the average annual increase in electricity consumption per inhabitant was 11 per cent in Ireland, 5.1 per cent in the UK, 6.1 per cent in France, and 7.6 per cent in Italy.  The growth in demand here is, of course, a sign of economic strength and an indicator of the improving living standards of our people.  Our economic growth is conversely to a great extent dependent on our continuing to invest increasing amounts of public capital in the provision of electricity to meet the increased demands.</P>
    <P>The board had been estimating future demand for electricity on a 9 per cent compound growth basis but they are now raising this estimate to 10 per cent.  Estimating increases in demand for electricity up to five years ahead is a hazardous and onerous job. There is the danger, on the one hand, of overestimation in which case the unused generating capacity would bring serious losses and, on the other hand, the danger of underestimation, resulting in load shedding because of inability to maintain supplies.  Future demand is affected by the course of general economic progress in the country in the period concerned.  The ESB, I might say, employ the most modern techniques of forecasting and they are aware of the latest developments internationally in the determination of more precise statistical standards for the peak load security level.</P>
    <P>To meet the expected growth in the years after 1974-75, the board expect, during the next two years, to approve the construction of up to 500 megawatts of further generating capacity estimated to cost about £25m.  A further £5m. expenditure in respect of generating capacity being provided up to 1974-75 will also arise during the next two years.  Finally, improvements <Col N="96" /> to the transmission and distribution networks and other works costing about £35m., are expected to arise for approval by mid-1972.  These sums total £65 million which is the amount of increased capital expenditure being authorised by the Bill. Further amending legislation will then be required, giving the House another opportunity to debate, in a general way, the affairs of the board.</P>
    <P>The enormous new investments now necessary to keep pace with the sustained and continuing growth in demand involve a serious financial problem.  During the next seven or eight years the board will have to provide as much capacity again as has been provided up to now.  Their capital expenditure is now running at over £20m. a year.  Having regard to the amount of capital left available after meeting the other competing demands for capital in the Irish market, the board can no longer attract their full requirements by the traditional long term loans, as in the past. The board have, therefore, to resort to foreign borrowing and credit financing which involves high interest rates and repayment in a shorter term.  This involves higher revenue charges and greater reliance on internal financing. To maintain their credit abroad, the board will have to continue to demonstrate to lenders that their revenues are buoyant and sufficient to meet loan repayments within the life period of the loans.  As indicated in last year's ESB report, this is one factor leading to increased prices.  As long as the present general financial position persists, I cannot rule out the likelihood that further price increases may be unavoidable.</P>
    <P>I might say that the board's charges, taking into account the increase which came into effect in January, still compare favourably with most West European tariffs for domestic consumers. In regard to industrial consumers, there is, admittedly, cheaper power for big industrial users in Norway, Sweden and Switzerland where adequate supplies of cheap hydro-power are available. French, British and Dutch tariffs for big industries give about the same order of costs to the user as those of the ESB.  I am sure the House will <Col N="97" /> agree that it is a major challenge to the ESB to maintain electricity prices here at attractive levels.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in recommending the increase in the board's limit on capital expenditure to the House.  It is a warranty, a clear evidence of progress being made and of confidence in our prospects for the future.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Bill deals with certain improvements in the pension schemes for ESB employees.  The first manual workers' pension scheme which came into operation in 1943 provided a maximum fixed pension of £3 a week and a retirement benefit of £200.  Over the years the pension rates have been increased from time to time but it became obvious that a scheme based on fixed amounts was no longer appropriate.  Substantial improvements in the pension entitlements of manual workers have recently been negotiated between the board, the workers, and the unions.  The principal improvement is that a worker with full service can now get a pension of half his retiring pay, together with a retirement benefit equal to one year's wages.  In the event of his death before reaching his seventieth birthday, then his dependants will continue to be paid his pension until the deceased's seventieth birthday.  Alternately a worker may, before retirement, exercise an option to accept a reduced pension and thereby provide his wife or other dependant with a pension for life should she survive him.  Death benefits payable under the scheme have also been improved.  The worker's contribution rate under the new scheme is 5 per cent and there is an equal contribution by the ESB.</P>
    <P>Many ESB workers serve in a temporary capacity for some years before they are appointed to permanent and pensionable posts with the board and admitted to membership of the pension scheme.  The purpose of section 3 of the Bill is to enable such workers to reckon for pension purposes one half of any such service.</P>
    <P>The manual workers who are in the board's service on 1st April, 1943 get only their previous service free.  Those who were not over 40 years of age on the date the 1942 Act was passed <Col N="98" /> got a special award which is enshrined in section 7 of the 1942 Act.  These employees got this special award for the obvious reason that they were then too old to earn a normal pension and because of their long service to the board during a period when there was no provision for superannuation.  The under forties age group at that time have been seeking a similar concession and in section 5 of the Bill a special scheme is provided for them on the general lines of that far the over forties age group but on the condition that they make a small contribution towards purchase of prior service before retirement.  Section 4 will give a similar concession to the manual employees recruited since 1943, that is, they will be enabled, in return for a limited contribution to be paid before retirement, to get an award from the board sufficient to make good full benefit for their total years service to the board.  This preserves the principle of mutual financing of the superannuation scheme while at the same time requiring only the absolute minimum contribution from the worker.</P>
    <P>The new benefits represent a considerable advance on those which applied formerly and the new scheme which was initiated by the board, is, in my opinion, a practical demonstration of their concern for their staff. I am confident that the new scheme will provide a valuable contribution towards the growing improvement in staff relations which the board are so anxious to foster.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed in the Bill are in line with improvements in pension benefits elsewhere in the public service and I am therefore recommending the amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to assure the Minister that, as far as Fine Gael are concerned, we will give him every co-operation in getting this Bill through the House. As the Minister has said, the ESB must raise their target for capital expenditure to a figure of £290 million.  This is an indication of the expansion of the economy and the general rise in the standard of living in the country.  It is also a great tribute to the ESB and, <Col N="99" /> in particular, to the engineering staffs that the board have succeeded in maintaining a service that is in line with the expanding economy.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill, as the Minister has pointed out, is to increase the limit of capital expenditure to a total of £290 million and to make certain improvements in the pension schemes for the board's employees.  As the Minister has rightly said, it is obviously necessary that the ESB should be aware that they must have adequate capital to finance projects as long as five years in advance.  Even to those of us who are non-technical laymen it is understandable that, in planning a project such as that being carried out at Turlough Hill, a period of at least five years would be necessary between the date of planning and the date on which the new station goes into operation.</P>
      <P>In these times of difficult credit situations it is wise to ensure that the board have ample opportunity for planning in so far as adequate capital is made available.  The present generating capacity is in the region of 1,410 megawatts and the board propose to commission 706 megawatts of additional capacity, half of which will be oil-fired, to meet the demand up to 1974-75.  As the Minister has said, these plans include the Turlough Hill project which will provide an additional 280 megawatts while there are two 13 megawatt gas units at the Pigeon House.  The additional capacity, we are told, includes a 40 megawatt extension to the milled peat fired station at Shannonbridge, County Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that this project at Shannonbridge will absorb the last major bog area suitable for harvesting by Bord na Móna's advanced techniques.  In many ways, this is a milestone in the history of the ESB.  We should not let the occasion pass without referring to the magnificent work that has been done by the two co-operating bodies, the ESB and Bord na Móna, in developing our peat resources to the maximum.  It will mean, of course, that the proportion of power generated from native resources will continue to decrease.  In fact, I <Col N="100" /> notice from the ESB's most recent available report that native resources now contribute only about 50 per cent of the total generated.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister refer, as I am sure other Members of the House were also, to the consideration shown by the ESB in landscaping the Turlough Hill project.  This has been done without any disfigurement to the area.  I would suggest that the ESB might turn their aesthetic consideration to other and perhaps more mundane matters, such as the type of poles which they erect, particularly in the urban areas.  Generally speaking, they are ugly affairs which disfigure large and small urban areas.  I would like to suggest to the Minister, and through him to the Electricity Supply Board, that some consideration should be given to providing wherever practicable, in conjunction with the local authorities, underground cables as an alternative to those ugly overhead cables which, as I said, disfigure most of our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his address touched on the various sources of energy, some of which are now coming to an end while new ones are opening up.  I should like to ask him, and I would be grateful if he would advert to it in his reply, what the opportunities are of harnessing any further generation from water sources, and in particular has any consideration been given to harnessing tidal waters to provide sources of power?  I know this has been done on the Continent and elsewhere and I believe it was considered by the ESB board some years ago.  I do not know what the outcome of their consideration was but I imagine that, with the advance in technical engineering skills, this project should be looked at once again as a practical means of generating additional power from native sources.</P>
    <P>Oil now occupies a very substantial proportion of the sources from which electricity is generated.  Here I find a possible danger in the stoppage or disruption of supplies of oil to this country.  There is a further consideration, that very few ports in this country are capable of taking the very large tankers now in operation, being built <Col N="101" /> or planned in the years ahead.  In fact, there is only one port in the country which can take the type of vessels which are now becoming more common in the carrying of oil across the world.  I refer, of course, to the Shannon Estuary.  It is becoming very obvious as time goes on that more consideration will have to be given by the Government to the development of the Shannon Estuary as a location for heavy bulk cargoes, including oil.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable over the years that, while we have had various platforms and assemblies talking about the lack of co-ordinating regional planning, particularly in the west and south-west of Ireland, very little has been done to put this type of planning into effect.  I suggest to the Minister and to the Government that before any further expansion of the generating capacity of the ESB with oil as its basis is considered, a regional examination of the Shannon area should be carried out to ensure that this area, with one of the finest waterways in Europe, will be developed to the full and utilised as a major centre for a large industrial complex including undertakings such as a further oil refinery&mdash;not by any means an impossibility in the years ahead&mdash; an ore smelter, a steel works, chemical works and similar major industrial undertakings.  In a few years time when some of those major undertakings are located in different areas we will regret the fact that some basic planning was not carried out to ensure that they were located in a centre where industrial development on a major scale is urgently needed.  I should like the Minister and the Government generally to consider the absolute disregard of major industrial development on a giant scale contiguous to the one great waterway we have in these islands.</P>
    <P>It is opportune, as we talk about the various sources from which power can be generated, to mark the fact that this year Ardnacrusha, the first generating station, is 43 or 44 years in existence.  I am sure everybody in this House will agree, irrespective of political or other considerations, that it is in a very real sense a living monument to two men of outstanding ability and foresight, Paddy McGilligan <Col N="102" /> and Tommy McLoughlin.  I believe I am correct in saying that it is today far and away the cheapest generator of electricity in the country.  If proper planning for the future is to include the development of the Shannon Estuary area the generating station at Ardnacrusha could if necessary be taken out of the national grid and employed to provide the cheapest current to some major projects in the Shannon area.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in the Dáil the fact that the turf generating stations in the strict financial sense are now uneconomic and that the question, if it has not already arisen, will surely arise in the near future as to whether we should go on literally subsidising these turf generating stations notwithstanding the fact that they are adding to the cost of producing electricity. Unless there are very severe reasons for closing down any of those turf generating stations, the factors in their favour, such as giving good employment in rural areas and the saving of imports of oil with a consequent benefit to our very shaky balance of payments situation, should be taken into consideration before any question of closing them down or restricting them should arise.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to know what the position of the turf burning station will be when we enter the European Economic Community.  I am sure this is a matter which is under study by the ESB at the present time.  Indeed, the whole question of the impact of the Common Market on the production of electricity in this country must arise. One of the essential requisites to efficient and low-cost production is power, particularly electrical power, and I am sure the ESB board are very conscious of the fact that, if our major industries are to be competitive in this large market of 200 million people, they will obviously have to get their power at the lowest possible cost in competition with the giant industries on the Continent.  I wonder if in these circumstances we will be in a position to compete on no less favourable terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the question of nuclear power, and offered the opinion that it is likely before the end of this decade that the first nuclear <Col N="103" /> power station would be installed in this country.  This is very good and encouraging news, but I hope that instead of looking ahead to the end of the 1970s the board are looking much closer at this matter, because it would be not only, as the Minister said, for strategic reasons but also on the ground of economy and from the point of view of reducing imports of oil as a means of generating electricity&mdash;if for no other reason than that I think that the early installation of a nuclear power unit would be of tremendous benefit to this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rightly said that up to quite recently the question of installing a nuclear power unit in this country was obviously out of the question, due not so much to the cost of the unit but to the fact that they were far too big for our relatively modest requirements, but expansion in the industrial and domestic demands for electricity has now brought this nuclear power unit well within the limits of possibility, and if we are going to increase our usage at the estimated rate of 10 per cent per year this is obviously going to be a practical proposition, I would say, within the next few years.  It might be very desirable if the commissioning of our first nuclear power station were to coincide with the entry of this country into the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it comes within the compass of the ESB's responsibilities, but no reference that I could see was made in either the Minister's address or in any of the addresses by the various Deputies who spoke on the matter in the Dáil to the questions of natural gas.  What effect would a substantial find of natural gas off the shores of this country have on the future plans of the ESB and generally in regard to the question of supplies of motive power in this country?  This is a matter that obviously must have been entertained by the board of the ESB and I would like&mdash;and I am sure that the House would be interested&mdash;to learn what effects, if any, this would be likely to have on the future plans for expansion by the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> The Minister has pointed out&mdash;and, again, it is indicative of the expansion of the economy and the rising standard of living in this country&mdash;the increasing demands over the past four years.  It is really striking, to say the least of it, that we in this small country have recorded over the past ten years something like a 10 per cent increase annually in the demand, as against a figure for the OECD countries of approximately half that rate of demand. This is a great tribute to all concerned for the advancing economic conditions in the country and an indication, as I have said already, of the rising standard of living of our people. The fact that the board are optimistic enough to predict a continuance of this rate of demand of 10 per cent annually should give us all encouragement for the future.</P>
    <P>One important aspect which the Minister has dealt with, and in fact with which this Bill is largely concerned, is the question of finance.  It is interesting to note that over the past decade the ceiling of capital expenditure by the board has increased more than threefold that is, from £100 million in 1960 to very nearly £300 million which is proposed in this Bill before the House&mdash;again a remarkable tribute to the expansion of the ESB activities.  I should like to question whether the increase to £290 million is sufficient.  I am a great believer that both Houses of the Oireachtas should continue to be watch dogs in regard to massive capital expenditure by public utilities and public services, but we have no reason to regret over the past years the actions of the ESB on their capital commitments.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that the cost of living index is rising, or has been for the past couple of years rising, at approximately the same rate as the demand for electricity, and inflation is continuing, I am sorry to say, at an ever higher rate, will the increased figure of £65 million which the board estimate be sufficient to cover their capital requirements over the next five years?  I very much question whether it is.  Now is the time for the Minister and the Government to have another look at this question of the provision of capital to the ESB, because <Col N="105" /> it is so important for our whole future economic progress, and to cavil at giving at this stage an extra £10 million, £15 million or £20 million would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>I do not know when these estimates were prepared.  It may have been in the last few months, or it may have been 12 months ago.  There is a reference in the accounts to the 31st March, 1969, but that is now over 12 months ago, and in the past 12 months the cost of everything to do with steel or engineering or building construction advanced, as we are only too well aware, very significantly.  I should like the Minister to reassure the House that the higher costs engendered by the inflation going on&mdash;I must admit not only here but all over the world&mdash; have not put the ESB estimates now very much out of line, because if they have the Minister can be assured that this House and, I am certain, the Dáil, would be fully co-operative in increasing that £290 million if necessary by a substantial amount.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech and in the ESB report they mentioned that the capital expenditure is now running at the rate of £20 million per annum, which is a huge figure and a figure for which this country has got very excellent value.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the sources of finance open to the ESB.  Here I think is cause for very grave concern. The last report of the ESB highlights the fact that the board are finding it ever more difficult to secure their financial requirements from home sources, and the Minister has been frank enough to admit that the ESB must compete with other major services for the supply of capital available on the Irish market.  Finally, of course, we have the amount of capital which will be required by the private sector and which I hope will not be reduced to any further significant extent by the Government's plans.  Foreign capital, of course, can be secured, but it is both dearer and shorter in terms of borrowing, and, as the Minister has said and as the chairman of the ESB emphasised in his report, dearer and shorter term borrowing must be reflected in higher costs of electricity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> It seems to me that in this context of ESB financial requirements, the time is opportune for the Government to have another close look at priorities in regard to capital requirements in this country in the years ahead.  I do not want to be taken as suggesting that there should be any curtailment of the subsidies, grants or inducements available to industrialists both inside or outside the country, but it may well be, at this time of dear money&mdash;and it is likely to persist for a few years to come&mdash;that the question of which comes first, basic public utilities such as the ESB or manufacturers, requires careful consideration in the matter of encouragements and inducements.  If most of us were asked to decide whether the ESB or some industrialist should get encouragement we would all plump for the ESB because electricity at competitive prices is one of the major inducements to any industrialist proposing to set up in any country.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that in the years ahead we will have adequate supplies of power available at competitive prices.  The question of estimating their financial requirements in the years ahead poses a major problem for the ESB, as any businessman who has had experience of the employment of capital will appreciate. If they underestimate they will be short of power and they will have to go in for load shedding and other unpleasant activities which could lead to disruption of industry and consequently of employment; if they overestimate they will be left with large capital projects to be paid for at high interest rates.  Obviously, therefore, they have a very difficult financial as well as technical problem on their hands.  Up to now they have handled these problems with the greatest expertise.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister when replying to make some reference, however limited, to the possibilities of cross-Border co-operation in the future expansion of electricity.  It appears to me one obvious field for the acquisition of the proposed nuclear unit.  I do not know the economics of acquiring a nuclear unit but I suggest that the larger the nuclear unit one can get the <Col N="107" /> more economic it will be.  Therefore, if we can combine with the Government in the North of Ireland to purchase a larger unit than the one that would be normally required to meet our needs in this part of the country, not only might it be good economic policy for both Governments but it could also be a major contribution to better goodwill and co-operation between the two Governments.  Wherever the opportunity arises for co-operation on economic and other grounds, we should be prepared to take the initiative in bringing it about.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say very much on the pensions scheme.  The changes which the Minister proposes are both reasonable and timely.  I was glad to note from reading the debates in the Dáil that the Minister accepted an amendment to delete the two-year waiting period in regard to qualification for payment of pension.  I should like him to clarify the section of his statement in which he referred to an employee getting half his retiring pay. Is it half his pay in the year in which he retires or is it half of the aggregated pay over the years preceding his retirement?</P>
    <P>One disturbing factor, not in the Minister's speech but in the report of the ESB chairman, is the reference to the disruption caused by industrial strife in that year.  The ESB now have an outstanding opportunity to lead the way not only in respect of the State services but also set an example to private industry and business in their relations with their employees; and recent developments in the ESB at board level have been an indication that the board are very much alive to this necessary development in this day and age.  We talk a lot about industrial democracy and worker participation, but a practical gesture by the ESB and other State companies would do far more to ensure peace among the workers in various State industries than all the speeches made by Ministers, Deputies and Senators in years.</P>

Again I should like to convey my assurance to the Minister that Fine Gael will give him full co-operation in getting the Bill through the House.  I shall be grateful if he considers the points I have made.  I am sure this House joins with speakers in the Dáil in paying tribute to the ESB, right down the line from board members to the humblest workers&mdash; I believe there are 10,000 of them&mdash; for the magnificent job they have been doing down the years under different Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the last speaker, I was very impressed by the statement made by the Minister on the history of what the ESB have been doing and on their projects for the future.  One was inclined to be carried to the stratosphere in hearing talk of hundreds of millions of pounds involved in so many projected schemes.  Having listened to those figures it is difficult to get back to ordinary mundane matters.  While all this serious planning is going on for the future, plus the difficulties of raising capital, plus the other matters which have been explained in detail, I have been trying to consider the smaller problems that affect the ESB. Senator Russell suggested that the ESB might be able to make known to intending industrialists the necessity to have cheap electricity.  We must attract industrialists to the country if we want to give effect to the hopes everybody here has for increased industrial activity and the creation of more jobs and goods for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give an example of an important factory which was built recently in Clonmel.  Last September an application was made to the ESB to provide power for this factory.  First of all the board said they would not supply electricity to the factory but later, after pressure had been put on them, they relented and said electricity could be supplied in six months time. The owners of the factory were then informed that as they wanted electricity <Col N="109" /> for industrial purposes they would be required to make a down payment of £8,000 before the board could contemplate supplying electricity, and once this down payment was made a further six months would elapse before the power was provided. They wrote to the owners of the factory telling them that their most eminent engineers were struggling with the problem of how to provide electricity for this comparatively small factory in Clonmel.  Subsequently I read that the ESB have sent some of their engineers abroad in order to bring them up to date in nuclear power stations.  I think they must be trying to stretch everyone's imagination.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what part the ESB are playing and what part they intend to play in the future because the express desire of all our economists is that we must set up industries in places where farming opportunities will decline. How can any industrialist think of setting up a factory in a declining area when the ESB will tell them that there is no power in the area and they have no intention of bringing power into the area unless an enormous down payment is made.  This policy is acting as a deterrent to those who want to see industries set up in the west which will provide employment for those who may eventually become unemployed on the land.  There does not appear to be any liaison between the ESB and those who are interested in setting up new industries.</P>
    <P>While I admire what the ESB have done in the past, it must be remembered that the past is behind us; there are new challenges ahead and the ESB must be prepared to play their part in these new developments.  The ESB are more concerned with providing millions of pounds to build up big industrial complexes than with providing electricity in outlying districts.  In the Clonmel case one would think this factory was the only factory in the town but in fact there are a considerable number of important industries there.  This new factory has been completed and it is the nearest thing I can imagine to the old song, &ldquo;The Pub with no Beer&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all the <Col N="110" /> Members of the House welcome this Bill which allows the ESB firstly to expand their power of capital expenditure and secondly to make some long overdue amendments to the superannuation code.  In regard to capital investment decisions the record of the board has been a good one.  Mention has already been made of the problem involved in such decisions: both the danger of overcapitalising, with consequent unnecessary costs or costs coming unnecessarily early, and, on the other hand, of under capitalising and running the risk of not being able to meet the demand.  In spite of a couple of frights the board's longterm planning over the past 40 years has been borne out.  It is heartening to know that the board are now able to finance their investments through the World Bank and other external lending agencies whose scrutiny of such projects is sometimes quite severe.</P>
      <P>The board's record is a good one and accordingly I do not think any of us would hesitate in approving their latest request.  When looking back over the 40 years which the board has been in existence, we see tremendous developments. In his opening speech the Minister spoke of the way which the board see their system developing in the next five to ten years.</P>
      <P>We have for the first time in this country the development of a pumped-storage plant; we have very heavy investment in gas turbine plants; we have the building up by the ESB of a power supply structure which has a flexibility and a range far beyond what the board has had in the past.  As the conventional hydro-plant fades out of the picture it is being replaced by the pumped-storage plant; as the last of the peat plants is developed we move over to the gas turbine and we begin to think in terms of nuclear power.</P>
      <P>The ESB have during the past 40 years kept pace with technological development.  When we look at the requests being made by the ESB for capital we realise that the board have had few difficulties in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to return to a question which I have mentioned before in this House not only in regard to the ESB but in regard to other items of capital development.  When looking at <Col N="111" /> capital investment decisions I think it is very foolish not to separate the true economic costs and the social costs which are involved because of community policy in relation to certain matters.  The position is that the ESB finances and the ESB costings of some of their plants are distorted from the true economic picture by community policy in regard to certain matters.</P>
    <P>The position is that the peat-fired stations are not as economic as the other thermal stations.  Nevertheless, they are planned and costed in the same way.  It is a perfectly correct decision to develop a certain proportion of peat-fired stations because we have in this the development of a native resource. In this case we have decided to invest heavily in peat-fired stations in order to develop native resources rather than look at the alternative of developing thermal stations based on oil in conjunction with intense agricultural development of our peat-lands.  It may be that because there is this use of peat, which is of benefit in saving on our balance of payments, that we have not looked at all the investment options open to us.</P>
    <P>In regard to the large bogs which have been developed in the form of milled peat in latter days for power purposes, the job has been done and has been done extremely well.  As we come to the end of this particular development, we should give credit for a job extremely well done.  It is perhaps not realised that in the development of milled peat for power purposes it is not just a matter of the minor adaptation of the type of plant which would be used for the burning of coal in order to design plant for peat.  Many of the problems of designing peat-fired stations involved a great deal of development work which was carried out most efficiently and most successfully by the engineers of the ESB.  In this they were very much on their own because the only similar development in regard to this was done in the Soviet Union and the results of that work were not too readily available. The engineers of the ESB have done a splendid job in developing power from peat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> I want to come back to the point that we should try to quantify as far as possible, and to be as clear as we can in our minds when we start a development of this type as to when we are dealing with clear economic costs and when we are meeting social purposes. I have talked of the peat-fired stations of the midlands.  We have another example in the ESB system.  We have the 4 mw power stations which were built along the west coast.  They were built purely as a social investment.</P>
    <P>Here was something which, on an economic analysis, would certainly not be tolerated.  There was an extremely good case for the erection of these stations.  We tend to blur our vision by the way the job was tackled.  It is worth recalling our actions in this regard because as we go into the European Economic Community, or if we remain out of it in a trading world which is dominated by the ideas of the EEC, we must know the true costs of our heavy capital investment, and unless we do we may come a &ldquo;cropper&rdquo;. We made a serious mistake in the way in which the whole decision about the 4 mw stations was presented and made.  The position is that these stations appear as part of the ESB's ordinary costing and accounts.  It would be far better if, in fact, the deficit on these stations, in comparison with the alternative stations which would have been used by the ESB, was shown.  The amount of this deficit should be carried as a vote which is clearly marked as a social charge.  Perhaps the ESB should be given a subvention by the Department of the Gaeltacht, or given a subvention which is clearly labelled as being a subvention to the ESB for the erection and maintenance of uneconomic stations using hand won turf which the board would not ordinarily have contemplated erecting or running.</P>
    <P>In regard to the future activities of the board and to the capital investment of other types, we would be well advised, when making decisions for social purposes, to make this distinction clear. Senator Honan mentioned the point in this debate already.  The Senator has suggested that the ESB must accept the community decision and provide <Col N="113" /> electricity if it is the policy of the Government and of the community to place an industry in a remote area in which electricity is not available.</P>
    <P>Are the ESB to do this without cost? Are the ESB to run out power-lines to every remote area to supply a factory which, on the basis of straight economic analysis, is wrongly located? If the community consider it necessary to have a factory in such an area there is an additional charge which has nothing to do with the ESB's job of the production and distribution of electricity. If the State consider there should be factories in remote areas which should be supplied with electricity I suggest that the right way of solving this particular problem is for the State, which wants the industry to be located in such a place, to pay to that industry as part of an industrial grant the amount which the ESB feel obliged to charge because of the special expenditure which must be undertaken in order to bring power to this particular spot.</P>
    <P>Some may feel that it would be simpler for the ESB not to charge. In fact, there are two considerations arising here.  One is if the ESB are asked to remit these charges which they make to new industries then these charges are being imposed as a tax on all ESB consumers.  These consumers are being asked to pay for this particular incentive towards the development of an industry in a particular place, rather than asking the taxpayers as a group to meet this particular charge.  At the same time, the cost structures of the ESB are being distorted and also the cost structures of the particular industries.  We will suffer grievously in our trading in the decade ahead unless we are quite clear as to the true costings of our various operations and of our various capital investment decisions. Unless we know the true costings we will be unable to make the correct decisions which will enable us to get our share of the market in an enlarged community or our share of European trade.</P>
    <P>In regard to technical developments, I have mentioned that the ESB record is a proud one.  Indeed, I am proud to have spent 12 years of my professional <Col N="114" /> life with the organisation.  We can look with confidence in the future to the ESB in regard to matters such as the new type of thermal station now being developed, in regard to producing a system of greater flexibility and in regard to the operation of that system. However, I wonder if the ESB can look with equal confidence to us, to the Oireachtas, in regard to this.</P>
    <P>What are the lines of development? The lines of development in regard to thermal stations are that in order to increase the efficiency of the conventional thermal station, the size of thermal stations is increasing.  In regard to nuclear power the threshold size of a feasible or an economic nuclear power plant is quite high.  We are moving into an area in which the economic development of electrical power which, of course, is part of the cost structure of every one of our industries, is dependent on the development of large size units.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell mentioned the question of nuclear power and development in tidal power.  In both cases large units will be needed.  In so far as nuclear power is concerned there is no doubt that the best way of providing nuclear power in this island is by producing one single nuclear plant rather than for Northern Ireland to go their own way in this and for us to go our way.  For many years discussions in regard to the development of nuclear power in this country were in terms of one single nuclear power plant but in more recent times the indications are that Northern Ireland will go ahead to develop their own nuclear plant.</P>
    <P>To my mind, this is an economic as well as a national tragedy.  As I see it, it is an indication that we who are engaged in public life may not have played our part in regard to the development of electricity.  There is no doubt whatever that in this respect, and in many others, our failure to follow up developments in regard to relationships and co-operation with Northern Ireland has led to a most unsatisfactory situation from the point of view of an economic activity such as the development of electrical power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> There was agreement initially in regard to the Erne scheme.  In the immediate post-war years there was excellent co-operation from a technical viewpoint as well as from a civil service and Government viewpoint in regard to the development of that scheme.  At that time, there was also a proposal that the power from the Erne, the works of which traverse the Border, should be fed into the Northern Ireland grid.  Agreement was reached in regard to the works themselves but in the following years various proposals for the interchange of power across the Border came to nothing.  More recently agreement has been reached but what was discussed at official level in 1946 and 1948 only came to fruition some 20 years later. We now have a cross-Border link between Maynooth and the Northern Ireland grid.  This enables power to be interchanged between the two parts of the island.  We are thankful for that. This is something which is a good pointer towards co-operation for the future but, at the same time, it should not have taken 20 years for final agreement to be reached on this point.</P>
    <P>We have not taken sufficient initiative or thought deeply enough about these problems.  This is typical of our failure to carry through and to take action on problems of practical co-operation with Northern Ireland&mdash;co-operation that we all accept as being desirable in principle.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other developments of the future, Senator Russell mentioned the question of tidal power. Tidal power may well be developed although I think we might wait and learn from the mistakes of other countries before we go ahead.  When we do, it is quite possible that the most likely site for the development of such a station would be Carlingford Lough. In this regard too, we would require the co-operation of Northern Ireland. The ESB will certainly be ready when the day comes for the undertaking of such a project.  They already have the technical answers in so far as tidal power is concerned but I ask if the Government and the Oireachtas are ready with the political answers to the <Col N="116" /> problems of the development of tidal power at Carlingford Lough.  These are matters which we must think about and not merely express our satisfaction when the Board come to us with a request for money which we are satisfied will be well spent.</P>
    <P>In regard to many of these lines of development there are these political problems to be faced.  The problem of sufficient co-operation will have to be solved.  We do not know when these developments will come about.  During the past 20 years predictions have been made that nuclear power in medium sized stations was only around the corner.  The technical and economic break-throughs were always ahead of us but yet we still find ourselves in the position in which nuclear power does not yet appear to be competitive compared with the more conventional thermal stations.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it would be extremely dangerous for us if we accepted the view that medium sized stations will be feasible and economic propositions during the next five or ten years rather than to accept the viewpoint that a larger station which could serve the whole of the island would be a more feasible and economic proposition. From the point of view of the future of electrical development we need schemes like Turlough Hill, schemes like the gas turbine units which will take the peak power but if pumped-storage at Turlough Hill and elsewhere is to be economic we must have cheap base load in order to supply it and if we are to supply this by nuclear power then, indeed, the cost of nuclear power will be very important in regard to our generation system.</P>
    <P>However, as I say, it is not for the ESB to solve these problems.  They are ready to solve the problems which are theirs but I would put it to the Minister that it is for him and for his Department to ensure that there are no road blocks or no impediments in the way which, for political reasons, would impede what is acknowledged as being the best technical solution.</P>
    <P>Now, in handing over this money to be spent by the ESB, the Members of this House will express confidence that it will be well spent.  I certainly would <Col N="117" /> express greater confidence that its expenditure will be well managed than I might have before the recent changes in the ESB.  The changes in regard to the management structure and some of the changes in regard to the question of breaking down the barriers of misunderstanding and ill-feeling between management and staff give some hope for the future.</P>
    <P>As Senator Russell said in regard to the restructuring of the ESB, this is not only important for the ESB but indeed might well serve as a headline for many other State authorities.  There are a number of significant aspects about the restructuring of the ESB. There is, firstly, the decision that the ESB will now run on a two board system, that there will be a policy board and that there will be an executive board.  This is a very important decision and in our context it is almost a pilot experiment.  Nevertheless, if we look to other countries, in particular if we look to the organisation of a large industry in Germany, this is the system which has proved itself during Germany's period of rapid economic expansion.</P>
    <P>There are other significant features about the reorganisation of the ESB. Let us say that first there does not seem any reason for delaying long before introducing into other semi-State bodies the same idea of the policy board and the executive board.  There has also been in the constitution of the executive board of the ESB a further breakthrough. In fact if we look at the constitution of the executive board we see the high membership of technical officers among the executive board of the ESB.  This is something which was perhaps easier in the ESB than in any other body.</P>
    <P>We might think this is something which would apply only to the ESB but in fact this is something which is a commonplace in the industries of the Continent, a commonplace in the industries of the United States.  In fact normally a majority of the members of the board are those who know the industries from the technological viewpoint, who know the hardware aspects of the industry from the inside.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of gratification to the <Col N="118" /> engineering profession in Ireland that the chief executive of the ESB under the reconstruction was a technical officer.  It is also a source of gratification to the engineering profession that of the four other directors two of them were technical officers.  It is not just a matter of gratification to me as an engineer that this has happened. It is also a source of gratification that at last an important Irish body have fallen into line in something which, as I said before, is commonplace in other countries.</P>
    <P>It was perhaps easy for the ESB to do this, the high technical content of the ESB work, the fact that in prior years, before they were peremptorily dismissed, there were two technical directors in the ESB, one of whom, Tommy McLoughlin, to whom tribute has already been paid and the other, the late Jimmy Fay, to whom equal credit is due, for the fact that during the formative and middle years of the ESB when the ESB name was a synonym for efficiency, the ESB were a happy organisation to work in.  I can say as one who worked there that the contribution towards that state of affairs by Tommy McLoughlin and Jimmy Fay was very great indeed.  So, perhaps, it was easy for the ESB to make this change but this is a change which will have to be made in many of our industries.</P>
    <P>This is a change which indeed our Civil Service will have to face.  This has been brought out in the Devlin Report&mdash;the idea that we can in a technological age treat our technical officers as people, in the words which are used of them sometimes by administrative officers, who should always be on tap but never be on top.  This attitude would be disastrous as we attempt to enter an international league in the matter of free trade in an age when production is based on technology.  This problem must be faced not only in our industries and in our semi-State bodies but in the Civil Service itself.</P>
    <P>The other changes that have been made in the ESB are those in regard to industrial relations.  I wonder are those to be welcomed; I wonder if in fact what has been done now in regard <Col N="119" /> to the ESB is not so half-hearted as to make the last situation worse than the first.  I wonder if there does not appear to be an idea in regard to the ESB that the deep rooted industrial problems which we all know exist there can be cured by a workers' council type of approach.  I am not against workers' councils and I think they can have a part to play, but only a part to play.  Here was a glorious opportunity to make the ESB the pilot experiment of the future industrial organisation, the future industrial democracy of this country.  If what has been done is the first step along that road then it is to be welcomed.  If it is intended as a final step along the road then it is very definitely to be deplored.</P>
    <P>I want to say the opportunity should be taken as soon as possible to emphasise the difference between what is meant by the industrial democracy of the type which exists in Socialist Yugoslavia and Capitalist Germany but is not so different when you go from one to the other and what has been done in the ESB.  We want here a real participation by the workers and, with all due respect to the eminent trade unionist present who is my colleague in this House, I do not believe the workers in an enterprise like the ESB will be satisfied that they are being given participation in the broad policy planning of their organisation merely because a trade union official is a member of the board.</P>
    <P>Something far more than this will be necessary in order to give us proper participation.  I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;participation&rdquo; which has virtually become a cliché but I cannot find another in the course of my speech. I do not believe the workers in the ESB will necessarily feel they are being represented on the policy board of the ESB unless they are represented by one of their own.  This indeed is one of the early mistakes made in the German effort at industrial democracy.  It may well be that it will be necessary for certain steps to be taken by the board, by the trade unions, to train members of the staff to take their place on the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> It may be that they will have to take people from the Board's staff who will receive training of one type or another so that they can really contribute to the board's work at the same time as representing their colleagues. To say that there are trade unionists on the board, to say that workers' councils are to be formed is very far short of what will be required in order to make the ESB a healthy place to work in.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in the course of this Bill the Minister has removed some grievances with regard to the superannuation code.  There was a time during my time in the board when I was chairman of one superannuation committee and I knew the code backwards. I find it hard to read the Bill and the Act to find exactly what has been done.  I can understand well enough most of the things the Minister has done but there are some cases, particularly in regard to pre-1942 service, about which there have been grievances for a very long time.  I raised this several times in this House on previous Bills but I failed, and I am extremely glad that it has been done now though I am sorry that it was not done long ago when many people retired from the board's service without being given this particular right. I ask the Minister if in fact he has in this Bill met fully the requests which were made on behalf of the ESB staff in regard to service in the years before the introduction of the scheme in 1942, and are there any outstanding cases with regard to this?  Do the provisions of the present Bill cover both manual and general workers?</P>

      <P>I am very glad. I will resist the temptation of saying &ldquo;about time&rdquo; and will just say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;.  This is something for which the ESB staff as a whole, whether they benefit or not, will be very grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we can say that this Bill is a good Bill and a welcome Bill. <Col N="121" /> We can say that the ESB are a good organisation.  They have done their job efficiently, but the great blot has been their extremely bad staff relations over the past decade, and this is a problem which must be solved.  As I said in the course of my speech, I think that it would be a very great danger indeed if anybody in the ESB or anybody outside were to think of the steps that have been taken so far as being sufficient to remedy that very bad situation.  Let us hope that they are only the beginning, and that in fact the ESB, which showed such enterprise in the technical field, can also show enterprise and success in the field of industrial relations.  If our industries, whether service industries like the ESB or manufacturing industries, are to play their real part and our people to hold their own in the Europe of the future, then industrial relations are just as important as technical productivity, and if we do not solve this problem it is worthless that in fact we have people of high technical skill. Unless we have management skills, and unless all of us here in this House as well as middle managers and supervisors dealing with the problem in the ESB can produce the conditions in which a place like the ESB is a decent place to work in and that people will be glad to work in, then it just is not enough to solve the technical problems.</P>

      <P>I will detain the House only a few minutes&mdash;three or four at the most.  I cannot aspire to bringing to this debate either the economic expertise of Senators Russell and Dooge or the technical expertise of Senator Dooge.  I will be much shorter and much more mundane in my approach to this.  I welcome this Bill. I think, as Senator Dooge has said, that it is overdue.  The amount of money involved in this, hundreds of millions of money involved in this&mdash;have we not come a long way from that white elephant?  When I say &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo; I do not think I have to tell this House the source of that quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the Second Reading of the Health Bill I mentioned a circular that was sent around from the Department of Health asking us <Col N="122" /> just after our estimates had been prepared in the various health authorities &mdash;this came to the Dublin Health Authority and this is how I got to know of it&mdash;to prune our estimates.  It was in many ways an insulting circular, but however we decided we could, by asking the Department to allow us to put in convertible burners, that is, burners that could be used for oil and could be used for solid fuel.  We would have saved £60,000.  It would have reduced our estimates by £60,000.  The Department of Health refused.</P>
    <P>I brought this out on the Second Reading of the Health Bill.  Yet we have here a statement from the Minister in the second sentence of his third paragraph on the first page &ldquo;they expect to commission 706 megawatts of additional capacity, half of which will be oil-fired, to meet the demand up to 1974-75&rdquo;.  The inconsistency of the various Departments of Government fails me.</P>
    <P>They would not allow the health authority to use convertible burners, yet they are quite willing to use them themselves.  I brought this up in the health authority.  I had two main arguments. One of them was that we could save £60,000 if we were allowed to use oil burners.  We got one into St. Mary's Hospital in the Park and saved £10,000 in that year.</P>
    <P>The other point I made in the Dublin Health Authority was that our resources of peat fuel are limited to ten to 15 years at the outside.  That was denied by the Department of Health, probably, it may be, at the instigation of the Department of Industry and Commerce, but I am not quite sure; but if one goes here into the last sentence in the Minister's speech on page 1 one finds: &ldquo;This will absorb the production of the last major bog suitable for harvesting by Bord na Móna's advanced methods&rdquo;.  In other words, this bears out the point I made.  He states that there is a limit to our resources of peat fuel.  What is left of peat after this station he talks about is installed can be harvested only by a man with a sleán or something like that, because machinery cannot get into it and there are no resources sufficient for the use of machinery after this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> My point in rising here today is to point out the inconsistency between various Government Departments. When a Government Department themselves want to save money&mdash;God knows it is time they did&mdash;they are prepared to use oil, but they will not permit health authorities to use it.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister wants to get the Bill through.  I want to welcome it generally but I thought it necessary to point out the inconsistencies in Departments. I am not an expert in engineering nor for that matter am I any good at economics and previous speakers on this side have elucidated points on those matters. I agreed with them when they said they welcome the Bill: I think all of us on this side support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House for very long.  I welcome the Bill for the developments which are forecast because of increased capital intensity.  I also welcome the Bill for the very desirable change it proposes in the superannuation code, on which the Minister is to be congratulated. Changes were long overdue.</P>
      <P>My obvious and primary interest in the ESB is in the field of industrial relations.  Normally I would hope to speak at great length on this question because for too many years industrial relations have been deplorable.  At the moment, however, they are in a state of transition and recent changes in the structure of the board seem to indicate a desire to effect a change for the better in that direction.  For that reason I thought it best not to say too much on this aspect.  It may be said that the recent changes in the board have met the recommendations of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the extent that they involve the concept of giving both a supervisory board and an executive board in the ESB, but I suggest to the Minister that to the extent that he is responsible there should be no great delay in seeing that the community is even better and more obviously represented on the supervisory board than is the case at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to speak too long on <Col N="124" /> the concept known and very often sneered at as industrial democracy but I want to take this opportunity in this House, as I have tried to do in other places, to warn all concerned in this important matter of industrial relations that there is a strict obligation, a very serious obligation, on all of us to realise that in our country, with faults on both sides, we have great and indeed grave unrest in our national industrial relations; and that we should always be intelligent enough to accept that the evidence is there already that things are far from right in that most important sphere; and that for that reason if for no other there is an obligation on us to examine our existing system, our existing structure, to see which changes are necessary to effect much needed improvement in our national industrial relations.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I, with others, have attached myself to the question of industrial democracy obtaining in this country.  I believe there evolves a particular responsibility on the Minister now in the House because of his interest in the very wide range of publicly owned industries we have in this country.  One must be fair to private employers, however hard I might find it at times: it must be accepted they have their own priorities and that social experimentation, for obvious and understandable reasons, is not very high on that list of priorities. This should not be so with publicly owned industries, and it is in this field, relatively large in our country, that we have the opportunity, while we have time, to carry out such experimentation as we may consider helpful in this field of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>It is for these and related reasons that I do not want to go into the matter of industrial relations in the ESB in too great depth.  I would hope, as was said earlier in the debate by the present occupant of the Chair, that the recent steps taken in the ESB are not the end but rather the beginning and are the signal for a very strong and sincere attempt to affect that one but very important sphere in which the ESB have failed.  We all have given credit to their technological initiative, <Col N="125" /> but in the field of industrial relations they have failed signally.</P>
    <P>That is why I hope we will see steps taken quickly in this field: that is why we have got to remind ourselves and, with respect, the Minister, that the committee of inquiry on industrial relations in the ESB were not established by the ESB or the trade unions but by the Government in the name of the Minister for Labour.  For this reason there is a heavy onus on the Government and on the Minister for Transport and Power to keep under constant revision the implementation of that committee's report in relation to the ESB.  One of the last recommendations of that committee was that the workers, by process of democratic election, should be placed on the board.  It is true there is a form of trade union representation on the board, and I mean no disrespect to my colleague and friend who was a member of that board when I say that this is not the expression of worker representation that gives the greatest hope to people working not alone in the ESB but in Irish industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>My final point in this debate&mdash;in other debates I will refer to it&mdash;is to urge as strongly as I can from my experience that there is in Irish industry, both private and public, not much time to make the experiments which are now available to us.  There is the choice that we may content ourselves with allowing things to go on as they are.  This will lead to chaos and there is already evidence on that point. Consequently, while we have time, particularly in publicly-owned industries, we should not be averse to a degree of courageous experimentation which will give the workers the peace in industry which they want, and the country the rightful progress which we all want to see in industry, not the least of which is the ESB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FarrellMcElgunn" hpid="Mr. McElgunn Mr. McElgunn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McElgunn</NameTxt>
      <P>Maraon le Seanadóirí eile, cúirím fáilte roimh an mBille.  I just want to make two points, the first of which I am sure the Minister is well aware of because it was raised in the Dáil and it concerns the original generating station which is in the Minister's own constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> The Minister mentioned in his statement that he proposes to increase the amount of money to £290 million.  We in our part of the country would like some part of that money to be devoted either to increasing the capacity and extending the plant of the Arigna generating station or to the erection of a new plant.  The coal mining industry at Arigna is the only source of employment apart from farming and as the board take social as well as economic factors into account I should like this fact to be taken into account.  Other Government Departments are prepared to subsidise new industries but here is a readily available source of employment in the area and I should like it to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I would not go all the way with Senator Belton in opposing the idea of using native fuel in our institutions. Some of the institutions in Roscommon and Leitrim use either Arigna coal or sod peat.  I think the mistake which Senator Belton made arises because he equated sod peat with milled peat.  My understanding of the Minister is that this will absorb production of the last major bog suitable for harvesting by Bord na Móna's advanced methods.</P>
    <P>I understood that to refer to milled peat but in actual fact sod peat is used in the institutions I have referred to. There are many smaller bogs all over the west which are suitable for developing for sod peat, and I think Bord na Móna can still devote attention to this.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the ESB on the marvellous achievements they have made with rural electrification.  Here again social rather than economic questions were the main consideration. I should like to see a policy adopted to clear up outstanding areas.</P>

      <P>The Bill refers to money for purposes other than rural electrification.  The Chair has no objection to the Senator making a passing reference to rural electrification but it would remind the Senator not to dwell on the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McElgunn</NameTxt>
      <P>Mention has been made of rural electrification in Northern Ireland and this is one area <Col N="127" /> where we in the south contrast very favourably with the north.  When the owner of a smallholding or a farm wants electricity he has to foot the whole bill whereas it is a different matter here in the south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators and welcome this Bill.  I wish to congratulate the management and staff of the board for the dynamic progress they have made. I had to smile when I heard Senator Belton talk about native fuel because two years ago the Department of Education did not consider the product of the ESB as being of native fuel.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the engineers who have developed the new thermal system of central heating.  As a person involved in vocational education I have found this type of central heating to be the most effective and certainly the cheapest.  I think the air filter and the air circulating arrangements make classrooms very fresh even at a temperature of 65 degrees or 70 degrees.  I do not think the ESB have been given sufficient recognition for this.</P>
      <P>The ESB have been thought of as a monopoly industry but in spite of this they have not remained complacent; they have been improving the system all the time.  The repair and breakdown service provided by the ESB is something that very few companies, either State companies or private enterprise, can compete with.  This is a credit to the workers who go out at all times of the day and night irrespective of the weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Electrical appliances are continually being brought more up to date but I feel the board do not give sufficient warning about the dangers of tampering with such appliances The board are always very quick to replace or repair faulty wires but I think the public should be warned through promotional advertising programmes of the dangers of tampering with electrical appliances. In my own county only last week a sad accident occurred.  A man was electrocuted while flying a kite.  Most people would not regard flying a kite as dangerous.  The board have an obligation to remind people to respect <Col N="128" /> electrical power and to treat it with great care.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if it would be possible to ensure that the areas throughout the country which suffered a voltage drop over the last year will be attended to.  Anyone with a television set notices a voltage drop when the set goes dim.  It shows up the weak spots of the network.  The board have an obligation when selling appliances to ensure that existing consumers are getting reasonable value for their money.</P>
    <P>The staff of the board are very efficient and try to improve the situation. Nevertheless there are voltage drops throughout the country.  Senator McElgunn's point about rural electrification got a short airing.  Perhaps the Minister might give the extra £1 million necessary to connect up the small percentage of rural consumers who happen to be in uneconomic areas for the purposes of their electricity supply.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge suggested that the IDA should look at the special services charge levied by the ESB on rural consumers for grant purposes.  This is a valid point and I should like to support it.  Even the small industries need four-phase current.  This is not available in every village and town.  It would be reasonable if the IDA were to consider including this as a capital cost and to have the provision of electricity considered for grant purposes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the board on the excellent services they have given over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little more to be said on this subject after the excellent contributions made by various speakers on both sides of the House. The Minister knows rural areas well. The Minister knows that it has been found uneconomic to connect certain small areas to the country's electrical supply.  There is an immediate necessity to deal with this situation.  I do not recommend running a long line for one single house.  That may happen in the future but there are various areas where small pockets are without electricity. Farmers in isolated areas now need electricity for their milking machines.  Group water supply schemes <Col N="129" /> are the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing.  The Government are not able to provide the money for extensions to ordinary water schemes. The people have been remedying these defects themselves.  They are in great difficulty if they have not got electricity. A survey should be made of all the outlying areas.  The difficulties with regard to electricity should be solved once and for all.</P>
      <P>I was intrigued by Senator Honan's point about a factory being erected in a particular place at a cost of £100,000 and then finding there was no electricity. Surely, there must be consultation in the future between all the parties concerned.  There must be consultation between the Department of Industry and Commerce, the ESB and the Department of Local Government.  If there is not discussion between the various bodies concerned in a particular project in an area there is bound to be great waste as happened at Clonmel.  Surely this type of consultation is possible.  It would be desirable to have dialogue between all parties concerned on every aspect of development. The country would benefit from such consultation.  We cannot go along saying: &ldquo;I have done my job today and I will notify somebody in a month's time about the job&rdquo; and then it will be found necessary to duplicate some of the work already carried out.  The time has come when every project concerning group water schemes or factories to be erected should be discussed.</P>
      <P>In formulating new schemes of advancement for transmission lines the ESB should consider that priority must be given to areas where it is proposed to establish industries.  I should like to congratulate the ESB on the work done.  The staff are courteous and efficient.  They go out in all weathers to remedy faults even in the middle of the night.  They deserve great praise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in Senator Dooge's points about turf-fired stations.  The Senator is right in saying that the costs of the four-megaton stations should be taken out of the general picture.  They were found to be a social necessity.  They serve a social purpose. For that reason the normal body of <Col N="130" /> consumers should not have to bear the cost that the uneconomic running of these stations entails.  Other Departments should give grants to the ESB for the particular purpose of running these stations.  In doing so they would decrease the cost to the ordinary consumers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the question of industrial relations and in particular about the points raised by Senator Dunne in relation to industrial democracy.  We have heard much about industrial democracy during the past few years.  It seems to me now that in saying &ldquo;industrial democracy&rdquo; one does not always have any clear-cut idea of what is involved in those words. Industrial democracy has almost as many meanings and definitions as socialism.  For every individual socialism means what that particular individual wants it to mean.</P>
      <P>I have personal experience of a fairly large firm to whom a trade union wrote asking for the introduction of the principle of industrial democracy.  The firm wrote back to the union saying they had no objection in principle to industrial democracy and inviting the union to submit detailed proposals as to how industrial democracy should be implemented in relation to that firm. That was the end of the matter.  The union concerned never replied to the invitation.  The unions, or at least the union dealing with that case, do not seem to have any clear-cut idea of what is involved.  If industrial democracy will help to improve industrial relations&mdash;at the present time anything that would improve industrial relations would be very welcome&mdash;then the unions in particular must draw a detailed blueprint of what are the longterm and the short-term implications of industrial democracy.  They should make this public because until such time as this is done the words &ldquo;industrial democracy&rdquo; continue to be a phrase that is thrown about by many people who are for and against such democracy while, it will not be possible to implement it because nobody is quite clear as to what is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a lot of <Col N="131" /> commonsense in the last remarks of Senator Ryan.  All of us would subscribe to the view that the most imperative need in Ireland today for the guaranteeing of future harmonious economic development is a very rapid improvement in industrial relations. However, the problem is in finding a method of achieving harmonious industrial relations.  Industrial democracy as such is a phrase that is bandied about quite a lot by people who do not realise its real meaning.</P>
      <P>I would regard some form of responsibility on the part of people at all levels in any organisation as an important step in the management of that organisation.  If that is what is involved in regard to workers' democracy I am in favour of such democracy.  I am in favour of greater responsibility at every level, from board and management down to the factory floor.  However, I should like a more precise spelling out of what exactly is involved in this phrase&mdash;a phrase that is bandied about rather loosely.  This is an aspect to which the new management&mdash;labour group should apply their minds.  I am confident that they will do so.  There is no point in introducing a theoretical or woolly blueprint as to what can be done.  People at every level in a factory or organisation should be given a sense of belonging to that factory or organisation at whichever level they may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to assure the Senators who raised the question as to whether the recent restructuring of the ESB was a final or a first step, that to my mind it is a first step towards the achievement of the most excellent industrial relations that we can achieve within this organisation.  It is my objective to make the ESB a model in relation to harmonious industrial relations but we must put first things first.  This is a matter which I emphasised when I discussed these questions with the board before September last.  What had to be done first was to work out proper organisation structure for the board. Subsequently, the board engaged the McKinsey Group who are among the leading consultants in the world.  There is no point in talking about industrial democracy in any organisation unless <Col N="132" /> the board and management structure is right.  I discussed this approach with a number of leaders in the trade union movement and they agreed fully with me.</P>
    <P>Prior to the recommendations of the McKinsey Report being made known there was little division in the ESB between the supervisory or board structure and the management and executive structure.  The situation existed in which the chairman of the board was chief executive and chairman and where the two strata that should be separated&mdash;the policy and executive strata&mdash;were meshed together. The result of that was insufficient delegation of authority and insufficient delegation of responsibility right down the line from the top.</P>
    <P>This was the main theme of the McKinsey Report.  There is now an entirely different structure at the top within the organisation.  There is a supervisory policy-making board to which I shall be making additions in the very near future, they will be solely concerned with policy.  There is then a management structure consisting of the chief executive and the various departmental managers.  The policy of having a degree of responsibility at every level is being pursued in detail I am very glad that the implementation of the recommendations of the Report has been welcomed by staff at every level within the organisation as it has also been welcomed by the public in general and by the trade unions.  I am grateful to everybody concerned for that approbation.</P>
    <P>Another important matter which was mentioned by both Senators Russell and Dooge was the question of co-operation with the Six Counties in regard to matters of electrical power. I agree that there is tremendous scope in this line for further co-operation.  We have already made considerable progress but perhaps we have not emphasised sufficiently the progress that has been made in relation to the interconnection that has taken place, the first phase connection which is already in operation between Maynooth and Northern Ireland.  By about this time twelve months we hope to have implemented the final phase connection. <Col N="133" /> There will then be full utilisation of power plants in both north and south.</P>
    <P>The fact is that this will be of substantial advantage to the electricity authorities on both sides of the Border. The economies will be phased in during the next few years and we hope to reach maximum advantage from this co-operation between the years 1975-76 and 1977-78.  During the next eight years in terms of capital expenditure on generating plant here, the saving to the ESB will be in the region of about £10 million.  There will be a saving of a similar nature&mdash;I do not know the exact amount&mdash;to the Northern Ireland electricity authorities. I might mention that one of the difficulties in so far as co-operation with the northern authorities is concerned is that they have three authorities whereas we have only one.</P>
    <P>The obvious field for further co-operation is, as suggested by Professor Dooge, in relation to nuclear energy. On this aspect both the Government and the ESB are keeping an open mind, and provided the deal is right we will be willing to negotiate any co-operation in the field of nuclear energy and power between both parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I would hope to see a nuclear power station being built before the end of the decade&mdash;by 1977 or 1978, if not sooner.  The first step in this direction would be taken in the form of legislation which I hope to introduce to the Oireachtas before the end of this year. This legislation will deal with the establishment of a new nuclear energy board.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge rightly said that the board have shown an overall picture of a properly diversified and organised power structure in the country.  This is true.  We would not wish to have a situation where we would be over reliant on any one particular form of energy.  This from every national point of view one can consider as commonsense.</P>
    <P>We want again to keep our options open here, to rely on our own native fuel resources to some degree, to rely on oil, which in the strict terms of economic is the most financially <Col N="134" /> economical of all, and to rely on nuclear energy as well.  In this way you have a balanced distribution of energy resources and it means you are not over-dependent on any single form of energy.</P>
    <P>This makes good sense and even though in strict narrow economic terms one would be totally for oil, in balancing out the various other national and social considerations it makes very good sense to have a fundamental matter like energy not confined to one particular source.  It makes very good sense to have one's energy resources spread and diversified so that in no sense is the nation reliant on any particular source of energy and thereby over-dependent on a particular group or grouping of suppliers or owners of any particular type of energy.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge rather over-stated the matter of the four small to five MW stations we have in the west.  This is a very marginal factor, as the stations between them produce less than 1 per cent of the total output of electric power in the country I do not think it is worth while itemising them for their social context.  We have done this in regard to the rail service of CIE.  We have them separately itemised in the accounts and the community know precisely what they are paying to keep the rail services going, but they are a major part of the activities of CIE.  This particular case of the four small sod peat stations is a very minor matter.  They were erected in days gone by for very good social reasons at the time and they are becoming decreasingly a part of the activities of the ESB and represent a very marginal matter.  I doubt if there is much point in itemising their costs because the whole thing is infinitesimal.</P>
    <P>The question of the utilisation of other sources of power was rightly raised.  I am glad the Seanad took the point and devoted some time to this question of diversifying as much as possible.  Tidal power was mentioned in this context.  I want to say that tidal power has been harnessed successfully in France but it depends on a particular type of estuary topography involving a very big rise and fall of water.  The ESB have done a very detailed survey on this and know as <Col N="135" /> much as anybody in the world about this type of power and its potentialities, which are excellent from the economics point of view if one can get the appropriate type of tidal race.  So far there is no such inlet or estuary within our jurisdiction to suit the purpose.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge mentioned Carlingford Lough as being a possibility.  This is a matter which I will certainly bring to the attention of the ESB although I am certain they have already investigated it and possibly have had discussions about it with the electricity authority on the other side of the Border.  I will certainly take it up with the ESB because it is another conceivable form of cross-Border co-operation in this field.</P>
    <P>The main new revolutionary development has been in the Turlough Hill project where we have this hydro electric storage capacity organised on the basis of building an artificial reservoir at the top of a mountain and pumping water in off peak periods from a base lake at the bottom up to this artificial reservoir from where it is available for peak period generation.</P>
    <P>The World Bank gave £6 million and the ESB also gave £6 million for it.  The World Bank have shown tremendous confidence in the ESB in this project, which is one of the most complex and one of the most highly organised in the world.  The ESB see some scope for this type of development in other areas and are at the moment examining it.  Again, as in the case of the tidal situation, this depends on a particular grouping together of natural features.  You must have a mountain of a certain slope, you must have a lake at the bottom of that mountain, you must be able to bore through the mountain to build up your pumping capacity and you must have a proper type of topography at the top of the mountain to have an artificial lake.  You must have all those features.  They must all be feasible from a technical point of view.</P>
    <P>I understand there are two other centres in Ireland where at the moment this is technically feasible and where sometime in the future we could hope to have a repetition of the Turlough Hill project.  One of them is in the <Col N="136" /> Comeragh Mountains in Waterford and another one is being examined at the present point of time.  There are therefore three on the mat, one at Turlough Hill, which is well on the way, and two more where we could have this type of hydro-electric project for use during certain periods to assist in having maximum load efficiency.</P>
    <P>Points were raised about superannuation. The proposals in the Bill meet the full case that was made by people who agreed, both on the manual side and the clerical side within the ESB, that all points that were outstanding in this field, particularly those concerning the pre-1943 employees, have been met in the superannuation provisions.  I regard proper humane superannuation provisions as being the best form of industrial relations. Security is a very important aspect of human behaviour and if within any organisation the superannuation aspect is properly organised in a humane sort of way you are taking a very big step when you get that aspect of it organised properly.  That is one of the important aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the authority of the ESB to raise money up to the limit of £290 million.  As it stands at the moment, the limit is £225 million.  It is indicative of the growth of the ESB and of power generation in this country that the rise has been from in the region of £100 million as the expenditure limit in 1960 to practically £300 million in 1970.  Over a ten year period there has been a three-fold rise in the capital requirements of the ESB.  That in itself is a barometer of the sort of progress that has been made by this organisation.  That sort of progress will be accelerated in the future.</P>
    <P>That is why it is all important to have this fundamental organisation on a proper board management basis and on a proper labour relations basis.  I should like to see this done in the very near future.  We have taken the first steps in this direction.  Once we have that organised there is no doubt about the technical capacity of the ESB.  That was one of the matters referred to by the World Bank when after a very brief investigation they came forward with <Col N="137" /> £6 million, half the cost of the Turlough Hill project, on the basis that they were completely satisfied with the technical excellence of the personnel and the resources available to the ESB in this country.  The ESB never had any trouble in raising money either here or abroad and for that reason we can all look forward with confidence to their future.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House again that no effort will be lost in ensuring we have as wide a spread of energy resources as possible and as cheap as possible.  The whole hydro-electric field including tidal and storage possibilities and all other aspects of cheap electric power generation, will be fully investigated. Above all else, we must ensure that as far as we are concerned in the future we are as self contained as possible in regard to our power resources, as diversified as possible with regard to them, and that we have as the agency for the generation of our power resources an organisation harmonious in their labour relations and excellent in regard to board and management organisation.</P>

Senators will be aware of the investigation going on at present into the possibility of natural gas resources in locations off our seaboard. I am informed that the economics of natural gas power generation vary enormously, depending on proximity to the coast, and depending on the volume available, but there is no doubt about it that if we find a substantial quantity of natural gas in a favourable location off the coast this would be a tremendous help in adding to the power resources available to the ESB.  But I am told that the nature of natural gas facilities varies enormously, and consequently so does the question of whether it is economic.  If it is available in the right place at the right distance and can be got out in the right volume there is no question of the <Col N="138" /> contribution that that could be to our resources.</P>

    <Title>Gaming and Lotteries Bill, 1969: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill, as originally introduced in Dáil Éireann, was to amend section 10 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, so as to permit of the operation of slot-machines which do not pay out direct to the player but require the intervention of an attendant to enable the player to collect his prize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> Section 10 of the 1956 Act prohibits the operation of any slot-machine that is &ldquo;designed to deliver&rdquo; a money prize when successfully operated.  For more than twelve years the section was construed by district justices as prohibiting the use of machines with automatic pay-out to the player through the front but as allowing the use of machines which are modified in such a way that the pay-out is at the back to a place not directly accessible to the player.  On that basis machines modified to pay out the back were widely operated under licence from the district court at seaside resorts and in urban centres throughout the country.  In December, 1968, however, the Supreme Court upheld the view of a district justice that the operation of these modified machines was in fact prohibited by section 10.</P>
    <P>When the Bill in its original form came before the Dáil, my predecessor explained that its sole purpose was to restore the position to what it was prior to the Supreme Court decision, namely, to permit the operation of machines delivering the prizes out the back.  The main justification for this proposal was that the proprietors of amusement halls had invested substantial sums of money in the purchase and adaptation of these machines during the period when their use was allowed by the district court and they thus had a very strong argument, based on established equities, for the restoration of the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>However, the spokesman for the two Opposition Parties urged that the amendment should go further and that the law should be amended so as to permit the operation of slot-machines which deliver prizes whether out the front or out the back.  The Minister undertook to reconsider the matter in the light of the views expressed and, following consultation with the Garda Síochána, he put down an amendment for Report Stage to repeal section 10 of the 1956 Act instead of simply amending it.  This was unanimously agreed to by the Dáil and the result is the Bill which is now before this House.</P>
    <P>By providing for the repeal of section 10 the Bill will in effect remove <Col N="141" /> the absolute prohibition at present imposed on the operation of all slot-machines which, when successfully operated, deliver a money prize whether out the front or at the back. Enactment of the Bill will not, however, mean that anybody will be free to install these machines in his premises for operation by members of the public.  The use of the machines will continue to be subject to the general restrictions on gaming contained in the 1956 Act.  The effect of those restrictions is that, subject to certain exceptions, gaming may be carried on only in an area where the local authority has formally passed a resolution adopting the relevant provisions of the 1956 Act and then only in amusement halls and funfairs licensed for the purpose on the authority of the district court.</P>
    <P>In all cases where gaming is permitted there are certain general conditions which must be observed, the main ones being that the maximum stake shall be 6d, the maximum prize 10s and that no person under 16 years of age shall be allowed to play.  Because of reports which have appeared to the effect that this Bill will legalise the installation of slot-machines in public houses, I want to emphasise that this is not so and that any kind of gaming on such premises will continue to be prohibited.</P>
    <P>The operation of slot-machines in amusement halls, particularly at seaside resorts, is an attraction for holiday makers and benefits the tourist trade. It is an attraction which I believe may safely be allowed to continue, subject to the restrictions which I have outlined and which are in the 1956 Act. I have no hesitation therefore in commending the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, I welcome the Minister personally and in that limited sense I wish him success.  He has explained the purpose of the Bill and I think that for his first entry to the Seanad arena he will have a comparatively easy time.  Certainly, I have no objection to the Bill.  I think its underlying purpose, though it may go a little further, is to re-enact, so to speak, or to put the general legislation on slot-machines back into the position the Oireachtas thought it was in after the enactment of the 1956 Act, and the judicial decisions, or permits, if you like, which were given on that.</P>
      <P>We all understood, when the 1956 Act was passed and was in operation for some time, that the position was these slot-machines could be operated, at least where local authorities had passed the necessary resolutions, provided they were not operated in such a way that a cash prize or a prize was delivered from the machines to the operator.  I am sure the Minister and Senators are aware that there were various modifications of those machines whereby instead of a prize being delivered directly to the operator the machines were operated in such a way that the prize came out of the back or that the area at the back was fenced off so that it was necessary for an assistant or somebody else in the fun palace to intervene before the prize was delivered to the operator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read and heard that in some cases a system was adopted whereby instead of the machine actually delivering a prize, front or rear, the assistant went around delivering prizes if a particular result was denoted on the machine.  This, of course, could have been a device to get around the legislation as it stood.  By and large, it was understood during the past 12 years that if the machine did not deliver the prize directly to the operator it was all right but that if it did then it was precluded by section 12 of the Act.  I think the reasoning behind that was somewhat analogous to the position of the earlier licensing Act where the &ldquo;Golden Hour&rdquo; was introduced to interrupt the long sitter.  The idea of adopting this cumbersome system whereby the prize does not go direct <Col N="143" /> to the operator meant that there was a break in the proceedings.  The operator&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;operator&rdquo; I mean the person working the machine in an attempt to win a prize and not the proprietor&mdash;was protected from becoming engrossed in the game and putting in coin after coin after coin in the hope of hitting the jackpot.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the whole machinery in relation to slot-machines of this particular type was perhaps too rigid and too harsh because, as the Minister has pointed out, the maximum stake is as low as 6d and the maximum prize is as low as 10s.  I understand, rightly or wrongly, that the limit is not the normal operating procedure and that very often those machines are operated on the basis of putting in 1d rather than 6d and the value of the prize money may be considerably less than 10s.  It is hard in some ways to see how a person could become addicted to harmful gambling with a stake possibly as low as 1d and in any event not higher than 6d.</P>
    <P>I do, however, appreciate that there was something which it was necessary to safeguard against.  When the 1956 Act was introduced I think the Government of the day recognised their duties and their obligations in the matter and endeavoured to legislate in such a way as to permit what might be described as entertainment in the gambling field without at the same time allowing such an open situation whereby people who operated these machines might become compulsive gamblers or become overtly addicted to gambling.  It did not work out in that way, in view of the court decision which the Minister has referred to.</P>
    <P>On reading section 10 of the 1956 Act I was rather surprised to find that for 12 years it was interpreted as permitting payment of the prizes to be made from the rear of the slot-machine. The district justice who decided that that simply was not allowed under section 10 was quite right.  The Government's method of remedying the situation is simply to remove section 10 completely from the Act.  The Bill before the House does not as the Minister inadvertently said, amend section <Col N="144" /> 10 of the Act: it repeals it.  When I read the Bill first it struck me that perhaps the Government were going too far by repealing the section instead of just amending and spelling out what was to be permitted in relation to these slot machines.  I feel the Government might be going too far in the other direction.  They might, in fact, be allowing slot machines to be operated without necessary restrictions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that though section 10 of the 1956 Act is being repealed&mdash;and therefore being removed from our legislation&mdash;certain general restrictions will still have to be complied with.  I agree that that is possible, but once the necessary resolution is passed by the local authority and the limitations as regards the stake and prize money are settled, then it does seem to me that the thing is wide open because there is no other restriction on these machines.  If there was any justification in the earlier reasoning, as I understand it, that it was necessary to have some kind of break or interruption in order to safeguard against the dangers which might seem to be inherent in this form of gambling entertainment, it seems to me that justification still exists and this Bill might just possibly be going too far simply by repealing section 10 completely instead of amending it.</P>
    <P>As Senator Gallanagh knows, when I was in the other House I represented a constituency where this form of entertainment plays a large part in the entertainment of visitors particularly during the tourist season.  The people who run this kind of entertainment found themselves in difficulty under the law as it stood.  These are expensive machines.  Many of them are entertaining to look at.  They are expensive, involved and complicated.  It meant considerable capital outlay on the part of the proprietors to install these machines. For 12 years they were able to install them.  Possibly they had to incur additional expense in modifying the machines in order to comply with the understanding of the law as it then was.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it seems to me that these people would probably be quite happy if the position were to be put by the Oireachtas on the basis that <Col N="145" /> they understood it was following the 1956 Act and from 1956 to 1968.  It is a bonus for them that the Government have decided to deal with the matter in this way and to repeal section 10 rather than to amend it.  I am assuming, I think rightly, that the Minister is satisfied and that the Government are satisfied that by dealing with this matter in this way there will not be any great outbreak of gambling of an undesirable character associated with these machines and that the likelihood of creating addicts for the one-armed bandit is unlikely to arise.  On that basis I have not any objection to the particular course the Government have decided on in relation to section 10 of the 1956 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelGallanagh" hpid="Mr. Gallanagh Mr. Gallanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the change in this Bill.  I advocated this change and I am glad to see from the reports in the Dáil that Deputy Fitzpatrick of the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Pattison of the Labour Party agreed with me on this.  Under the 1956 Act it seemed ludicrous that it was permissible to have an attendant to pay out a win on a machine and yet it was not possible for the machine to carry out the function for which it was intended, that is, to pay out automatically. I welcome this, as Senator O'Higgins has said, because we have many visitors to the seaside and it is necessary to entertain these people, particularly in temperate weather. There is need for entertainment and relaxation.  This is one form of relaxation.</P>
      <P>Although I welcome the Bill I note that it is permissible at the moment to use a coin up to sixpence in value.  The sixpence will disappear.  In no circumstances should the Minister allow that sum to be increased.  We should strive to make those machines something that would be played for amusement only.  If we can keep them in the low coinage range of the new penny we will have machines for amusement only.  They should not be allowed to increase that figure to five new pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the age limit for those amusements establishments is enforced.  Many <Col N="146" /> parents complain about children of all ages being allowed to go into them.  A certain amount of encouragement is given to them.  Children will find money for those machines if they have to.  They will use means which may not be legitimate to find money for the machines if they are allowed into the amusement centres.  The people who procure the licences through the local authorities and the law courts should be aware of the fact that they have the privilege of using the licence and also the responsibility.  They should be made to realise their responsibilities. This Bill should relieve us from pressure from the amusement caterers.</P>

      <P>I welcome the new Minister to the Seanad for the first time.

Very often the attendants in those places appear to be less than 16 years of age also.  This is not provided for in the Bill.  I regret that the Minister has not availed of this opportunity to include some method of ensuring that the bogus collectors and ticket sellers which the country appears to be plagued with are more strictly dealt with.  This is a great pity.  There are people preying on excellent charitable organisations.  This important job must be tackled.</P>

      <P>This is an amending Bill. It strikes me as strange that when we are bringing in decimal currency in a short period we did not make provision for amending section 7 in this Bill which deals with the stake of sixpence. When decimal currency is introduced the legal definition of one penny will be then what is now 2½ pence and the stake will be 1s 3d.  Once that is allowed at all there will be difficulties. People will have installed machines costing much money.  Injustice cannot <Col N="147" /> be done to them by interfering with the <i>status quo</i>.  Any encouragement to gambling, except for trifling sums and for amusement, would be very bad.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister in the course of this Bill to make provision for decimal currency.  Otherwise, when decimal currency comes into effect, and with legislative time as long as it is, I feel resonably certain there is no hope whatever that any amending legislation will be brought in for a year or two and by then the harm will have been done.</P>

      <P>Together with my colleagues in Fine Gael, I would like to extend a welcome to Deputy O'Malley as the new Minister for Justice.  Personally, I am glad once again Limerick is represented on a Ministerial basis.</P>
      <P>A number of the points I intend to raise on this Bill have already been raised by other speakers.  I should like to support those who have referred to the change to decimalisation which comes into operation in February of 1971.  I am sure the Minister will keep that in mind in endeavouring to ensure that the amount to be gambled will not be in excess of the present equivalent of 6d.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald was almost ruled out of order when he endeavoured to extend the scope of this Bill but I hope I am in order in referring to the Second Stage speech of the Minister's predecessor, the politically lamented Deputy Ó Móráin, and I quote from column 1624 of the Official Report for 21st November, 1969:</P>
      <P>This Bill restores the <i>status quo</i> to what it was before the High Court decision.  I think this is as far as we should go at this point of time.  The question of a comprehensive lottery Bill dealing with all kinds of things, such as street collections on which the law is very unsatisfactory, is another matter and would need inquiry and would need time and preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not go beyond that except to say that I hope the Minister will consider this problem, which is a serious one.  There is a never-ending stream of <Col N="148" /> collectors on the streets of our towns under the pretence of charitable collections. Some of those, to say the least, are of very tender age.  However, I shall not dwell on that point.</P>
    <P>Personally, I regard the one-armed bandits as a menace, particularly in urban areas.  I agree with the view expressed by the previous Minister for Justice that in tourist areas they are a form of harmless amusement in that they provide something for holidaymakers to do on a rainy day but, at the same time, they are an appalling nuisance. The Minister's predecessor mentioned that he was concerned about the amount of loitering in the places in which those machines are to be found.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that the law, as it stands, is not strict enough in regard to the premises in which those machines are located.  It is not unusual to find those machines in premises situated on a busy main street where they present a difficulty to the smooth movement of people on the street.  I do not know what the law is in regard to the types of premises in which those machines can be installed or, indeed, in regard to the type of machines used, but most of the ones I have seen are hideous and appalling-looking contraptions. The appearance of the premises, both inside and outside, is usually terrible.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty is that of enforcing the regulation in regard to the age restriction.  According to the law nobody under the age of 16 is allowed to operate one of those machines but, as was pointed out in the Dáil, it is almost impossible in these times to know whether a person is 14, 16 or 20. Of course, too, there is always the problem of a family of four or five seeking admission to those premises, two of whom may be 16 or 17 and the others 14 and younger.  In such a case it would be difficult to know whether to allow the older ones in and to leave the younger ones out.  There should be some regulation in regard to the number of machines that can be installed in any particular premises and as to the number of persons who are allowed into the premises at any one time.  I do not know if there is any such regulation. If there is I stand corrected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> I should like to emphasise the necessity for bringing in comprehensive legislation to deal with what I can only describe as the menace of collections. I am not in any way being critical of collections for genuine charitable purposes but, unfortunately, many collections extend far beyond that field.  It is obvious that this Bill is necessary.  To some extent, it is a makeshift technical solution to the problem which must ultimately be dealt with by legislation of a much wider scope.</P>

      <P>First of all, I, too, welcome the new Minister for Justice. I am glad of this amendment to section 10 of the Act which, I presume, was never meant to operate in the way in which it was decided by the court. There are a number of points I should like to stress.</P>
      <P>From reading the Dáil debate on the Gaming and Lotteries Act it is evident that it was never intended to have those sort of businesses in heavily-populated areas.  The problem in Dublin in this respect is very great.  The Minister's predecessor referred in the Dáil to the age-level of those frequenting the premises in which those machines are installed.  On several occasions I have had to make representations on behalf of the Dublin tourist region as to the condition of those establishments.</P>
      <P>As pointed out by Senators Nash and Russell, the change-over to decimal currency will create a problem in so far as lotteries are concerned but there are even greater problems with which we must be concerned.  In particular, there is the problem of what I would describe as semi-bogus charities.  I know this problem has already been referred to.  I was asked to make representations to the Minister's predecessor in relation to this problem.  I did so but, of course, I am only speaking from a tourist point of view when I mention the damage that has been caused to the reputation of the country by this constant pestering of visitors. Perhaps the Minister would have a look at this problem and see what can be done.  At any rate, I welcome the change in the Act.</P>

      <P>If I had my way I would <Col N="150" /> not allow a slot-machine of any kind, whether paying in front or behind, to be introduced into this country.  When I was a young man slot-machines were allowed, whether by law or not, on the main street of the town near where I lived.  One day I went to town on a message with the large sum of a half-crown in my pocket.  I saw this lovely slot-machine and I went into the shop and exchanged my half-crown for 30 pence.  I stood in front of that lovely machine and inserted penny after penny until the whole 30 pence had disappeared.  Then I stood looking at it.  Along came a gentleman, a well-known character in the town, who stood nonchantly with his hands in his pockets, then inserted a penny into the machine and, bang-bang, he got the jackpot.  I said to myself: &ldquo;Slot-machines are out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The point is that as far as the Bill is concerned you are allowing the type of machine which will not pay out direct to the person operating it but which will require a second person to pay the money.  To my mind this makes no difference.  Senator Ryan spoke about entertainment as against addiction. Anybody who plays the slot-machine will become an addict.  There is no doubt about that.  I do not believe there is any entertainment value whatsoever in slot-machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill allows the licensing of machines under certain conditions.  My opinion is that they should not be allowed in at all.  Everybody knows what happened in Chicago and what is happening in many of the cities of America at the present moment where you have the A1 Capones operating those machines on the basis that they make millions.  Once you get a licence to operate those machines the addicts come in, spend their hard earned money and then afterwards some of those other people come in to collect the money.  It is possible to manipulate any machine.  How are you to supervise those machines?  How does the Minister think he will be able to supervise them?  How can he supervise those who operate the machines from the point of view of age?  Unless people carry their birth certificates with them it is impossible to tell a 16-year-old <Col N="151" /> from a 30-year-old.  Nobody is there to say whether the person is telling the truth.  The same could apply if a garda asked somebody what age he was.</P>
    <P>Those machines are not supposed to be operated in public houses.  The law says that people under a certain age cannot be served with drink in public houses and consequently should not be there.  Therefore, a public house is a place for adults.  If you deny those machines to adults how can you bring them into public places where children of all ages will use them?  I believe, in common with other speakers, that all the Gaming and Lotteries Acts should be gone into and modified.  As far as this Bill is concerned the Minister would be wiser if he not alone repealed it but threw it out and introduced another Bill to ban those machines altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few brief remarks.  There is one part of the Minister's speech which should not be allowed to go completely unchallenged. On the first page of his speech he says:</P>
      <P>The main justification for this proposal was that the proprietors of amusement halls had invested substantial sums of money in the purchase and adaptation of these machines during the period when their use was allowed by the District Court and they thus had a very strong argument, based on established equities, for the restoration of the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We as a House of the Oireachtas and as a legislature should be very slow to allow this kind of equity to be established in this way.  If you carry this thing to its logical conclusion you are forced into a situation in which, if anybody is to be out of pocket by the application of the law, the law must be changed so that he will not be out of pocket because he has spent a great deal of money.  This should be very closely examined in a general way and also in a particular way in its relation to our whole approach to gambling and lottery.  I detect in this Bill a sort of trend to permissiveness.  People would perhaps think this is a rather unusual <Col N="152" /> line for anybody on this side of the House to take.</P>

      <P>In this House we are too often very uncritical in our attitude towards things like gambling.  We should look, if we are serious about the many and varied claims which we make concerning the reunification of the country, to the very high moral purpose, perverted though it may be in certain instances, which informs the attitude of some of our northern brethren to the whole question of gambling.  We do not pay enough attention to this.</P>
      <P>We are wrong in the first place in allowing a great deal of the gambling that takes place.  In the second place we are wrong by not taxing it adequately.  If we were to examine this, if we were to examine the amount of money that is spent in pursuits of this kind, money which in all conscience passes the normal kind of small change operation which is envisaged in this kind of Bill, we would have a very different approach and a very different idea of the morality of spending money.</P>
      <P>People talk in rather flatulent terms of public morality.  In the south our public morality in terms of our approach to gambling, and in terms of the approach to gambling exemplified in this Bill, should be very seriously examined indeed.  I would be very interested to hear, when the Minister is replying, whether he has considered the impact of this kind of legislation on the very large proportion of the population in the northern part of this island and whether he proposes to modify or otherwise change his attitude towards gambling legislation in the future on account of this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> The Bill, in this House as in the Dáil, has received general acceptance, but if I may make a few observations on some of the speeches which were made I would refer first to Senator O'Higgins when he said that he felt the Government might be going too far in this Bill in repealing section 10 altogether, and when he said that perhaps the reinstatement of the law as it was thought to be during the twelve-year period between the passing of the 1956 Act and the Supreme Court decision would have been adequate.</P>
    <P>That was the original feeling of my predecessor, but as a result of the speeches of Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan and Deputy Pattison in the Dáil, and in particular Deputy Fitzpatrick's statement, reported in Volume 242, column 1619 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think that pending that time the Minister should go a bit further here and permit the operation of machines which honestly and openly deliver the prize out of the front, because here we are really permitting the operation of these gaming machines but we are insisting that they be operated with the assistance of an attendant at the rear&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;it was as a result of statements of that nature in the Dáil that my predecessor saw fit to go a bit further and to repeal the section altogether rather than to amend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  The Bill originally introduced in the Dáil by my predecessor provided what Deputy O'Higgins has suggested, but as a result of pressure from the Opposition benches my predecessor in the Dáil put down an amendment on Report Stage to meet their wishes and that is the form in which the Bill has been introduced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister in the Dáil went further than Deputy Fitzpatrick wanted.  That is my recollection of it from reading the Dáil reports of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputies Fitzpatrick and Pattison suggested in the Dáil for the reason that it simplifies the matter.  Any law that is unnecessarily complicated and difficult to enforce will bring all law into disrepute to some degree or another.  Whatever else can be said about this Bill, it is clear-cut and, I think, sensible from that point of view.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators referred to the fact that local authorities had a certain amount of control, and I think it was Senator O'Higgins who stated that apart from that there is very little other control.  Before I deal with other controls, I think it might not be any harm to speak about the control the local authorities have under the 1956 Act. They had more or less absolute discretion as to whether to allow gaming in any part of their administrative areas.  I think it was envisaged by the Oireachtas in the 1956 Act that local authorities would be selective in the sort of areas in respect of which they would make declarations, or whatever the appropriate word in the Act is.</P>
      <P>Since 1956, local authorities have been anything but selective.  Many of them gave approval in blanket fashion for their administrative areas.  In that way they lost a great deal of the control which the 1956 Act would have given to them and this would have prevented the sort of development Senators and many people outside have complained about.  One example frequently cited is the main street of this city which was regarded as one of the finest streets in Europe but which now cannot be regarded as being one of them.  One of the contributing factors is the profusion of gaming establishments in O'Connell Street.  Dublin Corporation would have had control of that situation if they had wished to exercise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell said that it was frequently in main streets these premises were established.  In every case that can only have been done with the approval of the local authority concerned, and I am afraid the local authority of which Senator Russell is a member of have allowed the establishment of one such premises in the main street in Limerick, a matter which I <Col N="155" /> regret.  However, I should point out to the House and to Senators who are members of local authorities that it is open to local authorities to rescind any decision they have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in the section to ensure that notice is given, that copies of notices are served on members.  I should like to point out at this stage that in addition to the control the 1956 Act gave to local authorities, the district court also exercises considerable control.  Senator Russell mentioned matters relating to these gaming establishments, such as the number of machines that would be allowed in any one of them and the type of premises in which this form of gaming be carried on.  These are all matters which the district court takes cognisance of and in issuing its certificate, which is necessary before a licence can be obtained from the Revenue Commissioners, the district court can impose conditions relating to any or all of these topics which have given rise to these complaints.</P>
      <P>A matter raised by a number of Senators, first by Senator Nash, was the sixpence maximum stake and the possibility of what could happen on the introduction of decimal currency. Senator Nash was of the opinion that the maximum stake would automatically be converted to six new pence which would be, perhaps, 1s 3d in present currency.  That, of course, is not so.  In the Decimal Currency Bill now before the Dáil, one of the schedules sets out in relation to statutory conversion of old currency to new, that any reference in any document, any Act, any formal legal document, to currency in the old form will be converted automatically to the corresponding amount set out in that schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there can be no question of the introduction to decimal currency <Col N="156" /> resulting in an increase in real terms in the permissible stake.  It will still be the equivalent of six old pence which, I think, represents 2½ new pence.  Several Senators said they hoped no increase would be allowed by the conversion to decimal currency or otherwise.  As far as I am concerned I readily give the strongest assurance to the House that in no circumstances would I countenance any increase in the maximum permitted stake above six old pence or the equivalent in decimal currency.</P>
    <P>It is no harm that this statement should be made now because if pressure were to come from some of the people interested in these machines at a later stage, I should like to be able to refer to my statement to this effect at this time.  If any converting has to be done to these machines as a result of the introduction of decimal currency, the people responsible had better start converting on the basis of new pence, either 2.4 pence or 4.8 pence, because I would not countenance, and I doubt if this House would countenance, any increase in the stake money above sixpence in present values.</P>
    <P>Another point made by many Senators who readily saw the difficulty of enforcing it was the question of the age limit.  It is very difficult for the proprietors of those gaming premises or for the Garda to be sure whether a person is 14, 15, 16 or 17 years of age.  One could probably go a long way either side of these figures and still be in some doubt as to the correct age of the person.  I think all concerned, and this applies to both proprietors and operators, should make every effort to prevent people about whose age they are in doubt from gaming on the premises or loitering in them.  I will encourage the Garda to enforce this aspect of the law as best they can, although I readily realise their difficulties.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan took exception to a sentence in my opening remarks, presumably on a philosophical rather than on a practical basis.  While he quoted one sentence of my speech I think he should have gone on to quote the next sentence because the next sentence cuts the ground from under his own argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. The fact of the matter is that those people apparently pointed out to my predecessor that they had a very specialised type of machine which was designed to pay out from the back or pay through an attendant.  They asked to be allowed to retain it and they have been allowed to retain it, although they are also able to use the more usual and easily obtained type of machine.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to this form of gaming on licensed premises. There is a specific section in the 1956 Act prohibiting this.  I understand that due to the slightly doubtful state of the law on these matters in the last year or so some proprietors of licensed premises were foolish enough to install slot machines on their premises.  I want to take this opportunity of pointing out that it is a serious offence to carry on this or any other form of gaming on their premises.  In fact, under the 1956 Act it is an endorsable offence on their intoxicating liquor licence.  This is something easily detectable and the Garda will have no hesitation in enforcing it fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give the Film Censor and the Censorship of Films Appeal Board jurisdiction to deal with an application for the re-censoring of a film that has already been the subject of a censorship decision taken before the 18th January, 1965 or more than seven years prior to the date of the application, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>A film may not be exhibited in public unless a certificate in respect of it has been issued by the Film Censor. The Censor may grant either a full certificate allowing the general exhibition of the film or a limited certificate allowing the exhibition subject to conditions such as the exclusion of persons under a certain age.  An appeal against the Censor's decision lies to the Appeal Board, whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1965 it was not the practice to grant limited certificates.  For some time before that, however, the film producers had been moving away from the traditional type of film designed for family viewing on to so-called adult films, and it was in the context of that development that the practice of issuing limited certificates was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The granting of limited certificates <Col N="159" /> has meant that since January, 1965 a number of films have been passed for adult viewing which up to then would have been refused certificates or would have been severely cut.  Conversely, it may be assumed that a number of films that were refused certificates before January, 1965, would have qualified for a limited certificate if such a system had been in operation at the time they were submitted.  There is, therefore, a very good case, in principle, for altering the present law so that a film that was cut or rejected in, say, 1964 should now be eligible to be reconsidered.  The Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The question of films which were rejected or cut before January, 1965 is a specific, non-recurring problem.  However, the broader and more permanent question of gradually changing standards must also be considered, just as it had to be considered a couple of years ago in relation to books.  On this aspect, the best solution appears to be to allow a fresh application to be made to the Film Censor in respect of any particular film after some specified period.  The period specified in the Bill is seven years.  I think that that is a reasonable period to select in this particular context.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that, under the Censorship of Publications Act, 1967, a prohibition order made in respect of a book ceases to have effect after 12 years.  There are, however, important differences to be borne in mind in deciding on any comparable relaxation in the case of films.  A book which has been prohibited on the grounds that it is indecent or obscene may be placed on sale to the public once the ban expires without being resubmitted for censorship&mdash;though of course it may be prohibited again if the Board examine it and think it ought to be prohibited.</P>
    <P>The position is otherwise with films, since no film may be exhibited in public without a certificate from the Censor. Because of this important difference, we can safely adopt a shorter period for films without any risk that films unacceptable by the current standards of the Censor or the Appeal Board can be put <Col N="160" /> in circulation.  Moreover, because of social and fashion changes, and because of technical advances in photography and associated techniques, films become out of date quickly and, once we accept the principle of resubmitting films, the resubmission should be allowed within a reasonably short period of years, as the passage of time could make them commercially useless or nearly so.</P>
    <P>Senators will notice that the proposal in the Bill is that the application for reconsideration of a film should be made to the Censor in the first instance and not the Appeal Board and this is so even if the earlier decision was made or endorsed by the Appeal Board.  This is the right procedure, in my view, because the application will be based, even if only implicitly, on changes in prevailing attitudes that have occurred in the meantime and not on any suggestion that the earlier decision was unjustified at the time it was made. There is also an important practical reason for dealing with the matter in this way, namely, that the film Censor is a whole-time salaried officer, whereas the Appeal Board is a part-time voluntary Board which ought not to be expected to undertake work that can appropriately be done otherwise.  If, in any particular case, the Censor gives a decision unfavourable to the renter, the renter may of course appeal.</P>
    <P>In recommending the Bill to the House I should like to emphasise that it is designed to deal with practical issues, taking account first of all of the fact that we have had this change of practice about limited certificates and, secondly, of the fact that standards of what is or is not acceptable on the screen change over a period and the system must allow for that.  Indeed, if we do not have some flexibility of this kind, we will inevitably find ourselves in the wholly indefensible position that films that are being shown on television cannot be shown in cinemas because the application for a Film Censor's certificate was made several years earlier and was judged by the standards of the day.</P>
    <P>One thing the Bill is not intended to be is some kind of signal for easier censorship than that now prevailing. Neither does it imply that, because a <Col N="161" /> film is restricted to viewers over 18, there can be no justification, ever, for making any cuts in it.  Those of you who have some knowledge of the content of certain films produced in recent times will readily agree that the idea of their being shown in cinemas in this country, even for adult viewing, would be unacceptable to the vast majority of the people here.  The Censor and the Appeal Board will themselves be well aware that there is no question of the Bill being meant to promote or encourage a drop in standards and the House can be fully assured that, in the independent discharge of their functions, both Censor and Board will continue to do what in their judgment is necessary to protect the public interest.</P>
    <P>With that I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister to this House in the exact language used by Senator O'Higgins.  I welcome him here also as a son of his father who was a friend of mine whom I greatly respected.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill entitled an Act to amend and extend the Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1930.  I understood this Bill was to be the first item to be dealt with today and feel I have been speaking for hours.  After six minutes I'm afraid you will have the same feeling.  I have a sense of responsibility about this Bill and wish to treat it in a particular way.  It is relevant to the consideration of this Bill to say that it is an amending Bill, amending Censorship of Films Act, 1923.  But the legal foundation of censorship here is the Cinematograph Act, 1909, which in its precise terms seemed to concern itself simply with determining the material conditions to be complied with by a licence holder in order to be permitted to show a film in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of a series of High Court decisions it was established that other conditions could be attached. Not merely could natural fire be guarded against but hell fire also. Under the Cinematograph Act, 1909 the great difficulty was that the local authorities were the bodies which had <Col N="162" /> the power to give these licences.  It was a situation which permitted a film to be shown in Blackrock which could be refused to be shown in O'Connell Street and which allowed a film to be shown in Wexford which could not be shown in Waterford.  I am choosing these places to show preference.  Certain performances were permitted in some places and not in others.  The purpose of the 1923 Act was to centralise this by establishing a central authority for the determination of films suitable to be shown in public in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have a tendency to be insecure in our faith and insufficiently to value our traditions. This feeling may come from international criticism of the operation of censorship of books here.  Much of that criticism was justified in all too long a period of time.  Much that we did in that regard was unwise and involved a lack of sophistication and awareness of the realities of the problems that exist.  The Censorship of Films Act, 1923, which we are amending, was not introduced by agricultural &ldquo;Paddies&rdquo; who sought to assist the clergy in imposing censorship on the people.  This amending was an existing Censorship Act in Britain in 1929. Neither did the idea of censorship suddenly emerge in 1909.  It had a very ancient tradition.</P>
    <P>The theory behind censorship is as old as Greco-Roman civilisation.  There was censorship of a kind recommended then that no one in Ireland today would favour.  Plato favoured it 2,400 years ago.  Alfred North Whitehead, a great scientist whose Dialogues will be well known to the Leas-Chathaoirleach, regarded as the greatest intellect ever produced in the history of Europe, yet that great intellect was in favour of the absolute prohibition of all drama.</P>

      <P>I am glad to treat Plato as a European figure. If Senator Horgan would address his remarks to the Chair I would find it easier to deal with them.  Plato was in favour of the prohibition of all <Col N="163" /> drama as being dangerous to the morality of the State.  Plato thought that the whole purpose was to make people good by educating them. Making people good through education it may be remarked was a fallacy later to be exposed.  The early Christian Fathers supported Plato.  St. Augustine supported him.  Then we have the great figure of Collier in this tradition who attacked Restoration drama which came back with the Stuarts from their sojourn in France influenced by the mores of the time much as Englishmen and Irishmen have since returned from France under similar influences. We have the great Bossuet, a very great man, who thought that all drama should be banned completely because it excited dangerous passions.</P>
      <P>They were all supported by the surprising figure of Rousseau who thought that drama was part of the civilisation which was corrupting the natural man. This led to Voltaire remarking of Rousseau that he had become an early Christian Father.  All subsequent Platonists are in that tradition and I think it will be found that in relation to their children all parents are Platonists.</P>

      <P>I shall leave the philosophy of Bertrand Russell to Senator Keery to develop with the skill which I am sure he will bring to bear on it.  Ranging on the other side of this, there is, of course, Aristotle and following him, St. Thomas and, surprisingly, Queen Elizabeth I who sponsored the Shakespearean drama in opposition to all advice given to her by the scholars of her day, Sir Philip Sidney being prominent among them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the leading opponent of all of censorship of any kind was Milton, and Senator Keery might like to be reminded, through the Chair, that although Milton recommended, in the most extreme terms, liberty of every kind, he went on to make it quite <Col N="164" /> clear that this did not mean that it would be possible &ldquo;to tolerate popery or open superstition which, as it extirpates all religion and civil supremacies so itself should be extirpated&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the real problem of censorship and art, which is the reason why I am speaking on these lines, I want to deal with the simple matter of pornography.  At this moment the law in the United States of America is that one must conform with three requirements before pornography is legally proved.  I shall give only the third requirement and that is &ldquo;that it be utterly without redeeming social value&rdquo;.  If it has any redeeming social value then it is not pornography and is permissible.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to pornography is that in fact if we go back to the meaning of the word we will find that it is the stock in trade of the oldest profession in the world and the evidence of the professionals on pornography as to the effect of pornography in assisting them in the pursuit of their trade is that it does affect behaviour.  In arousing the passions that those ladies are concerned to arouse, they provide evidence which ranges wholly on the side of those who say it is the duty of the State to legislate for the improvement of and to prevent the corruption of man.</P>
    <P>This professional evidence confirms a profound Christian insight into the corruptibility of human nature which has always pointed out the solid reality that if we look into our own thoughts and hearts we must realise how difficult it is for any man to live well.  I am reminded of Chesterton's quip which went something like this&mdash;I may not have the exact wording:</P>
    <P>The strange thing about man is that he is made in the image of God. He is the paragon of animals but he is not to be trusted.</P>
    <P>The centrality of love, <i>l'amour</i>&mdash;this is an interesting point&mdash;among the passions, and its protean manifestations in all forms of desire and aversion, is a Christian insight anticipated by Plato but more interestingly confirmed by the scientific research of Freud.  In rejecting the Supreme Court of America's view <Col N="165" /> of this, I take the position that the evil of obscenity is a moral principle in which Plato, Aristotle and many others concur with Christianity.  How great an effect it has on the human soul is another matter&mdash;it is a question of fact to be investigated.</P>
    <P>I do not require the result of these investigations to take my position but I am informed that such investigations are being carried out and it is questionable as to the morality of the procedures adopted in ascertaining scientifically the truth of this Christian insight confirmed by the Platonic-Aristotelian tradition.  I am dealing with sex only at the moment but it is quite common to hear people say that in their opinion it is much more objectionable to have scenes of violence permitted on the screen.  These scenes of violence are seen immediately, in some way, to affect behaviour while erotic scenes are not considered as affecting behaviour.</P>
    <P>As well as condemning erotic scenes I condemn scenes of violence, but, in fact, I shall be suggesting to the House that there are grave doubts as to whether cutting either of them can be considered as being the appropriate procedure when dealing with this particular art form.  I would be interested if someone who is more attuned to the thought of what I call the Left&mdash; I, myself, am described as Left but sometimes I do not know what that means&mdash;could throw some light on the curious fact that the Left which is so critical of capitalism in all its manifestations never criticises, as far as I know, this appalling capitalistic institution of producing pornography.</P>
    <P>The society in which we live is obviously an extraordinarily transitional one, a period which is practically post-Christian certainly in most of the previously Christianised world.  Most of the world have come to accept a kind of philosophy of life which has not been expressed in any terms that one could intellectually accept.  It is obviously leading to rejection as is evident in the conduct of the young.  The affluent society does not produce the happy society.  If we think about this we will realise that is not surprising.  It is not specifically a Christian idea that <Col N="166" /> there are higher and lower pleasures. This is not merely a Platonic-Aristotelian feature but is a feature of the stoic and the epicurean philosophy.</P>
    <P>The epicureans thought that the object of life was to derive pleasure but one does not derive pleasure by simply seeking out its coarser forms. In fact one of the sayings attributed to Epicurus was &ldquo;Do not increase but diminish my desires: this is the easiest way for me to achieve pleasure, to be happy&rdquo;; and then there was the observation of Cicero: &ldquo;When we withdraw the mind from pleasure and business, we separate the mind from the body and we learn to die&rdquo;.  That is really what we are all living to do, learning how to die.  It is interesting to note the combination of business and pleasure because, for many, business is a kind of pleasure; it is a kind of distraction from the other things they ought to be thinking about, an escape from themselves.</P>
    <P>I am coming now to deal with the question of laws and what sort of laws you can and should have in dealing with this matter.  Laws obviously cannot be concerned with preventing sin. Certainly they have been notably unsuccessful in achieving what they set out to do.  They could not for example seek to prevent those acts in private which even elephants take care to carry out in private.  The laws which in fact are only possible are laws which deal with the aspects of conduct which are predominantly social and are concerned with the common good, that is to say with the peace and prosperity of men and society.  But laws that are good laws should seek to create conditions under which morality can develop.</P>
    <P>Among those, not the least important is a law which preserves freedom for people from compulsion by others. Recently I went to buy a couple of detective books for a person who was sick.  I picked up book after book and the covers were full of the usual stuff of photographs of half-naked women. I said to myself: &ldquo;This must be wrong. It is an invasion of my privacy.  I do not want to see those bloody women so why should I be required to?  It seems to me to be that a law creating conditions <Col N="167" /> under which I would not be forced to see those spectacles, that my freedom not to see them would not be interfered with, would be a good law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Laws must, of course, as the Minister said&mdash;this is the effect of what he said&mdash;have regard to the level of expectations at any time, must have regard to what the people, for whom they are being enacted, will regard as just and therefore they may vary from time to time.  We have here a Christian culture and an inheritance which we should seek to preserve but we must recognise the increasing difficulty we have in preserving it because with the increasing communications we are living in a world which is now furnished like a bawdy house.</P>
    <P>I do not find criticism of films as seriously done as it ought to be done. There is an assumption which indicates complete lack of self-confidence, a lack of confidence in our own values, assumptions made which show a weakness in the critics.  I want to quote one or two sentences from a psychological writing on the period of adolescence:</P>
    <P>The individual may be compared to a violin.  Previously the instrument may have seemed to be a cigar box strung with cat-gut.  At adolescence it may seem suddenly to become a Stradivarius played on by varying forces.  It sometimes responds as if played by a concert master, at other times as if by an untalented amateur. At times it refuses to produce music at all.</P>
    <P>The point is not to be lost and that is all the evidence is that the exposure of adolescence to pornography can permanently endanger the whole stability of their psychology and the quality of the life they have to live.  It is right to precede this quotation from C.S. Lewis with one from Milton, which is very good.  C.S. Lewis says:</P>
    <P>Without the aid of training emotions the intellect is powerless against the animal organism.</P>
    <P>Milton says in a magnificent passage:</P>
    <P>He that can apprehend and consider vice with all her baits and <Col N="168" /> seeming pleasures and yet abstain and yet distinguish and yet prefer that which is truly better he is the true war-faring Christian.</P>
    <P>He then goes on with the famous phrase:</P>
    <P>I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue unexercised and unbreathed, that never sallies out and sees her adversary but slinks out of the race where that immortal garland is to be run for not without the dust and heat.  Assuredly we bring not innocence into the world, we bring purity much rather.  That which purifies us is trial and trial is by what is contrary.</P>
    <P>Finally, he uses the words:</P>
    <P>To sequester out of the world into Atlantic and utopian polities which can never be drawn into use will not mend our condition.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to tell the House that I have not actually reached the main theme of my speech.  I can see it is fascinating the Minister.  Art is intrinsically and primarily good, for a man deprived of the pleasures of the spirit goes over to the pleasures of the body. Art teaches men the pleasures of the spirit.  Arts are able to perform the same function for every type of man.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting quotation from a debate in this House when the Censorship of Films Act was first enacted, that is an observation made by the father of our present Cathaoirleach when he intervened in the debate. He obviously had not given consideration to the solid fact that the film is a definite art form and a particularly cerebral one.  He was drawn into the debate in some way.  It is interesting to note he did not oppose the Censorship of Films Act.  He thought it irrelevant, unimportant, but somebody made the point about the effect of a bad film on somebody.  He said that this is a great problem for an artist.</P>
    <P>He described how his friend, James Stephens, had written a book in which he described a man drowning himself and how a body was fished out of the Liffey and in the pocket of the clothing of the drowned man was found a copy of James Stephens's book.  He comforted Stephens by saying that Goethe had <Col N="169" /> had a like experience.  He too had written a book in which he gave an account of a man drowning himself and again a body was fished out and in the pocket of the clothes worn by that drowned man was Goethe's work. It is a magnificent comment on Goethe and W. B. Yeats for Goethe reconciled himself by thinking of the number of people who had not drowned themselves as a result of reading his book.</P>
    <P>Aristotle, if I may be forgiven for referring to him again, spoke of art as having three justifications, first giving a contemplative pleasure, secondly affecting a purgation of emotions which have been raised because they are real emotions and entertainment. Dewey, the American philosopher, adds as a fourth justification for art&mdash; and I can see that the Minister is going to give great attention to this&mdash;the value of communication and that it effects in fact communication between people, eliminates loneliness, and provides alternatives, as the drama and certain cinema do also, to other baser types of activities.</P>
    <P>Shakespearian drama, for example. It is worth reflecting on that you had to come to the time of the modern cinema to have the same sort of numbers of people and the kind of people attending the play that attended Shakespeare's plays in the city of London.  At the time Shakespeare's plays were produced there, as far as figures were established the population of London was about 100,000 and it is calculated that 30,000 people a week went to Shakespearian drama and that few of them were able to read.  They all went for the joy of the story and the exciting themes which in fact, as we all know, Shakespeare dealt with.</P>
    <P>On the question of why censorship? This becomes an immense and difficult problem because the cinema and the drama are arts which generally share the same object, the imitation of human action, and the imitation of human action with modern techniques raises very serious problems in that imitation leads to a further imitation in human conduct.  The cinema is a new form of an old problem and a question for prudence to resolve&mdash;<Col N="170" /> how prudently that natural thing, liberty, is in fact properly and wisely to be restricted.</P>
    <P>Maritain distinguishes moral activity and artistic activity.  In saying what I want to say about art I want first to quote from the great historian Lord Acton who said that it was because the fine arts represent all those forces in mankind that it was necessary to undertake the history of mankind to get them into focus.  Art is concerned, Maritain says, with all that pertains to making it.  What I now want to give is entirely a summary of Maritain's position.  It will be long but I think that it is a useful one for the Minister's advisers to consider.</P>
    <P>Art resides in the will and is a certain perfection of the soul.  It is an inner quality or stable and deep rooted disposition that raises the human subject and his natural powers to a higher degree of vital formation and energy or that makes him possessed of a particular strength of his own.  When a master quality has become developed it becomes our most treasured good, our most unbending strength because it is an ennoblement in the very kingdom of human nature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to talk of the temptation of artists to devote all their powers to their art and in doing so damage their own souls.  He comments that Wilde's observation that a man being a poisoner never stopped a man writing good prose, by observing that poison finally finished the prose writer.</P>
    <P>On this question of the themes which it is appropriate for the cinema or drama to treat I think it is necessary to say that no theme can be excluded. St. Paul in his great observation&mdash;I have forgotten precisely the words&mdash; said &ldquo;let certain things not be so much as mentioned among you&rdquo; and he then proceeds to mention them all and obviously indicates the themes as being themes suitable for consideration.</P>
    <P>Now the whole justification for an artist dealing with a theme is to be found in the Aristotelian idea of purgation, that is to say, that the emotion which is aroused&mdash;in fact there is a <Col N="171" /> catharsis, that is a purging, and in this way in fact much evil action is avoided by every theme being treated with very great artistry.  But every activity which is bad is not to be imitated, and I am left with the great difficulty in relation to this whole question of censorship, personally, that I take up the position finally myself that the intention of the artist is irrelevant to the consideration of the final work he produces.  People who make and attend films which deal with themes may be unfitted in fact to treat and to consider the themes by watching the film because they are unable to avoid conniving at the evil they are depicting or viewing.</P>
    <P>I am affected in this sort of view by the remarkable fact that the Minister may be able to give me some information on, but on the information available to me as far as I know there is no great work of cinema, of film, dealing with the appalling consequences of venereal disease.  It is only in the last few months that people who were not brought up in the lore available to the children of medical practitioners who learned that Lord Randolph Churchill died of syphilis, and for the last 20 years of his life he was mad and in the most appalling degradation of circumstances.  It is curious that while love is treated in the way it is, the consequences of permissiveness, as far as I know, have not been treated at all.  Perhaps I am wrong in this.  I would like to be told that I was.</P>
    <P>But I do not want to just tell you what my difficulty is with regard to the making of a film.  My difficulty is this &mdash;that we were all brought up to live with the idea of Bowdler as being anathema who bowdlerised Shakespeare and the Bible; and the Bible is very good by the way&mdash;&ldquo;Blessed be the womb that bore thee and the paps that gave thee suck&rdquo;; &ldquo;and the Word was made flesh&rdquo;&mdash;not soul be it noted. The true Christian tradition is that the body as well as the soul is recognised as being part in creation and to be respected.</P>
    <P>On this matter of making films, as I understand this thing&mdash;and I am a man <Col N="172" /> here requiring more information than I have&mdash;I have feeling that this is a subject too important to avoid treating despite the kind of dangers to which it exposes myself of being pompous.  As to the actual making of films, it consists of cutting, that the director of the film makes a series of sequences and makes very much more film than he ever shows in the film he finally produces. The work of art is to cut the photographs, and the presentation of those photographs, of particular sequences, to cut certain things and leave in certain things.  Now that therefore may leave us with the great difficulty intellectually of saying how it can be proper to cut the film which purports to be a work of art and purports because it is a sufficient catharsis, proper to be shown in public, because after all we cannot have a cloistered virtue and people must learn to be aware of the Christian teaching about their own weaknesses and how they can be controlled.</P>
    <P>Something which might be considered on Committee Stage is that it should be perhaps open to a censor to say of a certain film that it would be seen generally or seen by a limited audience&mdash;presumably a reference to age&mdash;or that the film, though a work of art but of degraded art, is not one which in Ireland should be shown publicly. I am not sure that I like to leave in the power of the censor the ability to cut because this, for him, would be more than Bowdler did: he cut our paragraphs but he did not rewrite sentences.</P>
    <P>I shall end with the observation that the same grounds which made dramatic poetry the primary object of Plato's concern when he was 20 remained his concern in his eighties.  This thought makes the cinema more than anything else the outstanding social and political problem of our day.  I made inquiries, but I may have been misled on this or did not pursue them enough and I do not think we get reports on the procedures attached to film censorship. Therefore, there may be a lot to be said for the establishment of a committee of appropriate persons to consider how censorship has worked in Ireland and to continue to review the operation of film censorship.  This involves the <Col N="173" /> whole question of pornography, whether it appears in films or otherwise, and the whole question of the wisdom of protection in society.  It is, of course, a matter of prudence.  We have the generation gap, and conditions are very different in 1970 to what they were in 1923.  Therefore I should like to feel that some body of persons, of which I would not wish to be one, would consider this in all its aspects&mdash;legal, moral, artistic and otherwise.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that though fascinated by Senator FitzGerald's address, the Bill has to do with re-introducing films which were banned at one time and which are being resubmitted.

      <P>Like other Senators, I wish to welcome the new Minister for Justice and to congratuate him on his appointment.  I hope it will become apparent towards the end of what I have to say why I particularly welcome his presence as a young man.  Having listened to Senator FitzGerald speak, I would be very interested to hear the reaction to Senator FitzGerald should at some future date some citizen of Dublin be dragged from the Liffey with a bound volume of the Seanad speeches of Senator FitzGerald in his pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going on to welcome the Bill I should like to draw attention to one of the points made by the Minister in his opening address.  He pointed out <Col N="174" /> that prior to 1965 the film censor and the appeal board had not made very great use of their powers to grant limited certificates for the showing of films.  I think this new trend by the censor and by the board to grant certificates for films, limited usually by a stipulation of age, is a welcome change. It is, in fact, the main cause for the introduction of the Bill in that obviously films which were screened prior to 1965, when neither the censor nor the appeal board were of a mind to use this power to give a limited certificate, should be open to review.  Some of them may be allowed for completely open viewing but I imagine a fair number of films to be resubmitted may get limited certificates.  It is to be welcomed that the censor and the appeal board are now working in this way using the full powers they have been given.</P>
    <P>The main reason I welcome the Bill is that it will allow films of enduring aesthetic merit, which have not been available for public showing in this country, to be resubmitted to the censor and the appeal board.  I think it is worth pointing out that the film, in fact, is an art form.  This is something which is very much overlooked in our society.  There is a tendency to regard the film as trivial, as just a form of entertainment.  In my view the film is now definitely an art form and it is good to think that some works of such directors as Bergman, Resnaio and Bunuel which have not yet been seen here may be cleared for general exhibition if they are submitted by the renters as a result of the passing of this legislation.  This is a welcome change.</P>
    <P>We cannot, of course, point to specific examples of films of aesthetic merit which may have been rejected, because at present it is not the practice for the censor or the appeal board to reveal the names of rejected films.  This is one of the reasons why the Dáil debate on this Bill was unreal and limited.  The main reason for the interest in discussion of literary censorship in the past has been because specific works of prominent Irish authors could be pointed to as works which had been banned by the literary censorship board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> Because of existing practice, on this occasion we cannot point to specific films which have been placed before the censor and the appeal board and rejected.  An interesting point here, and this relates to part of what Senator FitzGerald had to say, is that aesthetic values have proved to be more enduring, in my view, than moral values.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that there are changes from time to time in the prevailing attitudes of the community and that yet there is no reason to regard the present Bill as allowing any change in the standards exercised by the censor and the appeal board. In our own time the change in moral standards is barely perceptible.  The censor and the appeal board, using the new powers given to them under this Bill, will not change their standards tomorrow but in seven or eight years time, when reviewing films which they would reject at present, they may well clear them for public exhibition.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Society and Radio-Telefís Éireann have done exceptionally good work in helping to raise the standards of film appreciation.  In this way they have helped to educate the community to understand aesthetic matters.  I think the Irish Film Society have had their influence on the film renters in this city.  They have gradually educated a sufficiently large section of the community to justify showing what are called art films in small cinemas throughout the city.  I believe membership of the Irish Film Society is suffering because so many of the films which in the past would only have been seen by members of that society are now available to the public at large.  I hope RTE will continue to show programmes devoted to the techniques of the cinema, linking them up with commentaries showing the development of the film as an art form.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald talked about the problem of whether one should regard the erotic or the violent as the more dangerous element in the cinema. When looking at the work of the censor and appeal board we must focus our attention on erotic and violent films. To my mind the Irish censor and <Col N="176" /> appeal board are &ldquo;hard&rdquo; on sex and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; on violence.  I apologise for that jargonned phrase.  I can explain what I mean by quoting from a letter printed in the correspondence column of the winter 1966-67 issue of <i>Sight and Sound,</i> the quarterly published by the British Film Institute, about the work of the New Zealand censorship board.  The correspondent says:</P>
    <P>The Board is capable of very inconsistent decisions.  &ldquo;The Knack&rdquo; was banned by the censor, the distributor referred the film to the appeals board which passed the film without cuts, after an argument on the effect of removing the rape scene.  Conversely the censor passed, subject to excisions, Wyler's &ldquo;The Collector&rdquo;, but the appeals board banned the film entirely.</P>
    <P>That is interesting because we are able to refer to specific examples here.  We have not seen &ldquo;The Knack&rdquo; but we have seen &ldquo;The Collector&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The Collector&rdquo; is a film about a homicidal maniac who collects girls as one collects butterflies.  &ldquo;The Knack&rdquo; is a film dealing with a sexual matter in a lighthearted sort of way.  But even though &ldquo;The Collector&rdquo; was on general view &ldquo;The Knack&rdquo; was not even shown to limited audiences.  The treatment accorded to &ldquo;The Knack&rdquo; may possibly be part of what John Mortimer, the playwright, has described as the tendency of any censor to induce political and social conformity.</P>
    <P>The censor and appeal board seem to be particularly hard on films involving Irish actors or films set in an Irish setting because, I imagine, they feel those films may have a greater impact on the community.  I can appreciate why they do this but I think they are in a sense exceeding their brief which is simply to deal with matters of indecency and morality.</P>
    <P>Returning to the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; on sex and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; on violence aspect, this is very important, in my view, because research has shown&mdash;and I am happy to tell Senator FitzGerald that considerable research is being done on the effects of films on the community&mdash; that films have an impact on people <Col N="177" /> who are pathologically disturbed in some way.  In the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of Tuesday, 19th May, 1970, there was a report of a new research study on television.  It stated:</P>
    <P>This survey states emphatically that violence and sex on television do not cause juvenile delinquency. But it admits that in a small number of cases, among pathological youngsters, it might be a contributory factor in their leaning towards crime.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about this finding, because I was disturbed by some other facts recently revealed in the first report of our Medico-Social Research Board.  This report showed that the number of patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals in this country per 1,000 of the population is twice as high as it is in England and Wales.  This is a matter of concern as it indicates that we may have a larger proportion of people susceptible to the influence of films and television in our community than is common elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I suggest that here also the community's views of sex and violence are extremely important because sexual matters, as Senators know, play a very great part in the causes of mental illness.  It is particularly tragic for young people to grow up with an impression of sex associated with a spirit of cruelty or a lack of tenderness and love; yet, I think, when reviewing films, the censor and the appeal board perhaps tend to dismiss sexual content of any kind regardless of whether it is associated with tenderness and love between people.  I hope I have made my point clear.  When a film viewed as a unit puts sexuality in a proper constructive human context, that is something which one should view more sympathetically than sex placed in a completely different atmosphere, an atmosphere of deception or an atmosphere in which there is obviously no proper love relationship between the characters concerned.  I would ask that the censor and the appeal board when viewing films will bear these factors in mind.</P>
    <P>In the same way, I would suggest that when viewing films they should make a clear distinction between films in which violence appears simply for <Col N="178" /> its own sake and where it is portrayed as the crass stupidity which it is. Through softness on violence we often see too much gratuitous violence alongside violence placed in its proper context, as something alien and harmful in any society.</P>
    <P>At this time in our community, and particularly because of some aspects of the community to which I have referred, there is great need for full and frank discussion of the general standards used by the censor and the appeal board.  I would not go as far as Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  I would not feel it was necessary to have a statutory body to do this type of work.  One example I can use to justify the need for this discussion appeared in <i>Orbit,</i> a special newspaper produced on Communications Day and published on 10th May by the Catholic Communications Institution of Ireland.  I understand this was available at every church gate in the country.  Michael Henry wrote:</P>
    <P>The Government is obviously not acting.  The ordinary citizen gets more confused.  Somebody must have made a decision to allow the current crop of eroticism to erupt in this country.  Who made this decision? Did he make it in the nation's name?</P>
    <P>I suggest that Henry should have known that any decisions regarding either publications or films in this country rested with statutory bodies approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this way it was the people themselves who institutionalised their values in the censor and the censorship appeal board.  The asking of such questions, however, underlines the importance of getting across to the community at large what exactly the censor does and what the appeal board do, and the values and criteria which they use in their work.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that if we are to have this type of discussion we are somewhat handicapped by not being able to refer to specific films as examples.  In asking for this type of discussion and understanding, I suggest to the public and the censorship authorities that when they are disturbed by either erotic or violent content in films they should pay due <Col N="179" /> attention to the context in which this content arrives and that they should try to view films as complete units. Because of the technical matters to which Senator Alexis FitzGerald referred, it is particularly important to understand this request.  As the Senator pointed out, the very impact of contemporary films depends on the cutting between scenes.  Their effect often is also a purely visual one&mdash;dialogue has ceased to be important.</P>
    <P>These technical facts make it extremely difficult for a censor or an appeal board to make cuts in contemporary films which do not disturb their artistic unity, or their intelligibility to the average audience.  I would certainly suggest that so far as possible the censor and the appeal board should make films completely available to the public on a limited certificate basis rather than cut them in a way which deprives them of any value.</P>
    <P>In asking for a debate on these matters I am particularly sensitive to the problems of protecting children from harmful material in the cinema. This is where I want to refer to age. For the reasons I have referred to, films may be particularly harmful to children and young people.  In this context I welcome the fact that the censor is a medical doctor and that on the appeal board we find a teacher and a housewife.  I appreciate that the Minister could not give me the ages of the censor or the personnel on the board, but if at any future date he has an opportunity to review the membership of the board I suggest that he ought to appoint a fair number of young people to the board.  They would be in touch with the problems of children.  The Minister might also consider the appointment of a child-psychologist as one of the members of the appeal board.</P>
    <P>It might help in the general debate on censorship if the censor and members of the appeal board came out in the open to discuss their work frankly and freely and to deal with specific decisions they make.  There have been very valuable experiments of this kind in Britain where the censor met film <Col N="180" /> critics from the national newspapers and showed them some of the material he had cut from films.  Many of these hardbitten journalists decided the censor had been justified in making the decisions he did and their understanding of the cinema's difficulties was considerably increased.  This approach could be used with effect here.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can have reasonable discussion of these matters without being able to refer to specific examples.  I had written to the Minister's predecessor about this and the Minister will have the correspondence but has probably not had an opportunity of studying it.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this so that if a film is banned by the censor or the appeal board the titles could be published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> just as the titles of banned books are.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the renter, the censor and the appeals board is at present given the confidentiality of an ordinary transaction between a member of the public and a Government Department.  May I suggest that the relationship between the renter, the censor and appeals board is, perhaps, better compared to a hearing before a coroner or a court.  The findings of such hearings are generally open to publication as matters of judgment of public interest and importance.  The decisions of the censor and appeals board are judgments of equal interest and importance.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for having spoken at such length on this Bill but it is a matter which has been of considerable interest to me and, like Senator FitzGerald, I was anxious that the Bill should have the type of debate which circumstances did not permit it to have in the other House.</P>
