      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 and 2.  To avoid duplication of the debate it is suggested that the debate on the Second Stage of the Appropriation Bill should include matters which would normally arise on the Finance (No. 2) Bill which it is expected will be received from the Dáil within the next day or so.</P>

      <P>Could I ask for <Col N="2" /> agreement on the proposal that to avoid duplication of debate the matters that would normally arise on the Finance (No. 2) Bill should be discussed on the Second Stage of the Appropriation Bill?  This would mean that when the Finance (No. 2) Bill comes for debate before us the Second Reading would be passed without debate. There could be a debate, if required, on the Committee and later Stages but not on the Second Reading. Is that proposition agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned it is acceptable.  There is just one point I should like to make.  I am sure there would be agreement on this, too.  This is to avoid duplication of debate.  Obviously matters which would arise on the Finance Bill being discussed with the Appropriation Bill, would ensure the debate would not be enlarged.  That might have the result that in dealing with the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill a Senator might not be able to make a particular point in that kind of general atmosphere and I would suggest that, without binding the hands of the Chair in any way, there should be some leeway allowed, if necessary, in the Committee discussion, if it is necessary to develop a Committee point beyond what normally would be regarded as Committee discussion, and that the House should <Col N="3" /> facilitate that.  I have no particular point in mind.  It is just a point that occurs to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be taken as agreeing to the Order of Business. Before the Leader of the House asks us to accept this Order of Business he should give the House, if he can, some explanation as to why the House has not been called to meet since last July.  I want to make this very clear. I am not trying to lay any blame on the shoulders of Senator Ó Maoláin. I know the position as far as he is concerned.  I think that as far as the Senators sitting behind him are concerned, and certainly as far as Senators on this side of the House are concerned, none of the Members of this House is reluctant to meet to do the work.  But they are not being given work to do and the reason for that is not that Senator Ó Maoláin is to blame but that the Government are not providing the work that this House should be doing.</P>
      <P>I want to say briefly that if this House is not to be allowed to function and is not to be seen by the public as functioning properly as one of our parliamentary institutions, then we are in danger of becoming in the public eye a national scandal.  If that happens, the sooner this House goes out of existence the better.  As far as we are concerned here we are prepared to meet as often as necessary to do any work that comes before us.  I am sure that Senator Ó Maoláin will say the same for his side of the House and I want our voices to be heard in public as people who are prepared to do our work if we are given work to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator O'Higgins in this protest.  As he has quite rightly pointed out, the Seanad has not met since last July, a period of five months.  Like Senator O'Higgins, I should not like to lay the blame on Senator Ó Maoláin. <Col N="4" /> With Senators on this side of the House, I feel that my friends opposite must feel as frustrated as we here on this side of the House because we are being treated with contempt.  It is no wonder that the people of this country treat the Seanad with contempt.  We must all feel a certain amount of guilt that we draw our salaries irrespective of what we do.  We get elected and we are in the money.  That seems to be the only function of this House. It is easy to say that there was no business.  There were no Bills before the House but there are 11 motions on the Order Paper and when the Seanad reassembled at its first meeting in 1969 there were pious resolutions that those motions would be dealt with. I regret that we have now been the subject of much comment in the papers. The other day I saw a figure of 137 days since the Seanad met and I hope a situation of that kind will never arise again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement with what Senators O'Higgins and Fitzgerald have just said.  I believe that if the Seanad is being treated as it is the public will look for the abolition of the Seanad and quite rightly so.  If this treatment is continued to be meted out the Seanad should be abolished.  That is all I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to join in the protest at the lack of work and I think we are making this protest on behalf of everyone here in the Seanad, because we all feel the same sense of frustration.  We feel that we can contribute but we are not being given an opportunity to do so.  It is just symptomatic of the situation in which the whole democratic parliamentary process is breaking down at the moment.  The 18th-century system that we inherited from Britain needs to be drastically overhauled to fit into the 1970s.  That is what is called for and if this House has any function at all it is as the spearhead of a proper and a modernised committee system. This House is not merely a pale replica of the Dáil to rehearse and rehash some of the opinions that have come from the Dáil.  There is a higher and better national purpose to be served by this <Col N="5" /> Chamber and I appeal to the Government and to everyone in political life to look quickly to the modernisation of our parliamentary system before parliament becomes a mockery and becomes unworkable in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask for an explanation, or perhaps a ruling, on the extraordinary habit of adjourning the Seanad <i>sine die</i> in the light of Standing Order 18 which states that unless it shall otherwise resolve, the Seanad shall meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 3 p.m. and on Fridays at 10.30 a.m.?  Of the last 32 sessions of this Seanad, some seven have been adjourned <i>sine die</i> and this is, I think, an index of the weakness of what is happening.  Could I ask you for an explanation of that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point briefly which no other Senator has yet made on this discussion.  The importance of the Seanad and the significance of its very long adjournment seems to me to be that the Government have neglected the opportunity of using this House in such a way as to make more time available for the other House.  It is only a week since the other House and the public were told that a debate on a matter which many people in that House and outside thought important could not be held because of pressure of work.  It seems to me that as long as this House is here and the establishment of this House has to be paid for by the people, it ought to be availed of by the Government so as to do work and so as to relieve pressure on the Lower House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the points already made it is worth noting that on the last occasion when the Seanad met at the end of July the business that came before the House that day had to be rushed through, without <Col N="6" /> adequate or full discussion.  Then we had a period of 19 weeks when the House did not meet at all.  Furthermore, if business does not come up from the Dáil for discussion here because of the time spent there discussing no confidence motions and so on, there are Private Members' motions here dealing with very important matters such as the Buchanan Report, membership of the EEC, <i>et cetera</i>, and I believe that the House should have been called to discuss these during the 19 weeks that we were not here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is on the Order Paper today one item, the first item to be debated, the Decimal Currency Bill, which has been in the Dáil for approximately, if not more than, six months.  It could very easily have been introduced in the Seanad where it would have been given all the time it required and everyone would have been delighted to have tried to improve it at our own pace.  The time in the Dáil would have been saved because it would have come in a debated state back to the Dáil.  This is a perfect example of the sort of use the Seanad could have been put to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, if the other speakers are finished, that I am surprised to find intelligent Senators on the other side of the House joining in this campaign of humbug conducted by the three daily newspapers who have now run out of scare stories about splits, divisions, and new Taoiseachs and have turned their attention to another post to lash, the Seanad?  I am surprised to find that Senators here do not sit down and consider for a moment before they support such a campaign as is being waged now in the three Dublin newspapers.  I have not seen my friends, the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, yet but I hope they will not follow suit in this line.  It is quite obvious to anybody who has read the Constitution and who knows the basis for the foundation of this House, what the position here is.  It is quite obvious to anybody who is in touch with reality how the Seanad works.  Anyone <Col N="7" /> who listened to the excellent news commentator, Joe Fahy, today on Radio Éireann will have heard him sum up in his first sentence the answer to all these humbugging complaints of the Dublin daily newspapers.  The fact that little or no legislation has come from the Dáil since the summer is responsible for the fact that the Seanad had no business to do.</P>
      <P>The Seanad is part of the Constitution and it is here whether people like it or not, but its functions are clearly defined and should be understood by Senators.  The Seanad must await business transmitted to it by the Dáil and if the Dáil does not transmit the business, then the Seanad can turn itself into a talking shop on these resolutions to which some Senators referred but it would not be doing the business for which it was intended.</P>
      <P>The Seanad has not such a bad record as it has been made out to have by some Senators talking about 137 days and all that.  I just took the trouble to look up what the position to the summer recess has been for the past four or five years and I find that in 1967, the Seanad met on 28 occasions; in 1968, on 30 occasions and in 1969 there was a general election and they were hamstrung and met only 14 times, but in 1970 we met 25 times. Anyone who works that out will find that the average is not too bad.  Why this sudden campaign now?  This campaign was not mounted in any of these years as far as I remember.  It is mounted now.</P>
      <P>The Seanad, as I say, awaits business from the Dáil.  The Dáil has given it no business since the Dáil met in October.  It is quite obvious to anyone who reads the newspapers why the Dáil has not given it business&mdash;because the Dáil was indulging, on the part of the Opposition Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Again with the humbugging instinct they refrained from naming it.  Because I am naming it I am out of order.  All right.  I accept your ruling.  The fact remains that we did not get business because of certain actions conducted by certain people and we must realise that if these people continue to conduct those actions, as they did from May to July and again from October until now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald can say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; but he is not that damn foolish that he does not know to whom I am referring and he need not try to twist it.  If they continue to conduct those actions the Seanad will still be in the same boat.</P>
      <P>That is not saying that I do not agree that we could do very effective work. We have done very effective work and, as Joe Fahy pointed out in his Radio Éireann address, we have contributed greatly to the improvement of many of the Bills which have come through this House particularly last year.  The amendments passed by this House were of great value in improving those Bills. I thoroughly agree that much more use could be made of the Seanad and I think that is the feeling of all the Senators but we are not going to get anywhere by attempting to cloud the issue by blaming the Government, or any particular person in the Government, or, indeed, blaming anyone here.  The fact remains that if the Dáil does not give us a free flow of legislative proposals then we cannot do anything except what we have been doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this clear.  I think this discussion has been useful and with the exception of the fact that he seems to have misled himself with regard to where the business of this House comes from, by and large the remarks of Senator Ó Maoláin may have been useful.  However, he is misleading himself if he thinks that the Seanad must depend on the other House for its flow of work.  That is not so and it is not so under the Constitution. It is set out specifically in Article 20 of the Constitution that any Bill, other than a Money Bill, may be initiated in Seanad Éireann.  Therefore the points which were made by other speakers, that the blame for the long recess here, the reason why this House is not getting the work to do which it is capable of doing, lies with the Government, are to my mind entirely true and correct.  It is open to the Government to initiate legislation here and, as one Senator has pointed out, when you have a situation in the other House where there is pressure and a matter of grave public importance cannot be discussed because of the pressure of business, surely the answer is to bring the legislation here first and let us deal with it?</P>

      <P>Basic statutory authority for the decimalisation of currency was given by the Decimal Currency Act, 1969.  When the 1969 legislation was before the House it was intimated that this second Bill would be needed to deal with matters of detail.

Senators will therefore be already generally aware of what is involved in the changeover to the £-new penny system of decimal currency beginning on Decimal Day, 15th February, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that day the banks, Government Departments, and a large proportion of companies, shops and business firms generally will switch over to working in decimal currency.  An overnight switch by all shops and business is not possible chiefly because some time will be needed by machine supply companies <Col N="12" /> to complete the task of conversion or replacement of cash registers and other machines.  There must therefore be a changeover period.  During that period both the £sd system and the £-new penny system of currency will be legal &mdash; except that cheques and other bank documents must be written in decimal currency.  While the changeover period may last up to a year, in practice the switch to decimal working will probably be nearly complete in most business sectors within some months after Decimal Day.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislative framework for the changeover.  It does not attempt to legislate for every decimalisation problem. Statutory provisions are required only for cases where serious inequity or administrative difficulty would otherwise arise.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with definitions and interpretation.  The effect of section 2 is that cheques must be written in the new currency on and from Decimal Day.  The complete switch of banking transactions into decimal currency on that day is important for the successful launching of decimal currency. Their large volume of transactions would, in any event, make it impracticable for banks to work in both decimal currency and £sd during the change-over period.  In order to ensure an overnight switch in banking transactions section 2 makes invalid any cheques with shillings or pence in them, if they are written on or after Decimal Day.  In the course of the Committee Stage debate in Dáil Éireann on 10th December, 1970, the question was raised whether a bank could deal at all with a cheque which is invalid under section 2.  The Minister promised that this point would be examined.  This has been done and confirmation has been obtained that banks can deal with such documents. For their part the banks are willing and anxious to facilitate a customer who has inadvertently lapsed into £sd when writing a cheque on Decimal Day or after it.  After the first few days of the use of decimal currency such cases are not likely to occur frequently. The publicity of the Decimal Currency Board and of the banks will <Col N="13" /> prepare the public to write cheques in decimal currency only as from Decimal Day.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is intended to facilitate the banks in the days, immediately preceding Decimal Day, during which they will have the heavy task of converting their accounts to decimal terms and completing various internal preparations such as conversion or replacement of machines.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the method of conversion to decimal terms of £sd amounts written on any cheques and similar instruments which though drawn before Decimal Day are not paid in until on or after that date.</P>
    <P>Section 5 prescribes the method of conversion of references to shillings or pence in bank balances.  These conversions will be done by the whole new penny conversion table given in the Schedule to the Bill.  The banks will account only in whole new pence and this table gives the amounts in whole new pence which are nearest in value to old penny amounts up to 2s.  In the overall the table will give equitable results because it is designed so that increases and decreases due to rounding balance out.  Some individual debtors or creditors may gain or lose marginally.  The maximum loss or gain on a cheque amount will be one and one-fifth pence.</P>
    <P>I now turn to some other transactions for which conversions by the whole new penny table will be done. During the changeover period it will be possible to settle £sd debts in cash because the £sd system will still be legal.  If an £sd amount to be paid includes some old pence, however, it will not have an exact decimal currency equivalent in whole new pence. In order to allow such amounts to be settled by cheque, section 6 of the Bill provides for conversion by the whole new penny table during the changeover period.  Under section 13 of the Bill the whole new penny table is also prescribed as a basis for settling in the new currency&mdash;whether in cash or by cheque&mdash;any £sd amounts that have to be paid after the changeover period. At that stage the decimal system will be the only legal currency system and <Col N="14" /> the £sd coins will no longer be in circulation.</P>
    <P>The position of regular weekly or monthly payments such as mortgage repayments, ordinary life assurance premiums and hire purchase instalments is dealt with by section 7 of the Bill.  As in the case of any other £sd debt, a person making such a payment will retain the right to pay the existing £sd amount in cash during the changeover period.  If he prefers to pay in decimal currency during the changeover period he will be free to convert the shillings and pence on the basis of the whole new penny conversion table and to pay that amount. After the end of the changeover period the payment must be made according to the whole new penny table.</P>
    <P>A special arrangement is however necessary in regard to premiums payable under industrial life assurance policies or friendly society contracts. A large number of such contracts involve very small weekly cash payments and many of these do not convert exactly into decimal currency terms. Application of a conversion table individually to such small payments would in some cases cause a relatively appreciable change in the amount of the payment.  Section 8 of the Bill will enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make regulations prescribing an equitable solution to come into effect as from Decimal Day.  It is intended that these regulations will prescribe that the total £sd amount payable over a period of four weeks will be converted into the nearest equivalent in decimal coins, that is, to the nearest half new penny.  Benefits payable under policies will not change.</P>
    <P>Section 9 and 10 contain an important group of provisions concerned with statutory references to amounts of money which include shillings or pence. The bulk of statutory references to £sd will not give rise to any difficulty as they will convert exactly to decimal currency terms.  In some cases, however, it may be necessary to make some slight adjustment if the amount does not convert exactly.  Section 10 of the Bill gives the necessary powers to enable this to be done in cases where <Col N="15" /> existing powers are not adequate for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 14 of the Bill will ensure that the changeover to decimal currency does not invalidate any contracts or other formal documents which contain references to amounts of money in £sd.  For example, if after the changeover a person makes a will which mentions an amount in £sd, it will not be invalid.  However, all payments under £sd contracts and other legal documents will fall to be made in decimal currency under section 13 of the Bill after the changeover period.</P>
    <P>During the changeover period those who sell goods or services will offer them at a decimal price or at an £sd price.  There will not be two prices for one article.  Once a shop has gone decimal, the prices will be decimal prices only and it will not normally be open to the customer to decide that he prefers to pay an £sd price.  People can, however, use both old and new coins when paying for their purchases. Since sixpence in the old currency is exactly equivalent to 2½ new pence, exact change can always be given if customers tender in multiples of 6d or 2½ new pence.  The decimal currency board will impress this point on retailers and the public.</P>
    <P>Up to the present a great deal of the Decimal Currency Board's activities have been directed towards getting businesses &mdash; large and small &mdash; to identify everything that needs to be done and to set about preparations in good time.  From the board's contacts with business firms and organisations throughout the country they are satisfied that the business community generally is responding well to the call for efficient preparation.  No intractable problems have been encountered but there is still a proportion of traders who have been dilatory in setting about the task of preparations.  These should take action without further delay.</P>
    <P>An important part of the board's future work will be to prepare the general public for the use of decimal currency so that they will understand it thoroughly.  A special publicity campaign will be conducted for this purpose. In the six weeks before Decimal Day the board will switch the weight <Col N="16" /> of publicity over to the general public. A special explanatory booklet will be sent to each household in the country. This booklet will include a copy of the shopping conversion table &mdash; sometimes known as the new halfpenny conversion table &mdash; which the board have recommended for equitable conversion of retail prices generally.  Other publicity measures will include advertising of basic facts about decimal currency in the press and on radio and television. I feel confident that the public will come up to 15th February, 1971, with the knowledge of decimal currency fresh in their minds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I welcome this measure which has obviously been drafted in the light of experience gathered in the similar conversions carried out in Australia and in New Zealand.  The terms of the Bill show at least a marked influence from the equivalent English statute.  I welcome decimalisation as something which will have advantages; it will help schoolchildren in their arithmetic, it will have the advantage of providing ease in establishing and computing relationships of values of different coins and it should be convenient from the point of view of the arithmetical manipulation of sums of money as multiples of units of ten.</P>
      <P>It is perhaps not out of order to remind the House that the idea of decimalisation derived from the Founding Fathers of America and, in fact, it was one Governor Morris, an aristocratic gentleman who helped in the Declaration of Independence, who first proposed the idea.  His scheme which was adopted in the American coinage system was that revised by Jefferson and supported by one of Alexander Hamilton's famous reports.  It was the French revolution, despite the aristocratic elements in the American Declaration of Independence, which introduced the decimalisation idea to Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Britain made the wrong decision in not basing the system on the 10s rather than on the £1, and however, we made the right decision in following Britain as we must have the same unity and it would be manifestly <Col N="17" /> immature to establish our independence by some gesture which would be injurious and damaging to ourselves. Decimal Day in Britain is on the 15th February, 1971, and so it must be with us.  Despite the great difficulties caused by the bank strike I understand the banks are confident they can keep to this date.  A massive operation is planned to effect this and it is expected a significant number of transactions will, in a week or so, operate naturally in the new coinage.</P>
    <P>It is dishonest of us not to face the fact that this is going to increase the cost of living because if our basic unit goes up from ½d to 1.2 pence and when we consider the multiplier effect, this must have an effect on the prices of some goods.  Difficult though it may be to believe, there are goods which still can be bought for 1d.  The supplier of these goods will have to sell them at not less than 1.2 pence, the buyers along the route will obviously have to take their margins on them and these margins must, with the multiplier effect, have some effect on the cost of living.  I gather calculations have been made and I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary make some comment on that in his reply.  Conservative and reasonable people have calculated it will affect the cost of living in the order of 2 per cent to 4 per cent.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary's advisers have considered this and I would like to get from them and other Members of the House some indication of the effect on the cost of living.  I do not think this can be avoided.  It is a necessary and proper step and we have got to pay for whatever effect it will have in terms of additional cost.</P>
    <P>I have only one reservation to make about this Bill and I make the point now so that by the Committee Stage further consideration might be given to it.  In the course of his opening address, the Parliamentary Secretary said that during the Committee Stage debate in Dáil Éireann the question was raised whether a bank could deal with a cheque which is invalid under section 2, and the Minister promised to examine the point.  Confirmation has been obtained that the banks can deal with such documents.  This is a correct <Col N="18" /> statement of the position.  Of course, the banks can treat as valid documents that are declared by statute to be invalid. The banks will not do that without risks to themselves because if a person draws a cheque which is, in fact, expressed in £sd after Decimal Day and that cheque is, by virtue of section 2, invalid, if the bank chooses to pay on that cheque, as a matter of practical convenience and part of a policy of educating their customers into the new system, the person who drew that cheque can sue the bank for having paid on an invalid instrument. I would earnestly recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary that a saver should be introduced in section 2 to provide that if the bank did exercise the option it would have under the section to make payment of an invalid instrument, the drawer of the cheque would not be entitled to sue the bank on foot of such a transaction.  Otherwise, there may be significant sums involved and I do not think it is an answer to this point &mdash; which may not have been made in debates elsewhere &mdash; if there is not a similar saver in the equivalent legislation that has been studied.  It is a serious point and I would propose at the Committee Stage to put down an amendment in relation to it.  At this point I simply repeat my welcome of the Bill in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage we welcome the Bill which makes provision for the changeover consequent on the decision already taken.  The only point I would make is that in the publicity which undoubtedly will be necessary to ensure that the public are aware of the changeover, the Minister should enlist the support of schoolchildren everywhere.  It would be a great fillip to them that from what they had learned from their teacher they would be able to instruct their parents at home.  It would be a useful contribution and, at the same time, a practical instruction in decimalisation for our schoolchildren.  I welcome the Bill as it is.  A number of other points can be raised on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Like the other Senators, I welcome the Bill.  At this <Col N="19" /> Stage there is very little that one can say on it because any comments are best left for Committee Stage.  I was very pleased to learn from the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory speech that this matter will get publicity on both television and radio between now and 15th February.  It is one area in which I considered the Decimal Currency Board had fallen down.  It is true that there has been a campaign directed towards traders, which was a good thing because they must gear themselves for Decimal Day. However, I felt that the public were being neglected in this respect.  Therefore, I am very, very pleased that the Parliamentary Secretary has put the record right and that there will be a publicity campaign between now and Decimal Day to make the public <i>au fait</i> with the major change that will come about on the 15th February.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill we all welcome.  This changeover is one of the refreshing and enlightening things. It is a mystery to me why we, and the people on the other island, have always had a different type of currency from the European and American currency. I find myself agreeing with Senator FitzGerald in saying that the decision to adopt the £ instead of 10s is a mistake which was made in Britain. Why it was made I do not know. If it had been a Conservative Government I would have understood it, but it was a Labour Government who made that decision.  We shall have to bear with the difficulties that will arise having regard to the difference in the currency system we operate and that in use elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I do not think this changeover will be easy, despite the work which the board are doing.  It will be relatively easy for some of us who have had the opportunity of having been abroad and are accustomed to dealing with currencies in units of ten, 20 and 100. However, it may not be as easy for others who might not have such knowledge. When it comes to a question of money it is not difficult for people to consider the matter, especially if it means they will lose money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> One of the questions that occur to me in relation to what the Parliamentary Secretary said about cheques that are dated is that this may be covered already.  In a modern economy there are always many instances of money orders, cheques, dividends and so on, that get mislaid.  These are restricted by banks to date periods.  I wonder if this would involve returning those cheques under these circumstances.  It is surprising how many people forget to lodge such items for quite long periods.</P>
    <P>The other point that occurs to me relates to the changeover in relation to public services, such as CIE, and how this may work out.  It is very important from the point of view of the public how one is going to work out 1s 5d in a bus and 9d on a stamp, and so on. It should be as equitable as possible. We have been reading much in some newspapers about what people in private business may do in an effort to gain on this, and warnings have been given.  As a public representative I am concerned to see that the public are protected against any of our public service companies in regard to the changeover to decimal currency.</P>
    <P>Finally, I agree with Senator Quinlan in relation to the schools.  I should like to put one other question to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Are the board doing anything regarding introducing special means for educating schoolchildren in relation to decimalisation, apart from what they are doing in relation to industry?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I should like to pay a tribute to the Decimal Currency Board for the excellence of the lectures and the way they organised talks throughout the country.  They have proved extremely beneficial.  However, the only crib &mdash; if I can call it one &mdash; I have is the apparent unsuitability of the bronze coins.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will get away with increasing the price of stamps.  Will the cost of the smallest stamp be 9.6d instead of 4 new pence? Which of the coins shall we use in the ordinary telephone coin box?  Can we expect that the local phone call will <Col N="21" /> be reduced to 6d, or something like that, or is it going to shoot up to 1s? These are things that well may nark the public, and rightly so.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said last week that people should not avail of the changeover to increase prices.  I doubt very much if the Departments of State I have mentioned will resist the temptation to increase the price of both the stamp and the telephone service. Who designed those bronze coins? Even those that have been circulated have changed colour already.  They are a hopeless collection of coins and even the size of the new halfpenny is ridiculous. I do not know what sort of a pocket one would need.  On their own they will be of very little use, in relation to their purchasing power, at the present time.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying, perhaps he will give us an assurance that the Government will not avail of this opportunity on 15th February next to increase the prices of the services rendered by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Any danger that exists is not so much in the Bill itself as in its implementation, especially as far as conversion is concerned.  I know the intentions are good and that the Government, through the various Ministers, have warned traders and shopkeepers to be very careful in this matter.  They will have to be more than careful in this regard because, human nature being what it is, the tendency will always be there to err, so to speak, on the right side as far as they themselves are concerned.  It would be a bad introduction for the decimal system if it were accompanied by dishonesty, <Col N="22" /> even of a very minor kind.  It is a pity that Britain decided to adopt the £ as a unit, as it would have been more natural to adopt the 10s unit.</P>
    <P>That was what was used in New Zealand and the great pity is that it was not introduced into Britain.  However, since it was not I suppose we have no option whatever but to follow suit.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned the part schoolchildren could play in the implementation of the working of the Bill from the 15th February.  A considerable amount of work has been done in the primary, vocational and secondary schools.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he keep in touch with the Minister for Education and ask for a new drive as from the 1st January.  I am delighted to see in this memorandum that a special publicity campaign is to be conducted for the purpose of ensuring that the public are familiar with the system.</P>
    <P>In the six weeks before Decimal Day the board will switch the weight of publicity over to the general public. For my own part I have no fears whatever. The general public will get used to this idea of decimal currency very quickly.  One always notices that where money is concerned people can adapt themselves very quickly to any kind of change.  We live in an era of change, but I have no doubt but the changeover in currency will be one of the easiest to effect.  A further help would be to get the parents, the public and schoolchildren working together in this matter.  I hope the changeover will be made easily and satisfactorily and my only fault with the Bill is that it should have been introduced years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to make a few very brief remarks on the Bill.  I am rather sorry we did not adopt the continental system of smaller units.  I know we are more or less tied hand and foot to the British system and there is a good deal to be said for following what they do.  Inevitably we do this, but anybody who has travelled on the continent will be familiar with the fact that most continental countries have quite small units as their basic coinage.  Had we been free <Col N="23" /> to do so, and untrammelled by a connection with Great Britain, I would have plumped for the 10s unit.</P>
      <P>I notice the Parliamentary Secretary in his introductory address mentioned that there is a proportion of traders who have been dilatory in setting about the task of preparation.  I think this is a little unfair because, as the Seanad is aware, a tremendous amount of the business in this country is done by very small businesses and small shopkeepers, particularly country shopkeepers. The task of facing up to the changeover to D-Day is quite a formidable operation for people in this type of trade and I think they deserve every help and encouragement in this regard.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, something more will have to be done to assist shop assistants to become more familiar with the changeover before the 15th February. I agree with the previous speakers who said that the success of the changeover will depend largely on the amount of work and the impact which is made from the 1st January to mid-February. Those six weeks are going to be the most important in the whole operation of changing over from the £sd system to the decimal currency system; I would go as far as to suggest that the people who have undertaken these various courses throughout the country over the past 12 months will have forgotten a good deal of what they learned at the time and will be in need of a refresher course.</P>
      <P>I understand that in some centres the facilities for training staffs are not adequate and I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply would give us some indication of reports coming from, say, vocational education committees about the success of the training schemes in their areas.  I believe that in some centres the facilities available are not adequate to deal with the number of applicants.  I would also like to support the Senators who said that the schoolchildren could help enormously in this changeover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard I would like to suggest that the coins should be made available to schools and to different organisations, and even to groups of business houses, well in advance of the <Col N="24" /> changeover.  I know that they will not be legal tender until after the 15th February but I think that everything possible should be done to familiarise the public &mdash; the adults, the children and the people who will be handling these coins through the course of business &mdash; with the coins well in advance of the changeover to D-Day.</P>
    <P>It occurs to me that some difficulty may arise in connection with wills.  I know it is mentioned in the Bill that where the husband makes a will and leaves sums in terms of £sd the will will not be invalid after the 15th February.  However, we all know there have been long delays in taking out probate and, in this regard, I wonder if any difficulties are likely to arise from the point of view of the changeover to decimal currency.</P>
    <P>Another Senator referred to the recent warning by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to traders that under no circumstances were they to raise their costs as a result of the changeover to decimal currency.  I think the conversion table attached to the Final Schedule of the Bill automatically assumes an increase in prices.  Traders would need to be protected against any possible charge of increasing prices when, in fact, an automatic increase in price occurs. Just to take one simple example, one shilling equals five new pence and so on.  I know it is impossible to round off the decimal equivalent in new pence to the old £sd currency but in fairness traders should be protected from charges of increasing prices when an automatic increase will occur due to the changeover to decimal currency.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to say, when replying, if traders and the public generally are to accept this conversion table in the Schedule to the Bill as the official rate of conversion and will this be the only acceptable table of conversion?  It would be helpful if it was generally known that this would be regarded as the only acceptable table of conversion.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill which is a challenge to us as a people to bring ourselves into line with the form <Col N="25" /> of currency which is generally used throughout the greater part of the world.  I am quite certain that, provided our people are armed with the necessary information, the changeover will be completed smoothly at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question in relation to section 14, to which Senator Russell referred.  It sets out here that &ldquo;save&rdquo; provided in section 2, no instrument shall be regarded as being invalid because of its containing a reference to an amount of money in the old currency.  Then paragraph (b) of subsection (1) goes on to say that &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; includes wills, documents, and all other writings of a formal legal kind.  I am just wondering if it would not be worth the Minister's while to have another look at the wording of that.</P>
      <P>All of us who are practising lawyers will be aware of the fact that from time to time documents are prepared without the assistance of solicitors or barristers.  They are documents which it is perfectly legitimate for a person to prepare.  There is nothing at all wrong with a person preparing a tenancy agreement in relation to his own house or a flat in his house without the assistance of a solicitor, but people who do their own drafting of legal documents without being qualified may accidently &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;accidently&rdquo;&mdash; in relation to this section find that they have not put their document in a formal, legal manner.  I wonder if documents of that sort are to be ruled out while documents prepared in a proper form by solicitors are allowed in.  It would seem to me to be wrong if that were to happen.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like the opportunity to ask one question.  Like I fear, a very large proportion of the population, I am one of those people who have been sitting back waiting for D-Day and hoping that somebody will succeed in explaining the matter to me when it happens.  I have been resting in the assurance that in the last six weeks of their campaign the Decimal <Col N="26" /> Currency Board will concentrate on people like me.</P>
      <P>May I draw attention to the one point which I find a stumbling block in consulting the decimal currency material?  It is a point which immediately struck me when I visited a primary school recently and I saw some of the publicity material on the walls of the school.  I should like to hear the explanation of this feature and perhaps the Decimal Currency Board could pay particular attention to it when they come to the last run-in of their campaign.</P>
      <P>I am referring to the conventions recommended for laying out the new currency sums.  For example, £1 and 38½ new pence will be quoted as £1.38½.  I have never quite grasped this; it seemed to create immediately a blockage for me.  Is it a decimal system or is it not?  I fear this may be the reaction of many people and it will immediately throw them, because even though we will see much greater teaching in the schools now based on the decimal system, with my understanding of the decimal system I have a mental blockage when I see a figure like £1.38½.  I consider it should be £1.385.</P>
      <P>I appreciate there may be an obvious explanation for this but, even in the general way in which I have tried to keep track of the publicity material which the Decimal Currency Board have sent in such regular streams to Members of the Seanad, I have not come across this explanation.  I should like to hear the Minister's answer because I think it would help a lot of people.  Reference has been made to people's experience on the continent. My recollection is that never in France, Switzerland or Holland have I seen anything like £1.38½, and I would be very interested to hear why exactly we have been forced into this position. It seems to me to spoil the decimal image, initially at any rate.</P>

The Decimal Currency Board should be congratulated on their work and I think they should be helped by everybody in the final six weeks of getting <Col N="27" /> the public acquainted with the new currency.  I should like to support what Senator McDonald said earlier that when it comes to changing the prices of postage and telephone calls, the errors should be rounded down rather than up.  This would be an important psychological step and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be vigilant in guarding against excessive increases in businesses or shops or in any other part of life where currency is being converted.  I should like to make the further point that as soon as possible our archaic system of weights and measures should be rationalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy with the way this Bill has been received and I hope I may be able to explain some of the points raised.  First, to go back to the history of the decimal currency system, in June 1967 the Minister issued a booklet summarising the case for and against the different decimal currency systems it might be possible to introduce in this country.  This was circulated to obtain considered views before a final decision was taken here.  In the meantime, however, the weight of opinion favoured the introduction of the same system as applied in Britain, and the Government decided to adopt this course as less in-covenient and less costly than introducing a different system.</P>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald asked about the question to which I referred in my opening remarks, namely about the banks accepting cheques which under section 2, would not be legal, apparently, according to the phraseology of the section.  The banks, I understand, are prepared to take whatever risks may be involved in exercising their discretion in dealing with cheques drawn in £sd after Decimal Day.  I believe it is not clear that there are real risks.  The same position applies in Britain.</P>
      <P>I understand the use of the word &ldquo;invalid&rdquo; in section 2 is necessary to secure a definite switch of banking transactions on Decimal Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of Post Office charges has come up again.  As regards telephone <Col N="28" /> coin boxes the Department of Posts and Telegraphs intend to have these converted within three to six months after Decimal Day to take bronze decimal coins instead of pennies and sixpence.  They are doing this because the considered opinion is that after Decimal Day the old coins will begin to go out of circulation fairly rapidly.  The Post Office have not announced their decimal rates for stamps and telephones but we understand they intend in the overall to balance ups and downs to bring in the same amount of revenue.</P>
    <P>There is some confusion about the two tables that are available.  There is one contained in the Schedule of the Bill and this is primarily for banking settlements in particular.  There is another table available, which is not a statutory provision, called &ldquo;the New Halfpenny Table&rdquo; and this is the table which will be circulated to householders and will be taught in the schools.  This will be the fairest way to ensure that traders will not in any way abuse the changeover.  I am quite sure they will not because the forces of competition and public opinion which have resulted I think directly from the activities of the Decimal Currency Board will all combine to ensure decimalisation will not result in an overall increase in price levels. I shall refer again to that later on. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has made it perfectly clear in his recent statement that it is his intention to take strong action should any complaints come to his attention.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with other Senators in congratulating the Decimal Currency Board.  They have done a truly magnificent job.  They have had special talks with groups of traders and other business interests in 140 towns. They have mailed booklets to all traders who are registered for turnover tax.  They have advertised extensively in the press and mass media and have participated in exhibitions such as the RDS Spring Show and Horse Show in Dublin, the Munster Agricultural Society's Summer Show in Cork, the Limerick Agricultural Show, the Mayo Traders' Fair in Ballina, the Dundalk Agricultural Show and also the Ideal <Col N="29" /> Homes Exhibition which I had the pleasure of opening.  They have performed a first-class job which probably goes beyond what most people realise.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education have issued detailed instructions to teachers with regard to the teaching of the new decimal currency.  Copies of some of the board's publications have been circulated free to all teachers and a special wall chart showing the coin designs has also been circulated to schools.  There will be further publicity in the schools in the six weeks preceding Decimal Day.</P>
    <P>The vocational school classes on decimal currency are going ahead in all areas outside Dublin city.  These classes are well attended and they will continue in many areas up to Decimal Day.  Efforts are continuing to get similar classes in Dublin city.  The Decimal Currency Board have prepared a special training manual for smaller traders.  An easy self-teaching booklet has also been distributed free to all traders.  Supplies of the new bronze coins are available from the Central Bank in packets of ten shillings worth, for staff training purposes.</P>
    <P>The emphasis up to the present has been directed towards traders, manufacturers and industrialists.  The emphasis from now on will be directed mainly at the general public and will be very intensive during the six weeks preceding the 15th February, 1971.  An explanatory booklet will be issued to the 687,000 households in the State and all publicity media will be used. The publicity will explain clearly the decimal currency system and will set out the special aspects of shopping in the changeover period during which both the £sd and the decimal currency systems will be in operation.  It is necessary to ensure that all sections of the public understand all the facts.  To fail in this regard would be to risk considerable confusion in daily transactions.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald and some other Senators referred to the effect of the changeover on the cost of living. I wish to assure the House that it will be negligible.  Research and calculations have shown that even if all retail <Col N="30" /> prices were rounded up to the nearest decimal coin the effect on the cost of living would not exceed 1 per cent.  In fact very many prices will be rounded down on conversion to decimal currency. This has been the experience in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform Senator Keery that our decimal system is based on the £ divided into 100 units and not the £ divided into 1,000 units.  While the ½ is perhaps an anomaly from some points of view, it is necessary to have a ½ newpenny coin to keep control of the cost of living.  Deputy Ruairí Brugha asked me about CIE fares.  I understand they have not settled their decimal fares yet but this matter is under active consideration.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point raised by Senator O'Higgins, section 14 is a saver for the validity of documents containing references to £sd.  I am satisfied that the section as drafted will be adequate to cover the cases where there are delays in obtaining probate of wills and also the other cases mentioned by Senator O'Higgins where documents were drawn up by laymen and not in strict legal phraseology.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points that have been raised.  However, on the Committee Stage we shall go into these matters in more detail.  I should like to thank Senators for the way they have received the Bill.</P>

      <P>I had and the Parliamentary Secretary gave me an assurance that the banks were aware of the perils to which I believe they certainly are exposed despite the doubt expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary as to whether there were any perils. Apparently the banking system is prepared to undertake that hazard, and I am not going to hold up the House in dealing with that.  However there are other provisions which, depending on the nature of the Committee Stage debate, it might be desirable to amend, and to approach this quite important legislation on the basis that we have got to get it enacted seems to me to be unfair to the House and unwise for the country.  If Members are prepared to take the Committee Stage now it does not mean that we shall take all Stages now.  It may emerge from that debate that amendments should be considered by the House and, if thought fit, adopted.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has just said that the bill of exchange or promissory note would be in order if it were certified in writing by the banker before Decimal Day.  What about a bill of exchange or promissory note which is dated on 15th or deemed to have been drawn or made before the 15th and which cannot be certified because the person does not even look at it until after Decimal Day?  Surely this is intended to provide for certification after Decimal Day by a banker to give authenticity to a document which would otherwise have been without it. If there is doubt about it should that not be written on it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two situations here.  There is the question of a cheque which is drawn before and possibly well before the 15th and is post-dated. That is the case that Senator Russell was speaking about, and under the section as it stands, that does not seem to require any certification from anyone provided there is in some way proof that it was made out before the 15th of February.  Then there is the case of a cheque drawn on the 15th or later which is certified by the bank. <Col N="34" /> There are two separate and distinct points in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 3, notwithstanding the fact that three of the days mentioned in subsection (1) of section 3 will not be non-business days, subsection (1) will allow bankers to present to each other for payment on the days in question, cheques and other payable instruments drawn on them. This will enable the banks to clear £sd items lodged on or before Wednesday, 10th February, which is the last business day before Decimal Day.  Having done this they plan then to balance customers' accounts in £sd and convert the balances to decimal terms.  Although Saturday is not now a working day it is still technically a business day in the bank for the purpose of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882.  Saturday, 13th February, 1971 has been declared as a non-business day because it is desired to give banks full legal cover in respect of this day as well as the two previous days.  The banks in Britain and Northern Ireland, which do not open on Saturday either, have been given similar cover under British legislation. In subsection (2) the days are fixed on which bills of exchange and promissory notes shall be payable if they fall due on the days the banks are closed.  This provision applies to bills of exchange or promissory notes which are payable at a fixed future time, unlike cheques which are payable on demand.  Under section 14 of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, the day on which such bill falls due is determined by adding three extra days, known as days of grace, to the time fixed by the Bill.  There is special provision in the Act of 1882 for cases where the last day of grace falls on a Sunday or bank holiday.  This subsection makes special provision for the exceptional circumstances of the closed period before Decimal Day.  The provision is designed to be as equitable as possible and bills of exchange or promissory notes for which the last day of grace falls on Thursday, 11th, or Friday, 12th February, 1971, will be payable instead on Wednesday 10th. Bills or notes for which the last day of grace falls on Saturday, 13th February, 1971, will be payable instead on Decimal Day, 15th February, 1971.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two types of cases about which I am worried.  The first one is cheques which were drawn, say, this month or last month and which are not payable until next March or April.  This is a common occurrence in solicitors' offices where large amounts of money are collected running into thousands of pounds and a number of post-dated cheques are received for hundreds of pounds each.  I have in my office substantial cheques which are drawn in pounds, shillings and pence and will not become due or payable until next April.  I should like to know what I can do with those cheques.  I cannot submit them to my own bankers because they are not yet payable and they will not be payable during this particular period from 12th to 15th February.  Must I travel with those cheques to the banks of the persons who drew them and who live at very considerable distances, inform them that here is a number of post-dated cheques drawn on their bank which are not payable until after Decimal Day?  Those cheques therefore, although I have accepted them and given receipts for them, in so far as the law stands will be invalid.  Where do I stand?  This is something on which I should like to have a definite ruling. I cannot see where it is provided for in the Bill.  Can I on the other hand take those cheques to my own bankers and say: &ldquo;Here are cheques which will not become payable until next March or April.  Can you certify them for me and convert them into decimals&rdquo;? My own bank does not know whether the cheques will even be honoured.  This is worrying me considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar situation arises with promissory notes.  Many times one makes out a promissory note payable 12 months' hence.  Promissory notes <Col N="36" /> have been drawn last May, June or July for substantial amounts.  Sometimes shillings and pence are included because provision has been made for interest which does not work out evenly in pounds.  How does one deal with those promissory notes?  Strictly speaking they are valid only until the 15th February.  I cannot see that there is any provision in the Bill which will validate either the post-dated cheques or the promissory notes to which I refer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding a post-dated cheque is quite simple. This is dealt with in subsection (3) of section 2.  A cheque must be presented to a banker to be certified under section 3 (2).  The same position exactly applies to promissory notes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not quite clear as to how a bank can certify a cheque.  How can a banker, seeing a cheque for the first time, certify that it was in fact drawn before the 10th February which is the first day of closing?  If a cheque is written during the three closing days the banker cannot certify it before Decimal Day and is the cheque valid when it comes into the post-Decimal Day period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just put this point?  It is provided in subsection (3) of section 2 that, if there is a certificate in writing by a banker, a bill of exchange or promissory note for an amount wholly or partly in shillings or pence which is dated the 15th February or a later date, will be deemed to have been drawn or made before the 15th February.  That only refers to bills of exchange or promissory notes which are dated the 15th February or a later date.  My query is in two parts. Where is the provision which requires the certificate from the bank regarding the date to be placed on an instrument before a particular date?  If the Parliamentary Secretary says it must be done by the bank before the 10th, how can it relate to any instrument which is dated the 15th or later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The onus is on the person with the cheque to satisfy the bank that the cheque was drawn before the specified date.  That is where the onus should lie.  While the changeover in banks will be on the 15th and the banks will not then be trading other than in the decimal system I have been told that in relation to cheques in particular the banks will be as co-operative with their customers as they possibly can be.  This section is put in in order to ensure that people who have post-dated cheques or promissory notes could have them certified by the bank.  After the 10th February they would have to make private arrangements for the limited service <Col N="38" /> which will be available.  It seems clear enough to me.</P>

Can you not think of situations in which it is extremely difficult to get a hold of bills of exchange or promissory notes?  You might, for example, have taken promissory notes in consideration of something you have sold or given or let; then you might have gone off with these and had them discounted by houses that were not aware of this and you might have difficulty in getting them from them. Admittedly, it would be in the interests of these bodies so to act as to get the benefit of the section.  Another question is: what would be the liability and responsibility of a bank which certifies an instrument as having been drawn before the date and which subsequently proves not to have been?</P>

      <P>In relation to the first question, if the Revenue Commissioners have post-dated cheques it is up to them to get these cheques certified.  As I pointed out at the start of this debate the banks are prepared to take whatever risks may be involved <Col N="39" /> in exercising discretion in dealing with cheques drawn in £sd after Decimal Day.  It is not clear that there are any risks.  The Bill does require that post-dated cheques should be certified and the banks are prepared to use discretion.</P>

      <P>Think of the situation in which you cannot actually get the promissory note or bill of exchange.  Say you have let yourself run to 9th February and you simply physically cannot get it because there is a postal strike or something of that kind.  Under this section the instrument itself must bear the certificate.  Surely there should be a provision under which a certificate given by a banker would in fact be as good as if the instrument itself was certified in such cases where a customer trusted by his bank was able to satisfy his bank that although he was not able to produce them to the banker, in fact, they were so drawn or made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of satisfying the banker.  If you cannot get hold of a promissory note at once you should go to the banker when you do get it afterwards and satisfy him, and the banks say they will be lenient on this.  The banks have no liability under section 2 (3) because if the banker's certificate is given, then the cheque is deemed to have been drawn validly in £sd before Decimal Day. The problem raised is that some promissory notes may be difficult to get.  I feel that the banks will be able to deal with matters of that kind.</P>

      <P>It may not be a promissory note with which the bank is involved at all.  This may be between two private citizens.  What happens in that case?  With all the good intentions in the world you cannot bring them in before the 10th February for some good reason.  Somebody is malicious and has got at them or there is a fire or a burglary.  The banker is not interested in this transaction. He is not a party to it.  He is in no way involved in giving a certificate to help anybody in this transaction and some innocent person suffers because there is no provision for the case.</P>

    <P>What is worrying me is the following. Let us take a practical instance.  A man transfers his farm to one son and the son to whom he transfers it is to pay a certain amount of money to another son who takes a number of promissory notes extending over two, three or four years.  These promissory notes are made out in £sd.  They are all dated even perhaps in the year 1968.  Those promissory notes become invalid on D-Day by this Act.  The promissory notes are lying in his solicitor's office.  Unless his solicitor is prepared to go through <Col N="41" /> every deed and paper in his strongroom and pick out all the promissory notes before Decimal Day there is going to be a terrible upset.  The promissory notes become invalid and if they are sued for them the civil bill or the proceedings are dismissed for the asking by reason of an invalid promissory note.  Supposing those are overlooked, can the payee of the promissory note or his solicitor take those promissory notes to his bank next May, June or July or whenever they are discovered?</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may very well be right but I would have put it the other way, that it is &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i> valid,&rdquo; because the Bill does not make it invalid.  What the Bill proposes to do is to make invalid a bill of exchange or promissory note drawn or made on or after Decimal Day.  If it is drawn or made before Decimal Day, even though drawn for presentation after Decimal Day, personally I cannot see how that is invalid.  In the particular type of case to which Senator Nash referred there would be the proof that it was drawn before Decimal Day because the cheque would not merely have been drawn, it would, so to speak, have been delivered in that it would have been sent to <Col N="43" /> someone else to hold until it became due for payment, so that there would be proof that it was drawn before Decimal Day.</P>

The certification refers only to that very limited class of bills of exchange or promissory notes; it does not refer to any which were dated before 15th February.</P>

      <P>I cannot find anything in the Bill which provides for a conversion of a description in £sd into a decimalisation by reference to the Schedule to the Act in respect of any documents other than those set out in section 4.  For example, what is to be the position of a description&mdash;the use of £sd&mdash;in documents which may be rendered valid by section 14?  How do you construe them?  How do you interpret?  How do you convert?  There is no automatic method to convert. Without this table there is a ludicrous position in which you are going to have conversion in many cases into recurring decimals&mdash;I think it is three cases in which you can have a recurring decimal&mdash;applied to a substantial sum of money.  This will happen in numerous instances.  Why do you not include in subsection (3) the documents referred to in section 14, so that you have a proper application to the £sd of the Schedule to this Bill?</P>

      <P>A question on section 12.  It arises in relation to the capital of companies.  I know that the view has been taken under the equivalent statute in England that people with capital expressed in 4s or 5s units have got to pass resolutions to adopt the new unit.  Is this to be done by whatever number of tens of thousands of companies we have got here?  That would not apply to so many of them but, to such of them as we have, their capital denomination in these units would be a nuisance and expensive and law costing.  Is it possible to introduce something into this section which would effect an automatic conversion in such a case such as is effected in relation to registered stock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of companies incorporated in this country have their nominal capital divided into £ shares.  The expression of these share values is not affected by the change-over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the nominal share values which are not in whole £'s, expression in decimal currency terms will not be obligatory during the change-over period or after it.  Most companies will however wish to refer to shares in terms of decimal currency from Decimal Day, 15th February, 1971, or soon after that date.  If no change in nominal value is involved, there is no need for any formal steps to enable companies to refer to the nominal <Col N="46" /> share value in terms of decimal currency as from Decimal Day or later in documents such as share certificates or annual returns to the Registrar of Companies.  For example, such documents could refer to 25 new penny shares even though the company's memorandum and articles of association continue to express in their articles of association the value of 5s.</P>

I have been very surprised to notice that a number of very large companies, registered in England, have in fact sent out notices of meetings to convert their units into decimal units.  I do not know if we have something dealing with this point which they have not got.  I should have taken the view that the Parliamentary Secretary has expressed but I thought I would draw his adviser's attention to the fact that there is a different opinion on this matter and if it were possible to put something in it might save a good deal of inconvenience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Trade in England, because of some confusion on this point, issued a statement recently to the effect that if a company wish to amend their memorandum or articles of association so as to express the nominal value of shares in decimal currency in those documents, they must follow the procedures prescribed in their Companies Act whether or not there is any change in the nominal value.  Some companies in England may have been calling meetings merely for the purpose of expressing nominal share values in decimal terms.  This is unnecessary and I hope that this assurance of mine will be sufficient for the House.</P>

Contracts can be made between two businessmen by letters which are only informal and they wish in fact to have them so, and of course there is the case mentioned by Senator O'Higgins of the holograph will drawn by the person himself, which is not a formal document in the ordinary sense, except that it takes a particular form.</P>

      <P>The point which Senator Alexis FitzGerald is making is a good one.  It is just a question of having a look at this closely.  As I understand it, what Senator FitzGerald is suggesting is that the definition should be tied to the legal consequence of the act rather than that we should tie it to a definition of an instrument by reference to the phrase &ldquo;formal legal kind&rdquo;.  Some people might believe that the fact that it is put this way weakens other things that could be included in it whereas it includes wills, documents and all other writings of a formal legal kind.  Quite frequently contracts of one sort or another are made by an exchange of letters which are documents or writings but they are not documents or writings which are considered in the ordinary sense as being of a formal legal kind.  The consequence of the exchange of letters is to create legal obligations and obviously it is intended by this section that when there is an exchange of letters or notes creating a legal obligation that is intended to be covered by this.  Like Senator FitzGerald I fear that that particular example he gave, which is a good one, might accidentally be excluded from the section.</P>

There are so many possibilities and we are dealing with something <i>in futura.</i>&ldquo;Documents of a formal legal kind&rdquo;&mdash;I think that has a specific meaning in law.  It means documents which are formally drawn in strict phraseology.  Informal letters would not come within the phraseology of it.  Informal letters, even two, three or four, may create rights or obligations and if, in regard to the reference to the rights or obligations which have become involved in £sd, these are letters written by people who have not a legal training, who will never read this Bill, the obligations or rights which they purport to create would be, in my opinion, frustrated under this section as it stands.  Formal legal documents are very strict and I should like to have added to that subsection the following words.</P>
      <P>In this subsection &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; includes wills, documents and all other writings of a formal legal kind or which create rights or obligations between parties.</P>
      <P>If those words were added I think they would cover everything.</P>
      <P>I appreciate very much the graciousness and patience which the Parliamentary Secretary has shown towards us and I do hope that in the various questions raised by us he will understand that we are trying to be helpful and to ensure that this Bill will be as sound as possible and will not frustrate the creation of the rights or obligations which it is intended to create.</P>

      <P>I think there has been too close concentration on the actual wording of the Bill here.  Subsection (b), as I see it, lays out some types of documents included in the word &ldquo;instrument,&rdquo; but it does not purport to be an exhaustive definition of that word &ldquo;instrument&rdquo;.  The fact that the word &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; is included in subsection (1) (a) and the way this section generally is worded would cover a very wide field.  No one should find himself in difficulties as a result of this further explanation which was inserted into subsection (2).  Even if <Col N="50" /> subsection (2) were not there at all it would probably still be satisfactory.</P>

      <P>One question please. When he was replying to a point I made during the earlier Stage of this Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned two tables&mdash;one which is contained in this Bill and another one which will be circulated to the public and to traders.  Is there any significant difference between the two conversion tables and if so is there likely to be any confusion arising through any charges against shopkeepers for overcharging? Will this table in the Schedule be a defence against a charge under the other tables?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Schedule is put into the Bill mainly for banking and accounting purposes.  The other table will not be statutory.  It is a recommended table brought out by the Decimal Currency Board for conversion of shop prices generally and will be included in the booklet to be sent out in the near future to all households. It is for the convenience of shopkeepers and people going shopping. This, however, is chiefly for banking and accounting.</P>

      <P>I think I follow the Parliamentary Secretary but I mentioned specifically on section 14 or 15 the question of trade contracts between the buyer and the seller.  The buyer <Col N="51" /> will be buying and in reference to this Schedule he will then sell, say, to a retailer who will be reselling the goods under the second conversion table.</P>

      <P>No, payable amounts calculated in £sd under contracts will be converted by this conversion table. The table is not of course applied to cases like industrial assurance policies where the payments are very small; these would present difficulty in applying this conversion table as the changes could be substantial.  This table applies in relation to banking and accountancy in general.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, last year when this Bill came before the House I found it necessary in the course of my speech to make remarks of a critical kind against a member of the Government.  I was told by the then Minister for Finance the following day the Seanad sat that to make such remarks in the absence of that Minister was a breach of all the traditions of this House.  My understanding of this debate is that it offers the sole opportunity in the year to the Seanad to discuss in a general way the working of Government in all its Departments as well as collectively and I would like your ruling, Sir, on whether it will be in order for me when the time comes or for others Members of the Seanad to speak critically about members of the Government and about the way they perform their work, even though those members themselves may not be present in the Chamber as indeed they scarcely can be and even though they are represented only by another member of the Government or by a Parliamentary Secretary?  Are you, Sir, willing that is should again be said that anyone on this side of the House is in <Col N="52" /> breach of any tradition just because he is doing what he takes to be his duty?</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to appropriate formally the amounts voted by the Dáil for the supply services. This year's Bill follows the general pattern of previous Appropriation Acts.</P>
      <P>Section 2, which is the principal section, appropriates to the specific services set out in the schedule to the Bill the sum of £462,023,676, comprising £3,846 to cover an excess on the grant for prisons for the year 1968-69; £35,065,370 in respect of the 1969-70 supplementary estimates which were not included in last year's Appropriation Act; and £426,954,460 in respect of the estimates for 1970-71, including the supplementary estimates already voted for this year.  The section also authorises the use of certain departmental receipts amounting in total to £29,766,234 as appropriations-in-aid: these are detailed in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill authorises the grant out of the Central Fund of the sum of £3,846 to make good the excess <Col N="53" /> on the grant for prisons already referred to.  Authority to issue out of the Central Fund in respect of the balance of the items to be appropriated is contained in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment after much consideration and deliberation, for the purpose of pinpointing the statement made the week before last by the Government with regard to the possibility of bringing into operation again Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940.  I feel that this is a matter which is of very deep and fundamental importance and that it is a matter which should engage the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It seems to me that we are in danger of entering into an era of government by threat and I think that that is in any sense objectionable, but I want to make one thing quite clear before I deal any further with the question of the Government's statement, that is, that the party, for which I speak at the moment, and I myself and I think all associated with me, either with my family or politically, stand <Col N="54" /> and have always stood for the maintenance and preservation of law and order in this State.  The fact that I seek to look in a critical way at the Government's statement with regard to internment and to analyse it and the effects of it as best I can is not to be taken by anyone as indicating either that I or the party for which I am speaking depart one iota from the stand which it was necessary for this party to take in very tough and difficult days in the past when this party and their predecessors were responsible for establishing and for defending the parliamentary institutions of this State and the organs of the State responsible for maintaining and preserving law and order.  They established the unarmed Garda force and the administrative organs of justice in this country and certainly anything in the nature of crime whether it be political crime or otherwise which is contemplated or engaged upon by any people of this country whether they be an organised section of the people or otherwise will receive nothing but condemnation from this party, and to the extent that it may be necessary in order to preserve law and order so as to ensure that parliamentary democracy will continue to function, there is no one in the party for which I speak who, for a moment, would shirk bringing into operation, if it were necessary, Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940.  Neither would we shirk taking any other measure that might be necessary to preserve our democratic system.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it seems to me that the steps which the Government contemplate are of the utmost gravity. They are so grave that neither House of the Oireachtas and no public representative should willingly contemplate their being brought into operation except in circumstances of the utmost seriousness.  I say this because the bringing into operation of these powers would interfere in a very fundamental way with basic human rights.  In a most serious manner, they would threaten personal rights which are enshrined as fundamental rights in our Constitution &mdash;rights that are basic and human rights even if they never figured in our written Constitution.</P>
    <P>It will be agreed that the right to personal liberty, the right to freedom <Col N="55" /> and the right of a person not to be incarcerated or imprisoned except following conviction after a fair trial is one of the most fundamental and one of the most treasured of human and personal rights.  Any interference with the ordinary machinery of the law should be contemplated only in exceptional circumstances.  What are the circumstances that exist to date in which this proposal is contemplated by the Government? In fairness to the Government the only way of making clear the situation would be to place on the records of this House the statement issued by the Government in the following terms:</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed the Government that reliable information has come into their possession to the effect that a secret armed conspiracy exists in the country to kidnap one or more prominent persons.  Connected with this conspiracy are plans to carry out armed bank robberies which the police believe may well involve murders or attempted murders.</P>
    <P>The Government view with deep gravity the situation arising from this information which has been carefully checked.  They have given the fullest consideration to the problems that this gives rise to and they have decided that, unless they become satisfied that this threat is removed, they will bring into operation, without further notice, Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940, which provides for internment.</P>
    <P>The Government have given instructions that places of detention be prepared immediately and the Secretary General, Council of Europe, is now being informed of the Government's proposals as these proposals will involve derogation from certain provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>This is a serious situation.  The Government trust that those who are directly involved will appreciate just how serious it is and just how determined the Government are to take effective action when they have already gone to the stage of informing the Council of Europe that derogation <Col N="56" /> from an international Convention is in prospect notwithstanding the gravity of that step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I had been making the case that the powers which the Government have indicated they may invoke under the Offences Against the State Act, 1940, are powers which, to my mind, should only be invoked in very exceptional circumstances.  They are the type of powers appropriate for the preservation of public safety or the preservation of the State if the security of the State is in jeopardy.  I made the point that if such a situation exists where the ordinary machinery of the law has broken down or where it is inadequate then these powers could be justified.</P>
      <P>If Senators will reflect on the date of the Act I am talking about, the Offences Against the State Act, 1940, they will immediately realise that this Act was introduced towards the beginning of the last World War.  It was wartime legislation.  It was introduced in circumstances where the security of the State might have been placed in jeopardy.  I want to note that in passing because it is of some importance.  It is important to remember that we are talking now about a period some 30 years later.</P>
      <P>Before we broke for tea I placed on the records of this House the Government statement which was issued on Friday, 4th December.  As one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, we should consider if the statement which was made by the Government indicates in any clear and concrete fashion if the powers which it has threatened should be invoked are necessary and not merely desirable or convenient and not merely invoked or threatened to be invoked in order to serve the convenience of the administration of the Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to argue that such powers <Col N="57" /> is necessary for a single military man &mdash;and I intend to deal in some detail with the extent of the powers contained in Part II of the 1940 Act&mdash;should not be regarded as necessary if the situation in which it is proposed to use them can be dealt with by the ordinary machinery of the law.  Having said that, I want to have another look at the statement made by the Government, and nobody can accuse me of being unfair when I say that the information given in this statement amounts to the Garda authorities having given certain information to the Government, which they and the Government believe to be absolutely reliable, information that there is a secret armed conspiracy to kidnap one or more prominent persons. Secondly&mdash;and it does not read like this in the statement&mdash;there are plans to carry out armed bank robberies, and thirdly, the Garda authorities believe that in connection with the plans to carry out armed robberies, murder or attempted murder might be involved. You have three things there&mdash;possible kidnappings, possible bank robberies and possible murders or attempted murders.  Surely it is true to say that each and every one of these would constitute crimes under our ordinary law?  All of them are matters which can be dealt with under our ordinary law.</P>
    <P>Even if that were not so, without having recourse at all to Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940, is it not true that under the 1939 Offences Against the State Act there are exceptional additional powers which can be called into operation if they are needed. So that you have the ordinary law of the land and you have the exceptional powers already there in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  It stopped short of internment, which is the effective power contained in Part II of the 1940 Act.</P>
    <P>We have three possibilities referred to in the Government statement.  I wish to emphasise again that I would regard each of those possibilities with abhorrence. There is nothing more likely to shock the ordinary people of this country, nothing more horrible to contemplate, than the three acts which are referred to in the Government's statement&mdash;the possibility of a conspiracy to <Col N="58" /> kidnap, the possibility of armed robberies and associated with that the possibility of murder or attempted murder. All of these are horrible things to contemplate.  What I am concerned with and what we should all be concerned with is if we can say that such a state has arisen and that we are not capable of dealing with these things through the ordinary law of the land.</P>
    <P>Certain reasons have been advanced by the Taoiseach as to why it would be necessary to invoke the provisions of the 1940 Offences Against the State Act to deal with this situation.  At column 485 of the Official Report for 9th December, the Taoiseach set out reasons as to why further information could not be given and he spoke about the situation in which the information available could be used as a basis for criminal prosecutions.  I do not know whether we, as one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, are going to concede that that is the position.  It seems to me that that in effect is what the Taoiseach's argument on that basis amounts to.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the fact that you have at the moment on the Statute Book and available for use to the Government or to the Garda authorities the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  That Act provides for the setting up of special courts.  I think it would be necessary as far as I can recall&mdash;I am open to correction on this&mdash;for the Government to bring that Part of the 1939 Act into operation by means of a proclamation in the same way as would be necessary for Part II of the 1940 Act.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that you have in the 1939 Act machinery for special courts.  There is provision for the establishment of those special courts where adequate protection could be afforded to witnesses.  It is true to say that any time special courts have actually been established here they have been on the basis of the personnel consisting entirely of Army officers.  That need not necessarily be so.  It would be open to the Government to establish special courts which are not special military courts.  Even under the 1939 Act I do not think it <Col N="59" /> to be on a court.  I feel that the Taoiseach's statement&mdash;while I acknowledge its validity in relation to the personal jeopardy of people giving information &mdash;must be tested so far as the effectiveness of our security is concerned against what is available to be put into operation by the Garda authorities and by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then gave reasons why he felt it would be gravely improper to give details of the information to the Dáil.  One of them was the grounds I have already spoken of.  He said that to name or identify a person as a suspect for an offence would be likely to prejudice the fair trial of such person should evidence become available subsequently which would warrant his being charged.</P>
    <P>I want to pause and consider that for a moment.  Surely what the Taoiseach is saying, in effect, is that instead of allowing a trial, fair or unfair, we are going to allow no trial at all and we are going to intern a person without trial if we bring into operation the provisions of Part II of the Act of 1940.  It does not seem to me to be any answer to say that if I give this information to the Dáil it may prejudice the fair trial of the person suspected if at the same time I am saying that I will not allow any trial, fair or unfair.  He will go into the Curragh or wherever the internment camp may be set up.</P>
    <P>The third ground mentioned by the Taoiseach was that to give details to the Dáil would prejudice the work of the security forces of the State and achieve no desirable end.  I want to question that too as being sufficient or adequate ground for refusing information to the Dáil in relation to this matter.  It is possible for the Dáil or the Seanad to meet in secret session and it seems to me that if there was any danger of disclosures being made in the Dáil prejudicing the work of the security forces that could be surmounted by allowing the Dáil to meet in secret session and making the fullest possible information available to the Members.  I question also the assertion that it would achieve no desirable end.</P>
    <P>I think this is the kernel of the whole matter.  The Taoiseach apparently <Col N="60" /> adopts the position that to discuss an important matter of this sort with the Members of the Dáil, and presumably also with the Members of the Seanad, would achieve no desirable end.  I feel that it is a vital function of Parliament in this country that they should be taken into the confidence of the Government and that if a serious situation exists, and apparently it does from the Government's statement, that the people who should be informed about that are the public representatives, the people who by their presence in Parliament represent the nation.  I do not think that that is any mean end at all. I do not think the Taoiseach is right in saying that if he were to give the information to the Dáil it would be achieving no desirable end.  I think it would be achieving a very desirable end and it would be achieving a position of an informed parliament and through an informed parliament possibly an informed public as well.  However, those are the reasons which have been given for not giving this information to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>What is proposed by the Government? I said at the outset that we seem to be entering into an era of government by threat and what else is there in this?  The Taoiseach was at pains to point out in the Dáil on 9th December that no one had been interned and that Part II of the Act had to be brought into operation.  As far as I am concerned, I see the situation quite clearly and quite simply.  If a situation of such seriousness has arisen that internment is warranted then, to my mind, it is the duty of the Government to act.  If a situation has not arisen which warrants internment, then I think the Government are making a mockery of themselves and of the functions of government by setting up a bargaining position of this sort.  The Taoiseach in his reference to this matter in the Dáil last week said, at column 493 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>It is because of that difficulty we took what action we thought necessary in the circumstances.  We did not want to wait until some person was kidnapped and perhaps subjected to danger because it would then have been too late.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> What have the Government done except poured out words in a statement to say &ldquo;If you are not good boys, we will do this&rdquo;?  They have not done anything else that I know of except make that statement and surely to heavens none of us is so naive as to believe that if an organisation which is ruthless enough to engage in conspiracy for armed kidnapping, for armed robbery of our banks, which is ruthless enough to engage in murder and attempted murder, are going to stop short of a white lie and say, &ldquo;Oh, it was never our intention to do this&rdquo;? And is the Taoiseach naive enough if that statement is made to accept it and to accept that then, if there was any danger, it has passed simply because someone had said, &ldquo;We never intended to kidnap or to rob banks or to murder&rdquo;?  Remember that on the terms of the Government statement as issued there was a specific plan.  The statement said that the Garda authorities had informed the Government that reliable information had come into their possession to the effect that a secret armed conspiracy existed, and so on, and then it went on later:</P>
    <P>The Government view with deep gravity the situation arising from this information which has been carefully checked.</P>
    <P>So that there was according to that statement a situation there where a plan existed, where there was an armed conspiracy and a conspiracy and a plan that could be checked and that was checked and yet apparently if someone makes a statement saying, &ldquo;All right. Forget about it.  We are calling it off&rdquo;, in the eyes of the Government that is sufficient.  I do not think it is sufficient. Either the situation is serious enough to warrant the invoking of Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940, or it is not.  If it is it should be done.  If it is not, then this threat should never have been made.</P>
    <P>What are the powers in Part II of the Act of 1940?  In this connection let us bear in mind that whatever organisation, whatever group of individuals were in mind in the Government statement, they are apparently known because the information could have been checked or was checked.  Whether the <Col N="62" /> group is big, whether it is small; whether the organisation is big or small, none of us knows but I think that what is important to bear in mind is that if Part II of the Offences Against the State Act of 1940 is brought into being, it is applicable then as part of our law to every individual in the State. After providing for the bringing into operation of these powers of proclamation, this Act then goes on in section 4 to refer to the particular powers to be brought in:</P>
    <P>Whenever a Minister of State is of opinion that any particular person is engaged in activities which, in his opinion, are prejudicial to the preservation of public peace and order or to the security of the State, such Minister may by warrant under his hand and sealed with his official seal order the arrest and detention of such person under this section.</P>
    <P>That says that, if these powers are brought into operation, if any Minister of State&mdash;it need not be the Taoiseach; it need not be the Minister for Justice &mdash;any Minister of State&mdash;forms any opinion in regard to any particular person that he is engaged in activities which are prejudicial to the preservation of the public peace and order or the security of the State, that Minister without any further evidence can order the arrest and detention of the person. I am not suggesting for a moment&mdash; I would not suggest&mdash;<i>mala fides</i> against any Minister of State, I am not suggesting that powers as drastic as these would be misused by a Minister of State deliberately, but I think every one of us is human and a Minister can make a mistake just as easily as anyone else; indeed, many of us would feel they make mistakes far more readily than the ordinary people; and a Minister can make a mistake about this.  What are the consequences if he makes a mistake?  Some unfortunate individual is put in the glasshouse because the Minister was wrong in his opinion and because the Minister issued a warrant under this section, and the operation of this procedure to arrest depends as I say entirely on the opinion of the Minister. There is no question of a court hearing.  There is no question of <Col N="63" /> a fair trial.  There is no question even of an unfair trial.  A person is immediately interned on a warrant issued by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unfair in my approach to this.  I think it is right to point out that the same part of the 1940 Act also provides, if it is brought into operation, for the setting up of a commission to deal with internments. I have it here in front of me if anyone wants to consult it.  From my recollection I think that commission consists of three members, one of whom will be an Army officer of at least seven years' experience and the other two will be either barristers or solicitors of at least seven years' experience, or judges or district justices or former judges or district justices.  If a person is interned, under the provisions dealing with the commission it becomes a matter for the commission to inquire about it and to inquire if the internment should continue.  That is there as something of a safeguard. In the meantime, however, the person has been interned while this process has been put into operation.</P>
    <P>It is also fair to point out that under another provision in that Part of the Act it is necessary for the Government to give details to the Dáil&mdash;I am not clear if it is necessary to give details to the Seanad&mdash;to make a return at least once every six months, giving the names of persons who have been interned, the names of persons who have been released on the initiative of the commission and the names of persons who have been released without a recommendation or order having been made by the commission.</P>
    <P>Even with that possible addition as a safeguard, the obligation is to bring that information before the House once in six months only, so that a person could be interned without trial, without, so far as the ordinary law of the land is concerned, evidence against him, merely on the opinion of the Minister.  Neither the Dáil nor the Seanad would know anything about it or, to be more accurate, might not necessarily know anything about it, for a period of six months.</P>
    <P>Against that kind of background&mdash; the background of the extraordinarily <Col N="64" /> drastic powers that are contained in Part II of the 1940 Act&mdash;I feel that it is right for Members of this House, and indeed even more so, for Members of the other House, to be given an opportunity of considering and expressing a view and a decision on the Government statement before it is brought into operation.  I concede without argument&mdash;and I have emphasised this already&mdash;that in my view if such a serious situation exists as to warrant those powers, it would be the duty of the Government to bring them into operation.  But they have not done that.  They have issued a threat.</P>
    <P>That threat is 11 days old now. Surely there would have been an opportunity in the last 11 days to discuss the position with the Dáil and with the Seanad and to ascertain the views of the two Houses on it?  Even if we accept&mdash;and I suppose we must accept &mdash;that the Taoiseach and the Government have good reasons for not giving all the information at their disposal to the Seanad or to the Dáil, that in itself is no reason why the Houses of the Oireachtas should not be able to consider the statement and to debate and discuss it and give an opinion on it.  This is not a one-sided thing.  Even if the Government are not free to give the entire information available to them, at least it should be remembered that they are the servants of the people and that the other public representatives are entitled to have and to express views on this matter.  Those views should be listened to.</P>
    <P>I regard it as unfortunate that the opportunity was not given to the other House to express their views.  By the fortuitous circumstances of the Appropriation Bill coming into this House, at least we are afforded an opportunity of expressing our views on it.</P>
    <P>Possibly I have dealt with the subject matter of my amendment at greater length than I had intended.  It is not my intention by any means to endeavour to suggest, for myself or anyone else here, that this debate should centre entirely around the matter of the Government's statement or the possibility of introducing powers of internment, serious and drastic as I consider those powers to be.  There are a lot of other matters which are important, <Col N="65" /> which are serious and which must necessarily engage the attention of Members of this House, where there is clearly a situation of grave political and economic importance.  I do not think that even the most stalwart supporter of the present Government could claim that the last six or eight months was a period of political stability.  I do not think that the most stalwart supporter of the present Government could boast of the way in which the present Government have discharged their functions under the Constitution as being collectively responsible.  I do not think the strongest supporter of Fianna Fáil could feel happy about the economic situation.  I do not think they can satisfy themselves that the gravity of the economic situation has not been contributed to because the Government and the Government party were so distracted by internal strains and stresses during the past 12 months or more.</P>
    <P>The ordinary people will feel that important matters to the people have been allowed to drift because the members of the Government and the members of the Government party have found themselves in a situation during the past 12 months where their energies were directed towards trying to solve their own internal differences. That is not a healthy situation in any country.  As a practical politician I can appreciate the desire of a party in office so to arrange matters as best they can that they will continue to be in office, but a time must come when, no matter how powerful a political party are, the members of that party bear very much in the forefront of their minds that the interests of the country must come before the interests of their party.</P>
    <P>I know that there are many people, not merely intelligent but of very sincere motives and goodwill, inside the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party and their supporters, just as there are in the ranks of the other parties.  Sooner or later they will realise that it is simply not fair to the people of this country and it is not in the best interests of the country that a party who are unable to compose their own differences should remain in office.  I think <Col N="66" /> they would serve the people of the country best by vacating office, composing their differences and then making a bid again for office if they like.</P>
    <P>One of the matters laid down in our Constitution in regard to the Government of this country is that there should be a system of collective responsibility. That is laid down in Article 28 of the Constitution, which is quite specific on the matter.  In Article 28 (4) (2) it is laid down that</P>
    <P>the Government shall meet and act as a collective authority and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>Constitutionally, all members of the Government have an equal responsibility. It has become usual in recent years to talk of senior Ministers and junior Ministers.  So far as the Constitution of this country is concerned, there is equal responsibility and all of them share that responsibility.  They all have responsibility for all of their actions.  They must act together as a collective authority.  It goes without saying, although it has been said, that this principle of collective responsibility requires mutual trust and co-operation if it is to become effective and if the Government are to govern effectively.  I wonder how many of us, looking back over the performance of the present Government&mdash;when I say present Government I do not mean merely the members of Fianna Fáil who are in Government at the moment but the members who have been in Government since the last general election&mdash;can say that that Government on their record have attained the degree of mutual co-operation, one with another, which is so obviously required if not merely the theory but the requirement of collective responsibility is to be discharged.</P>
    <P>It is public knowledge that one Minister in the Government&mdash;I do not want to exaggerate on this and I do not wish to misquote in any way&mdash;one member of a Fianna Fáil Government, felt unable to act on a letter, or a copy of a letter, presented to him by a Cabinet colleague because he was afraid it constituted a trap.  The whole world knows <Col N="67" /> that that situation obtained in the Government, that one Minister was afraid another Minister was walking him into a trap and for that reason would have nothing to do with a particular matter in which the other Minister wanted him to show an interest. Does that show mutual co-operation between two Ministers in the same Government sitting around the same Cabinet table?</P>
    <P>We have it as a matter of public knowledge that since the general election within the past 12 months the resignation of three Ministers was requested by the Taoiseach, that two of them were sacked because they would not resign, that another Minister resigned because he disagreed with the action of the Taoiseach in sacking two of his Ministers and that a Parliamentary Secretary resigned, presumably, for the same reason.  It is a matter of public knowledge that two former Ministers, who were appointed about 18 months ago by the Taoiseach and who sat around the same Cabinet table with him, were put on trial in our courts.  Having said that, let me add, in fairness to them, and it is on record, that they were acquitted.</P>
    <P>With that situation and with newspaper headlines such as I have here&mdash; Haughey Throws Down the Gauntlet &mdash;does any of us really believe that the Fianna Fáil Government were all a happy family, that they are capable of carrying out the constitutional requirement of acting collectively?  We know that this trial was held, we know that former members of the Government have made it known publicly that, in their view, the present Taoiseach should resign.</P>
    <P>All this has been in the short period of time since the last general election. Is it any wonder, in that situation, that things were allowed to drift on the economic front, that we got into a position of inflation, that it was necessary for the Government to introduce another Budget, that the Government eventually were forced to try to control the situation by a Prices and Incomes Bill?  Does it say anything for the Government that introduced the Prices and Incomes Bill that having first announced <Col N="68" /> that it was to be a freeze right across the board, including the previous wage round, they jettisoned that particular proposal and now have apparently jettisoned the entire Bill, at least for the present?  This is the Government that engaged in international negotiations of vital importance to this country. I do not care whether one agrees or disagrees with the proposal that we should enter the Common Market, at least, as long as that is the policy which is being pursued, it is a matter of vital concern and vital importance to us.  Can we believe that a Government that have so damaged their image at home and abroad are the right Government to represent the people of this country in negotiations of such major importance and major significance?</P>
    <P>On industrial relations, we have had during the same period two of the longest major strikes in the history of this country, the cement strike and the bank strike.  I do not think I am far wrong when I say that if the Government had not been so bedevilled by their own internal political party differences they would have been able to intervene effectively to reduce the duration of those strikes and the hardship arising out of them.  But the Government having got themselves into difficulties by reason of their own internal power struggle and warfare were not, in my view, able to pay proper attention to the affairs of this country.  We have an economic mess; we have a bad image abroad; we have a situation where there is at best an uneasy peace on the surface in the Government party.  I do not think any artificial patching up of differences or any facade of unity presented for the purpose of keeping the present Government in office can be anything but an uneasy peace.  It is fraught with dangers for the ordinary people of the country.  It might explode at any moment in the faces of those who succeeded in engineering it. I do not wish to exaggerate but I think that we are in a period of immense strain, immense stress and immense difficulty.  In a situation of that kind a Government so weakened by internal dissention are not the right Government to carry on governing in the interests of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on the Appropriation Bill I wish to follow somewhat on the same pattern as I was glad to follow shortly after entering this House last year.  I want to focus on a number of things which seem to me important if we are to achieve an improved quality of life in politics and economic, social and cultural development.  I will relate these general policy considerations to specific items of expenditure accounted for in the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to talk for a little time about some matters which would fall under headings which we find in the Estimates, such as &ldquo;Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Central Statistics Office&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stationery Office&rdquo;.  In discussing expenditure under these headings, my aim will be to deal with the topical question of the role and relevance of Parliament, something which is extremely topical on a day like today when we have had complaints about the long intermission in Seanad activities.  There have also been references to controversy arising from discussions in another place, to the dismissal of Government Ministers and motions of confidence.  Such events have been the immediate cause of present questioning of the role and relevance of Parliament.</P>
      <P>I believe that this questioning would not have arisen to the same extent to which it has if, in the community at large, Parliament and the working of Parliament were held in high regard. I should like to mention some small non-controversial initiatives on the part of the Government through expenditure under the headings to which I have referred which I believe would help to bring about important changes in the workings of our Parliamentary institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be generally accepted that the standard of debate in Parliament is related directly to the availability of information to Members of the Oireachtas and also to the understanding and appreciation which Members of the Oireachtas have of information on the various topics which they must debate, on the various areas of legislation which come before them.  I <Col N="70" /> should like to look for a time at the main sources of information for Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>These sources of information are primarily the documents and reports which are circulated through the post and the statistical material which is readily available in sources published by Government Departments and by the Central Statistics Office.  The wealth of material of this kind which we daily receive has grown considerably in recent years.  It is important for us to look at the value of this material and the ways in which it might be made more effective.  Surely it would be an excellent use of funds under some headings of appropriation that we are discussing at this time to investigate this whole business of the documentation which is made available to Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no pattern in the material we receive.  Some of it is extremely important, relevant and useful but another part of it is often publicity material or a gimmick report from some body or organisation which is only of peripheral interest or value to most Members of the Oireachtas. It is true to say that there are many occasions on which, through oversight, important documents which are vital to the understanding of an area of Government are not circulated as they should be to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>For example, I have had to make a request for the Report of the Higher Education Authority, the Report of the Commission on Reformatories and the recent Report on Adult Education. I am sorry that the examples are all related to the Department of Education which I have always found to be extremely helpful with the provision of information.  It seems to me, however, Members of Parliament should have automatically received this type of information for their benefit and guidance. I suggest that the mere provision of material like this would be of tremendous assistance and, of itself, help to influence the pattern of debate in a discussion such as we are having at the moment.  A Member might be encouraged to speak on the problems of higher education as a result of the material he received and the opportunity <Col N="71" /> for studying if given to him.  I would suggest that it would be well worthwhile if whoever may be commissioned to do such a study would take a look at the procedure for the issuing of material from Government sources to Members of the Oireachtas, consider what items should be added to the list or what might be deleted and generally see if there is any way in which this valuable source of information could be improved.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer now to that other great source of information for Members of the Oireachtas&mdash;the Library of the House.  We get an outstanding service from the staff in the Library; the standard of help and attention is of the highest.  If I refer to the shortcomings as they appear to me in the Library service, it is not in any way a reflection on the staff of the Library.  It is a sad matter that the post of Assistant Librarian in the Houses of the Oireachtas has remained vacant for so many months.  Additional staff is required urgently in the Library. I understand that progress is being made with regard to the recruitment of an Assistant Librarian and that the post may be filled shortly by a university graduate.  I welcome this type of approach to the working of an institution like the Houses of the Oireachtas Library.  I think there may be other duties than strictly librarian-ship duties which would be of considerable assistance to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In referring to the Estimates, I see with some dismay that the estimate for expenditure for books and periodicals for the Library during the coming year seems to have been cut.  I do not know the reason for this decision.  Perhaps there may have been an over-expenditure last year and, notwithstanding that fact, I deplore the decision.  In general, the use and the value of institutions can be raised by the quality of service offered and by the approach to the institutions.  If there was an overestimate last year for the supply of books to the Library this may have been due to problems of storage, that people had despaired of bringing in more books, or Members have been forced to look elsewhere for certain <Col N="72" /> publications.  In my view, the answer is not to cut down.  The answer is to spend more and I certainly cannot understand how, at a time when we are applying for membership of the European Economic Community and when an appreciation of foreign affairs is so important, we could possibly have too much money for spending on publications and documents by the Library of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In this regard may I say that on studying the related report of the Council of Trustees of the National Library of Ireland for 1969-70 I was very saddened to see on page 10 of the report the following statement:</P>
    <P>The Trustees are appalled that the Library in its present neglected condition cannot carry out its commitments in relation to the parliamentary papers and the publications of international organisations such as UNO, UNESCO and WHO which it receives. These lie unopened in hundreds of large cases scattered about the Library, and, until space and staff are provided, they cannot be processed and made available although the Library has a double obligation in this regard: (a) the obligation to the government or organisation from whom it receives them, and (b) the obligation to this nation on whose behalf it receives them so that they may be made available to readers.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be an appalling indictment.  I am sorry to say that the case appears to be equally bad where documents of an archival nature and literary works are concerned.  I am merely drawing attention to this state of affairs regarding parliamentary papers and similar publications.  I have had occasion to be referred to the National Library myself by our own Library and it really is very sad to see that many publications cannot even find shelf room in our National Library As I have indicated I fear that much the same situation may exist in our own Library here in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of possible ways in which Members could become more interested in the Library service if that service was presented to them in a <Col N="73" /> different way.  I am interested in this topic and I would like to refer Members to the situation as it exists in the Library of the House of Commons. I know the situation there is rather different; it is a much larger institution and I imagine would have much larger funds.  However, I think that the point I am making would apply equally to our own Library here.  I would argue &mdash;and this is related to the supply of information to Deputies and Senators generally&mdash;that we need the provision of a research service.  If I might quote from an article by G. F. Lock, in the <i>Commons in Transition</i> edited by A. H. Hanson and Bernard Crick for the Study of Parliament Group, it will give an idea of what I mean by research. I am quoting from page 137:</P>
    <P>It is not &ldquo;research&rdquo; in the academic sense at all; nobody writes lengthy dissertations on any subject &mdash;the staff would not have time to write them, nor Members to read them.  Nor should we claim that any of the work was original or &lsquo;pushed forward the frontiers of knowledge&rsquo;, though we should claim that our answers were very useful in bringing together and boiling down material from a wide range of different sources.</P>
    <P>Inquiries vary enormously and answers vary in length from half a page to several pages.  The scope of the service covers replies to specific inquiries put by Members and arising out of their parliamentary activity; it does not extend to general briefing and replies are, of course, strictly factual and impartial.  A general characteristic is the urgency of the work; about two-thirds of the answers are required within 48 hours and for many only two or three hours notice is given.</P>
    <P>One can see the value of such a research service from examples that are also mentioned in the work.  In addition, when there are debates on a particular Bill in the House of Commons, bibliographies and reference notes are made available to the Members on the particular topic of debate.</P>
    <P>It seems to me we are reaching the stage where we need this type of service and where the most important institution <Col N="74" /> in the country should have this service.  I am not sure which is the appropriate machinery, namely, whether the initiative should come from the Houses of the Oireachtas or some of the committees, or whether it should come from a Department of State.  In any event, it is time this situation was looked into.</P>
    <P>I would argue that many of the people who are calling at this time for a reform of Parliament, and particularly for the use of a committee system to expedite the work of Parliament, should realise that effective committee work would in many ways depend on the supply of the type of information about which I have been talking.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that much of the statistical material we receive from the Central Statistics Office could be extremely valuable in interpreting economic trends, for example, but I personally find it extremely difficult to read and fully understand the implications of much of this material.  I put forward the suggestion that an initiative might be taken by the staff of the Statistics Office: perhaps a member of that office should be commissioned to provide some kind of a seminar for Members of the Oireachtas, particularly at the start of a new session, so that the Members would get some guidance and education into the full use of the type of material which they will get month by month while they are in Parliament.  This would be a start towards improving the quality of Parliament and the standard of debate.  This process of improvement is extremely important at the moment when, for one reason or another, people are becoming increasingly critical of the democratic process.  I hope that my suggestions may be of some value.  I consider that the appointment of the assistant librarian should be pursued with all haste and the question of the money spent on books and periodicals should be examined.</P>
    <P>Regarding the matter of information and communications generally.  I should like to refer to these topics again in relation to expenditure under particular headings.  During the debate <Col N="75" /> on the Appropriation Bill last year, I referred to the position of the Government Information Bureau and the need for a better flow of information to the public and the press from that office.  I think I am right in saying that the estimate for the Information Bureau has been increased from £16,000 to £20,000.  I welcome this trend and in particular I welcome the vast increase in the Health Estimate for information services.  During this year we have seen the benefits to the community which have been attained as a result of the improved presentation of the service.  The improved quality of publicity not only brings the attention of the public to the services at their disposal but in its own way it has an effect in improving the image of Government and Government institutions.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government Information Bureau, apart from its work in dealing with specific queries and in presenting particular statements at a particular time, should also be involved in constructive continuing work like, for example, the work which is done by the information service in Northern Ireland.  I have here the Ulster Year Book, 1970, which is produced by the Northern Ireland Information Service.  This is an example of a publication which meets a wide range of demands which are not met, so far as I know, in any way by our present information services.  It would be invaluable for use in civics classes in schools, it would be an invaluable asset to tourists and to Córas Tráchtála. The range of information which is given in this Ulster Year Book is really outstanding.  Even as a gesture in helping to understand the people in Northern Ireland, it is a publication I recommend to Members of this is House.  This type of general constructive work seems to be overlooked by our information services and this is a matter the Government Information Bureau should consider.</P>
    <P>I seem to be in a kind of no-man's land area trying to work out who has the responsibility for this matter.  I am not sure if it is a matter which could be dealt with by the Government <Col N="76" /> Information Bureau or whether it should be dealt with by some other body, but there is a great lack of public knowledge about the day-to-day work of our own institutions.  I was surprised to find that until there was the publicity in the press recently people in the country were not aware that the Seanad was not meeting.  At this time when much of the work of the other House has been delayed by various events, there seems to be no source through which the public could be informed of important legislative business, like the Local Government Planning (Amendment) Act, which has been held up for months.</P>
    <P>For some reason or another this is the sort of item which people never hear about and if they had this type of information it would help to put the working of Parliament into a much more constructive perspective.  There is plenty of material here for constructive coverage and, though not strictly relevant, I would very much like to welcome the new radio programme on Friday nights giving coverage of affairs in the Dáil; now that we are back in action I hope it will cover the Seanad also.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that my opinion of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; inquiry proved correct.  I presume that the figure of £25,000 in the Post and Telegraphs Estimate for commissions, <i>et cetera</i> is towards the cost of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; inquiry.  At the time the inquiry was launched, I pointed out that it would probably cost a great deal of money.  It is unfortunate that it cost so much and I should like to take the opportunity to ask people to look again seriously at the possibilty of establishing a press council here that could do this kind of work for half this amount of money.</P>
    <P>I should now like to move from the general theme of information and communication to the general pattern and image of administration.  In particular, I should like to refer to the pace and effectiveness of the implementation of policy during the past year.  Although I am sorry to say it, and I do not wish to offend any of my friends and helpmates in Government Departments, there was a sentence in a review of the Devlin Report by Professor M. J. McCormack in <i>Administration</i>, <Col N="77" /> Autumn, 1969 which caught my eye and which to a large extent is true. Professor McCormack said:</P>
    <P>If one were to pinpoint any major defect in the Civil Service, the lack of speed in decisions is the most vital....  Tardiness is not an essential part of the system in a large organisation.</P>
    <P>There must be many projects of importance and of relevance to the community in hand.  It is the responsibility of members of the Government to keep an eye on things. There are however many &ldquo;nitty-gritties&rdquo; of administration and peripheral topics where, with the best will in the world, one cannot see the political eye extending and where there may well be delays and blockages which we should not ignore and which call for action.</P>
    <P>We have been waiting for the long-promised White Paper on Local Government. The closer it gets to local government elections, the less the likelihood of fair consideration for whatever proposals or suggestions there may be in this White Paper.  In general terms I regard the Department of Labour as a success since its foundation but I certainly think that as each year of school-leavers emerges there is need for the placement service which we have been talking about for so long, which we know is under way and which certainly does work in some of the main centres in Dublin.  We do need an effective placement service and if anything can be done to speed up its appearance on the scene it will be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I read through the document on the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, 1969-'72 from time to time and I hear about the projects that are being considered.  For example, one of my favourites which became topical in the discussions on the Prices and Incomes Bill, was the extension of the Fair Trade Commission to investigate matters such as the fixing of professional fees and so on.  We should not have to wait much longer&mdash; we cannot afford to wait much longer &mdash;for an extension of the terms of reference of the Fair Trade Commission and for definite signs of its action.</P>
    <P>The section in the Third Programme <Col N="78" /> for Economic and Social Development dealing with matters of income maintenance is among the matters that are being studied by the Department of Social Welfare.  Let the day come quickly when the studies will be completed. There are very important topics at issue in the field of social welfare, whether it has to do with home assistance, which is one of my favourites, or other matters.  I hope we will not have to wait very much longer for a report and investigation of the working of that service and recommendations for its improvement in the future.</P>
    <P>We had a report of the Radioactivity Consultative Council published in 1960 which, among other things, recommended the need for regulations to control radioactivity and the use of radioactive substances for various scientific and other purposes.  As far as I know we still have no regulations for the control and use of radioactive substances.  This is a routine administrative matter; it is non-political and noncontroversial. The report and recommendation should be issued and a decision made in the normal routine way.  However, one gets the impression that the person who should be dealing with the matter has fallen asleep and nothing is done.</P>
    <P>In calling for an acceleration of business in many Government Departments I wish to underline the importance of the type of change recommended in the Devlin Report and factors like that stressed by the Committee of Public Accounts, namely, the problem of recruitment to the Civil Service.  Because of my appreciation of this situation, I was surprised when I realised that there had been a cut in the expenditure of the Civil Service Commission.  I do not see how a reduction in the expenditure of the Civil Service Commission is consistent with the necessity for getting many more entrants for Civil Service competitions, for making people much more aware of the role of the Civil Service and above all, making sure that candidates applying for posts in the Civil Service should be treated with the speed, the courtesy and the civility they expect from other employers.  Frequently, people can be left for a long time&mdash;<Col N="79" /> and this can apply to departmental vacancies as well as to vacancies dealt with by the Civil Service Commission&mdash; with just an acknowledgment.  They may never, at any stage, be informed that the post has been filled or that the vacancy no longer exists.  It is bad for the image of the Civil Service that one school-leaver can tell his friends that there is no use applying for a job in the Civil Service, that one does not even get a reply.  This can create a vicious circle that can set back recruitment. Just as there is need for reform and a better image of our Parliament and parliamentary institutions, there is also the same need in regard to the Civil Service.  Both image and approach are matters of very great importance.</P>
    <P>In our community we need some institutions to which an aggrieved citizen may appeal if he considers he is being wronged by an institution of the State or local government.  I look forward to the implementing of the Devlin Committee's recommendation regarding the need for a commissioner for administrative justice.  One may not recognise the term, perhaps, but it is similar to the Ombudsman that we find in other countries.</P>
    <P>In the same way, a very strong argument can be made for the appointment of a commissioner for local complaints &mdash;I think it is the title used in Northern Ireland.  I should like to bring this fact specifically to the notice of the Minister for Local Government. I understand, for example, that under the Housing Act, 1966, the Minister for Local Government has certain powers under section 60.  When a local authority is drawing up a scheme for the assessment of priorities for letting houses, the scheme must be such that it can be made only with the approval of the Minister.  I should like to suggest to the Minister, and to his housing section in the Department of Local Government, that in their duties they should look at the working of the schemes for the allocation of houses. There is a certain amount of evidence that the working of the points systems, which have been approved in many local authority areas, is causing a real <Col N="80" /> sense of injustice in the community, where many people are not prepared to believe that their case has been judged fairly.  They may feel that a family rehoused ahead of them could not possibly have had more points than they have, and so on.</P>
    <P>In the same way, too, if someone is rehoused because he is a key worker or if his circumstances warrant that he be considered a priority case, if the people who are on the waiting list and who have been assessed by a points system are not aware of this fact, a real sense of injustice and panic can be created if the people consider that the points system has not been adhered to.  I would suggest that the Minister for Local Government and the housing section of his Department should look at the possibility of issuing a circular on the lines of the report made recently by the complaints commissioner in Northern Ireland.  He showed how important it was that people should be kept informed at all stages of the progress of their application, the system for allocating points and how they stood in relation to other cases.  This type of approach would help to get rid of the sense of bitterness felt by many housing applicants.  It is desirable that we get rid of housing lists completely.  I know this is still probably very far off, but I should like to welcome the efforts being made by the present Minister for Local Government to step up the housing programme with the use of low-cost houses.  I should also like to welcome his particular interest in co-operative housing and the fact that an advice unit for co-operative building groups, as proposed in the White Paper, <i>Housing in the Seventies,</i> has now been set up in his Department.</P>
    <P>I should like now to talk about some matters which, for various reasons, are often sadly neglected in discussions. In the Appropriation Bill debate last year very little reference was made to the area of foreign affairs.  Perhaps the Department of External Affairs will receive more attention this year because of the growing interest in the progress of our negotiations for entry to the European Economic Community.  May I underline the importance of Members <Col N="81" /> of the Oireachtas receiving the fullest information possible about the progress of our application for admission. Indeed this is a case where there is a great need for background information on the EEC and the implications of entry so that people will be able to judge freely and fairly for themselves the prospects of our admission.  I think that frankness, even in an area where it is difficult to be frank&mdash;about diplomatic negotiations&mdash;is extremely important. As far as one can see there will be a referendum of some kind involved in our accession to the European Economic Community and the people of Ireland may well be tempted to make a wrong decision simply because they feel they have not been fully and frankly informed of the situation. It is important that when people go in to vote in a referendum on this issue they should have no complaint that they have not been properly and fully informed about the prospects of entry to the community and what it means.</P>
    <P>Many people in talking about our national distinctiveness and the importance of our individuality overlook our international image.  I think our international image is an important aspect of our individuality.  Although it has been an area of criticism from time to time, I remain satisfied that we have a distinctive foreign policy.  I think particularly in recent months the activities of our representatives at the United Nations have been very commendable. May I give as an example the General Assembly discussion on the Programme of Action for the Full Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples?  I would like to put this on record because so many people try to misinterpret our position at the United Nations.  Ireland voted in favour of this Programme of Action and the pattern of voting was as follows: there were 86 votes in favour, five against, with 15 abstentions.  The five against were Australia, Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and the USA; the 15 abstentions were 13 from the western European group and two others from Malawi and Swaziland; France was recorded as not participating but subsequently declared she <Col N="82" /> had abstained.  The only western European countries voting in favour were Ireland, Greece and Turkey.  May I say, too, that even in voting for the Programme of Action with regard to colonial countries and peoples, the Irish delegate's explanation of his voting on this particular complex resolution must be highly commended.  Our approach is both practical, just and liberal.  I think this has been our approach to the United Nations over the years. May I say further that in the voting on that particular resolution, in relation to the members of the European Community which we are to join, we were unique in our approach?  It is this type of uniqueness which it will be important for us to defend inside the European Community.  People are speculating about the foreign policy to which we may be committed by entry into the European Economic Community, also the military commitments in which we may find ourselves involved in the hypothetical future.  I can see no reason why we should not be able to continue to exercise the type of independent voice which we have had in external affairs.</P>
    <P>Governments in the European countries, like Governments everywhere else, come and go.  For example, it is quite a different matter and, to my mind a sad matter, that we now find ourselves negotiating for entry to the European Community alongside a Conservative Government in Britain rather than a Labour Government, because this influences the whole picture of European foreign policy about which I am talking.  Harold Wilson's foreign policy would have been much closer to our own than Edward Health's is proving to be, but this underlines how important it is that we realise that when entering the European Community, even though many of the Governments of those European countries may be Governments which have not got foreign policies with which we would agree, there are in those countries other parties who may be close to Government or may well be the Government in some years time who have policies with which we can agree. It may well be, and I hope it will be, that as the foreign policy of the European Economic Community develops <Col N="83" /> it will be sensitive to the problems of the Third World, that it will be anti-colonial and that it will have some of the appreciation which our Government have shown of the need for disarmament and the control of nuclear weapons in the world.</P>
    <P>I put this forward as a rival hypothesis to many of the stories and projections which have been put forward from other quarters.  We have a policy on external affairs of which we should be proud.</P>
    <P>One last point touching the Department of External Affairs is Government policy towards the north of Ireland.  One of the things I have found in the past few months is that many people ask the questions: &ldquo;Now that the Dáil debate about the situation in the north is over, what is happening, what is going on, what are the Government going to do about these particular problems which at one time seemed to be such burning issues? What are the Government going to do about the special position of the Roman Catholic Church in the Constitution, for example?  What are the Government going to do about the matter of the right of family planning?&rdquo; These are the sorts of questions which we are now being asked.  I should like to remind the House, and indeed to remind the community at large, of the statement of the Taoiseach at column 1650, Volume 248 of the Dáil Official Report:</P>
    <P>As I have previously indicated in this House, studies have been in progress for a considerable time on matters affecting Irish unification. In accordance with a recent Government decision an interdepartmental unit comprising senior officers of my Department and of the Departments of External Affairs and Finance has been established to examine all matters affecting north-south relations, to keep in close touch with all aspects of Anglo-Irish relations having a bearing on the situation, and to arrange for the study in depth of short-term problems as well as longer-term difficulties. The unit is required to report <Col N="84" /> its activities to me through the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the work of this unit is going on in a worthwhile way and my understanding is that this unit in the Department of External Affairs would be glad to hear submissions from all parties who feel that they have something worthwhile to say on matters affecting north-south relations, on matters affecting the constitutional position and so on.  As someone who has a particular interest in some minority problems may I just say to these people, that the way in which this unit can work most effectively is if it receives fully detailed memoranda regarding the particular points at issue? It is not good enough for every Tom, Dick and Harry to ask: What about family planning?  What about divorce? What about the special position of the church?  Those are just empty complaints which in many ways are doing a disservice to the great majority of the people of our community who feel they are living in peace and harmony with their fellow men and who just do not understand this type of grouse.  People who feel they have a point or have a grievance should set out in full detail what they think needs to be done and bring it to the attention of this unit in the Department of External Affairs. I certainly am satisfied that this unit is anxious to receive submissions from representative minority groups particularly.</P>
    <P>Returning for a moment to our application for membership of the EEC I should like to underline the importance of a correct approach to matters of physical planning here in our island.</P>
    <P>One of the things that are mentioned as an attraction to entry to the European Economic Community is that Ireland is the sort of relatively undeveloped region which will receive benefits and assistance under the European Economic Community's regional policy, a policy under which there is a central fund to assist with the development of peripheral areas.  The European Commission has looked into the problems of these areas and has issued a memorandum generally outlining how the problems of these areas might be approached.  Nevertheless at <Col N="85" /> this moment the regional policy of the European Economic Community is, in my view, relatively undeveloped and even if we enter the European Economic Community there is not necessarily any guarantee that Ireland will be successful in pressing its particular case for assistance from the Community's regional development fund.</P>
    <P>As far as I know to date this matter of regional policy is not one that has been mentioned in our negotiations with the European Economic Community and yet when Dr. Mansholt was in Dublin recently he mentioned this matter of regional policy as something which might well be a topic to be raised during negotiations.  We should have in mind the possibility of trying to obtain in the course of negotiations with the European Economic Community some commitment from the Community that we would receive a certain priority or that our particular problems would be recognised under the terms of the EEC's regional policy.</P>
    <P>Immediately one can see a problem about this, because I am reasonably satisfied that any European planner looking at this island from Brussels sees an island unit, whereas in practice here we have two countries&mdash;and this seems to me to be a real difficulty. Looked at from outside by our fellow Europeans we are one island with exactly the same planning difficulties, and the Border does not make any sense at all.  For example, in planning terms it seems to me to be quite obvious that in the Cavan-Monaghan area the working of market towns there only makes sense if you regard part of what is called the Six County area as part of the hinterland of those market towns; in the same way too some market towns in the north should be the natural focus for many people who live at the moment in the Republic.  In the same way too I think the planning of Donegal must be an absolute nightmare because the natural focus for County Donegal is surely the Port of Derry and the industrial activity around Derry&mdash;and this seems to me to be the way in which anybody looking at the planning problems <Col N="86" /> of our island from Brussels must see it.  And yet, as far as I know, we have not taken any steps between ourselves, north and south, to present the case for the island being regarded by the European Economic Community as a major area for regional assistance.</P>
    <P>Even though we may remain politically separated for years, albeit in an increasingly meaningless sense, nevertheless it does seem to me to be important in bread and butter terms for the people of our island, particularly for the people of the Border counties, that we should have between us&mdash; north and south&mdash;some get together in planning terms.  We should have some ideas and some suggestions to make to the European planners for the development of the whole island.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am speaking in ignorance of matters happening behind the scenes because I made some inquiries of the former Minister for Local Government as to whether or not there had been any planning discussions of this kind between planners, north and south.  I was advised that, if there had been, they would probably be dealt with in a document published by An Foras Forbartha and called &ldquo;Appraisal of Regional Planning in Ireland: Seven Seminars.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the preface to this document there is a complaint by Mr. Louis A. Roache, who was Chairman of the Steering Committee for the Seven Seminars, that the conference failed to engage the interest of politicians.  Having read the document I can certainly understand why they failed to engage the interest of politicians.  It seems to me &mdash;and this is something that is happening in many more areas of Irish political life and discussion&mdash;that these seminars were just another public relations effort, a nice get together of technical personnel to swop intellectual ideas, chat, and so on, but with not a great deal of relevance to the actual problems of the community. While the idea of this get together between the planning authorities from the north and south was valuable, it was not nearly as valuable as it could have been, because they largely ignored the fact that they were talking about one island in which there were planning problems on both sides of the Border <Col N="87" /> which were shared and which should be dealt with, if at all possible, on a united basis.  I would suggest to the Government, to An Foras Forbartha and to the Department of Local Government that they should draw up, even in outline, planning proposals for the whole of this island which they might present in negotiation, even on a joint basis with Britain, to the European Economic Community, as planning proposals requiring some endorsement under the regional policy of the EEC.</P>
    <P>In saying this I may be touching on a definite gap in our present planning situation.  While I appreciate the thinking behind planning in regional terms, again I often wonder are we missing the point.  As I understand it, the idea of planning in regional terms was to get a better feeling of the problems of particular areas, to get a better appreciation of the needs of those areas as areas where industry, local authorities and so on were concerned, in other words, to bring planning closer to the people.  I have wondered many times have we achieved this?  I am seriously worried that we may be reaching a situation where our elected representatives have handed over the entire management of areas to civil servants or members of State-sponsored bodies.  For instance, one of the planning organisations is the Eastern Regional Development Organisation. From what I can gather the work of that body will be largely carried out by a technical committee.  Of course this technical committee has no elected representative on it.  There are the professional staffs of the county councils plus the representatives of the IDA, the Regional Tourism Organisation, the Dublin Port and Docks Board, CIE and the Department of Local Government. This is not bringing regional planning closer to the people.  If these bodies meet infrequently and the elected representatives find it difficult to appreciate the full technical background to many problems, what hope have they of contributing when the technical committee put forward plans and proposals?</P>
    <P>Let us face it: experts of this kind can make mistakes and when they make mistakes they can be extremely <Col N="88" /> serious.  There is need for more democratic feed-in, so to speak, into our regional planning institutions, particularly as there seems to be a great shortage of technical people in all fields.  We must find these technical people for all our regions, and I wonder should we not re-examine this situation.  I find it difficult to believe that our island is that big that its physical planning could not be dealt with on a more centralised basis.  I relate this to what I was saying earlier about submissions to the European Economic Community.  This would be one of our difficulties in making a submission to the EEC on national planning.  On the face of it we have no machinery for gathering together the threads of national planning.  The Third Programme for Economic and Social Development meets the situation to some extent but by no means satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong but I get the impression that we have no real over-view of the working of our part of the island, and I would argue we should have an over-view of the whole island. Confirmation of this seems to me to come from the address to the European Economic Conference of Ministers responsible for regional planning which was delivered by the Minister for Local Government, when he said:</P>
    <P>When the reports by the regional co-ordinating groups have been completed the regional development programme will be further considered.</P>
    <P>If we have to wait for the reports from the regional co-ordinating groups before we can go on with consideration of the regional development programme we will be waiting a very long time before we begin to make the extremely important decisions we should be making in regard to the country's infrastructure.  Decisions on the future pattern of our infrastructure are of great importance in the attraction of industry, meeting problems of pollution, conservation and so on.</P>
    <P>In many areas of our life the time has come when we must, in a sense, put aside all thinking and theory, stop all research and investigation, because we are wasting time and will only find out exactly the same answers as have <Col N="89" /> already been found in Britain and elsewhere. For example, I am not at all sure that there is a great deal of point in studying the pollution of Dublin Bay or some aspect of it, because surely water will be polluted in precisely the same way as people have found waters being polluted everywhere else and we will be losing valuable time in carry out this investigation.  If we could begin now and implement some of the methods found for combating pollution in other countries we would be getting a better return for our money and getting on with the job of conservation.</P>
    <P>We are coming to the end of conservation year and it is no harm to have a brief look at this conservation year.  We may find that we have done a great job in making the people aware of problems; have done a good job in roping in public representatives to various seminars; but have we done much towards conserving anything?  Have we made much headway in calling a halt to the problems of environmental pollution, the protection of animal life and so on?  We still await the basic legislation on this matter.  I am not at all sure what has been the cause of the delay in the appearance of this legislation. It may be in circulation among the Departments at the moment but it is a matter on which I have made inquiries from time to time and we certainly should not have to wait very much longer for legislation in this conservation field.</P>
    <P>In passing earlier I mentioned the state of the National Library.  We had an excellent debate here in this House on the state of the National Museum. I have not seen any evidence of action there since the debate in the Seanad and this is something which is crying out for attention and for a new approach. In going through the Appropriation Accounts and the Estimates looking for references to cultural matters I found it difficult to tally the way in which we are very kind to some particular causes and yet neglect some important institutions.</P>
    <P>For example I was delighted to see in the Estimates that the Chester Beatty Library&mdash;this may be a special commitment which we have because of this wonderful gift to the State&mdash;is getting <Col N="90" /> £12,000 each year.  I think that money is exceedingly well spent.  If any Members here have not been to the Chester Beatty Library I would certainly urge them to go there.  I was interested also to see that Marsh's Library got, I think, £3,500.  Again in my view this was money well spent.</P>
    <P>I was interested also to see that the publishers of a book of essays to commemorate the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland received another £3,000.  These between them are nice little sums given to causes where you can imagine people coming along cap in hand with a particular plea and definitely a good project.  It probably was appreciated by many members of the Church of Ireland, for example, that the State had a hand in this book of essays to commemorate disestablishment. Perhaps I am being too objective here, but looking at the overall cultural situation might it not have been more in the national interest and the general community interest that the combination of moneys I have mentioned could have been spent more effectively on the National Museum and the National Library?  Just because particular interest groups come along with a particular point of view we must resist the temptation to channel our money in bits and pieces towards them unless it fits into a pattern of general policy. In this area of the Museum, the National Library and national archives generally, we need firm policy decisions about the progress of these institutions and the role that they are to play in our national life.  When one sees moves like the plan to build a new building for the Department of Agriculture just up the road and when one knows that a site on the far side of Kildare Street is in the process of being developed by an insurance company, surely if there is any opportunity at all to have in this city a real cultural centre of which this capital could be proud&mdash;which would be adjacent to its Parliament&mdash; such opportunity should be availed of? I hope that in the near future we will have major decisions regarding these important national treasures.  We owe it to our community to hold on to these things and to treasure them or else posterity will blame us.  Those, then, are most of the points I wished to raise.</P>

      <P>I wish, first of all, to second the amendment in the names of Senators O'Higgins and Kelly and in so doing to lend my support to the very excellent case Senator O'Higgins made when he was dealing with this rather vexed subject.  He covered the entire ground very comprehensively.  I merely wish to add to that, that in my view, it is a very retrograde step for the Government to take and indeed, listening to Senator Keery when he was enumerating our activities in the United Nations, when he had us lined up with Greece, I thought that here too was another country that parade themselves as a democracy but yet they have the same type of internment without trial.  I think that we seem to be getting into bad company in all spheres.  I sincerely hope that good sense will prevail and that the Government will move away from this daft proposal at this time and at this stage of the condition of our Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During recent months we have lived through a series of crises.  The Government have hopped along from one particular crisis to another, many of which need never have arisen.  I agree with the view expressed in an excellent way by Senator Keery when he suggested that not only the Members of the Oireachtas should be given more information and have access to more direct information but that the public are entitled to know exactly what is going on.  It would allay a lot of public fears and apprehensions if the members of the Government were more straightforward with their announcements and gave the Members of the Opposition especially the information that they require in order to carry out their functions as representatives in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Some of these crises could have been avoided had the Ministers of State devoted more of their time to the actual work of the Departments of State and less to the political type of activity that so many of them appear to have been engaged in, especially during the months of last summer.  The last occasion on which this House sat, we were here until 2 o'clock in the morning because the Minister for Agriculture wanted to bring into force the next day an Act to deal with the horse industry.  Some <Col N="92" /> five months later not one word has been heard of that legislation.  It appears to have been neatly shelved.  We have seen no account of it in the newspapers.  The Minister, as we all know, has been active but he has not been in his Department for a lot of the time since.  It is a pity that in this year of 1970 our nation will suffer because important legislation was not put through in this session.  Senator Keery rightly referred to conservation year and the achievements that we gained from the conferences and the attention that was focused on this aspect of our national heritage.  The Government are the people who must give a lead, must prepare the legislation and bring in the appropriate Bill so that we can hold on to and salvage as much as possible of our national heritage.  The whole idea of conservation year was good but there has been an unnecessarily long delay in including, in this session of Parliament, a Bill to put the good ideas into action. Instead of that we have had a Government-designed crisis after crisis, created either by people jockeying for position or in order to keep the mind of the general public off the sorry plight in which the national economy appears to be.  Too much emphasis is placed on commissions and reports.  For every problem that arises the automatic solution appears to be that some Minister for State proposes that a commission of inquiry or some board be set up to investigate the matter.  This is putting the problem on the long finger and eventually when it comes to be tackled we find the solution will, with the rising costs, be more expensive.</P>
    <P>I was reading recently the report on our reformatories.  While these people took so long to put their findings into print they were very unappreciative of the tremendous work that a small number of people, mainly the religious orders, have done in this field.  The main deficiency here was the fact that the capitation grants for the children in these reformatories were altogether inadequate and were it not for the charity of the brothers and other religious these people would not have been looked after at all.  To bring out a report at this stage that failed totally <Col N="93" /> to keep this vital factor in the forefront was a shame and a poor return for the excellent services that these people have performed on an almost semi-voluntary basis down through the years.</P>
    <P>Looking for a moment at the prison service, here again is an area to which the Government have not given sufficient thought.  It was a bad step to close down our smaller prisons some years ago.  We have the situation now where two of our prisons are almost packed to capacity.  This does not give any scope for the segregation of prisoners into categories and this hinders any effort to rehabilitate the first offenders and the younger prisoners.  There is a need for a new detention centre or house of correction and this could be provided.  The people who staff the prisons are not sufficiently protected and unless this system is changed, recruiting will be difficult.  The longer these problems are put off the more difficulty there will be in solving them.  The fact that our prisons are so overcrowded may be one of the reasons why we see in the papers rather short, and what appear to us laymen to be inadequate sentences for crimes of violence of every kind.  The time may have come when the Houses of the Oireachtas could have a second look at the Capital Punishment Act.  I have held the view all along that we should have on the Statute Book, if only as a deterrent, some form of capital punishment. The price of life would appear now to be very low.  I do not wish to comment on court findings or sentences but I think these cause disquiet especially in rural areas and indeed in our towns and cities.  Elderly people living alone are not getting the protection from the law to which they are entitled and we should have a second <Col N="94" /> look at this particular piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>There should also be some amending legislation brought in to give more protection to farmers and farmers' co-operatives. We have seen in the past year where farmers' co-operatives have suffered, in one case to the extent of £400,000, by these 1970 style cattle rustlers.  The same has happened to a lesser extent over the last two years. Surely if our law is inadequate to deal with these people it must be amended or else people with property, and the cattle trade has always been one of trust, will have to resort to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he thinks that the provisions in the Estimates for drainage and mining relief are adequate.
