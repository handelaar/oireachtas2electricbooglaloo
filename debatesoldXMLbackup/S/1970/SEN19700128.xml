      <P>I have received notice from Senator O'Higgins that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House tonight, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The assurance given by the Minister for Transport and Power, as reported at column 723 of the Seanad Debates of the 18th December, 1969, and the attitude of the Government with regard thereto as intimated to the Tribunal established by motion of Seanad Éireann on 19th December, 1969.</P>
      <P>I am accepting that notice and the matter will be taken from 9.30 p.m. to 10 p.m., or earlier if the business of the day concludes.</P>

      <P>Before we take up consideration of the Committee Stage of this Bill, I should like to indicate that I have ruled the following amendments out of order: Nos. 1, 16, 45, 60, 73, 74, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 86, 87, 97, 98, 99, 100, 103, 107, 112, 113, 115 and 122.  Of these amendments, Nos. 98, 100, 112, 113 and 115 are out of order as they are outside the scope of the Bill as read a Second Time.  The remaining amendments <Col N="1070" /> are out of order as they involve a charge on the public revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer again to a matter on which I spoke on the Second Reading in reference to subsection (3), this novel provision that a reference to an enactment in this Act shall be construed as a reference to that enactment as amended or extended in future legislation.  The Minister at that time confirmed my worst fears that this is a reference forward. In my time, a great many people have objected to a great deal of reference back.</P>
      <P>Legislation by reference can very frequently be confusing and difficult to understand.  Sometimes it is all right, but frequently it is no more than the somewhat obscure statement that in subsection so-and-so of section so-and-so we delete subsection (14) and substitute something for it.  Unless you go back to the previous statute you have not got a clue what he is talking about. This is bad enough but here we have a new idea, a reference forward so that in a future amendment or extension of any of the enactments mentioned in this Bill, any amendment which affects this Bill will not be referred to; it will be merely taken that it is already agreed by the passing of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, it is bad enough to have to keep looking back to, perhaps, two or <Col N="1071" /> three statutes but public representatives, to say nothing of the public, when they see something in an enactment of 1980 may be quite unaware that it, in fact, affects this Health Bill. Therefore, I wish the Minister would have second thoughts in this matter.  It is quite new and it seems to be quite unnecessary.  The Minister suggested that it would save having to put in amendments to this Bill, when it becomes an Act, at some future date, through some change in social welfare legislation, but there is nothing at all unusual in some social welfare legislation saying that it affects the Health Act of 1970.</P>
    <P>This is a type of thing that is quite common and very frequently it is done in a very bad way.  As I understand the Minister, he said that no one will know seeing an amendment to a Nurses Act in 1980, say, that, in effect, that amendment affects an Act of 1970. This is highly undesirable.  One thing I have always argued in favour of in regard to any statute is that not only should it be understood by the officials who have to work it and the lawyers but by the people to whom it refers, the public in general, who have a right to understand legislation.  We are continually complaining about the Establishment getting further and further away and becoming more and more incomprehensible to the public.  I do not go along with that very far but if this sort of thing creeps in&mdash;and this is only the start&mdash;I would agree it is a very bad move indeed.  Therefore, I trust the Minister will have a second look at it.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the time is drawing near when it will be necessary to consolidate health legislation.  Certainly, that is highly desirable but what would happen in the case of a clause like this?  You cannot change anything in a consolidating measure.  Would it be advisable to say that anything mentioned could be amended without reference in the future?  In the Dáil the Minister said that it was due to the parliamentary draftsman and I think he should ask the draftsman again if he is sure that this is a wise thing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheldon is really exaggerating the import of this.  If there is some change in the Social Welfare Acts or the Local Government Acts which might affect this Bill when it becomes an Act the section to which he refers would be adapted to the changes in such Bills.  If it affected materially the health services, or the ambit of the health services, or the interests of the people in the health services, that first of all would be mentioned at Government level and, secondly, when the Bill would come before the Dáil and the Seanad then any change that might have an effect which would be of interest politically could be discussed; Members of the Dáil and Seanad could say: &ldquo;Well, clause X of the Social Welfare Act of 1980 is having this effect on the ambit of the health services&rdquo; and they can discuss it and that is the answer.  It does not prevent debate on it.  If the Dáil or Seanad chose to reject the amendment on the grounds that it would affect adversely or wrongly, from the point of view of the public interest, some part of the health service or administration, then the Government would have to consider it again.  I do not think it is of serious import.  It is really a facilitating section to avoid having to amend the Health Bill in all sorts of ways as a result of an Act on which it depends being itself amended.  That is the position and it has been done before.  I think it is the Social Welfare Act of 1952 which has a similar section and in which there is capacity for adaptation with other Acts which were amended which affected the 1952 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I followed the full purport of Senator Sheldon's argument but if I did he is right.  As I understood the basis of his argument, it is that here in section 2 you have a subsection which states that a reference in the Act to any enactment shall be construed as a reference to that enactment as amended or extended by any subsequent enactment. As I see it, and I think this is in line with Senator Sheldon's argument, the House is being asked to pass the Health Bill with a subsection which will give <i>carte blanche</i> as regards <Col N="1073" /> any changes that may be made in the other Acts and we do not know what changes may be made.  It may be, as the Minister argues, that this is purely a matter of convenience, to avoid having to come back with new Health Bills every time an amendment is made to the other Acts.  I do see that from a practical point of view there is a lot of commonsense behind that but I am just a little bit afraid, and Senator Sheldon is right in this, that if we do things purely to facilitate the amendments because it is convenient at the moment and it seems a good idea to avoid having to come back when other Acts are amended, that we just might be walking into some trouble.  I accept without hesitation that what the Minister has in mind is that the amendments will be of a type that do not alter the whole basis and principle on which this Bill is founded; but, if an enabling section of this sort remains in, the position could result in a major amendment in other legislation being, so to speak, in advance of the event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Sheldon in this.  An abominable departure from good British practice has grown up in legislation here.  I refer to this practice of amending by reference.  Senator Sheldon spoke about the problem of lay people understanding legislation.  When one has responsibilities to discharge it is a very real problem for anyone discharging such responsibilities.  Literally, one sometimes has one's foot on one Act, one's elbow on another and one's eye on a third.  The physical and mental operation of trying to determine what is meant adds to the cost of administering solicitors' offices and, therefore, adds to the cost of their services. Another body will be considering the level of professional charges here and this provides an instance in which consideration will be called for when considering this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Senator Sheldon has raised on subsection (3) of section 2 of this Bill.  Legislation by reference is undesirable.  Such legislation should be kept to an absolute minimum.  That is the general consensus of opinion of <Col N="1074" /> this House and it is only natural that we should view with some degree of alarm the question of legislation by forward reference involved here.  The Minister in his reply indicated that the House need have no worries on this point and said that if, in fact, such a situation came about in the future the bearing of the new legislation on the Health Act would be referred to at Government level, at Dáil level and at Seanad level.  But, surely if it will be adverted to on these occasions, the simplest way of all of having it adverted to on every occasion would be by putting in an appropriate section.</P>
      <P>It seems to me either of two things will happen: the matter will be discussed thoroughly when future legislation comes up or it will not.  If it is to be discussed thoroughly it should be discussed as a section of a Bill and in no other way.  The only guarantee the Minister can give us that we are not, in fact, handing over here not merely legislation by reference but also legislation that will not be immediately apparent to those concerned with the enactment of that legislation, is by striking out the subsection and saying that, in future, all amendments to the Health Act will be by Acts of the Oireachtas and not by indirect legislation by reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of the pressure exercised in relation to legislation by both the Dáil and Seanad, I am afraid I could not agree with the Senators.  If any Government tried to do something nefarious, something against the public interest or unfair to the staffs of local authorities, it would pretty soon be exposed.  In the present climate of education and public opinion I cannot conceive of any such action being taken by a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the practical side of this.  If the Superannuation Acts were amended in the case of local authority officers and staffs and the amending legislation applied to officers and servants of the health boards and, as a result of that, some unfair situation arose for the officers <Col N="1075" /> and servants of health boards, then the unions and the organisations in charge would be sufficiently alive and say: &ldquo;You will not get away with that.  If you are going to pass this Bill you must have an amendment to the Health Acts&rdquo;.  It is a matter of commonsense. I just could not agree that this would happen.  In actual fact, if any changes are made in superannuation arrangements they will go <i>pari passu</i> between one and the other.  The Minister for Local Government could make changes relative to the health authority staffs if, for some reason or other, they should be treated differently. This is a matter of public opinion asserting itself.  I could not conceive of anything being done against the public interest and the very fact that it is mentioned here today is a sufficient warning to any Minister in any Government that he should not misuse this forward reference section for the purpose of doing something against the public interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not, I think, a question of deliberately doing something against the public interest; it is a question of another enactment being amended without somebody affected by it having cognisance of the fact that that amendment will also amend this piece of legislation when it becomes an Act.  In any such enactment some subsection in that enactment should refer to the fact that the proposed legislation will have a consequential effect on the Health Act.  It is true to say that an amendment of any other enactment may have an effect on the Health Act, an effect to which some affected people might not advert at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that what he is asking the House to do is to pass an Act with a variable future content in that there may be changes in the future in relation to which this Act may not be quoted?  This will make life very difficult for those interpreting the Act or advising on it in that they will have to look to the future.  This is a valid <Col N="1076" /> point.  This is a very bad practice and it is one of which we should be very wary.  The expediency of which the Minister speaks does not, I think, call for such a major departure in principle from normal practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Sheldon in this.  I would remind the Minister of the provisions of subsection (2) of section 45 which decides that the way in which yearly means shall be calculated is to be in accordance with Rule 1 of the rules contained in the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  I pointed out on Second Stage that this means that any capital sum that a person may have over the amount of £400 is treated in this rule as if it were bringing in ten per cent, irrespective of whether or not it does.  It is quite conceivable that the Social Welfare Act might be modified in its Seventh Schedule to such a degree that the presumption would be that any capital sum over £400 would be bringing in 15 per cent or 20 per cent.  When the 1952 Act was passed it was quite fantastic to suppose that any capital normally held would be bringing in ten per cent; yet recognition of this fact has been enshrined in successive Health Acts.  The Minister says he could easily point out there is an injustice there and something would be done but, in fact, ever since the first Health Acts based upon this type of means test, we have been supposing that any capital sum of this kind is, in fact, bringing in ten per cent, irrespective of whether or not it brings in anything.</P>
      <P>The Minister's argument that this kind of thing would cause a public outcry and would have to be changed and so on is thereby proved to be false. In this particular instance, this subsection (2) of section 45 makes precisely this kind of reference to another Act which could be modified either way and which would bring with it the modification of the present Act if we leave in the subsection which Senator Sheldon is rightly objecting to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say that I agree with Senator Eoin Ryan. The Minister, quite clearly from the debating point of view, takes the extreme <Col N="1077" /> case of something very upsetting and something underhand being done.  I am not concerned with that at all.  It is very unlikely.  Senator Ryan sees the danger of something that no one even thought of, that some abstruse reference could be made and even the draftsman might for once nod and not notice the effect.  It is all right to say that what is said here and what the Minister says should be remembered by other Ministers.  This I rather doubt, say, in 12 years time.  There have been people in public life who make a habit of reading everything and who keep on reading it for years and who may refer back to what somebody said in 1932 but it is usually in relation to other matters rather than a technical point.  I rather doubt that anyone will refer to the Seanad Debates to see the danger signals that were then pointed out.</P>
      <P>As I say, I am not afraid that some villainous future Minister for Local Government or Health or some other Department will set out seriously to affect people's rights by doing something in consequence of this.  What I am afraid of is that things happen in legislation which are proved to be rather objectionable.  The Committee on Statutory Instruments are very well aware of this.  It would be very easy over the passage of years to lose sight of objectionable things in legislation unless you had an enormous staff and each member had an enormous staff to keep track of all the ins and outs and possibilities.  The Minister rightly said, I am sure, that if some major change were envisaged the Government would have reference to it and the attention of the House would be drawn to it.  Suppose it was not a major issue, something that went on for five or six years and then the courts discovered that someone for five years had been doing something quite wrong.  I think it is a bad principle to go on.  Legislation nowadays is difficult enough to follow and this Bill is not exactly a shining example of light from the point of view of any ordinary person reading it. There is this confusion so that a person reading a Social Welfare Act in 1980 would not know exactly what it means.  I cannot see the advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> The Minister talks about this as being administratively better, and possibly from the narrow point of view that is so, but I think it would lead to much confusion and a type of confusion which it is difficult to put right.  It is never easy for Government Departments or local authorities to admit five or six years later that they were wrong and I do not think they should be put in jeopardy of being wrong through inadvertence because nobody ever believes that a Government Department or a local authority is wrong inadvertently.  At least, if anyone does, I have not yet met him personally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a specific question before he intervenes here.  If, in fact, this subsection is retained and a future Bill not related to health makes an amendment which affects this Bill, will the Health Act, 1969, appear in the Schedule of Repeals in that new Bill or will it not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Amend, yes.  I do not mind looking at this between now and Report Stage to see if there is any way of ensuring clarification.  I am quite willing to do that.  I can see the point Senators have been making but it would be very difficult to do it.  I still think it would be in the interest of any Government in office, regardless of what party they represented, not to confuse the public or the Dáil and Seanad by attempting to enact health legislation in another Bill in a way which would be against the public interest.  I do not believe it would happen.  I shall look into it to see if anything can be done by way of a qualifying amendment to this subsection so as to try to introduce something which will relieve the fears of Senators.  I will try to do that.  I think it will be impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly could not accept that every time the enormous body of local <Col N="1079" /> government legislation and social welfare legislation is altered we have got to have a very elaborate series of amendments to this Bill parallel with them and to make all sorts of new adaptations because I do not think we would be able to get through the business of Parliament on that basis.  I shall look into it and see if anything can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (a), page 5, line 6, to add to sub-paragraph (i):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;including at least one member from each county electoral area and city electoral area&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory. In effect, what we are asking for here is that one councillor from each county electoral area and one councillor for each city electoral area will be appointed to the new health boards. By doing this, much better representation would be given population-wise. On Second Reading references were made to disparities between areas in regard to population.  Special mention was made of Kildare-Wicklow <i>vis-a-vis</i> Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire.  For that reason we thought that, electoral areas being units in any county council area, to have one representative from each electoral area would be the ideal way in which a health authority should be composed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might give an example here of an area with which I am familiar and with which the Minister is familiar, namely, Cavan - Monaghan - Louth - Meath.  It would mean that Cavan which has a representation of three at present would be increased to four, Monaghan constituency which the Minister represents <Col N="1080" /> and where it is proposed to have two, would have four; the representation of Louth would increase from three to five and of Meath from three to five.  It is not asking too much.  It is true that the Minister may argue that the composition of the board might be too big and unwieldy but there could be a cutting down in other spheres of representation.  It is important that public representatives and members of local authorities should have adequate representation on the new health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Fitzgerald on this amendment. One of the important aspects is that each area should feel that it has direct representation and the electoral areas are the obvious choice from this point of view.  One of the big fears throughout the country in regard to this Bill is that there is a whittling down of representation on the health boards.  People feel that local persons will not have as much say as they used to have under the local government system.  Even at the expense of making the boards slightly larger than the Minister intended, we feel that it would be very worthwhile to have at least one representative from each electoral area.  The Minister feels very strongly on this point about too large a board not being as effective but there has been operating since 1960 the Dublin Health Authority which has a membership of 30 and which has proved fairly effective.  I do not think anyone would query that.  In fact, although the membership may be 30 one can count on a certain absentee rate which would give an effective board of 22, which I do not think anyone would consider too large.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider this amendment as one which I think would be welcomed by all parties throughout the country from the representation point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to apologise for my initial intervention. I was at fault because I was referring to the wrong document.  On this amendment I think the Labour Members have a point in that it is equitable that each electoral area <Col N="1081" /> should be represented.  Take a particular county, Wicklow.  The interests may vary from area to area, the west side of the county having a much more rural aspect than the east side; it is still rural but one side is more urban than the other.  If some proposal like this is not accepted there may be elected people confined to certain areas, and the county at large may not have the representation it should have.  You may have an area with no representative on the board, that is no person who would have the interest of this area at heart.  There is merit in the suggestion and I would ask the Minister to have a look at it.</P>

I quite understand the reason underlying it, but you have this growing concept all over the world of enlarging areas for administrative purposes simply because of the change of techniques and the change of characteristics of whichever service is being carried out. The general principle has been accepted, but I could not accept this amendment if for no other reason than what is contained in the Second Schedule, section 2 (1) (a), (b), (c) and (d) where we have this method of ensuring proper political representation in the regional health boards. There is absolutely no other way of ensuring this political representation.  It could not possibly be linked with the concept of electing one member from each county electoral area and city electoral area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House again of the fact that we are providing for local representation through the local committees from each of the county council and corporation borough areas; there will be representatives on the board from each electoral area chosen by the county councils. It will be the duty of these local committees to keep alive in the minds of the regional health boards any obvious defects in the service either in a rural area as compared with an urban area or some particular area.  It will be the duty of the local committees to draw attention to defects in the choice of doctor system or to omissions or to failure to provide the <Col N="1082" /> new child health service in some particular area.  These bodies, I hope, will be very vocal about this.  Now I think we are getting pretty good in this country about communications and small groups protesting through their committees or associations on matters which they regard as important.</P>
    <P>I expect the representatives of the county councils and corporations on these regional health boards to act more and more in a corporate capacity. Perhaps I am too much of an optimist but after about five years operation of these boards I cannot conceive of a Dublin County Council representative deliberately fighting to get a better service for Dublin County Council than for Wicklow or Kildare. I do hope it will not happen.  I hope the regional concept will operate satisfactorily and that the representatives will act very much in their corporate capacity while at the same time obviously having a thought for and a deep interest in the county council to which they are elected.</P>
    <P>This was raised in the Dáil as well, the connection between county councillors and the present health authorities in respect of appeals.  That will still remain.  Not only will those having medical cards have a statutory right of appeal for eligibility but the democratic practice whereby councillors or Deputies for the area, people of importance, can make appeals in regard to decisions on eligibility or unfairnesses in carrying out a particular kind of medical service, will continue in the same way.  The fact that it is a regional health board will not prevent some person in some remote part of Mayo making quite sure a local representative can go to the regional health board's chief executive officer and say: &ldquo;Have you had regard to this particular circumstance in your officer's making this decision?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole of that public relations system will continue and at the same time there will be a statutory right of appeal in regard to eligibility.  The same thing would apply in relation to any defects in the service.  I would hope it would be done largely through the local committees in so far as general defects of the service are concerned as <Col N="1083" /> distinct from particular personal cases of eligibility or non-eligibility.  I would hope the local committees would be given teeth in that way.  I do not think the House need worry about this question of individual electoral areas being ignored, being bereft of adequate service or adversely affected.  In any case I cannot agree to the proposal, as I have said, because of the method of ensuring political representation in the Second Schedule.</P>
    <P>Finally, I do not believe in the regional health boards&mdash;and I have made a statement on this&mdash;being large. I do not want to make them any bigger than from 25 to 32, because the larger they are the more unwieldy they become.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister appears to be so adamant on this.  I want to assure him that in putting down this amendment we were not thinking in terms of politics at all, because in regard to political representation it would have no effect anyway.  It was to ensure that each county council area would have representation on the health board.  After all we are talking now of regionalisation and this is the first real attempt we have had at setting up regional boards.  I have no doubt they will be quite successful but I think they would be more successful if every electoral area believed that they had representation on that particular health board rather than that three out of five or two out of four would have representation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned local health boards and local health authorities. To my mind they will have no powers under this Bill at all.  If we want to give the whole local authority area the feeling of being involved in the new health authority, this is the ideal way of going about it and I would have hoped that the Minister would have another look at this to see if he would be able to meet the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unfair and I think I would be dishonest if I were to say that I could alter the <Col N="1084" /> system.  I know what the Senator is getting at.  I understand his view, that he wants this geographical representation. I am not sure whether in relation to regional health boards so strict and narrow a geographical representation is essential in regard to what the board does and in relation to looking at the health services for a complete area and making certain every part of the area receives a fair share of services and hospital services, and so on.  I cannot do it, if I am to retain the Second Schedule arrangements for appointing the board.  These have been approved by all parties in the Dáil.  They were approved at the time of the Health Authorities Bill, 1960, in relation to the four health authorities.  It is an excellent method of ensuring adequate representation.  I simply cannot do it and maintain the Second Schedule.  I am afraid I cannot give way to the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced that the Minister cannot do it. I have not referred to the Second Schedule to which he has referred. Every section of this has been discussed in the Dáil.  Yet we have amendments in here.  Even on the very first discussion that we had here on section 2 the Minister agreed to have a look at it on Report Stage.  Therefore, it was not really copper-fastened when it passed through the Dáil&mdash;either the Schedules or any of the sections.  For that reason I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments that you cannot have representation on an electoral basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not with getting representation for every area or county or every part of the county that I am concerned but rather with the local jealousies on local authorities.  I can only speak for the local authority of which I am a member. While one may be elected on a political ticket to serve a particular area, it is not unknown for the five members elected for that particular electoral area to become almost one political party in putting down motions to their local authority and in fighting for what they believe their people need in that particular local authority.  This <Col N="1085" /> is designed to prevent the feeling that any particular group on a local authority have no say in what may happen on the health authority.  It is to ensure a better working of the local authority that I should like to see every local authority area and every city ward <Col N="1086" /> area represented on the new health authority.  I find it very difficult to withdraw this amendment because I am not convinced that the Minister's argument is reasonable.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>On page 5, line 11, to add to subsection (2) (a) (iii) the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Such persons shall include not more than two persons nominated by the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in accordance with regulations to be drawn up by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment and the question of staff representation has been mentioned before both in the other House and on Second Reading in the Seanad.  The medical side are very well represented in the Minister's proposals as are the local representatives.  The reason the Public Services Committee of Congress is mentioned is that the Minister did express elsewhere that there would be difficulty in arriving at the method of electing people who would represent such a variety of people as porters up to staff officers and other clerical and administrative grades.  For the information of Senators the Public Services Committee are a sub-committee within the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and there are 15 unions represented on it.  Within these 15 unions you will find every grade of people employed in the health boards and it would be convenient and simple to use the Public Services Committee to provide representation as they would have no problem in electing the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the trade union side we feel that this is an opportunity for the Government to give at least some recognition to the idea of staff and worker participation. There is a precedent for this in the Dublin Port and Docks Board to which the Dublin Trades Council elected two members and no good reason has yet been given me why we cannot have representatives from the staff side on the board.  The Minister <Col N="1087" /> referred to the possibility of getting the staffs involved in a sort of management committee but I do not think this would be accepted by the staffs as being the same as representation on the board.  I do not see any reason why they should be treated as second-class citizens in that regard.</P>
    <P>I believe they have quite a contribution to make.  They would obviously be very useful at administrative level. What we often ignore is that people who work in what appears to be the lowest level of an organisation are, perhaps because of their low position, denied the opportunity of making a greater contribution.  One often finds if one goes into a public office that in many cases the person who knows most about the day-to-day activities in that office is the porter.  I would strongly urge the Minister to consider again including staff representation. We have cut the figure down to two, which would be very little in an organisation as large as the Eastern Health Board which has an extensive staff employed.  We would be satisfied with this figure which would at least be a start towards more modern thinking in worker participation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had considerable discussion on this and I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment. I do not believe that all grades of staff can make equal contribution to what is a matter of executive management. People very often can make suggestions in regard to the individual working of their own particular section of any Department or office but I honestly do not believe that this, at the present stage of affairs, is a practical suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great many of the clerical staff, for example, are in the same sort of position as a chief executive officer and they have their unions to represent them in matters of service, conditions of service and I think, at this stage of the growth of the regional health boards, to have representatives, for example, of the clerical staff on the board would place the chief executive officer in a difficult position and the members and the representatives of <Col N="1088" /> the clerical staff equally in a difficult position.  The professionals are chosen for their ability to contribute in a specific professional field and they are, therefore, different from representatives of the staff and, although I would be willing to give the Public Services Committee of the Congress of Trade Unions an acknowledgment of their competence, how on earth they would be able, in a democratic way, to get representation from 15 different groups of people who work in health authorities I do not know.  I do not honestly think this is a very practical suggestion.</P>
    <P>I have studied this in relation to the State bodies over which I have general supervision for ten years.  I have also read a good deal about it in periodicals related to industrial relations.  There is a great deal of talk about industrial democracy but a great many people, both on the trade unions side and on the employers side, see the difficulty in this automatic participation concept. I read particularly about this, for example, in Sweden.  We have been able to have some success in the joint consultative council of CIE in which groups of management staff meet representatives of the unions at regular intervals and they discuss the sort of grievances that do not necessarily arise under trade union negotiation.  They also discuss suggestions for the improvement of the service.  The number of suggestions made are fairly limited and they are made by certain individuals and the system works fairly well and I think that this is the alternative to trying to get two representatives from a very large number of employees involved in miscellaneous forms of employment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I have to retain the point of view I had before about this.  I do not think it would be practical, certainly not in the first stage of the operation of these regional health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I should like to make here. Firstly, the Minister talks of the difficulties in securing such representation; I think he might leave that to the members themselves.  If we were prepared to grant representation I am quite sure they would be fully able to <Col N="1089" /> work out a satisfactory method of arranging for the designation of the persons.</P>
      <P>The second point I should like to raise is that the Minister has put his face firmly against an acceptance of this amendment.  Does that mean that he is putting his face equally firmly against such representation or will he keep an open mind, in regard to his nominations, to the desirability of such representation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not commit myself in regard to my nominations at this stage because, quite possibly, my nominations would partly depend on the kind of persons who had already been appointed.  We would have to make quite sure that there was not a need to appoint somebody with some particular skill or experience so I could not commit myself as to whether I would appoint for my own nominations somebody representing the staff. I could not commit myself on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister's concern for the Public Services Committee of Congress, their difficulty in selecting from so many different grades and how they could do it in a democratic way.  I do not think this is a principle that the Minister should be involved in.  If Congress feel and the Public Services Committee feel that they can do this, that this should be done, then I think that is their problem.  What I am amazed at is the Minister's attitude, that while he is making the case for the difficulties of the Public Services Committee in trying to select two from 15 of a group yet he seems to have set his face against these groups having any representation at all.  I would like the Minister to elaborate a little bit more on that.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of whom two would have to be selected and I expressed doubts as to whether two people could be selected from all these groups who would have particular and good experience of executive management or who would be able to make an effective contribution to what is fundamentally executive management because in relation to terms and conditions of service as the House knows that is a reserved power of the chief executive officer as of the county managers and in relation to conciliation and arbitration and so forth there are ample means for expressing views about improvements and conditions of service and so on in that way.  That is what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seemed to be the Minister's intention that as far as possible the members of these health boards should not function as representatives of any other groups and I am in total agreement with that and I think if the health boards are to succeed that will have to be stressed right from the beginning, that they have a very important task, that they are selected in various and diverse ways but after that their job is as members of the health board alone and we should try to discourage the idea of representation and especially reporting back by every possible means.  I should like to know if that is the Minister's view on this.  Am I interpreting him correctly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I suppose it is true to say that in no board could the point Senator Quinlan is making be absolute.  Quite obviously, the local authority representatives will have to think to a considerable extent about the county they represent but, in general, I agree with the Senator that if these boards are to be successful those on them must think in a corporate capacity and although a consultant surgeon may be on a board and bring to the board his knowledge of consultant surgery nevertheless, although he can contribute that and he can get good advice on the hospitals operating within the regional board area, he should also think as a corporate member of the regional health board and not always be thinking <Col N="1091" /> narrowly on the aspect of any decision which might or might not affect adversely or favourably some particular hospital or some particular aspect of hispital service.  This is a very difficult thing to bring about.  The same thing applies to the Government of a country. Very much so.  We cannot start a long philosophical political discussion on that but I agree with the Senator, bearing in mind that there are limitations to this, and there are definite representational features in the Bill as, for example, the local authority members who do come from certain county councils and who should act in a corporate capacity as well as acting on behalf of their county councils.  Incidentally, they are the people who do represent the users of the health services on the boards in a corporate capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the Minister's last statement and the point raised by Senator Quinlan. Indeed, this word &ldquo;representative&rdquo; is, perhaps, unfortunate in the context of what we are talking about.  It was not my intention that they would be representatives, as we would normally consider them, of the trade union side of the health board, but if we examine the proposals for the health boards we have the local representatives, the pharmacists, the dentists, the psychiatric nurses, the non-psychiatric nurses, the general nurses, and the one group of people involved in the health services who are excluded are the clerical, administrative and manual staffs.  I do not think that it is asking too much that they should be given two people on the board, as full members of the board and not as staff representatives. I do not quite agree with the Minister that the CEO is the same as the clerical officers, having been a clerical officer myself, for it is not so.  The public services committee and I think the Government, and, indeed, the Minister here today, recognised their competence.  The Minister for Finance on the last day, I think, paid tribute to them on their competence in the 11th round wage negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They do not represent 15 groups as <Col N="1092" /> such.  You cannot say that one person on the Public Services Committee represents, say, the ambulance drivers.  They are representatives of unions, including the big unions like the Transport and General Workers Union and the Workers Union of Ireland which have nurses within their membership.  You cannot just say that they are representing one group, therefore, or that there are only 15 groups.  There are far more. In the Dublin Health Authority, if you examine the broad structure, you will find that there are something like 100 different groups employed at least, that would be a vehicle for electing those members.  This is the policy of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as adopted by their annual congress and they are anxious that they should be recognised on the health boards.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister for another look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind having another look at it, but I want to make it clear that I have read a lot about this.  This whole question of the concept of participation in industry is the subject of very much discussion, and I have read quite recently documents from both Sweden and Germany where there is nearly as much objection from trade union organisations to direct participation in private company management direction as there is from the management side, as they say it places people on the board in an almost impossible position.  There has been, as I say, a great deal of discussion over this whole business and we have nearly reached the stage of thinking that it is authoritative now.  We shall inevitably see changes taking place in the future with regard to all these matters, but in relation to the whole operation of the State boards and the general consideration of this problem I do not feel that I would be entitled to accept the proposal of this kind in the form in which it has been put, but if the Senator likes I will think it over again before Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (b), page 5, line 15, after &ldquo;board&rdquo; to add &ldquo;by at least a quarter of such number.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister in various statements that have been embodied in this Bill as passed by the Dáil has graciously consented to give more than 50 per cent representation to the local members on the health boards.  This seeks to define what the extra amount is and this is our suggestion, that it ought to be increased by at least a quarter.  There are various reasons for this.  Most regional health areas comprise approximately four counties, and if the Minister in giving the increase to local representatives had much less than a quarter he would be giving that increase to a certain county rather than to another, and by a quarter it equalises this increase amongst the counties as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further aspect of this that I should like to direct the Minister's attention to.  The five bodies which it is proposed to make up the eastern health board have already met in the premises of the health authority in James's Street and after not such a protracted discussion agreed on the respective figures for their areas.  This does bring the size of the body up beyond what the Minister might envisage and might in his view make it a bit unwieldy, but in its favour is the fact that agreement has been reached. I do accept the principle of the Minister that large bodies are not necessarily the most efficient bodies, but where we find at least in one region five bodies coming together in agreement and agreeing on the representation that each should have&mdash;and for the Minister's information on the eastern region I give the figures that they agreed upon&mdash;Dublin Corporation, eight; Dublin County, five; Wicklow, four; Kildare, four; Dún Laoghaire, two.  This with the 16 other members would bring, if my mathematics is correct, this body up to 39, which normally I would myself consider a bit large, but I would say that when you have agreement amongst five constituent bodies that represent a health region I think it should weigh to a <Col N="1094" /> great extent with the Minister's decision to allow this amendment to go through.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is more than I am asking for in this amendment, because it is, indeed, slightly more than what I am asking for.  These two reasons I think are very cogent reasons, the first being that it spreads the increase more equitably over each county, and the second that already one region has come to examine what representation there should be from each of its constituent bodies.  I should like the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I understand. The Senator mentioned in this connection the possibility of altering the present constituent proportions in representation on the different local health areas.  These things have to come in the form of regulations before the Dáil and Seanad later, so that there is nothing rigid about the draft proposals put into the memoranda supplied to the Oireachtas.  I think myself that there must be some flexibility left to me in regard to this, and if you say that we must accept a quarter of the number that makes it very difficult, thinking of the various boards throughout the country and the varying numbers of health authorities to be absorbed in one board.  I must have some flexibility related to the different situations that are going to arise.  I must be honest with the House.  I do not believe that there should be more than a fair majority, because I have never believed and I still do not believe that if these health boards operate successfully there will be a continuous opposition from the professional side to the local authority side.  I just do not believe it, and when I went around the country and saw representatives from every local authority in Ireland I said this to them and I could see faces in rows looking at me nodding.  A great many <Col N="1095" /> people know that very well.  It is right that there should be strong representation from the local authority representatives because I feel that it is their democratic right even though the central Government pay for 75 per cent of the total cost of the health services in this country, including the agricultural grant.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think the bare majority is quite sufficient.  I do not believe there will be continuous conflict between the two groups.  Indeed, I should think they are far more likely to come together when they are going over their annual reports, to unite and to ask the Minister for Health for more and more of this and more and more of that, than there is to be a conflict between the two groups of people.</P>
      <P>There will be doctors appointed who have a good sense of public administration or who will quickly begin to grasp the point of view represented in the first instance by local authority representatives, and after a few years they will be working together as a team.  Indeed, as often as not there could be a conflict on which there will be members of each group combining to have a majority or a minority.  It is essential I should have flexibility here, firstly because of the different kinds of boards and secondly because I think it is sufficient to have a simple majority, though not a big one.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty but at the same time I should like him to have another look at this proposal.  I feel that our amendment would make it simpler for him in the long run.  I do not intend to be rigid in the actual proportion but I suggest that if the Minister provided for a majority of nearly a quarter he may find it simpler when he goes later to deal with the various local authorities and particularly the constituent bodies which make up the boards.  He will find it simpler if he has given a majority of more than one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eastern region group have come to agreement among themselves, subject of course to sanction because the Minister will have some say in it, and once an authority have agreed on their <Col N="1096" /> representative membership, it is a strong argument in favour of the Minister having a look at the provision again.</P>

      <P>I assure the Minister that, as far as I am concerned as a member of the Dublin Health Authority, having spoken at some length to my own party members and to members of other parties, I am quite sure that all public representatives would be glad to have some clear majority over non-public representatives.  The majority need not necessarily be a quarter.  They would be far happier with the proposals in section 4 and with the idea of the new boards generally if there was that clear majority.  The Minister intends to meet the local authority representatives again before the provisions of this Bill are operated and from his point of view at any rate he will get a far better reception if he has written into the Bill some specific percentage by which public representatives would exceed the other representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> In our amendment we are not asking for a quarter extra over and above the other members for any political reason. We realise that the public representatives on any health board would be drawn from all parties, with, indeed, some independents.  We are asking that the public representatives on these boards should be in a clear majority because they are the people who have been elected by their constituents to look after their interests&mdash;to strike a rate and to see that the various affairs of the area are dealt with.  Public representatives are the people most in touch with their constituents.  They are the people who most often receive complaints in respect of the administration of any health authority area.  The doctors' representatives, the nurses' representatives, no matter how admirable they may be, will not be doing this work of representation on behalf of individuals. Neither will the Minister's representatives.  They will not have to receive criticism in relation to the increased charge on the rates because of the operation of the new health boards, and an increase there will certainly be.</P>
    <P>It is because of this especially that we feel public representatives should have a clear majority.  If our proposal were implemented, the number of non-public representatives might be 12, and the greatest number of public representatives would be 16.  The health boards would consist of between 27 members and 36 at the greatest.  Our amendment proposes that the Minister could give public representatives more than a quarter more if he so desired. The figure does not seem to be unworkable. It allows public representatives the majority they want and it seems to me that in such circumstances the Minister would get a much more favourable reception, especially from his own party members, when he goes to meet the public representatives.  We ask the Minister very definitely to consider this proposal, not in a political light but from the point of view of getting agreement on administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated on the Second Reading, this is one of the parts of the Bill about which I am uneasy.  I think the Minister has already gone too far in yielding to <Col N="1098" /> democracy in this matter.  The idea that you would give any group a majority presupposes that that group will somehow or other keep all the others at bay or, in the last resort, that they will do it by sheer counting of heads.  That is a very bad spirit, a very bad approach to bring into the health boards which should be team affairs.</P>
      <P>Indeed it seems that a majority in fact means nothing because I cannot see how the situation would arise in which all the party representatives among the local authority members would combine to vote down the others.  You could not conceive such a situation arising.  The very suggestion of having a majority of one group over another is irksome and would act as a means of bringing home to the others that they were only there on suffrage, that they were a second-class type of citizen.  I would prefer to look on the reorganisation of the present health authorities as being in two stages: you have the health boards and you have the local committees, both of which will be doing the job which up to this has been done by the health authorities.  It is quite right that in the local committees the local authorities should have adequate representation, and, indeed, a majority, but the other being a regional matter we should by every means possible endeavour to develop the regional approach and get away from the county approach.</P>
      <P>That is why I believe this majority in itself it wrong and the Minister should not go beyond where he is. Again, there is no discretion left to the local bodies in regard to the rates they have to pay and the levy is laid down by the Minister.  I do not think the matter will arise of whether an authority can resist or not resist the question of an extra penny on the rates.  I hope it will not.  If we have to have services we have to pay for them and the decision as to whether we will have them or not will have to be made on a more national basis, or certainly on a regional basis.  I would hate to see too much county politics intruding.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator <Col N="1099" /> Boland in appealing to the Minister to consider this amendment favourably before Report Stage.  The Minister stated that the public representatives would represent the people who will be benefiting under the health services. This is the important point and not what rates one county might have to pay in the future.  In my own county which is 100 miles in length there will be six representatives on the regional board and when the people have a problem, if they are seeking something or if they feel they are being jeopardised, to whom will they go?  It will not be to the Minister's representatives or to the medical representatives or, indeed, the representatives of the psychiatric nurses, but to the people they helped elect, whether they are in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or anything else.  The doors of public representatives will be open to them from early morning until late at night and the people know that.  For that reason it is very important that the representation from public bodies should be as large as possible on the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5 to delete subsection 2 (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection is inconsistent with what we are trying to do and it would have a damaging effect on the procedures we are setting up.  The section sets out the composition of health boards which will consist of persons appointed by the local authorities, persons elected from the registered medical practitioners and ancillary professions and persons appointed by the Minister.  Paragraph (c) is a temporary measure and I do not think it is a good one.  It says in regard to the second category, those to be elected by the medical and ancillary professions, that <Col N="1100" /> the first appointments will be made on nominations from bodies which in the opinion of the Minister are representative of the medical and ancillary professions or of particular branches thereof.</P>
    <P>I have four reasons for rejecting this temporary measure in regard to the first setting up of these boards.  First, we are setting up a health service which I agree should have as a first priority serving the people and should be in their best interests but in serving the people it must be attractive to those implementing it and to those in the medical profession and ancillary professions who will be participating in it.  Here, however, we are broadening the scope and suggesting that a wider range will participate in the scheme.  They must be encouraged to do so by an accountability from the very start, by electing their own members to the board.  I agree with the views expressed in regard to local representation.  It is very important to have a democratic method of election. Secondly, this Bill is strongly characterised by the wide ministerial powers in regard to making regulations, appointments and nominations.  Certainly it is a skeleton Bill which the Minister will fill out by regulation.  It is necessary to have flexibility and to have this type of framework when drawing up social legislation on such a scale but as a House of Parliament, in order to maintain the balance of power, we ought restrict those powers as far as possible, where the Minister is asking for nominations which in his opinion are representative of the medical profession rather than letting them elect their own representatives to the boards.  We are giving an unnecessary power to the Minister.  I do not think the Minister will take me as imputing misuse of that power because I am not but we must control as far as possible any delegation of our powers in setting up the boards and it is unnecessary to have this stop-gap measure which will only apply to the first setting up of the boards.</P>
    <P>My third reason is that this could be taken as implying that these professions are unable at present to arrange for such machinery.  If the Minister does not accept this amendment I <Col N="1101" /> imagine he may use the argument that the local bodies and the Minister would be geared to elect members while the others would not be.  This is not true; it is an argument of expediency but, in fact, it does not do justice to the medical profession or the ancillary professions to say they would not be capable of setting up fair and democratic electoral processes.  Finally, this is an example of where we can abide by a perfectly sound constitution of the boards, to the extent that we can make them democratic and accountable. This is a temporary measure which takes away those two qualities from these professions.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to delete this subsection in order to make the process more democratic.  It would make it more acceptable to the medical profession because in framing a health board you are framing it on solid foundations if the first time you do it you determine how it can be done hereafter and you do not have to have a special way of setting up machinery the first time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Bourke has hopelessly misunderstood the whole purpose of this subsection.  I wish she had read the Dáil debate.  I have no intention whatever of taking away the democratic rights of consultants.  What I said in the Dáil was that it was utterly impossible administratively for me to set up elaborate permanent electoral machinery, with registers and what-not, for nurses, psychiatric nurses, surgeons and consultants for each of these regional board areas by October of this year.  These would come before the Dáil and Seanad in the form of regulations to be passed and, in the interim, I would simply ask the professional people in the area to nominate in their own democratic way, on an informal basis, whatever number of consultants and general practitioners I indicated would be desirable for each regional board, together with nurses, psychiatric nurses and pharmacists.  If the medical association of a very large area, such as the Eastern Health Board area, decided that, for the first occasion, they would not all meet and form an unofficial panel but that they would send representatives for an executive council meeting and entrust the executive <Col N="1102" /> council for that area&mdash;it might be an <i>ad hoc</i> one or one already constituted&mdash;to nominate a representative, for instance, of the general practitioners of the area, I would accept that. My intention is to ask the consultants and others&mdash;they will know they will be in the glare of the public eye and they are extremely responsible people &mdash;to do this kind of informal nomination in the first instance, without having to obey a strict pattern of regulations, regulations which will come before both the Dáil and Seanad ultimately.</P>
      <P>Senator Bourke has really misunderstood me.  I am sure the Senators would accept my proposition for the first election, knowing these people are responsible and not likely to appoint someone grossly unsuitable for the position of, for example, consultant surgeon for the Eastern Health Board or someone who might grossly misrepresent the views of all the other consultant surgeons in the Eastern Health Board area.  I am perfectly certain the thing will work out satisfactorily and then, in 1972, we would hope to have some statutory arrangements&mdash;these will have to be agreed with the medical associations and by the Dáil and Seanad&mdash;for a permanent form of electoral system for these various professions to the boards.</P>

      <P>The Minister did and that is why I am inclined to support him in this.  As originally introduced, the provision read: &ldquo;Paragraph (a) (2) shall not apply in the case of the first appointments of members of a health board&rdquo; and the inference was that the Minister himself would make the appointments.  The Dáil objected to that and the Minister brought in an amendment on the Report Stage which is incorporated in paragraph (2) (c) of the Bill as passed by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am aware of what happened in the Dáil.  I am also aware <Col N="1103" /> that there was this amendment. I understand that the professions are happy to feel they are in a position to elect members in co-operation.  I do not see the enormous ministerial administrative difficulty the Minister seems to see in drawing up regulations. The medical profession have a fairly tight-knit organisation.  They have their union.  They have methods of co-operating with the Minister in drawing up regulations, regulations they envisage could be implemented next October which would put them on the same footing as other members of the board.  If this is possible then I would regard it as a better method of setting up the original board rather than have a preliminary board which will not be in full operation until 1972.</P>

It will be very difficult to get it into operation, particularly in relation to the boards, by October, however anxious I am in the matter.  It is an immense measure and my staff are working very hard on it.  I can assure the Senator that, with all the co-operation in the world, it would be impossible and so I think there will be a reasonably democratic election by the bodies concerned for the first occasion and then something more formal in relation to the second and subsequent elections.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the Minister, one should say that the general public has rather a wrong idea about the tightness with which the medical profession is organised in this or any other country.  One just cannot say how many doctors there are in a particular area at a particular time. A certain number are registered in the Medical Registration Council's register, but the doctors may not be there; they may be in another country.  There are some doctors who are members of the Irish Medical Association, but not all doctors have to belong to that organisation.  The same applies to the Irish Medical Union.  If one wants to get a register of doctors in a particular <Col N="1104" /> area to form the basis of electing a representative I do not think that can be done easily.  I do not know whether or not it could be done by October next.  If Senator Bourke has information that it can be done I will not dispute that but I can see the Minister's difficulty.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that the medical profession is very pleased that this Bill proposes, for the first time, to give it representation officially on boards which will be responsible for the health services of the country. Naturally it would also like to be responsible for the election of its own members to these bodies.  The Bill obviously recognises the enormous difficulty there will be in setting up an actual statutory electoral body and I do not think that at the time the professional medical organisations were worrying about this matter they realised the election would have to be on such a strict statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister's assurance now that the initial nomination by himself will follow a reasonably democratic election by the doctors in the area will do much to reassure them and the further fact that elections in a more formal way will take place in two years time, in 1972, will do much to settle their worries in the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (5) to insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) In the case of a first appointment of members of the Eastern Health Board subsection (2) (a) (i) shall not apply to appointments from Dublin Corporation, and the persons to be appointed shall be appointed at a meeting of persons who were entitled to vote as representatives <Col N="1105" /> of the Dublin Corporation at the last previous Seanad General Election.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We come to a thorny problem here&mdash;&mdash; I am sure this problem has been concerning the mind of the Minister&mdash;as to how he would nominate from Dublin Corporation whatever representation is eventually decided upon unless there are local elections before 1970 because it is, I think, in the Minister's mind to have these health bodies established by approximately September-October, 1970, and to have them in existence for six months so that they would become <i>au fait</i> with the work and the area they have to cover. In the absence of an election some method has to be found by which Dublin Corporation will get representation.</P>
    <P>The suggestion in the amendment in my name is a very simple one, that whatever proportion is allotted eventually to Dublin Corporation, those members should be taken from past members of Dublin Corporation, if you like, persons who were members of the dissolved body.  My main argument is that they still retained a vote in the Seanad election and, as they did retain a vote in the Seanad election, it would be only reasonable and fair that from their number should be elected the representatives on the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I am not a member&mdash;an ex-member I should say&mdash;of Dublin Corporation. I have never been a member of Dublin Corporation.  If we have to have equity, reasonableness and, possibly, the shaking of hands after some unfortunate incident, it might go a long way in actual fact to reinstate the interests, not alone of the ex-members but, possibly, of the people of Dublin in local government.  I shall not go into the merits or de-merits or reasons for the dissolution of Dublin Corporation but even the Minister will agree that it is not a satisfactory method to have one man running a body like Dublin Corporation and especially where the people have not the personal touch.  If a method such as this is used to appoint the members, whatever number it may be, who represent Dublin Corporation in such fashion on the basis that they <Col N="1106" /> had votes at the last Seanad election, the Minister might think that it would be reasonable enough for that reason to allow those ex-members to vote as a body and from that body to get representation on the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 9 which is in my name and that of other Senators is as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before subsection (5), to insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Notwithstanding anything contained in any enactment (or in the Dublin City Council (Removal of Members) Order, 1969, dated 24th April, 1969) the members of the dissolved Dublin City Council may meet and select the persons to be appointed by the Dublin Corporation (at a meeting convened by the Dublin City Manager) as if the Council had not been dissolved, provided that this subsection shall not apply if the Dublin City Council is restored before the first appointments are made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 is very similar indeed to the amendment which has been moved by Senator Belton.  In my view, the wording is slightly better in that it does cover the evenuality of the Dublin City Council being restored before the first appointment are made, in which case the subsection will not apply.  I did not consider it necessary to put in any reference to voting at the last previous Seanad election.  Of course, this is the argument and precedent for it, as we all know, that they retained their vote in the Seanad election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should be very grateful to this side of the House for the fact that we put down the amendment because it does get over a problem and the problem does exist.  He did say, replying to the Second Stage debate, that he would have to discuss this matter of appointing persons to the Eastern Health Board with the Minister for Local Government and the method is spelt out for him now.  Like the previous speaker, I do not wish to get involved in the reasons for and the arguments about the dissolution of <Col N="1107" /> Dublin Corporation but this is an opportunity at least to allow the citizens of Dublin to be represented on the health board through the people who were elected, regardless of what happened afterwards.

      <P>The position is that under section 52 of the Local Government Act, 1941&mdash;I do not think I need to read the clauses&mdash;the Minister for Local Government may make consequential provisions to deal with situations that arise when a dissolution of a local body is enforced and he can deal with this by making appointments as he thinks fit to vacancies on subsidiary bodies.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister for Local Government, if he so chooses, when this Bill passes and when the resolutions are passed in the Dáil and Seanad for the formation of the regional health boards and their actual constitution, appointing Mr. Garvin if he chooses, to represent the whole of the Dublin Corporation.  There is equally nothing to prevent him appointing any number of persons he wishes to represent the Dublin Corporation on the Eastern Health Board.  I shall be in touch with him about this.  It would be unfair for me to ask him to commit himself in advance in regard to this situation.</P>

    <P>All I can say is that I fully appreciate the reason underlying these amendments, that there is a certain <Col N="1108" /> anomaly.

      <P>I do not think I quite understood what the Minister said the same way as Senator Belton.  I understood the Minister said he would discuss this matter with the Minister for Local Government; he pointed out he recognised the problem of the eastern health region and again reminded us the Minister for Local Government had power to appoint people.  However, this is not what the amendment is trying to do.  What we are asking is that a meeting would be held at which people would be elected, which is very different from saying that the Minister would appoint people, even if these people happened to have served on the Dublin Corporation when it was in existence.  Perhaps, the Minister would clarify what he has in mind.</P>

      <P>We would be getting into very controversial waters if I were to start talking about the dissolution of the Dublin City Council and as to who should or should not be appointed by the Minister for Local Government. This is a point of principle, and the Minister for Local Government, quite rightly from his own point of view, might say in regard to the city council: &ldquo;I dissolved you.  You are not persons whom I would think fit to take this decision.&rdquo;  One gets straight into this argument and you really cannot do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, perhaps, put his finger on the point that may be at issue here.  It is a question, as I see it, of a democratic or an undemocratic approach to this matter. The view taken by those who sponsored the Fine Gael amendment&mdash;I have no doubt the same motive is behind the Labour amendment&mdash;is that so far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned the proper people to make the election are the people who were elected at the last city council elections. They have, as Senator Belton pointed out, the right to vote for Members of this House.  We either approach this in a democratic way or we do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the views of the Chair and I respect them, and I am fully aware of the fact that we cannot on this amendment or at this stage discuss the reasons for the dissolution <Col N="1110" /> of the city council.  However, it is relevant to say that whatever reasons may exist for the dissolution of the city council by the Minister for Local Government they are not and should not be a relevant consideration for the Minister for Health in dealing with the Health Bill.  We are dealing with a Health Bill; we are dealing with regionalisation; we are dealing with the establishment of the regional boards, and the Minister apparently visualises a situation where a very important regional board, the eastern board, is going to be established by election by certain of the councils or county councils concerned, but at the discretion not of the Minister for Health but the Minister for Local Government as regards other members of that board.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there is nothing to prevent the Minister for Local Government making particular appointments. I do not know what other colleagues of mine on this side may feel, but I do not think that is going nearly far enough.  I accept fully, when the Minister says he will consult with the Minister for Local Government, that he intends doing that.  I do not know to what extent the Minister for Health is likely to be able to influence the decision of the Minister for Local Government in this matter.  I would prefer to see the hands of the Minister for Health strengthened in this matter and that we should write into this Bill the particular machinery for the election so far as membership from the former Dublin City Council is concerned. There is no question then of the Minister for Health having to depend on the good offices of the Minister for Local Government.  There is no question of the Minister for Health having to plead his point of view before the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>I want to see the hand of the Minister for Health strengthened in this matter and strengthened in the way proposed in these amendments.  There is a difference in the wording of the amendment.  I do not think it is particularly important.  An agreed amendment could be worked out.  The one central idea is there in both of these amendments and I would strongly urge <Col N="1111" /> that this House should accept one or other of the amendments.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned with the rights or wrongs of the dissolution of Dublin Corporation or any other body for that matter.  This is not why we were motivated in putting down this amendment.  What we are primarily concerned with is the amount of goodwill that will be required in the setting up of this eastern regional board which is the board that will be responsible for a much larger number of people than any other regional board. I am sure the Minister and the Government are as concerned as we are that these regional boards should get away to a good start, because if they do not I do not know if they will prove as effective as we would like them to be.  We should not be concerned with the Dublin Corporation as such.  We should be concerned with the people whom the members of that corporation represent and through their representatives they should have a say in who would represent the people on the regional health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.10:</P>
      <P>In subsection (5), line 35, before &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for the purposes of considering and if thought fit passing with or without amendment&rdquo; and in line 37, before &ldquo;has&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the draft as amended&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment with a view to understanding what is intended by the subsection drafted in its present form.  In the normal course regulations are laid before the House and there is no question of laying a draft of the regulations before the House.  The only difference there is between two different methods of approach.  In the first case, where regulations are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, it is necessary to move a resolution to annual them. They take effect when they are made by the Minister under a particular statute and they are annulled if the Oireachtas passes the necessary resolution.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Minister's words in the Dáil that a concession was intended to be given here and I should like to pin-point the precise nature of this concession.  I understood the only concession is that the regulations do not take effect until there is a resolution approving them.  In this situation we would be given an alternative method simply of having a debate; the debate would not, in fact, give the Houses of the Oireachtas any additional opportunity of improving the draft if the draft did not seem to be right.  It is in accordance with the proper dignity of this House that it should feel capable of improving draft regulations coming from any Minister, however skilful he or his advisers might be.  As I understand the word &ldquo;draft&rdquo; in its general use, it is something capable of amendment; it is not something final but is offered by one party to another for improvement on the basis that it may be improved.  Possibly, in certain circumstances it is the process of negotiation, and something like negotiation is intended to proceed here between the Executive and Legislature.</P>
      <P>If we cannot amend the draft&mdash;the intention of the amendments we propose to sections 44 and 45 are similar to the intention behind this amendment &mdash;I see very little point in having it in this form.  There is a built-in reason for not accepting any amendments in so far as it would seem necessary for the Minister to reject amendments unless statutorily empowered to accept them.  Perhaps he would be in the position here, standing over draft regulations, where he would listen to members of his own party making some points on how they could be improved and bringing to him knowledge which he previously did not have.  The idea of laying draft regulations before the House is a very desirable development; it would be valuable to this House if Members felt that they were of use to the country and could improve draft regulations.  On amendment No.12 I shall be making some comments on the rules which have emanated from the draftsmen.  Perhaps I could anticipate some of the things I may be saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have a set of draft regulations for the <Col N="1115" /> functioning of a body which failed to make provision for certain matters and these draft regulations might come before the House and might contain provisions, for example, whereby a man might be a member of a health authority and be convicted of a criminal offence and yet not be disqualified from continuing in membership. You might have draft regulations providing for a man with a lot of property being a member of a body who would continue to be a member of that body after he had been declared a bankrupt.  You could have draft regulations for the government of a body that provided a man would not be disqualified if he became a lunatic and still exercised great power in relation to the control of the property in question.  You might have a set of regulations establishing some body which gave it a lot of property without giving it any power to borrow money on the property and thereby sterilising considerable property to the disadvantage of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could see draft regulations with defects coming under these three sections.  I accept the Minister's sincerity that he considers he is making a concession on this.  I do not wish to press it too far, but I wonder if advice has been taken on what the position will be if draft regulations were submitted to and rejected by the House. Is the Minister empowered under this section to re-submit draft regulations or does he come to a full stop?  I recall the 1953 Health Act that enabled the Minister by Order to bring certain sections of the Act into power.  A Minister vacating office made an Order bringing these sections into power and it was found necessary to come back to the House for a new Act as the Order could not be revoked.  Does the Minister want to be in the position, after he has laid draft regulations before the Houses of Parliament and has listened to many good points made by Members of these Houses&mdash; not perhaps political points at all&mdash; and is convinced himself that they are good points, that he cannot take advantage of the wisdom presented to him without coming back and enacting a new Health Act?  I submit that the <Col N="1116" /> amendment is a desirable one for reasons of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  The case has been well stated by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  On the Second Stage the Minister justifiably emphasised the fact that he was giving the Seanad more power in relation to such regulations than it often has in that we would have the right to veto them and not merely to hold them up, to delay them for 90 days.  I made the point that we apparently would not have the right to amend them and, in answering, he suggested that what could be done would be that a regulation would be rejected and that he would then come back and submit another regulation.  It is quite obvious that such a method would be cumberous in the extreme and that if we in this House had the right to amend regulations the old procedure would be much more efficient.</P>
      <P>The Minister today has been rejecting certain suggestions on the grounds that they would be unnecessarily cumbersome and unwieldy and slow in practice.  This amendment suggests a way in which his regulations could, if thought necessary, be improved and amended by this House immediately without the necessity of first vetoing them and then putting him under the obligation of redrafting and re-submitting them with the danger that they might again be rejected.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, therefore, on the very grounds that the Minister uses in other connections, grounds of efficiency and, as Senator Alexis FitzGerald said, the utilisation of the combined wisdom of this House, on these grounds this amendment I think should be accepted by the House and by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I brought this point up before because I was somewhat at sea about the difference between regulations laid before the House and regulations laid before the House in draft.  I took different opinions on it. None of the opinions was the same so I am still slightly at sea as to the difference between draft regulations. Even if draft regualtions have a rigid meaning, this Bill is really a committee <Col N="1117" /> Bill and, as mentioned by Senator Miss Bourke, it is a skeleton that has to be filled in by regulations.  There are so many regulations involved in this that they should be by draft and the concession should be made, even in this Bill for the moment, that, when regulations are laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas, the Members of each House would have the opportunity of amending these regulations. That is what I would like the Minister to elucidate for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with all that has been said.  Amendment No. 114, which is being taken with amendment No.10, is practically identical with those put down by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  It is a practical way of dealing with regulations.  There is a worthwhile reason for doing it this way in that, where one cannot propose amendments, where one must either accept or reject, one is inclined perhaps not to pay so much attention to the matter.  If one gets a document that one can amend, then one is inclined to examine it.  There is also the very valid point made by Senator FitzGerald that it is a bit ridiculous that one can only reject the whole or accept it, that one cannot modify.  Often we will be in a position where we will agree with 99 per cent of a regulation but, if one disagrees with only 1 per cent of it, one has to reject the lot.  It seems to be unnecessary work both for the Minister and his officials and the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment and the others that are being considered with it.  The Minister would be doing a very good day's work if he were to accept this amendment.  A number of very weighty arguments have already been put forward and I have no doubt that the Minister will regard them as weighty arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House and the other House are legislative assemblies.  It is our job, surely, to consider legislation coming before us, whether it is coming in the form of a Bill or in the form of regulations or draft regulations.  We lose all purpose as a legislative assembly if we have no power to amend the legislation <Col N="1118" /> coming before us.  Apart from the obvious practical disadvantages of a system whereby this or the other House can merely accept or reject a global regulation brought before them, it seems to me that we are not acting realistically as a Legislature unless we have the power of not merely considering but amending what we are considering.</P>
    <P>I can see a situation arising where, if this section and others throughout the Bill remain unaltered, Members of the House my find themselves put in rather difficult and embarrassing situations. Under subsection (5) of section 4 it is provided that a draft of regulations which it is proposed to make under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until legislation approving of the draft has been passed by each House. The House may find itself in a situation where the Minister in all good faith comes before the House with a draft regulation which he wants to get passed as a matter of urgency, not for his own convenience but for people who are to be affected by it under this Act.  We then find ourselves in the position where some Members of the House have a strong objection to a particular portion of a regulation, that they make a good argument as to why that portion of the regulation should not be accepted by the House.  The Minister then is in the position of having to say to the House: &ldquo;Well, that is true.  I accept that that is a good argument but unfortunately under section 4 (5) of the Act I must have the entire regulation or none of it.&rdquo;  You cannot amend it and you must give him all or nothing, and the House, if it feels sufficiently strongly on the matter, has then no option but to reject the entire regulations as drafted.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Members of the House may feel that it is better to accept a curate's egg type of regulation which is in their view largely bad and only good in spots rather than to delay matters by rejecting it in a situation which, as I say, may be a situation of urgency&mdash;by rejecting it and having the whole thing re-submitted. <Col N="1119" /> I do seriously think that in the interests of the Houses of Parliament, of the legislative bodies, and the interests of the smooth functioning of this legislation as well, the Minister would be doing a good day's work if he were to accept these amendments. If he did not feel like accepting them as they stand most of the Members on this side of the House would feel that if the Minister is prepared to meet us by introducing Government amendments on Report Stage we would be happy with that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to support the cases made.  In point of fact we lose all function here if we are not capable of amending.  Surely a regulation in its passage before being printed in the Minister's Department would have originated in one section and probably been shown to the others who would, if they saw anything wrong at that stage, have their normal right of amending.  We are only asking that we should be in the position to look at it in the same way and be able to argue for a change and thereby bring in better regulations.  I do not think that there can be any argument for not accepting these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I could not possibly agree with those who have spoken on this question. These are ministerial regulations related to very detailed consideration of construction, organisation and standards and so forth.  I suppose that the House realises that in relation, for example, to regulations setting up the regional health boards there could be such a conflict of opinion between the Members of the Dáil and the Seanad without any kind of political inconsistency that you would have amendments that might be introduced and passed in the Seanad and these detailed regulations would be rejected by the Dáil.  There could be all sorts of different points of view about the constitution of a regional health board in one area or in another.  It is because these regulations relate to very detailed matters, and because there could be such a conflict between the two Houses, <Col N="1120" /> that the Minister must be fundamentally responsible in putting forward the regulations.  If one House modifies the regulations it would seem in some ways to cut across the powers of the other House.  As the various provisions of the Bill stand, regulations must either be submitted to both Houses before making for approval in draft form or else submitted to both Houses after being made and either House may annul them.  I do not think that there is any need for either House to be empowered to amend the regulations, which would give rise to complications in the other House.  If either House refuses approval to the draft regulations or decides to annul the regulations that have been made, then the Minister will have to have new draft regulations or new regulations before the House, and if he wishes to have them passed he will have to take into account the wishes of the House in respect of the regulation.  In this way I think that the rights of both Houses of the Oireachtas are preserved.</P>
      <P>For example, Seanad Éireann could move an amendment &ldquo;that Seanad Éireann declines to approve of draft regulation so-and-so unless the following changes are made&rdquo; and if a majority is secured in the Seanad the Minister would then have to go back and redraft the regulations, taking into account what has been said here, or else draft them in such a way that he thinks on balance they would be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in connection with anything so detailed as the regulations provided in this Bill there is the difficulty that he could go back to the Dáil, and if the Dáil were prepared to accept some regulations suggested by the Seanad he could be faced then with a further difficulty that some regulations or some amendments might be proposed which would have secondary effects on the rest of the Bill and the whole Bill itself would have to be amended.  As I have said, I quite agree with the modern concept of democratic procedure, but I am afraid that we are up against enormous complications in legislation of this kind and it is up to the Minister to try to <Col N="1121" /> frame regulations that are likely to get the consent of both Houses.  As the House very well knows, this concerns a whole lot of complicated detailed considerations in relation to regional health boards, regional hospital boards, Comhairle na nOspidéal, the standards to be adopted, and so forth, and I think that the whole arrangement must be done by one blanket regulation either rejected or accepted.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister to use his intelligence to put forward regulations that are likely to have a majority view accepting them and likely to be accepted by the majority, and it is up to the Minister to at least show consistency in framing the regulations so that he would not get himself into trouble and offend the legislature by offering regulations that do not seem to show any consistent pattern in relation to any particular matters that might be discussed.  In other words, if I was to put forward regulations in Dáil Éireann for the regional health boards that showed gross inconsistency of treatment as between one regional health board and another that would reflect either incapacity on my own part or an attempt to favour someone on my part, I would be asking for all the trouble I would get and I would be doing a very bad day's work if I tried to force it in through the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Seanad to accept the position that these regulations, for instance, detailing the whole eight regional health boards proposals will be complex, and to think that every detail would have to have the consent equally of the Seanad and of the Dáil is impracticable.  This is a point into the discussion of which we could go for a long time, going into details in relation to the operation of the Bill.  As I have said, these are matters for the commonsense and the perspicacity of the Minister to put forward regulations which the majority of the two Houses will accept, and I could not possibly accept these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister will not for one moment think that if he introduces regulations, for instance, as he gave the example himself, in relation to the eight health boards this or the other House would <Col N="1122" /> tear them to pieces.  They might very well make suggestions which they would feel in the light of their experience would improve the regulations considerably, but certainly the approach from this side of the House would be a constructive one, offering what we felt would be improvements to the regulations or draft regulations. I am only a short time here, but I am very interested and it has been a great enlightenment to me to hear one thing emerge, when the Minister mentioned that regulations or draft regulations should not be passed unless the Minister does so and so.  As the Minister has told us, we could move a motion. This at least is something to have learned from the discussion, that such a motion could be put forward to draft regulations saying that we do not particularly want to reject them out of hand but that they should be rejected unless the Minister himself decides to amend them in a certain way.</P>
      <P>That I understand was more or less what the Minister was saying.  This is certainly not the advice or the explanation of what could be done on draft regulations that was given to me by several people and, indeed, I would ask the Minister that he might again just before we leave these amendments clarify this position for us and let us know categorically if we can enter a motion like that on the subject of draft regulations.  It certainly was a great surprise to me to hear it.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I have not a very legalistic mind.  I have never had, and I must confess, perhaps, that it is a great advantage sometimes. I feel, on the other hand, that one makes progress in certain terms without a legalistic mind.  It is quite obvious to me and I hardly believe that the Leas-Chathaoirleach would refuse to accept a resolution of that kind, a motion of that kind, saying that Seanad Éireann declines to approve of draft regulations unless the following changes are made in them by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to prevent such a thing being done.  There are not many precedents for these kinds of regulations, which are not made in the House and are subject <Col N="1123" /> only to annulment.  I cannot recall any legislation of this kind.  It is something perfectly obvious.  I do not see how the Cathaoirleach could refuse to accept a proposition of this kind.  It could still leave us in this difficulty: there might be a resolution of that kind framed by Seanad Members in relation to draft regulations and the proposals might reflect the opinions of certain Members.  If I were to accept the proposals made, I would be getting myself into trouble with people in the Dáil who might feel that the balance had been upset in regard to their particular county councils or counties.  It is a very complicated business.  There would have to be some kind of omnibus resolution in respect of these things if the Seanad grossly disapproved of them.  For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I just wish to raise a query.  Is it not possible that as a result of the argument here the Minister himself would want to amend because he would see suddenly a weakness or a danger in something in a regulation?  Does the Minister then have to ask his party Leader to move that the Seanad reject the regulations unless the Minister makes the change that the Minister himself wants to make?  How ridiculous can we get?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>Would that not be very much the second best compared with having the right to make the change when it appears necessary? We have the practical fact that no change can be made in legislation unless the Minister approves&mdash;in other words, whatever the party says.  The Minister's party will naturally have to back the Minister and that guarantees that what the Minister wants, so long as he has a parliamentary majority, will be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy with the Minister's point of view on this.  That he comprehends our point of view is illustrated by the fact that we are having a debate on this subsection which, and I am open to correction here, is a precedent.  I do not know of any other example of a section in which there is provision for draft regulations.  It is only right that the House should face up to the implications of the subsection.  The Minister made one point and, having listened to him, I felt that I should have been more critical in regard to my own draft.  I had not fully faced up to the implications of amendments in one House which are not to be reconciled with amendments of another House.  None of us wants to propose amendments which would create a mess; certainly I do not.  If the Minister wished to have a debate resulting in amended regulations which did not have an element of disorder in them, this could be done by providing the order in which these amendments would be taken, that the section or subsection in question could, in fact, provide that the regulations should first <Col N="1125" /> come before the Dáil and then be considered by this House when amended by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, I am a novice in this and, perhaps, this would require an amendment of our Standing Orders, and, perhaps, an amendment of the Standing Orders of the Dáil, to deal with what would be a new kind of procedure.  I have been looking through Standing Orders to see if there is anything in them to cover this kind of situation and there does not seem to be.  However, there could be, and it might be the duty of this House to amend Standing Orders accordingly if this amendment were passed.  I hope I do not sound too legalistic but we are dealing with the law and, therefore, I suppose one is allowed use this kind of language.  I also feel, and every Member of the House will share this feeling with me, that this House should not simply be a target for abuse, for the suggestion that we are a useless body, for questions asking what is the purpose of this body and how much does it cost or what are its functions. We would all like to feel that we are doing a useful job for the country.  We do not want to destroy the cool, quiet, friendly atmosphere which we have and which we all like.</P>
      <P>The Minister is wrong if he thinks that the only kind of problem he will be faced with in relation to draft regulations will arise from a conflict as between one locality and another.  I spoke on Second Stage of this Bill and the Minister knows my position.  There is no question of it being in conflict with the opinion of my party and I did not make my speech without getting the guidance of my leader so that I might express my view.  Regulations might come before the House which to a large degree would commend themselves to me but yet might contain elements to which I might object for as strong reasons as I support the Minister's policy in relation to health but which to the officials who advise him would not be understandable but might have some justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether I made myself clear when trying to make the point that we have great respect for <Col N="1126" /> our civil servants, and long may we retain it, and that is not just said for the purpose of pleasing anybody who may read or hear what I say.  It is true, but not all the wisdom in the world is mustered behind the Minister and it would be very unwise guidance if those who advise him thought that all the wisdom in the world is mustered behind them.  The regulations we may be faced with may be as defective as the rules set forth in the Second Schedule are defective, so defective that unless I were to retire from what I am otherwise doing I could not set about drafting amendments.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of things which seem to me capable of giving rise to great trouble and I hope that, when we come to deal with the Second Schedule, there will be some clarification. I gave some examples.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister appointing the entire Cabinet to membership of the health board.  There is nothing to prevent him appointing a sufficient number of Senators and Deputies to the health board.  There is nothing to prevent him maintaining on the health board or removing from the health board established criminals or lunatics.</P>
    <P>These are the rules submitted to us after great care and consideration. We may be presented with regulations which will have similar defects.  We may favour the general trend of the regulations, but with the kind of defects about which I spoke, and because they will have these defects, we will be forced to vote against the whole set of regulations despite the fact that we approve of the general trend.  Why should that be so?  If the Minister merely wants to have a situation in which the ordinary kind of debate will take place&mdash;the test being that in one case you need a motion to have a debate and, in the other, it must be passed by the House&mdash;this is too high a price.  It will be safer, wiser and better if the Minister, in fact, amends this and puts it back into the ordinary form in which he would put regulations which are to be annulled.  There are two points about this.  As I understand the law with regard to the Executive, the Executive has only such power <Col N="1127" /> as we in the Legislature give it and the Minister has only such power as we in the Legislature give him.  It may be that he will have power to re-submit draft regulations.  I do not know.  It is not expressed here.  I should like the Minister to consider this matter between now and the Report Stage.  I know that in the case of particular sections of the 1953 Health Act the Minister at the time was advised that he had no powers to revoke the orders he made and the Minister had to introduce a new Act for the purpose of getting such powers.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;draft&rdquo; used in this legislation must have meant that it was to be given a particular interpretation and draft regulations must be different from other regulations.  The word &ldquo;draft&rdquo; must be given a meaning.  What if <Col N="1128" /> someone, having a grievance against a health board, proceeds to argue that the powers being exercised are defective because they are exercised pursuant to draft regulations which were not treated as draft regulations?  The courts are not allowed to listen to or to read what we say, which is very bad for them, and, in endeavouring to construe legislation, the fact that we had a debate as to what draft regulations are would not be looked at by the judges. It would be better business not to depart from well-established precedent. Such departures very often have unforeseen consequences.  If this amendment is not accepted then there should be some provision making it quite clear that our position is that we simply have the right to annul the regulations and nothing more.</P>

      <P>This is the section that establishes the various area or regional health boards.  As I mentioned on Second Reading, every Member has been circularised with tentative proposals of administration.  I shall not repeat what I said then.  That is not my intention now.  The Minister has at various times indicated that he would like to see these boards established some time in the autumn of 1970 and that they would become operative, I expect he means, in the financial year 1971-72.  I wonder what business or function these boards will be carrying out within that six months?  Will they have <Col N="1129" /> anything assigned to them?  Will they in any way interfere with the running of the current boards?  Will there be any liaison between the current boards and these regional health boards?</P>
      <P>There are two aspects of this, one that will be dealt with in detail later but I shall advert to it now, that is the aspect of continuity of boards.  I do not intend to enlarge on this, but the continuity of staffs of the boards makes for more smooth running of the board.</P>

They will be getting a compendium of information from my Department on the general characteristics of the regional areas over which they will have jurisdiction. They will be given information and statistics so that they will be able to see the whole spectrum of their activities. I imagine they will also be considering the kind of committees they might want to appoint, which have to have my consent.  There is a mass of planning work in which they will be engaged before they finally come into operation.  I thought it was a very good idea to appoint them in advance.</P>

That will be quite a complex business but I am certain that the accountants with the present health authorities and the existing county managers or the heads of the Cork, Waterford and Limerick Health Authorities will be able to do that.  That will be largely a matter of accountancy and establishing what the total cost will be for the whole area and then looking at any extensions of service and so on.  It could be very difficult but with the help of a competent local civil service I do not think the transfer will be too difficult in the first year provided I can get these boards established in time so that we will have an opportunity of studying all this.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I mentioned that it would be appropriate if a health board which happened to have a medical school in its area had some member from the medical school as a member of the board.  I had in mind putting down an amendment to this effect before the Committee Stage.  But I <Col N="1131" /> was very glad the Minister referred to this in his reply to the debate and gave an assurance that he would bear this in mind when making nominations to the health board.

      <P>&ldquo;( ) A health board may erect, acquire, purchase, convert or reconstruct, lease or otherwise private dwellings, including houses, flats, maisonettes and hostels (and such dwelling may be temporary or permanent) for persons employed or to be employed by the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We shall be able to dispose of this amendment fairly quickly if the Minister can answer some queries on it. The real reason why we put it down is that as far as I could ascertain in reading the Bill there does not appear to be power for the new health board to do any of the things that are listed in the amendment.  I could not find any power for them to purchase new buildings that they might need, for instance, to house their nursing staffs, even to provide extra accommodation which will certainly be needed for the new administrative areas.  If the Minister can assure me these powers are there I shall gladly withdraw the amendment but, if not, we would have to discuss it.</P>

      <P>I do not blame the Senator for asking this question.  There is a great deal of legislation which has not been repealed, the 1947 Health Act and the 1953 Health Act.  Section 105 of the 1947 Act could be adapted to apply to this Bill: a health board &ldquo;may, with the approval of the Minister, and shall, if the Minister so directs, provide and maintain residences for the use of officers appointed or servants employed by them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following subsections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The Minister may by order, on the application of a health board, amend the Rules set out in the Second Schedule applying in relation to the board.</P>
      <P>( ) A draft of an order which it is proposed to make under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for the purposes of considering and if thought fit passing with or without amendment and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft or the draft as amended has been passed by each House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put this amendment down so that the Minister and his advisers could consider the matter.  In my own personal experience it is extremely undesirable to have any body constituted without a carefully designed system of amending its constitution.  I think these rules are deficient.  Perhaps I am going to be educated when the Minister comes to deal with the Schedule by being made aware of existing provisions or statutes that will correct deficiencies that, on our first reading of these rules, seem to be there.  The one that strikes me most is that there does not seem to be any power of borrowing.  Perhaps this is in the Health Act of 1947.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that, but while that section can now be cited to me, it may be I would be drawing attention to a deficiency in the rules which did in fact require repair.  We are pioneering a very important development.  We do not know the difficulties that may lie ahead.  If we read our legislation of the past we will find many sections which have never been used.  We do find that amending legislation is necessary in relation to bodies such as those to be established under this Bill, when enacted. It may be found that various <Col N="1133" /> matters will require clarification.  For example, what is a &ldquo;casual vacancy&rdquo;? These words have gone through law courts for over 100 years.  Under the Companies Acts, there is a different interpretation of &ldquo;casual vacancy&rdquo;. What is a &ldquo;casual vacancy&rdquo; under these rules?  It might be found desirable to define &ldquo;casual vacancy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am now arguing that the Minister should have power to make and vary the rules set forth in the Schedule so that if he finds he has difficulties he does not have to come back to the Oireachtas for a new Act but can make an order altering the rules; in like case, any other order he makes under any other section.  It is not usual to find me pressing powers upon Ministers but this is a power I want to press on the Minister for Health.  I have never known a body of any kind which did not find itself in difficulty if it did not have power to amend its constitution. We are creating new bodies here.  It means that the constitution cannot be altered without coming back for a new Act of Parliament.  To me, this seems expensive and unwise.</P>

      <P>I will give a qualified assent to the proposed amendment. Subsection (2) of this section 5 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by order made at the request of a health board, substitute in relation to that board a different rule for any of the following rules set out in the Second Schedule, namely, rules 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, any amendment is being done by order and orders, I take it, under the Bill are not to be laid before the Houses even under the rule.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator FitzGerald that it seems a very odd provision, in view of what the Minister said earlier on section 2 about the importance of being free to deal with minor points without legislation, that certain rules should now be laid down by Act and can be ended only by Act.  The sensible approach would be that any of these rules might be amended by order but I should like the draft of the order to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, subject to the ordinary 30-day rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> I would not go as far as Senator FitzGerald's amendment seeks to go by widening the scope of the debate on orders.</P>

      <P>This is a complex matter.  The concept of &ldquo;casual vacancy&rdquo; has been accepted as it has occurred in a great many other Acts of one kind or another.  I do not think there is any difficulty about interpreting it.  Following the practice over a period. I do not think we need to define &ldquo;casual vacancy&rdquo; any further in relation to a great deal of our legislation.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with the powers to borrow.  Senator FitzGerald raised a number of matters in relation to which he thinks the Second Schedule should be altered; perhaps we had better wait until we reach it.  As I said in the Dáil, a great many of the rules in the Second Schedule should consistently be applied to all the health boards.  Neither I nor the health boards should be allowed by the Oireachtas to vary the general character of the health boards.  In response to a request by Deputy Richie Ryan, I introduced an amendment and, as the Seanad will see, section 5 (2) provides arrangements whereby, at the request of a health board, different rules can be provided that are specified in number.</P>
      <P>I do not think there should be any variation in relation to the method of electing the local authority representatives. It might give one political <i>bloc</i> in one regional health board a greater preference or a greater privilege than they could obtain in another health board; I do not say it would be likely to happen.  Nevertheless, there should be consistency and that would be the general basis for the election of professional members; it should be reasonably uniform for the entire country.  This means that a general framework of rules should be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we turn to the Second Schedule, variations can be made, with my consent, in relation to a number of rules. There can be variations in relation to the quorum.  The boards can make arrangements for the election of chairman and vice-chairman&mdash;No. 17. There are a number of them; the House can read them.  There are arrangements in relation to proceedings <Col N="1135" /> at meetings.  There are four rules in that respect where there can be some variation by the board, subject to my consent.  With regard to all the other rules, I consider that there should be consistency of practice.  I understand why this amendment was moved but I do not think I can accept it as I wish to have consistency.</P>

      <P>I shall be withdrawing this amendment with a view to possibly re-introducing it on Report Stage but I hope the Minister will give it further consideration, at least the first part.  He has already stated his objection to the second proposed subsection.  On the point of consistency, assuming for a moment it is desirable that the rules regulating the regional boards should be exactly the same&mdash;a matter which I am not convinced is necessarily right for the good administration of the health service generally&mdash;if the power is given to the Minister he can see that there is no inconsistency in the proposed rules. This may be his reason for rejecting the proposal because it would give rise to an inconsistency of which he does not approve but to be given the power to amend cannot be wrong from his point of view.  It cannot give rise to inconsistency unless he inconsistently approves of different alterations in the different health boards.</P>
      <P>I am withdrawing the amendment in the hope that the Minister will give it careful consideration.  I have come across cases where bodies have come to an absolute <i>impasse</i> and a great loss suffered because there was no power to amend the rules.  The Minister is putting himself and his Department in the position of having to introduce a new Health Bill, to get it passed in the Dáil and in the Seanad, if he does not take the powers proposed to him by this amendment which I am now withdrawing.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point of explanation.  In the constitution of the health boards there will be certain <Col N="1136" /> people appointed by election and so far as I can see they are not subject to regulations that permit the Minister to dismiss persons from the board. However, the people being appointed by the Minister for the first session of a health board, until 1972, will be the forerunners of the people to be elected and who will actually be nominated by the Minister following the democratic process of election by the medical profession and ancillary services in the area.  They will be subject to Rule 13 whereby the Minister could rule from the board.  While the medical profession is most conscious of responsibility for getting health boards off the ground and of good relations between the different branches, the local authorities, the medical service, and the Department of Health, there would be greater confidence in the medical profession if people who were appointed from their ranks were independent of ministerial favours and this same point will apply later so far as regional hospital boards are concerned.  I should like if people coming from the ancillary services in the medical profession were excused from Rule 13 of the Second Schedule.</P>

      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald withdrew his amendment so rapidly that I wish to raise a point on the section in regard to rules.  I am rather baffled to find the Minister so anxious to tie his hands.  In regard to the sacrosanct nature of the rules, I draw his attention to the second part of Rule 2 in which it is stated:</P>
      <P>...one member falls to be appointed to a health board, he shall be appointed at the appropriate meeting by a majority of the votes of the councillors present at the appointment,</P>
      <P>whereas Rule 28 states:</P>
      <P>All acts of the board and all questions coming or arising before the board may be done and decided by the majority of such members of the board as are present and vote at a meeting of the board duly held according to law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a vast difference here and I think the first rule is not as clear as Rule 28.  What is meant by a majority of votes of councillors present?  This is <Col N="1137" /> one of the expression that can frequently give rise to trouble and it is a pity this has occurred when so much care has been taken in Rule 28 to give a precise definition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Reading <Col N="1138" /> I spoke at some length about the functions of these local committees and the Minister might have noticed that in the Fine Gael amendments, where we were concerned about the method of appointing people from Dublin Corporation to the health boards and trying to provide that members of the dissolved corporation would be entitled to be appointed, we did not enter the same amendment as the Labour Party in relation to section 7.  The reason was that we did not think it very important because, as the Bill stands, we could not see what useful function these local committees were going to serve.  I asked the Minister on Second Reading to consider giving these committees some real work to do and I pointed out that the 1960 Act provided that the constituent local authorities in the Dublin health area could appoint committees, which they did. In a short time these committees ceased to function for the simple reason the members realised they were wasting their time and had nothing to do.</P>
      <P>I do not see how in section 7 any real authority is given to any of the members, or potential members, of these proposed committees and I should like to hear the Minister's views on this.  I think the section was slightly amended in the Dáil in relation to sub-section (5) (a) to oblige a health board to consider any advice tendered to it by a local committee but if this is the best the Minister can do as regards giving teeth to a local committee it is not very much.  The committee cannot make any real decisions; all it can do is make recommendations and it was a bit disappointing to see the Minister only feeling in a position to go as far as to decide that the health board would have to consider whatever advice was given to it by a local committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are one or two health advisory committees that have operated very well.  It seems to me that this is a matter of what intensity of feeling there is in a county council that there should be an advisory committee and how much they really want to survey the work of the regional health board in a particular county council or borough area.  It seems to me that this is a matter <Col N="1139" /> of willingness to do the job.  The health committees themselves could receive deputations from various bodies in a county in relation to any views they have about the operation of the health services so far as they are concerned. They can ask of the health board that an executive officer attend their meetings.  They can require him to give such reports as they desire on the operation of the services.  There is nothing to stop them asking the health board to prove that in respect of any one decision made the very best possible service is being given in the area in respect of that service.  There is nothing to prevent them, through their own officer, collecting a series of complaints during the year in regard to defects of service and referring them to the health board.  This is really a matter of communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the House would accept that in the last ten years facilities for communication or belief in local groups communicating has grown enormously.  Some of it is effective, some of it is foolish, some of it is most unwisely conducted but there is a great deal of growing communication partly through the growth of the communication media, partly through better education and partly through the fact that government has become so complex and so difficult that a great many intelligent people in every local area see that they need to express their view and somehow their point of view must reach the nearest large unit of administration and then must move upwards.  They certainly do not fail to make their views known both to the smaller unit such as the regional health board by parliamentary question in the Dáil to the Minister for Health.  This is really a matter of what might be described as local &ldquo;zizz&rdquo;.  If there is local &ldquo;zizz&rdquo; these health committees can be extremely effective.  If nobody is interested they are undoubtedly useless. I differ from Senator Boland in believing that if you can just get even four or five people on a county committee who are interested in having a practicable, sensible report on the health services in the county or the corporation area good work will be <Col N="1140" /> done and they will be useful to the regional health board.  I cannot say more about it than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was rather a personal opinion of mine but the House will be dealing with that under section 6 and, perhaps, some other section.</P>
      <P>Some of the functions heretofore administered by the county council and the sanitary authority are being transferred to the new health board and the remaining functions of the sanitary authority are being left with the county council to administer.  These new local committees will in the main consist of members of the county council with officials of the council and some medical people.  One of the things that struck me was that many difficulties will arise because of this splitting of the functions of the sanitary authority and the feeling in many parts of the country that the health board should administer all the sanitary functions and the feeling in other parts of the country that the sanitary functions should not have been interfered with at all.  I am more inclined to agree with the former.  I rather thought that the Minister might usefully have looked at the suggestion that the local committees would have acted as the sanitary authority and in this way have had some linking-in of the functions of the sanitary authority with the functions of the health board.  It would, to some extent, clarify the position of health inspectors who used to be called sanitary inspectors and will, when this Bill becomes law, once again be sanitary inspectors but without any reference to the area health board.</P>
      <P>Many people are apprehensive that there will be a lot of confusion in regard to this and, indeed, the business of being a sanitary authority in this quickly changing and developing era is one that will be of greater importance especially in the more urbanised areas.  A committee such as this which, as I suggested the week before last and earlier tonight, will not have very much to do, might be an ideal one to be given the very complex and onerous task of being a modern sanitary authority in a modern age.</P>

I should like to query the Minister if I may on one point.  I understand that membership will be specified in regulations and I hope that the Minister can give us some idea of what the spread will be.  It is mentioned that local authorities will have more than half the representation. Will the remainder be a similar type of spread as occurs in the area health board?</P>

      <P>I should like to join Senator Alton in welcoming the establishment of these local committees. When speaking on Second Stage, I indicated a basic problem we face in our society at the moment.  While we have larger and larger administration areas, there is the problem of maintaining some form of local contact point, some form of local forum, where there can be discussions of problems which affect every citizen from day to day.  I feel these local committees can serve this function.  I am disappointed that someone like Senator Boland regards this function as not an important one or as something that does not mean very much. In fact, it seems to me extremely important that this opportunity should be there for local discussion.  I feel it <Col N="1142" /> is no small matter for a local committee to be able to advise a health board about the working of the health services in their area.  I might go so far as to suggest that in the course of the discussion on other sections of this Bill today I was somewhat disappointed by the approach of many Members who are also members of local authorities.  It seems to me that in his approach to this section Senator Boland is showing some of these traits which disappoint me.  I am not a member of a health authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and have no vested interest in the matter but I feel that one of the problems about people who become members of any body is that their attitudes tend to become focussed on the procedures of that body; their thinking tends to become fossilised and institutionalised.  Particularly if they are politicians, they tend to think that the only way in which a job is done is when somebody has to stand up and have his vote counted.  Constantly, too, they are thinking in terms of people either complaining to them about decisions which have been made or of people who are likely to land up on their doorsteps looking for benefits of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that it is this type of attitude which leads people to be sceptical and cynical about these local committees, because with a local committee which provides purely an advisory function there is no reason why it should act in this stodgy way of thinking merely in terms of head counting and so on.  It can sit down and do a proper constructive job discussing the problems of the area and passing on its advice.  I think that it is in this new spirit, this post-Devlin spirit, that we must be thinking about legislation as it comes before us.</P>

      <P>I hope that I have made all the suggestions I can to indicate that I favour discussion of this report at a later stage.  I am happy to see that <Col N="1143" /> the Senator and other Senators have had an opportunity to study the Devlin Report and see the type of thinking that is there and think over the report and do, as I hope many of them will do, in order to apply it to the pieces of legislation that may come before us meantime.  This type of legislation needs a complete change of attitude, and it is important that in the health boards and on these committees the people who are elected by the local authorities should cease thinking in narrow local terms and think more about the general problems of the people they serve and try to get away from this idea of worrying about complaints about the rates or local grievances and local politics.</P>
      <P>It is about time that people on committees when matters come up for discussion thought more in terms of asking &ldquo;Can we deal with this efficiently and effectively?  Is it a realistic proposition comparing the benefits and the costs?&rdquo; and then to be prepared to say equally to people &ldquo;Look, we have achieved this for you and it will cost so much.&rdquo;  That is the fact of the situation, rather than going to person A. and saying &ldquo;We have got you this benefit&rdquo; and then going to person B. and saying &ldquo;It is terrible that this has cost us so much&rdquo;.  I think that people will have to be single-minded in their approach to the committees and the boards of this Bill and bring a constructive approach to the debate, so I very much welcome these bodies and I hope that this section will be adopted.</P>

A lot of people feel that there should be more teeth in local bodies like these, but if you give more teeth to local bodies you will find them either overloading or in conflict with the parent body.  To act in an advisory capacity on the part played by the health board is, I think, as far as they should go, and if the Minister goes further then they would be usurping certain functions of the health board and would come in conflict with it.  To that extent this section as it stands at the moment is the right way.</P>

      <P>It is very obvious to the House that Senator Belton and I are in disagreement about this.  We have discussed this section privately on several occasions.  It is my feeling that the local committees might be given some functions which the health board will administer.  They might instead be given, as I suggested, some of the functions of the sanitary authority.  On this I did not get the Minister's reaction at all.  I did not intend my comments about membership of the local committees to be taken up and adopted by Senator Keery in the way he did in an attempt to justify his suggestion last week on the Second Stage that politicians should not have control of the health boards, and I do not intend that my remarks should be used by Senator Keery in that way.

      <P>I was at some pains last week to point out the value and the merit of the contributions of the local authority representatives acting as the health authority over the years and the very great debt we owed to them for the manner in which our health service has evolved.  I read Senator Keery's speech several times, and at column 938 he said &ldquo;I still wonder whether it is entirely desirable that the major voice on these bodies should be that of the representatives of the local authorities&rdquo;, which is a little cry from today's speech where he represents himself as being an advocate of the local authority members, a little bit away from his suggestion last week when his own colleague, Senator McGlinchey, had to come out and defend members of local authorities who had worked so hard over the years to provide proper health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame Senator Keery.  I welcome the fact that he has now been educated and sees the valuable contribution which members of local authorities have given in relation to developing our health services.  All that I am asking is that they should be given some function, some purpose, in future. <Col N="1145" /> I refer to the members who will not be members of the new health boards, but I hope that their contribution and their merit will be recognised and suitable opportunity be given to them by giving them something further to do.  I said last week, and I repeat it, that these men have something to offer.  I am quite convinced that, after the Minister went around the country and met them, he knows that they have something to offer, he knows that they&mdash;from all parties&mdash;are only too anxious to contribute to the development of our health services and the evolution of a proper system of local government. They are men who will work tirelessly and endlessly for no reward, like any Member of this House, in an effort to provide better services for our people.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Minister to investigate between now and the Report Stage who will have responsibility for the sanitary functions, which obviously are going to become much more important and to create a great deal of difficulties between the health boards and the local authorities.  For instance, it will be generally recognised that pollution is something which is injurious to health&mdash;the pollution of the atmosphere and of our rivers.  The control of pollution, the little legislation we have, is a matter for the sanitary authority and should remain a matter for the sanitary authority.  If this local committee were dealing with it, it could seek and get advice from the health boards and the district medical officers and it would be fulfilling useful health and sanitary functions.  This is what I was talking about and that is why I have risen again to make my position quite clear.  I do not intend to allow myself to be used as a whipping boy to get Senator Keery off the Seanad electoral hook.</P>

      <P>I know you will have no hesitation in interrupting me if I stray from this section.  The point I welcome is that membership of a committee appointed under the section may include persons who are not members of the board.  This is very important.  It should be possible to bring people into discussions of committee considerations who are not necessarily local authority members or members of the board, so that expertise can be introduced.  I should like to make the point that we do not in any way underestimate, as Senator Boland suggests, the work and the contribution of local authority members.  I know they have worked themselves to the bone during the years, but my question is whether they have worked themselves to the bone doing the right sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty is that the expertise of local authority members tends to be solely in terms of explaining away rate increases or finding the answers to local problems.  If we take the example of a health board or a local committee, they may be discussing the control of <Col N="1147" /> pollution.  The tragedy is that very few local authority representatives had the time or the facilities to study matters like the control of pollution, which is the sort of thing they should be doing in an improved society.</P>

      <P>The point is that the majority of board members will be local authority members and I am welcoming the proposal that when committees are set up under this section they may include persons who are not members of the board.  This widens the scope of the matter and allows the opportunity to bring in expertise from outside.  I was explaining why I welcome this, without, in any way belittling the role of local authority members. If Senators consider my remarks further they will realise that I am concerned with the general role of local authorities and the working of local government which I regard as a serious problem in our society as it is developing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 7 to add to the section the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) (a) A Health Board may make an allowance to the Chairman of the Board and to the Chairman of a Committee established under sections 7 or 8,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) A Health Board may make payments to a member of a Health <Col N="1148" /> Board or to a member of a Committee established under sections 7 or 8 for attendance at a meeting in lieu of compensation for lost time,</P>
    <P>(c) a payment under this sub-section shall not be a charge on the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to enable health boards to make allowances to their chairmen to enable them to recoup expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.  What we have in mind principally are matters such as entertainment.  We have had experience of chairmen of local authorities being considerably out of pocket in this respect.  There is no provision by which they can be recouped and we want such provision made in this Act.  That is principally the purpose of paragraph (a) of the amendment.</P>
    <P>In relation to paragraph (b), we have been concerned for some time that intending members of local authorities have been inhibited from becoming members because of lack of income. People who would have very good service to give to the people, eminently suitable people, have been unable to accept public service and we are principally concerned about wage earners. The Bill does not provide in any way compensation and wage earners will thus continue to be inhibited.  Therefore we are keeping some of the best people out of public service.  We hope that the Minister will agree and that he will introduce an amendment accordingly on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is rather difficult for me because it involves a departure from the principle set up in relation to county councils and to the present health authorities.  It is true that certain people&mdash;the Lord Mayor of Dublin and the mayors of other cities &mdash;are given allowances for the purposes of entertaining, but that is not really what is proposed in the amendment. Quite a number of corporate bodies have been set up by the Minister for Health in relation to which these allowances are not made.  I can see the point made by the Senator and perhaps there is a case for making some allowances for those members who would include the chairmen and vice-chairmen who have a great deal <Col N="1149" /> more to do than the rest of the board, such as the preparation of agendas and so on.  All I can say is that I will look at it before the Report Stage.  As the Senator knows, there has been some comment in regard to it in the newspapers. I suppose there will be changes of this kind but I really cannot set a precedent which would apply to a great many other corporate bodies: I cannot be the one to set the pace&mdash; there must be some general understanding in regard to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with part of this amendment.  Paragraph (a) suggests that a health board may make an allowance to the chairman of the board and to the chairmen of committees established under sections 7 and 8.  I could agree with that part of it, but not the whole.  Future chairmen of these boards must spend quite a lot of their time not alone attending meetings but in consultation with senior officers.  They must waste a lot of their own time.  There are certain occasions when a chairman must entertain.  Chairmen of health authorities had not an allowance, yet they had to entertain visitors and buy wreaths.  The chairmen of health boards should get some emolument.  I go that far, but if you get down too far in the amendment I am not sure I agree with it.  I must emphasise that I am making only a general comment here.  I will not pursue any argument on this, but from experience I know that the chairman of a board such as the proposed health boards, no matter who he is&mdash;be he the poorest councillor or the poorest man entitled to be chairman&mdash;should be capable of doing what is expected of chairmen of such boards, such as entertainment or the buying of wreaths.</P>

      <P>We would, of course, be prepared to accept the Minister's undertaking to have a look at this before the Report Stage.  Having said that, I should like to make a few further points in support of the principle involved in the amendment.  I wish to point out that the area now proposed to be administered by the new health boards is much larger than that covered by the institutions to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> The point must also be made that it is envisaged in this Bill, and indeed in all our hopes for the future working of the health services, that it is inevitable that there will be quite a lot of visiting&mdash;to use no greater term&mdash;involved and which inevitably will affect the chairmen who will be expected to receive from abroad people who will be visiting their areas to advise on the proper working of hospital services or perhaps to learn from us.  We are only suggesting that these particular allowances should be given to eight people and these are people who will be of considerable stature and importance in the community.  The point I made in regard to the larger geographical areas gives further weight to our suggestion that these allowances should be provided and not merely subsistence allowances and that consideration should be given to members who might be obliged to lose time.</P>
    <P>Obviously the proper functioning of the health boards will involve much travelling by the members of the health boards and the same principle as applies to parliamentary allowances should be applied in this respect.  I am sure it would not be the Minister's wish that any citizen who wished to render service to the community through the health boards should be prevented from doing so because of financial considerations, because if he became a member of a health board it would involve travelling long distances from home and therefore loss of work and pay.  We accept the Minister's undertaking that he will look at this before Report Stage.</P>

I support the amendment both in regard to clause (a) and clause (b).  If we do not agree with these clauses it could be that the area of selection of members will be too restricted.  I am glad that the Minister has agreed to look into the matter.</P>

I do not see why people who are appointed to look into the merits or demerits of the suspension or removal of an official should be paid fees when the members of a health board are not.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1) to add at the end&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided that the Minister may not under this paragraph remove the members of the Board unless the Minister has first exhausted the power of appointment to the Board vested in him under the specification of membership by regulations under section 4 subsection (1).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am moving this amendment without any pressure, if I may put it that way. I just was not quite clear about the thinking behind subsection (1) (d).  It seems to me that if you had a political situation in which, say, a successor Government did not like the scheme which it is proposed to operate, and also happened to have control of the local authorities, they might by the exercise of the unrestricted power of subsection (1) be able to abolish the health boards simply by not appointing the number they were entitled to appoint.  It seems to me therefore that the Minister should be obliged to appoint the number that under the specifications he will be entitled to appoint, before he is entitled to remove members of the health board because the numbers have fallen below the quorum necessary.</P>

      <P>As the House knows the quorum is one-quarter of the members or five, whichever is the greater.  In practice the quorum will be from seven to nine, depending on the size of the board.  Subsection (1) is included to cover the case of mass resignations from the board leaving the membership less than one-quarter of the total.  In such circumstances it is desirable for the Minister of the day to initiate the procedure for removal under section 11 rather than using the limited power of appointing under section 4, to top up the small number to something over the quorum.  I should at most have two or three members on the board.  That should be in further explanation to Senator FitzGerald. This is an emergency situation.  The Minister can only remove the members of the health board if they refuse to do certain things.  In a case of a mass resignation I would not believe in using the topping-up procedure.</P>

      <P>I should like to urge the Minister to reconsider his attitude to this amendment.  I would draw his attention to subsection (3).  The Minister says that this is to be used only in an emergency situation but subsection (3) enables him to wait two years before actually re-appointing new members and therefore it is not really an urgent emergency he has in mind.  I fail to see why, if there are some members of the board willing and capable of acting, their number cannot be added to rather than abolishing the board and placing oneself under the obligation of appointing a new board within two years.  That is not my idea of an emergency piece of activity.</P>

If the board was reconstituted, not on that occasion but at a time of the year which did not relate to a five year period then, quite obviously, the Minister would have to make arrangements for appointing a meeting to be held other than the one which is specified in the Bill in the normal way. That is all.  It is purely a matter of mechanics.  It does not affect the democratic position; it does not affect the actual structure of the board.  I have given a clear declaration on that and I gave it in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>One of our main reasons for entering the second paragraph of this amendment was that under existing legislation regarding the dissolution of local authorities the Minister for Local Government was obliged to lay a copy of the order which he made dissolving those local authorities before each House and it did seem to us to be surprising that in a section dealing with the removal of the members of a health authority from office the Minister would be entitled to remove the members of that board without laying a copy of the order of removal before each House of the Oireachtas.  We felt that the Minister would have derived his power from this section because of the fact that each House would have passed this section and that it was only right that at least a copy of the order and preferably a draft of the order would be <Col N="1157" /> laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the reason for the second paragraph of amendment No. 21.</P>
      <P>I am still a little bit apprehensive. Our intentions in the first paragraph were to ensure that if a board was dissolved and was being reconstituted it would be reconstituted by virtue of each of the constituent local authorities electing the number of members which they were entitled to and the Minister appointing a certain number of other members following their election by their representative organisations and then appointing his two or three personal representatives.</P>
      <P>It does not seem to me that the provisions of subsection (3) of section 11 as it now stands make this quite clear.  The wording is that the Minister shall by order provide for new appointments of members to that board.  It seems to me that the Minister could very well make an order appointing members directly to that board and it does not seem as if the writing in of a paragraph to see that the order made under subsection (3) of this section shall be in conformity with (a) and (b) is in any way harmful to the Bill because, in effect, what that would be saying would ensure that the local authorities would be allowed to re-appoint.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In subsection (9), line 44, after &ldquo;board&rdquo; to add:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and within two months of the vacancy falling due the Minister shall instruct the Local Appointments Commissioners to select under section 14 a person for appointment as chief executive officer of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see that the Minister would <Col N="1159" /> have any objection to this amendment. This has nothing to do with the filling of a temporary vacancy.  It is proposed in order to ensure that the machinery for filling the appointment is set on foot within two months and that machinery is that the Minister shall instruct the Local Appointments Commissioners to select under section 14 a person for appointment as chief executive officer of the board.  The purpose of putting in this period of two months is that there tends to be too much delay between the vacancy occurring and the machinery being set on foot for the new appointment.  The amendment is self-explanatory and I do not intend to delay the House on it. I should just like to hear the Minister on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is one of those amendments that have some validity.  It may be undesirable to fix a rigid limit for initiating the procedure for appointment of a chief executive officer.  We might be considering altering the boundaries of health boards.  We might be reviewing the qualifications for the office at the time.  I think I have had enough experience of local appointments to know that it is pretty dangerous to try to confine the time in any way because so many matters can arise such as, as I have said, the qualifications for the office being reviewed at the time the vacancy fell due or that we might be reviewing the organisation of the area.  All I can say is that I think it is true and in line with modern thought that Ministers who are responsible for organisations where appointments are made by the Local Appointments Commissioners more and more will have to do their utmost to see that the appointments are made as promptly as possible.  Although I can see that, I would not like to be tied by the amendment suggested.</P>

      <P>I have received and accepted notice from Senator <Col N="1160" /> O'Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House tonight, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The assurance given by the Minister for Transport and Power as reported at column 723 of the Seanad Debates of the 18th December, 1969 and the attitude of the Government with regard thereto as intimated to the Tribunal established by motion of Seanad Éireann on 18th December, 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I, first of all, make it clear that I am not raising this matter in a party political sense but I am raising it because I believe it is a matter of fundamental importance to Parliament both as regards the rights of Parliament as a body, as distinguished from the rights of the Government or the Executive, and as regards the position of individual Members of Parliament in their consideration, before they come to a decision, of motions such as that which is relevant here.</P>
      <P>I think it will be clear to the House that my remarks this evening must be very circumspect.  I cannot and do not wish either to discuss the tribunal or the matters which are <i>sub judice</i> before the tribunal, but I think it is both relevant and of paramount importance to say with some emphasis that the establishment of this particular tribunal was a matter for Parliament and was a matter dealt with by Parliament rather than a matter dealt with by the Government.  There are two things involved that I wish to discuss. First of all, what I regard as the assurance given by the Minister for Transport and Power when the establishment of this tribunal was under discussion and, secondly, the attitude of the Government with regard to that assurance as intimated to the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the assurance given by the Minister, this appears at column 723 of the Seanad Debates of 18th December last.  I should like at this point again to make it clear that I am not concerned to argue the toss with the Minister, or with whoever is dealing with this discussion in the House here this evening, as to what was intended <Col N="1161" /> by the Minister's remarks which I regard as an assurance to the House and which I think some Senators would put possibly even stronger than that and would regard as an undertaking to the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any ambiguity whatever with regard to the words used by the Minister.  There may be ambiguity with regard to the target to which those words were directed.  If the Minister or his spokesman here this evening says they were directed at one target rather than another I shall, of course, accept that.  However, what concerns me and what should concern the House is as to whether or not any other construction can reasonably be put on the Minister's words which could be reasonably supposed to influence Senators in their consideration of the question which was before them on 18th December and in coming to a decision with regard to the establishment of this tribunal and its terms of reference.  At column 723 of the Seanad Debates of that date Senator Brugha referred to matters that had been raised previously by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington had raised in a very definite way the possibility of people incurring penalties before the tribunal if they did not disclose sources of information.  I do not want to put it any more detailed than that.  Senator Brugha then said at this column:</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Sheehy Skeffington's reference I am glad that it has been made clear in the Dáil that the inquiry may be held in public or private as may seem necessary or desirable.  I welcome this because it will enable any of those who may have to give evidence to do so in private.</P>
    <P>There was no intervention by the Minister on that occasion.  Senator Brugha was talking with the knowledge that this matter had been made clear in the Dáil.  It had also, incidentally, been made clear by the Minister in his introductory remarks that the tribunal could take evidence in private and apparently there was no assurance called for by the Minister at that point and none was given.  Senator Brugha then went on to what I regard as a <Col N="1162" /> separate although related topic and he said:</P>
    <P>It is well known that journalists from time to time must protect their sources of information and indeed that some journalists have elected to go to prison rather than disclose information given to them in confidence.</P>
    <P>Here was a question being raised of journalists protecting their sources of information, being prepared even to go to prison rather than disclose sources of information given them in confidence.  Senator Brugha continued:</P>
    <P>This is something I support and I presume that when this matter comes before the tribunal this principle will be upheld.</P>
    <P>The Minister then intervened:</P>
    <P>It will be upheld.</P>
    <P>His words, as I say, are quite definite and unequivocal.  I can see that it could be argued that those words of the Minister's refer to the taking of evidence in private and, as I said, if that is argued I accept that that was the intention of the Minister.  The Minister, after all, is the only person who can say what he intended at that time.  But it can hardly be in doubt that a definite assurance was given to the House by the Minister and I think what is relevant then is to consider what are the constructions that can be placed on that.  I have referred to one, that it may relate to the question of the tribunal taking evidence in private.  I suggest very strongly that in the minds of Senators it could also relate to the question of non-disclosure of sources of information which was the next topic dealt with by Senator Brugha, and it was immediately following this that the Minister's words were used.</P>
    <P>It would be facetious to think that the assurance was given as to the right of journalists to go to gaol, although that might appear in a strict reading of this.  It seems to me that from the timing of the assurance, following as it does the reference to the sources of information, Senators were legitimately entitled to regard that assurance as being related to that topic.  As I say, <Col N="1163" /> there is no doubt in regard to the words used by the Minister.  Consequently, as the Minister was definite in the words used it seems to me that whatever matter he was referring to was then settled beyond doubt.  He was quite categoric in his statement.  There was no need to refer to it again and I think it would be fair to ask did Senators regard it as necessary to refer to the matter again.</P>
    <P>I may be misconstruing this but it seems to me that Senator Brugha in his speech did not again refer to the topic of non-disclosure of sources of information. He did, however, in the very next column, again come back to the question that he referred to as being raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington in relation to contempt of court.  At column 724 of the Official Report he is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>I hope that the question rightly raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington in relation to contempt of court cannot arise and that any journalist will be entitled to claim the privilege of giving evidence in private.</P>
    <P>So that that particular matter, apparently, was not settled.  I am assuming, in any event, that it was not settled in the mind of Senator Brugha by the Minister's assurance but he did not come back to the other topic of non-disclosure of sources of information. I think that Senator Brugha or anyone else is entitled to regard, on what was said here, that matter as having being settled and established by means of the assurance given by the Minister.  My time is limited and what I can say is also restricted.</P>
    <P>The second point I wanted to discuss is the attitude of the Government.  In this, I am relying on newspaper reports. I make no comment on the fact that the attitude of the Executive with regard to what the Minister said was sought by the tribunal.  It does seem to me that, once the query was raised, while the Executive may have felt that, as a matter of urgency, it should be answered, it should not have been answered without giving a clear indication that the matter was one for Parliament and not one for the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> According to the <i>Irish Times</i> of 24th instant, counsel for the Attorney General said:</P>
    <P>....that he had now obtained the instructions as to the attitude of the Executive.  The Tribunal is established in pursuance of resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If it had been intended that the ordinary rules of evidence were not to apply in full, provision to that effect would have been made in the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Chairman: The Executive did not accept that an undertaking was given by the Minister for Transport and Power in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>To that, the counsel replied:</P>
    <P>That would appear to be so.</P>
    <P>I want to say that the only intention relevant with regard to this motion that was passed on 18th December, 1969, in this House was the intention of Parliament. That is the only relevant intention. To my mind, the Government have no right to interpret the intention of Parliament without consultation with Parliament.  We all know that this House was not consulted with regard to its intentions before that reply was indicated to the Tribunal.  It is a matter of common public knowledge that the other House of the Oireachtas has not been in session and consequently that no consultation took place with the Dáil to ascertain their intentions with regard to this matter.  I would feel that this matter is of such fundamental importance that a very early opportunity should be afforded to Parliament, to both Houses of the Oireachtas, to make its intentions known, to make known what it intended in relation to this particular matter.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is to my mind only the intention of Parliament and not the intention of the Executive that we are concerned with.  I have agreed to allow five minutes of my time to Senator Miss Mary Bourke.  I should like to give way to her at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator O'Higgins for the time he has allowed me this evening.  I endorse most of his remarks, but regret that we speak to an empty Chair.  I assume <Col N="1165" /> we shall get a reply from somebody on behalf of the Government.  I regard the sequence of events as constituting a wrongful usurpation by the Executive of the role of Parliament. We must not minimise the consequences of this.  I should like to begin at the other end from where Senator O'Higgins began and trace briefly this sequence of events.  I do not want to comment on the tribunal or the evidence taking place before it because that is <i>sub judice.</i>  One of the witnesses did not wish to disclose information. The position was put by her counsel that an undertaking had been given by the Executive, to this Seanad, that there would be a journalistic privilege not to disclose information.  According to newspaper reports on Friday, 23rd January, 1970, the Chairman of the tribunal said that this undertaking had not been indicated to the tribunal. If it was given, and he wished to know whether it had been given, he asked counsel for the Attorney General to refer back to the Executive on that point.  I submit it was wrong for the Executive to give its opinion of what it intended at the time.  It does not matter what it intended at the time. What matters is what opinion the Seanad formed of the Executive's undertaking at the time.  I would make a stronger case for what opinion we formed of this undertaking by quoting, first, the Tribunals of Enquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, which set up the tribunal.  Under this Act, it is clearly stated that the powers of the tribunal of inquiry include the power to take evidence in private.  Section 2 of that Act provides:</P>
      <P>A tribunal to which this Act is so applied as aforesaid&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  shall not refuse to allow the public or any portion of the public to be present at any of the proceedings of the tribunal unless in the opinion of the tribunal it is in the public interest expedient so to do for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry or the nature of the evidence to be given;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, there is jurisdiction in the tribunal itself to hold hearings <i>in camera;</i> to exclude the public and to <Col N="1166" /> have private hearings.  May I refer here to what was said by Senator Sheehy Skeffington?  He quoted part of this Act and went on to say, as reported at column 708 of the Official Report of Seanad Éireann, 18th December, 1969:</P>
    <P>What is being done in this kind of programme is of course an operation in free inquiry, and I feel that what is implied by such a tribunal in the original Act, with which certain people have not up till now been very fully informed, implied in the 1921 Act, give to the tribunal powers which we must really realise before we pass this Motion.  It would be absurd for us to set up a tribunal and to say afterwards: &ldquo;We did not know that it would have these powers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are assumed to know it had the power to hold evidence in private.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington went on, then, in that vein.  This was what was referred to by Senator Brugha in the already quoted column 723, when referring to Senator Sheehy Skeffington's remarks:</P>
    <P>I am glad it has been made clear in the Dáil that the inquiry may be held in public or private as may seem necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>This is clear in the Act.  Therefore the Minister, as a member of the Executive, can neither give an undertaking about it nor not do so.  It is an Act of Parliament. It has nothing to do with the Minister.  Therefore, the only undertaking he could give, and was understood by this House to give, was an undertaking as to the matter of journalistic privilege.</P>
    <P>Since the case can be put as strongly as that, I submit it can be put very strongly.  The point is that the Executive had no right to reply, when approached by counsel for the Attorney General and to give their subjective interpretation of what they meant.  I would quote from what Mr. J.A Costello, counsel for the RTE team, said before the tribunal when he made the following comment:</P>
    <P>The tribunal was set up by Parliament under the authority of Parliament and derives its authority from <Col N="1167" /> Parliament so the Minister therefore, in giving this undertaking, is giving it on behalf of Parliament and it was binding on the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Only in this Parliament, before the Dáil and the Seanad, could the Minister either ask again or be asked again, within the confines of this House, what was meant by the undertaking, in setting up the terms of reference.  It is also clear that the judges of the tribunal were prepared to accept that, if such an undertaking had been given, they would abide by the journalistic privilege.</P>
    <P>In my estimation, the Executive have usurped the function of Parliament. The unhappy situation here is that the tribunal have not as yet used this lever which has been placed in their hands. They have not yet gone behind the journalistic privilege because they have not considered it of sufficient importance. It is a matter of intense importance. I should like to see it brought up in the Dáil as well.  We ought not to allow our powers and privileges to be stripped from us in this way by the Executive by-passing what is a parliamentary function and what is essentially the role of Parliament.</P>

      <P>I, too, unfortunately am compelled to be circumspect in my remarks but I cannot help smiling at the remarks of Senator O'Higgins and the beautiful Senator on my left here.  Senator O'Higgins is very worried and says that the Government have no right to interpret the wishes of Parliament and he wants an early opportunity of making Parliament's wishes known in this matter. Senator Bourke goes one better: she says there is a usurpation by the Executive of the powers of Parliament. If those two Senators had only been as wide awake on 18th December they might have taken note of what Senator Sheehy Skeffington said and done something about it.  Apparently he was the only one wide awake on that side of the House and I pay him a compliment on that.</P>

      <P>The Government do not in any circumstances accept that an undertaking was given by the Minister for Transport and Power in the Seanad on 18th December.  This socalled assurance of which Senator O'Higgins spoke was given by the Minister during the debate on an intervention by Senator Ruairí Brugha who referred to the power of the tribunal to hold the inquiry in public or private.</P>

      <P>Mr. Justice Butler told Mr. J.A. Costello on 22nd January that no such undertaking had been conveyed to the tribunal on the terms of reference.  He said later that the Minister's interjection was given, and could be given, an interpretation that it referred only to the possibility of journalists giving their evidence in private.  The judge then, as Senator Bourke said, asked counsel for the Attorney General to find out if an undertaking had been given by the Government and at the end of the proceedings of the tribunal on Friday, 23rd January, counsel for the Attorney General informed the tribunal that the Government had given no such undertaking.</P>
      <P>We have heard so much tosh here about the usurpation of the powers of Parliament and the desirability of another session to deal with this matter that perhaps we should restate the facts.  This tribunal, as Senator O'Higgins quite correctly observed, was set up by decision of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was not set up by the Government or by an outside agency.</P>
