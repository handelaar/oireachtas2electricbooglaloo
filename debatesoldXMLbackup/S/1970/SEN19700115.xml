      <P>Yesterday evening when we adjourned I was speaking about the development of the health service, of which I regard this Bill as the next stage, and the fact that we had evolved our present situation from the arrangements that obtained up to about 1947 when really the only section of the community for which special provision was made by the State was the medically indigent.  Now we have got away from that and the State has recognised that other sections need special help in order to deal with the very heavy expenses of a serious illness. This has led to the arrangement whereby the State has divided the community into the three sections with which we have all become familiar during the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In retaining this particular approach to the health services we have been wise; we could have departed radically in considering this new development and adopted some other method of providing health services, an entirely new method, but if you have tried a system and have had it in operation for 20 years, it is easier to modify it than to try an entirely different one and possibly find that it does not work as well.  I have had occasion to talk about our health service in various countries, to lecture on it and to discuss it and I have always been impressed by the favourable views which people took of our arrangements when they were explained to them, of the fact that they were a sort of happy compromise between the arrangements whereby the State makes provision for everything <Col N="904" /> and the other kind of situation in which only the medically indigent are provided for.</P>
    <P>In discussing this Bill there are three aspects of it to which I should like to draw particular attention, three important new departures.  The first one is the introduction of health boards to look after the general administration of the health services in their areas.  The second is the setting-up of the special arrangements for co-ordinating hospitals under the regional hospital boards and the hospital council, and the third is the modification of the present practitioner service with special reference to the free choice of doctor which is now being introduced for the first time for the kind of person who is being looked after by the health services.  The health boards have got three special kinds of significance for me.  First of all, they do bring into existence larger areas than the former areas looked after by the local authorities.  These areas consist of two, three, four or five counties as is projected by the Minister's document which he circulated some time ago.  These are very much better units as a basis for planning; they do enable an authority to be created by a health board which will look after all kinds of services in these areas and try to co-ordinate them with each other.</P>
    <P>We all remember the difficulty that existed in regard to mental hospitals, where you had not got a mental hospital for every county and sometimes several county councils had to join together to run a particular mental hospital. This, as it were, is almost a forerunner of the situation we will have where health boards will be nominated by several local authorities to run the areas and all aspects of the services in those areas.  This will mean we will be able to have more specialised services because they will be able, more economically, to cover this wider area. It is also important in setting up these boards that the Minister has found it feasible to give a considerable amount of responsibility, as representatives on them, to doctors and workers in the ancillary medical profession.  This was not possible previously.  A doctor might be on a health authority but not necessarily as a doctor.  Now doctors <Col N="905" /> will be appointed on the health boards by the Minister on the nomination of the professional bodies concerned and, therefore, they will be on it in their professional capacity.  I think this is a very important step we are taking in recognising that a doctor, as well as being a professional man, may also have some competence in helping to run a service and in administering a service.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we should recognise that the establishment of these health boards is a step towards taking health services and health problems as far as possible away from politics.  It has been a truism for a long time that health services should be above politics, but this is not very easy to arrange in general.  Perhaps the countries which have gone furthest in this regard are in Scandinavia where the health services are administered by a national health board appointed by the Government without direct responsibility to any particular Minister.  The board have a subvention from the Government and have the continuing responsibility of administering the health services.</P>
    <P>If one discusses this with any responsible person from one of these countries one is likely to say that this is an admirable arrangement because the health services are then not in danger of changing with political changes which may take place every few years; they have a stability and the people concerned with them can plan in a forward manner.  You will be told on the other hand that the fact that the health services are divorced from politics like this means there is no particular Minister responsible for finding the money for them&mdash;there is no Minister for Health to fight his corner in the Cabinet to get the best from the Minister for Finance.  Therefore, they are always complaining there that they do not get their proper share of the financial cake.</P>
    <P>The system we are evolving here of health boards which will have responsibilities to the health authorities and to the central Department of Health and who will, therefore, receive their financial support from both sources will be a compromise which might work extremely well.  At the same time, <Col N="906" /> the majority representation on these boards will be appointed by the local authorities but with considerable representation from the medical and ancillary professions.  Therefore, the boards are less likely to be politically orientated or to make decisions on a clear-cut party basis such as the local authorities in the past on these matters.</P>
    <P>In regard to the functions of the health boards, one is dealing with something which is an extremely wide subject.  Obviously, they will have the responsibility for running the services, and any discussion of their functions is a discussion of the services as a whole, and it is hardly appropriate to embark on that now.  There is, however, one point I should like to mention in particular. It is the possible functions these boards might have, or any committee set up under them, in the matter of the dissemination of information about the health services and in organising arrangements for health education.</P>
    <P>This was referred to in the Dáil and amendments were suggested to include the function of advising the general public on the availability of the services. These were rejected by the Minister because he thought the possible cost of these information centres, if they became too numerous and too large, might become too great to be justifiable.  He reminded the other House that the local authorities already have this function under the 1947 Health Act, and he mentioned there is a centre in Cork that deals with the dissemination of information about the health services.  However, as far as I can gather, this is the only such centre outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>I think that if an Act of 1947, 22 years ago, gave power to local authorities to do this, and if in the course of these 22 years we have had only one centre developed in one city in this country, it does not indicate to me that this is working well.  Therefore, it would do no harm if the Minister took another look at this and put into the provisions dealing with the functions of health boards and their local councils a specific reference to either health education or to the dissemination of information about the health <Col N="907" /> services.  In the long run this at least would stimulate local authorities to take public notice of this and it would help in turn to make the services more efficient and possibly more economic to run.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of general talk about various diseases that occur and it is a fashionable topic of conversation, but it does not mean there is any deep public understanding of such diseases.  There was a discussion, for instance, on the early signs of cancer and the person conducting it discovered that not one of five adults with reasonably educated backgrounds could give one early symptom of cancer.  If there was some better means of disseminating information like that, in the ordinary way so that it would not create scares, you might find that people would come forward for treatment in time so that you would not have to bear the massive cost of treatment in the long run.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that a big proportion of people are unaware of the services that are provided and available for them under various health measures.  It has been estimated that, perhaps, up to half of the total illnesses in any community is latent; it is beneath the surface like the proportion of the iceberg, though not as big a proportion.  This is one of the reasons why the health services in England have increased in cost so enormously.  Their cost in 1945-46, when introduced, was based on the then conception of the amount of illness in the population.  They have found since that that programme had to provide a service for illnesses which they did not know existed at the beginning.  It is necessary that we become aware of these under-the-surface illnesses and the best way of doing this is by way of having centres not distributed too numerously, and, therefore, too expensively and possibly ineffectively, in reasonably large communities. There might be one centre under the aegis of each health board.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say the local authorities already have under the Act of 22 years ago a responsibility in this respect, but if that Act has produced only one centre, it might be no harm <Col N="908" /> to remind the health authorities of their responsibility in this respect.  Therefore, as I said earlier, the Minister might think again on this matter.</P>
    <P>On the question of membership of the boards, I think the agreement that has been reached by the Minister in the other House with the various people who put forward views as to the relative representation of the local authorities and the medical representatives is well founded and I have no quarrel with it.  I agree also that ancillary workers should be represented on these boards.  They are very important because of their direct responsibility for dealing with their patients, and this applies particularly to nurses.</P>
    <P>Special reference has been made to psychiatric nurses.  I do not know why they have been taken out of the whole body of the nursing profession for special mention.  There are others, as well, with equal importance.  There are obstetric nurses and paediatric nurses. In fact, the entire nursing profession is now becoming as split up into specialities as the medical profession. Therefore, I do not know why psychiatric nurses have been picked out and why they should have been given more of a right to representation on the boards than obstetric nurses. There is as much obstetric work these days as psychiatric work and I hope that situation will continue well into the future.  That is a matter which presumably has been worked out with the Minister and the nursing authorities.</P>
    <P>An amendment that was suggested and pressed with some force in the other House was the desirability of having other workers in employment on the health boards represented on these boards.  I do not find myself completely in agreement with that.  I agree with the Minister that if you make these boards too large nothing will ever get done.  Having served on a number of these boards, I feel that the people who have the direct responsibility for the particular function that the board has to carry out, namely, dealing with sick people and promoting health, are the people who are more likely to give the best service on these <Col N="909" /> boards.  This is not to say that I underestimate the valuable work done by everybody connected with an institution like a hospital, but I think the best way of dealing with that is to bring in these other people, the people who run the catering service, the people who run the clerical side of the hospital and the administrative side, everybody, in fact, on various types of committee where these particular functions will be discussed.</P>
    <P>There are two other points about health boards that I should like to mention.  There does not seem to be any provision for either the health boards or the local committees to have members other than those who are appointed by the health authorities and nominated by the Minister.  They have not, so far as I can see, any power to have on them people outside this range of expertise, if you like.  On the other hand, in section 40, dealing with the reorganisation of hospitals, both bodies under that section have the power to have on them people who are outside the membership, in other words, to go outside and bring people in, presumably for their special knowledge in particular matters.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view put forward that some provision should be made to have members of health boards on local committees.  If the local committee are to function properly and bring the health board into close relationship with the conditions in the various areas for which the local committees have responsibility, then there has got to be some very direct communication between them.  In the Medical Research Council we have a number of committees and we have a rule that the chairman of each committee is always a member of the council.  We find that this gives a member of the council a direct responsibility for seeing that that committee get on with their work and, in turn, he then has to report on the work of the committee at the council meetings. This is an arrangement which works very well and I am sure it obtains in many other institutions.  If some sort of bridge like that were to be made between the health boards and their local authorities the whole thing would <Col N="910" /> find itself in a much more unified and satisfactory position.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention another point in relation to health boards.  In the health board areas where there are medical schools&mdash;there are three such areas in this country: Dublin, Cork and Galway&mdash;the health board should have a very close relationship with the medical schools.  They will have to use, by and large, the graduates of those schools for the purposes of staffing their health services.  The younger graduates will be the house officers of the hospitals.  The training arrangements and the teaching arrangements will be, or should be, very closely dovetailed with each other.  It would be appropriate for the authority that is running the medical school, the university, that is, to have some representation on the health board.  I am sure that this can be looked after by the Minister when he is arranging to make his nominations on that section of the health board but I should like him to assure me in that regard.  It works very well in England where the university, if it has a medical school, has representation on the regional hospital board and also on the regional practices committees.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the next point, that is, hospital reorganisation.  One can only welcome what is done in the section in this Bill dealing with hospitals to rationalise and co-ordinate the hospital situation.  It has become extremely difficult with the enormous number of small hospitals scattered all over the country and the desire of each hospital to pursue its work at the highest possible level of specialisation and to have this desire supported by adequate funds from the central pool. This leads to a situation which has become completely impossible and not least of all in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>My particular interest in this regard is in section 40 and in the implications of that section in regard to the question of medical education.  Comhairle na nOspidéal which is being set up under that section is being given responsibilities of a very wide nature regarding the staffing of hospitals.  It is very right that these responsibilities should be given to a particular body on a national <Col N="911" /> basis so that proper co-ordination can be brought about but, on the other hand, there appears to me, in the first draft of this section, to be a danger that the staffing of the teaching hospitals might become a direct responsibility of this council rather than of the medical schools that are depending on these hospitals for the training of their students.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor and the Minister and the officers of the Department have looked at this problem in a very sympathetic way and amendments have been introduced into section 40 which will go a long way to deal with it but there is one still necessary in subsection (1) (b) (i) of section 40.  This subsection gives the council the authority to determine the number and types of consultants in hospitals.  Later on we find that they also have the authority to approve the qualifications of persons who are candidates for these posts and when they come to do that they have to consult with the teaching body concerned if there is a teaching responsibility. That is fair enough and we are grateful to the Minister for introducing that amendment but even at the level where they are approving the number of these consultants it has a direct implication for the teaching bodies.  I just give one instance of this and this is one with which the Minister is very familiar.  We wanted to develop cardiology in a particular teaching hospital in this town and it proved extremely difficult because the authorities in this hospital did not recognise that this level of development of cardiology was the kind of thing they wanted to encourage without reservation.</P>
    <P>A very bright young man was appointed.  He tried to work in those sort of circumstances and he found it impossible, so he left, greatly, I think, to the loss of medicine in Dublin. When we were replacing him we were in a position to insist that the hospital take a more rational view of this responsibility.  Grudgingly, we got a certain amount of encouragement but it was not until we got money from an outside source, an American foundation, to support the post in part <Col N="912" /> that we were able to make an appointment in that hospital of a cardiologist. What I am trying to say is that the hospitals concerned should have the obligation to consult with the teaching authorities in the establishment in determining the number of such posts. Not only in determining the qualifications of them but also in establishing new ones, it should be able to listen to the teaching body when such circumstances arise and take note of their requirements.</P>
    <P>In regard to the qualifications that consultants, particularly in teaching hospitals, have on their appointment and in regard to the manner of appointment, the provisions in this section also meet our wishes and we are grateful to the Minister and his Department for this and for being sympathetic to our point of view.  In Trinity College we are fortunate in having an agreement with the hospitals where our students go for training, with the federated hospitals, the Rotunda and St. Patrick's Hospital for different types of training that students get and for the appointment of people who have teaching responsibility. By and large, these agreements provide that such persons will be appointed jointly by the university and the hospital.  The appointments board set up to deal with vacancies will be constituted from the hospitals central council and partly from the university itself.  We have found in a number of instances that this works excellently. There is some difficulty in bringing this into line with the also excellent system of filling vacancies operated by the Local Appointments Commission but I believe that the wording of this section in this regard is sufficiently liberal and unrestricted as to make it possible for some proper arrangement to be worked out.  I am sure the Minister and his colleagues in the Department of Education will be able to help us when we get down to dealing with that matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think a teaching body should make an appointment to a hospital of somebody who has responsibility for looking after patients.  The teaching body are not the kind of organisation who are equipped to make such an appointment, to judge the qualifications and the ability of the person so appointed to fit in with his colleagues, <Col N="913" /> and so on.  Nor do I think that a hospital on its own should make appointments of persons who have teaching responsibility without referring to the teaching bodies but together the two can make a very good job of it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the functions of this council in relation to staffing hospitals, I would hope that the Minister, when we come to look at these sections in detail on Committee Stage, would take some special step to introduce into this section or some other appropriate place in the Bill some reference to the right of the general practitioner to work in hospitals.  He mentioned this in his explanatory memorandum but there is no specific reference to it in the Bill itself.  I think the whole arrangement would have a great deal more teeth if this was said in the early subsections of section 40 and if the words &ldquo;general practitioner&rdquo; were inserted in that section and the responsibility of Comhairle na nOspidéal for regulating the number and qualifications of other staffs in hospitals were set out.  I think they could be given a right to be considered for incorporation in hospitals staffs.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the general practitioner, which is the next point I want to take up, has been under very close scrutiny recently by various bodies and it is clear that only recently have we begun to recognise that this section of the profession is at least as important as&mdash;possibly even more important than&mdash;the consultant specialist group for the purpose of the ordinary running of the health service. In the Todd Report which I have here there are no fewer than 90 sections dealing with general practitioners and in section 31 we find this sentence: &ldquo;A very substantial proportion of all illness, perhaps 90 per cent, is dealt with entirely within the ambit of general practice&rdquo;.  That is a measure of the importance of the work of the general practitioner and it could be even greater with the development which the Minister foreshadowed of a more active investigative function for the hospitals so that patients are taken into hospital and investigated and then sent back with instructions to the practitioner as to what to do rather than having patients kept in bed in <Col N="914" /> hospital to be looked after by the consultants.</P>
    <P>Yesterday a Senator referred to the debt we owe to those who initiated the Hospitals Sweepstake scheme.  I agree with him wholeheartedly.  I mentioned this on the Appropriation Bill but it is not inappropriate to mention it again now.  This scheme was introduced on 6th December, 1929, in Dáil Éireann by the then Professor of Medicine in Trinity College who was Sir James Craig.  He had nothing to do with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland at that time although sometimes confused with him.  In his Second Reading speech on that occasion he made it quite clear that he did not relish introducing that scheme.  He was a Northern Ireland Protestant and one could understand why he did not want to be in the position of putting forward a Bill in support of the health services of the country, including the hospitals, on a gambling basis.  But he found this was absolutely necessary because the hospitals then were in a dreadful situation.  There was no money for the development of their services, no money even to continue on the very low standard on which they were then being run.  We have all seen the development that occurred following the operation of the Sweepstake scheme.  This is one of the most important developments that have taken place in the health services of the country.  The amount of money that has come in from this scheme has enabled a large number of hospitals to be built throughout the country and others to be developed.  Most of us disagree fundamentally with the Government for taking a large share of this money in tax but this is a matter on which we have never been able to get any satisfaction and there is no use in raising it now.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not being contentious when, in referring to these improvements, I mention that particular hospital of which Sir James Craig was a senior member of the staff.  Sir Patrick Duns, which I attended as a student, has had relatively little benefit from the Hospitals Sweepstake scheme. The hospital is essentially the same as it was in 1929, which was about the time I qualified.  There have been <Col N="915" /> improvements but not of any major character.</P>
    <P>This also applies to most of the hospitals in that group, hospitals to which students of our medical school go.  I know there are reasons for this. I know that the multiplicity of these small hospitals has made it very difficult, in the absence of any agreement between them, for the Minister or his Department to achieve all the developments they would like to see taking place.  This restriction has not applied equally to all the small hospitals.</P>
    <P>This group has now taken certain steps which I think will help the Minister to help them.  About ten years ago they formed a federation and, in the course of the negotiations, some of them extremely difficult, in the development of that federation, they have recently, with the help of the Minister, formed a plan for their future development.  We will now look to the Minister to encourage this group of hospitals in this development in a way which I think they deserve.</P>
    <P>This federation is made up of seven hospitals.  Some of them have been serving the sick poor of Dublin for over 200 years.  Most of them were built in the slum areas so as to be easily accessible to the sick poor.  They provide about 1,200 beds altogether and they have over half the attendances at out-patient departments in the year.  These are figures which are not generally recognised.  When the amount of work done is staggered over seven small units like that, it tends to be lost but, when it is all gathered together, it makes a very substantial total.  They want to go on doing this and they want to go on doing it in a modern and worthy style.  They want a provision in a specific way to allow this to be done to the standards of the 70s, 80s and 90s of this century.</P>
    <P>At the same time, they do not want to deny their younger people the opportunity for post-graduate work and specialist training.  This is absolutely necessary at this stage of the development of medicine and, if some provision were not made for this, they would not be able to persuade their <Col N="916" /> younger people to stay in the employment of these hospitals.  The agreement we are in process of working out with the Minister&mdash;I do not want to go into it in detail here&mdash;will provide for both of these aspects and I would hope that there would be no suggestion that the aspect which deals with the ordinary day-to-day illnesses of the very large majority of the people of this town is in any way secondary to or a less worthy aspect of our medical effort than, say, the training of specialists and the carrying out of prestige operations in special centres.</P>
    <P>We come to the choice of doctor under the section which deals with general practice.  This is an excellent innovation but I find myself in a little difficulty in understanding how it will work.  I would welcome an explanation from the Minister on this when he is replying to the debate.  Will we continue to have dispensary doctors?  That is my principal difficulty.  If we do, will we be paying twice for the same job of work?  Will we be paying a dispensary doctor to look after a sick person, but that sick person does not choose to go to that particular doctor but chooses to go to somebody else?  Will we be paying specifically for that act of service?  In other words, will we be paying twice for the same job?</P>
    <P>Could it happen that a dispensary doctor would make himself so unpopular with the people in the lower income group that they would all opt to go to someone else?  Then he would be getting paid but he would not have anything to do for that part of his salary.  I am sure there is some way around this.  I am quite certain that doctors are not like that and that that would not happen, but that is just an extreme point that comes to my mind and I should like if the Minister would elucidate it.</P>
    <P>It is very important that there should be good quality doctors available in the rural areas.  One of the things that the Local Appointments Commission have done over the past 30 or 40 years was to recruit good quality doctors for those dispensary posts.  I have been on a number of boards constituted to make those appointments and I was always impressed at the way they <Col N="917" /> weighed up the qualifications and experience of the candidates.  As a result, in many parts of the country there are highly qualified people running this aspect of the service.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention briefly to the Minister that I believe it is very important to stimulate and encourage the provision of good quality general practitioners.  I believe quite honestly that there is not any country in the world where the scarcest form of medical care is not quality general practice.  In most countries you can get highly qualified surgeons and very well trained specialists.  They are to be found in the cities working in hospitals of various degrees of adequacy but, when you go to the rural districts and look for good quality general practitioners, very often there is difficulty in finding them.  I know this applies to those countries as well as the less developed countries.</P>
    <P>There are several ways in which we can do this.  We have to provide better facilities for general practice so that the practitioners can examine their patients properly and have them properly investigated.  They should have access to facilities in hospitals for special investigation on their patients. I saw with pleasure recently that University College, Galway, have succeeded in making such a service available.  This should be general and should cover the whole range of general practice.  I am not talking about putting specimens in a tube and sending them by post to some laboratory and reading the result and possibly not being able to understand it because you have not read that amount about recent developments.  I am talking about an opportunity to make as close contact as possible with the people who are involved in these investigations, who understand what they are doing and are in a position to explain to the practitioner the implication of the results so far as the patient is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have in one hospital in Dublin &mdash;that is the one I happen to know about; there may be others&mdash;an excellent arrangement whereby a particular practitioner works in the outpatient department of that hospital during certain <Col N="918" /> sessions each week.  This is not recognised by the health authority for payment but he does it and this brings him and his viewpoint and his knowledge of the background of the patient into close contact with the hospital.  I think this would be an excellent arrangement for the health boards to have.</P>
    <P>I also think&mdash;and this is getting away from the function of the Department of Health&mdash;that if the Department of Health could bring influence to bear on the Department of Education so that the medical schools would be encouraged to establish departments of general practice, this would add greatly to the prestige and status of the practitioners. We could have a professor in charge of lectures on general practice teaching the students the organisation of practice and the responsibilities of the general practitioner, sometimes out of contact with the specialist service of a hospital.</P>
    <P>We have in Trinity College during the last five or six years instituted a scheme, which is working very well, whereby medical students go for a few weeks each year to a number of practitioners around the city, who are prepared to co-operate and take these students around their practices, show them what is going on and explain to them the nature of their work.  This has two effects: first of all, it gives students an insight into the other side of illness, the side away from the hospital, and the implications of this illness on the family and it also shows them that general practice can be an attractive and stimulating way of life.  This, in turn, will enable us to recruit better quality students for this type of practice.</P>
    <P>There are only two or three other matters I want to mention briefly. Research was mentioned here.  There is provision in the Bill for the Minister to support specialist investigations and to encourage research.  We are grateful for this.  The desirability of encouraging research in rheumatism in the western parts of the country was mentioned and emphasised.  I wholeheartedly agree with this.  Rheumatism is, as the Senator said, one of the most important reasons behind absence from work and so forth, <Col N="919" /> but I would not agree with him in his suggestion that this type of research is an inexpensive type of research.  It is anything but that.  If one wants to do good quality research in rheumatic diseases one needs to have a very complicated laboratory; one wants a couple of electromicroscopes which cost about £10,000 or £12,000 apiece.  One wants teams of workers to look after them, people who understand how to use them.  One needs very special X-ray equipment which will cost several times as much as a couple of electromicroscopes. That represents a nice little bill for a start.  I do not think the Senator should go away with the impression that he can set up very cheaply in Galway a small unit which will discover the cause of rheumatism in a very short time and relieve the incidence of that particular malady in that area.  I am not suggesting such a research unit should not be established in Galway, or that the expense is any reason for not establishing it but, if anybody is thinking in terms of establishing a rheumatism research clinic, he should not think in terms of a small amount of money.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with other Senators about the amount of work that the Department and the Minister, and his successors, will have to do in future when this Bill is passed in drafting regulations to try to make the Bill work properly.  There are two kinds of regulations.  One kind has to be approved by both Houses before they can be put into operation and the other kind has merely to be laid before the House for 21 days.  There is nothing in this Bill that states this as a particular requirement, but I take it that is the overall ruling which has been accepted as binding for all sorts of regulations.  Then there are orders. There is nothing at all about the orders. The Bill does not say they will be laid before the House, or put before either House of the Oireachtas, so that we will never know about them until they have been made.  I wonder are we entirely at the mercy, shall we say, of the Minister and his successors in this regard.  Can he just make an order, having consulted with whatever local <Col N="920" /> people the Act asks him to consult with, and we will not know anything about it until the matter is a <i>fait accompli?</i></P>
    <P>There is, then, the use of the words &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I note this over and over again in the Bill.  Sometimes it is quite apparent that the one word is appropriate where the other would not be, but it is not so apparent in every instance.  For instance, I know that home nursing &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be provided, but I also note that home helps &ldquo;may&rdquo; be provided.  I do not know why there should be a subtle difference between these two because, if one is ill, a help in the home may be just as important as a nurse.  Indeed, there are certain kinds of illness which do not need nursing but do need a great deal of home help.  Rheumatism is one of these.  One might be crippled with rheumatism and unable to cook a meal. A nurse cannot do anything but one does need a home help.  Why have we &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo; as between these two sections?</P>
    <P>I conclude by welcoming the introduction of these two sections providing these ancillary helps.  They will be an enormous benefit in keeping down the extravagant use we are making of our hospitals at the moment, not merely for medical but very often for social purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was being discussed in the Dáil the question of who should have a majority on the health boards gave rise to a great deal of discussion and I am very glad to know from the Minister's opening speech here that members of local authorities will, in fact, have a majority on these boards.  In saying that, I do not for a moment disagree with the fact that doctors and other professional people will have a fairly big representation on these boards. Indeed, this is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason at all why the Minister should not have the power to nominate a number of people to these boards.  When this was being discussed in the other House it was suggested that this was in some way undemocratic and that the Minister should not have nominees.  That seems to me to be a <Col N="921" /> very peculiar approach to democracy because the Minister, after all, represents the people and he is providing something like 75 per cent of the cost of these services.  It is a peculiar approach to democracy to argue then that the Minister should not have the power to nominate some members to these boards.  However, as I said at the outset, it is appropriate that the local authority representatives should have a majority on the boards.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to make a brief comment on something Senator Jessop said.  He dealt with the extent to which politics should be involved in the health services, the extent to which politics should obtrude on them, and he suggested, I think, that politics should only play a minor part in health services.  It must be realised that were it not for the efforts of politicians, Members of the Dáil and Seanad and, in particular, members of local authorities, we would not have today anything like the health services we have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>In point of fact, I said party politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is largely due to politics that we have the health services we have.  It must be realised that health services are not merely a matter of providing hospitals, operating theatres, and skilled personnel.  The other side of health services is finding out, first of all, what are the real needs of the people and then finding out whether the services in existence are giving the people that which legislation purports to give them.  Politicians, whether they be party politicians or independents, have a very important part to play and it is only right that they should have a majority, even if it is only a slight majority, on these health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having made reference to Senator Jessop in a mildly critical way, I should also like to take this opportunity of congratulating him on an excellent speech which dealt with the problem of health in a very comprehensive way and which all of us found very interesting and helpful.  I find myself at a disadvantage speaking on <Col N="922" /> health after the speech made by Senator Jessop, who has such an expert grasp of this matter.</P>
    <P>The main improvements in this Bill are the structural and administrative changes in the health boards throughout the country.  I think these changes are essential.  It must be realised that we cannot stand still.  We cannot ignore the fact that services must change and that the cost of such services, whether we do nothing to change them or whether we make big changes, will inevitably go up.  Hospital costs are going up by an astronomical amount the whole time and so is the cost of equipment.  Not only is the cost of equipment that has always been in existence going up but more sophisticated kinds of equipment are needed all the time and the cost is not merely doubling but is going up ten times in certain respects.  The cost of specialists is going up, not because the specialists are being paid more, but because more specialised specialists are required.</P>
    <P>If we are to give the service considered to be normal and reasonable in the present day those who administer the health services as well as Members of the Dáil and Seanad find themselves in a dilemma.  They have to decide whether they are going to allow the health services to deteriorate or whether very much more money is to be provided to continue or slightly improve the type of service given under the present structure.  If it is agreed that resources both in regard to money and the skilled personnel required are limited&mdash;money will always be scarce and taxes cannot provide for everything&mdash;every effort must be made to ensure that these resources are provided for and distributed in the fairest and most rational way possible.  I do not think any Member of this House would want the services now being provided to deteriorate, nor do I think any Member of this House would merely want them to stand still.  I think we all want them to improve and be as good as possible within our resources.</P>
    <P>Those who object to the structural and administrative changes in the health boards, which will ensure that <Col N="923" /> improved services can be provided at the lowest possible cost are, in fact, objecting to the cost of such services and the fact that they are having such a heavy impact on the rates.  It seems to me that we cannot have it both ways.  If we are conscious of the cost of these services and if we are conscious of the fact that the available money must be spent in the most rational way possible, then we must face up to whatever structural and administrative changes are necessary to provide that service.  It seems to me that the provisions in this Bill supply these services in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>We can only provide hospitals able to deal with every case, no matter how difficult or obscure, in two or three places in the country.  Some people seem to want every county to have a hospital able to deal with almost every case.  Clearly, this is something which is not possible.  The Minister said in the Dáil that the average county surgeon could probably deal with something in the region of 80 to 90 per cent of the cases which come into the hospital and that it was only in something slightly over ten per cent of the cases that a patient who came in for treatment had to be sent elsewhere for specialist treatment. This is a very good figure.  Nevertheless, the present system met with great difficulty in trying to provide treatment for the other ten per cent. It created the problem of what hospitals these people should be sent to and whose responsibility they should be when they went to these hospitals.  It created an undesirable situation which, far from getting better in the future if we continued with our present system, would get worse.  Specialist treatment is improving all the time and it would be impossible to have the various specialists in every county.  This situation is serious at the moment and it will, inevitably, get very much worse unless the kind of structure provided in this Bill is brought in.  This is not something which is going to be provided next week or even next year.  The Bill merely gives the Minister power to introduce gradually this new structure into our health services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> The reaction of Opposition parties to this Bill has in some cases been mildly critical and in almost all cases they have given it rather niggardly praise.  If the Opposition accept that resources are limited one wonders what type of services they would wish this Bill to provide.  In the Dáil, although certainly not to the same extent in this House, Fine Gael advocated an insurance system by which everyone in the country would be insured against ill-health. There would then be an insurance fund which would pay for medical attention for everyone who needed it. This is a positive suggestion and certainly something worthy of consideration. It is difficult to understand how this would work.  In the first place, we must realise that the voluntary health insurance scheme is there and everybody in the country is entitled to be a member of that scheme if he wants to be.  However, there are very large numbers of people who will not subscribe to the voluntary health insurance scheme and there are very large numbers who, whether they want to or not, cannot afford to subscribe to it.  What is the system which Fine Gael advocate?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if the Government tried to introduce a scheme of this kind, they would, first of all, have to decide on various categories of people; they would have to decide on certain categories, which I suppose would coincide pretty well with those who are fully eligible, partly eligible and not eligible under the present Bill; then they would have to introduce some kind of means test to decide what people were to be in the various categories and they would have to pay the premiums of approximately 30 per cent of the people who are fully eligible under the Bill and help those who are only partly eligible to pay their premiums.  What would happen if the people concerned refused to pay the remainder of the premiums is not quite clear.  Finally, they would say to the other ten per cent, or thereabouts, that it was up to them to provide their own services.</P>
    <P>What is so different from doing that and having the present system?  In effect what the Government are doing <Col N="925" /> is raising from taxes the money needed to provide full medical attention for those who need it fully and part medical attention for those who need it partly.  Is there any difference between doing that and raising money to pay the full premium for an insurance scheme for those who need full attention and to pay part of the premium for those who need part attention?  In the end it seems to me to get back to very much the same kind of system.  It seems to me that the impact on taxes or rates, or however it is financed, will in the end be very much the same.  Although the system proposed by Fine Gael on the face of it seems to be very different, we would be dealing with something which is insurance rather than a Government provision of medical attention and the end result from every point of view would seem to be very much the same.</P>
    <P>I must say I see no advantage, no real advantage, and I see many disadvantages, in the system advocated by Fine Gael.  In a community which accepts, as this community accepts, that everybody who needs medical attention is entitled to it the only way to provide that service is to provide it in the kind of service we have at present and the kind of improved service which we have in this Bill.  The fact that some people need some attention and that at present the State does not feel obliged to provide everything for them, illustrates the difficulty of introducing a kind of insurance system because, as I said earlier, if the Government pay some of the premium it is not clear what happens about the remainder.</P>
    <P>When I comment on the voluntary health insurance scheme I want to make it clear that I am not for one moment criticising the scheme.  It is an excellent scheme and anybody who can afford to contribute to it should certainly do so.  In every way it has proved to be an excellent scheme and one which has done a great deal of good work and provided magnificent help for those who subscribed to it.  Its success however is due to the fact that it is voluntary, that it is there for people who are prepared and able to subscribe to it and to try to change it into a kind of compulsory scheme <Col N="926" /> would, to my mind, mean that it would not have anything like the same kind of success.  When I say that some of the other parties were critical of this Bill, or certainly lacking enthusiasm for it, I do so because I read some of the speeches and I heard some of the speeches made by the Labour Party on it.  Some of the Labour Party, of course, are reasonably satisfied with it but some say that it is merely a stop-gap solution and that the real solution is to have a free-for-all health scheme.  I wonder whether anybody outside a few doctrinaire enthusiasts for free health services really want this kind of scheme.  It is impossible to understand exactly who it would benefit and what the overall effect of it would be.  In the Dáil the Minister mentioned that the cost of introducing a free-for-all scheme would be at least an extra £20 million.  That would be an extra £20 million on top of whatever extra cost there would be for the improvements in this Bill.  What would be the advantage of spending an extra £20 million?  The position is that those who are in need of free medical attention already get it and they would be no better off.  Those who are getting part help, hospital attention and so on, might be marginally better off because they would get general practitioner and general medical attention as well, and those who at the moment are able to provide for their own needs are the people who would really benefit.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why the Labour Party should be advocating that the relatively wealthy members of the community who can afford to provide medical attention for themselves and their families should benefit in this way.  The result inevitably would be that the general standard of the health services would deteriorate because the resources available would have to be spread more thinly.  The standard would suffer to some extent and the only people who would benefit are those who do not really need help.  I cannot accept that this approach to our health problems is in any way reasonable or helpful.  It is a doctrinaire approach which does not seem to be pushed in this House and I do not think that the Labour Party are 100 per cent in favour of it.  Their <Col N="927" /> attitude to it is somewhat half-hearted and I believe it will continue to be half-hearted in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because it provides the structure for administrative changes which I consider essential for the improvement of the services in the future.  It introduces a number of relatively small but very important improvements which already have been referred to by a number of Senators, but which I should like to refer to again.</P>
    <P>The choice of doctor is an excellent improvement which has been discussed for many years and which, as far as the individual patient is concerned, may be of considerable advantage to him.  In many cases, of course, it will not be of any advantage because in many cases a person may be quite satisfied with the local dispensary doctor.  In many other cases, however, this may be of exceptional importance to a person in a part of the country where for some reason he or she does not get on very well with the local dispensary doctor.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the matter of eligibility of various classes, the improvement in the means test and the fact that there is an appeal in this respect, are of considerable importance also.  Several speakers referred to home help, nursing help, and I agree this is of great importance, something which will not only be of tremendous importance to the patient concerned but which will also be of great importance in helping to keep a family together.  It will also help in keeping down the cost of the health services because the cost of keeping a person in hospital at the moment is very high and just as much can be done in many cases by providing nursing assistance in the home.  Accordingly, in every way this development of the health services is of great importance from the patients' point of view and from the point of view of cost.  Also, the relatively minor abolition of the charges for outpatients is something which must be recommended.</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed this Bill <Col N="928" /> is fair to all sections of the community: it is fair to those who need full medical attention; it is fair to those who need some medical attention; it is fair to those who need the various services, some of which are new and some of which have been improved.  At the same time, in so far as it is possible to be fair, it makes some effort to cut down, to minimise, the increasing cost of the health services.  This Bill represents an effort to deal with changing circumstances in the health services, changes which are inevitable.  It is a matter of whether we face up to them or allow the situation to take over from us.  This Bill makes a very good effort to take that problem in hand and to deal with it in a rational way.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one point in conclusion.  It is not really a point in respect of which the Minister is responsible: it is a matter of drafting and I mention it more in a professional way.  It is on the question of repeals.  Repeals in many cases are repeals of entire Acts.  In some cases they are merely sections of previous Acts being repealed.  Here, however, the Health Authorities Act, 1960, with the exception of two sections and a schedule, has been repealed.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister and to the Parliamentary draftsman that in a case like this to repeal the whole Act and to allow two sections and a schedule to stand is not the best way of doing it. Surely to repeal the previous Act in its entirety and to reintroduce these provisions in the Bill before us would be a better way of doing this, because the difficulty for anybody reading Acts of this kind, tracing back amendments and repeals and so on, is immense.  It gets more difficult as time goes by.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, suggest that where you have a situation like this, to leave an Act on the Statute Book containing only two or three sections seems to be carrying this system too far.  I should like to mention that on a previous occasion&mdash;I think it was when the Income Tax Acts were being consolidated a few years ago and an Act was being introduced and a certain amount of publicity was being given to it in the newspapers&mdash;I happened to be talking <Col N="929" /> to the then German Ambassador who asked me why so much fuss was being made of the fact that Acts were being consolidated.  He said it was difficult for a German to understand this because in Germany most Acts are consolidated Acts to the extent that as far as possible when an Act like this is being introduced it would incorporate all the law dealing with health services &mdash;all previous Acts would be repealed and the whole system would be reenacted and brought up to date.</P>
    <P>This may present a very big difficulty in some cases but as far as possible we should aim in this country at having consolidation Acts which would bring all the law on a particular subject into the most recent Act.  I, therefore, ask the Minister whether it would be possible&mdash;obviously it is not possible in this Bill&mdash;when further changes in the health services are being considered, to introduce a Consolidation Act which would deal as comprehensively as possible with everything dealing with the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to compliment the Minister for his approach to the introduction of this Bill in so far as he went to some trouble to meet representatives of the local authorities to hear their views on the new Bill.  I should also like to compliment him for having gone to some trouble to indicate to the councillors present at those meetings that he would be all the time mindful of any suggestions they might make.  That is a good spirit: it is good to have liaison between the Minister and the members of local authorities who give long years of their lives to the public service and who have no reward other than the pride of achievement.</P>
      <P>I should like further to compliment the Minister for acknowledging in his introductory speech that the Bill as it came before the Seanad had been improved as a result of suggestions from all sides in the Dáil.  That, too, is a welcome spirit: the Minister welcomes suggestions rather than becoming annoyed when they are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get down to the Bill itself, I think regionalisation is absolutely necessary for a couple of reasons.  One is that it has become necessary to have well-equipped <Col N="930" /> and well-staffed hospitals&mdash; well-staffed from the point of view of numbers and their ability to deal with the work being done.  In this context I draw attention to the decline of population in some of our counties which is so low that they could not be considered as practical units for health services.</P>
    <P>Taking three counties in one section of the country from the point of view of valuation, in Meath 1d in the £ yields £2,400; in the adjoining county, Cavan, it yields only £1,200 and in the other adjoining county, Leitrim, its yields only £600.  Therefore an improvement in medical services in Meath might cost the ratepayers something in the nature of 3d in the £; in Cavan a similar improvement would cost 6d and in Leitrim 1s.  For these main reasons the introduction of a system of regionalisation is welcome and, as has been said by other speakers, is the system most likely to give an effective health service as economically as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated specifically that the health boards will be established on 1st April, 1971 and I suppose that from that date there will be a gradual implementation of the Act.  The Minister has not indicated when building of the new regional general hospitals will commence, whether it is likely to start in this decade or might not occur for two decades.  That poses a problem as to what will happen in the case of existing hospitals in the meantime.  Will they be kept in a reasonable state of repair or will there be an attempt to modernise them to any degree?</P>
    <P>There are hospitals that are in a bad state of repair structurally and it is possible that these hospitals would be allowed to go into further disrepair and would be rubbed off the hospital map, so to speak.  This is a problem in which local authorities are keenly interested.  They are anxious to know when the building schemes provided for in the Bill will get under way and what the approach to existing hospitals will be in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what has been said <Col N="931" /> by Senator Ryan, it is a disappointing feature that rates are still to be the source of revenue for hospitals under the health scheme.  There is a good deal in what Senator Ryan has said. The point is that it must be accepted that rates are based on an outmoded system and that the collection of rates causes very severe hardship in a big number of cases and, as a result, there is opposition to schemes that there otherwise would not be.  Down the years the Government have recognised to a degree that hardship is imposed by rates.  They introduced the Act giving relief of rates on agricultural land. As the Minister pointed out in his introductory statement, the subvention from the Government to health has increased over the last number of years from 50 per cent to approximately 56 per cent.  That also is a result of the growing awareness of the hardship imposed by the burden of rates.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the collection of the necessary funds to implement a hospitals scheme, or any other scheme, must cause some displeasure to those who have to pay but there are some forms of payment that cause more annoyance than others.  It is not very popular to compliment the income tax collectors on their system but that system does make certain allowances in respect of dependent children and the education of families, whereas rates do not make any such allowance. Take, for example, the figure of £1,200 maximum in the case of the middle income group.  A person in receipt of a salary of £1,600 could be granted allowances in respect of children, whereas no similar allowances are afforded to the person in the corresponding bracket whose valuation is £80.</P>
    <P>For these reasons and others, rates are a particularly objectionable form of collecting revenue and opposition to worthwhile schemes often grows up because of opposition to rates.  There are people who are opposed, not to the broad outlines of the Bill, but to the collection of the necessary finance in the form of rates.  That is a distinction that I should like to make.</P>
    <P>Groups will continue as under the <Col N="932" /> existing Health Act: lower income group, middle income group and upper income group.  I do not intend to criticise that matter at any length but I do hope that there will be more standardisation.  In certain counties the ceiling in the case of the lower income group is about £10 a week for a married couple with a family of two.  In other counties the ceiling for the same category may be as high as £14.  There is dissatisfaction when persons do not qualify for the general medical service card while others in the same category in an adjoining county, who may be in better circumstances, do qualify.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ceiling of £1,200 per annum in the case of the middle income group, the point I want to make is that if the right to £1,200 per annum is written into the Bill and becomes law, in four or five years time that may not be a fair ceiling because of depreciation in the value of the £ and an increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I think that in such cases when a specific salary or wage is introduced into a Bill it should be linked with a clause that would enable the thing to move up or down&mdash;if the latter likelihood ever comes about&mdash;with regard to changes in the cost of living.  If we have £1,200 as the fixed amount for the ceiling for the middle income group at this date with the value of the £ what it is and the cost of living rises above the figure it is now, then within three years or, perhaps, even less the cost of living will be appreciably higher and the value of the £ becomes increasingly less.  There should be some scale written into this clause that would automatically raise £1,200 to whatever was the equivalent value at a future time.  When I make that suggestion to the Minister I have in mind something of the same nature that occurred with another Act.  It was with regard to the sum given for reconstruction of dwellinghouses.  A limit of £140 or some such limit&mdash;I am not actually certain what it was&mdash;was written into the Act ten, 12 or 15 years ago when the amount of £140 had a purchasing power much greater than the purchasing power of the same amount of money now.  I make the suggestion, that when these specific <Col N="933" /> sums are introduced into a Bill they should be linked up with the cost of living and capable of adjustment without having to go to any great difficulty &mdash;that it would be done automatically in fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his address that radiologists are scarce, and I do not have any reason to dispute that.  The point I want to make is that in some areas doctors are scarce. There are areas in the country where you have not had a doctor under the dispensary scheme for the past five, six, seven or eight years.  In those remote areas the doctors do not wish to go when they can find remunerative employment in a more convenient place.  Tribute has been paid here by Senator Jessop to the work done by general practitioners throughout the country, but in my opinion the Minister or his successor in the very near future will be faced with the difficulty of being unable to keep doctors in certain remote areas in this country.  It will probably be necessary to offer an incentive of some kind, monetary or otherwise, to doctors to settle in the more remote parts.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned here yesterday by one Senator, and, perhaps, more, that married nurses are being brought back into employment in hospitals throughout the country.  This is quite true, and I know it to be true because it is happening in my own county.  It would, therefore, appear that we do not offer sufficient inducements to young nurses to stay in this country.  A number of Irish girls continue to go to England to be trained and then we are not able to induce them to come back here. Much of the good intentions of the Minister in this Bill will come to nought if we are not in a position to attract good doctors and nurses into the rural parts of this country.  Reference was made yesterday to the difficulties that confronted people in Mayo and other remote places when they have to call on medical services.  In this regard I would say to the Minister that here is an exercise on which he might advise some of his officers in the Department to continue to work.  They are people who got high places in the junior executive examinations years ago, and because they are skilled in <Col N="934" /> comparing and contrasting one thing with another they could employ that ability to compare and contrast the conditions that prevail in many parts of rural Ireland with those that prevail in the more thickly-populated centres. Then it might be seen that there was a great need to have more incentives to people to do their work there.</P>
    <P>The idea in the Bill of affording general practitioners an opportunity to use the local hospital for treatment of patients is to be welcomed wholeheartedly, and I compliment the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points. I have no hesitation whatever in extending my congratulations to the Minister for ensuring in the Bill that income of the family will not be taken into account when the means of parents are being assessed.  It has been happening down the years under the old Act that parents who could have benefited under the health scheme were denied benefit because of the supposed contribution they were getting from members of their family which, in fact, they were not getting.  Furthermore, I should like to say that in my experience the payments of disability allowances and even, indeed, the granting of GMS cards to certain classes of people left cause for discontent and complaint.  It has been interpreted down the years that a person who becomes immobilised applies for assistance under the local authority disability allowances scheme, and I have known it to happen that people were ruled out because it was said that they were not in gainful employment before the illness.  &ldquo;Gainful employment&rdquo; as far as I have been able to find out means earning wages but it did not include work done on a farm. Therefore, it would happen with farming people in some cases that you would have two brothers and a sister working on the farm and their labour was helping in production, but when one of them was stricken down with some illness he was ruled out from disability allowances because of the interpretation that he was not engaged in gainful employment.  If contributing to the production of wealth on the soil is not gainful employment, then <Col N="935" /> my knowledge of life in the country and of the English language is badly in need of a check-up.  I know another case of a housewife who was crippled with arthritis and because of the fact that she had not been in this &ldquo;gainful employment&rdquo; for 15 or 20 years when she was bringing up her family she was ruled as being ineligible for payment of disability allowance.  That sort of interpretation cannot be the intention of any Minister however anxious he might be to tend to the needs of the less well off members of the community.</P>
    <P>I would, too, join in support of the Senator who said that we should devote more attention to the school medical inspection and to the dental treatment of children at school.  I know that this is being done under the old Health Act, but in some areas because of a shortage of dentists there is a great back-log in the dental treatment of schoolchildren.  Anything that can be done to have the situation improved will be appreciated and the money will be well spent.  I remember being told by one of the Minister's predecessors that the aim was that every child should have at least three medical inspections during its primary school life.  That should be realised and there should be even more than three inspections if possible.  Above all, greater attention should be given to the care of teeth and eyes.  I am not ungrateful for the great headway that has been made but the shortage of dentists and specialists in some areas means that people are not getting the treatment it was intended they should get when the Act was passed.  Anything the present Minister can do to ensure that the present situation does not continue unalleviated will, I am sure, be done and I can assure him that his efforts will be widely appreciated.</P>
    <P>We still have a long way to go in order to deal properly with mentally retarded and deficient children.  I know of two cases in my own area. One is the daughter of a widowed mother who had to go out to work when her husband, a small farmer, died.  The eldest girl in the family is severely retarded and at sixteen has <Col N="936" /> the physical development of a child of five and the mental development of a child of about six months.  The child was taken to a suitable institution but last year the mother was told that as the child had reached the maximum age for children in this institution, she would have to make arrangements to take the child home.  What kind of treatment was that to mete out to a woman who must go out to work every day in order to rear the other children in the family?  When she had made this career for herself she was suddenly told that a child of this kind would be sent back to her.  What could she do about a child in that condition if it did come back?  Fortunately, people intervened and after great difficulty and much torment for the woman concerned the child was put into another institution.</P>
    <P>I know another case where nothing has been done.  I cannot delay the House citing individual cases but they are such serious cases that I am certain the Minister and his officials would not tolerate things of this kind if there was any possible remedy.  I am referring to the case of a child of nine, the eldest in a family of five.  The parents are small farmers.  The child is severely retarded and blind and dumb.  Every effort that has been made to have that child accommodated in an institution has so far failed.  It is no harm to reflect for a moment on the mental anguish of the parents of that child.  The mother, who is at present an expectant mother, must get up each morning of her life and try to deal with a child of that kind and one can imagine the mental torture unnecessarily inflicted on her.  One must also consider the two brothers and two sisters of this child who are being brought up in this environment. One also knows the uncharitable remarks that children in the school playground often hurl at each other.  When one takes all these things into account one realises the necessity for an all-out effort to make suitable provision for the treatment of such a child.  I make a special appeal to the Minister to ensure during his term of office and as early as possible that every back-log in a service of that sort is cleared up.  I know the difficulties that arise <Col N="937" /> in regard to the treatment of children of that type.  I suppose institutions are overcrowded but as a layman I believe it should be possible to add a chalet or some prefabricated cubicle to an existing institution to enable a child such as the one I have spoken of to be taken from the home and so afford the father and mother some prospect of being able to live their lives in reasonable comfort without having to face such a difficult existence daily.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the wholehearted support of a big section of the people in his efforts to reorganise health services so as to get the best possible results in the future, taking into account what we can afford to spend. We all know there are difficulties in health administration here as in other countries and the bills must be met. Sometimes there is a difference of opinion as to the best way of raising money.  We are aware that the health service is costing a colossal amount of money in England and in other countries and we also know that our health system gives us better protection than any provision made in the United States for the people there, some of whom are Irish emigrants, who live in fear of having to undergo a long period of hospitalisation in New York, Chicago or other cities.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill and on the new provisions he is introducing and I wish the measure every success.  I hope the urgent cases I have mentioned will be dealt with at an early stage and that so far as possible we shall have standard allowances for all those entitled to benefit whether they live in Donegal, Meath, Mayo or Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill not so much for itself but as an extract from work in progress because I found when I tried to study the complexities of the Bill that I was going back as far as the Public Assistance Act of 1939 and yet was in imagination looking forward to a Government decision on the Devlin Report and to future legislation which would implement many of the recommendations from the reports on the hospital system, child health services, mental illness and <Col N="938" /> mental handicap that are still left untouched.</P>
      <P>In looking forward, I look forward particularly to the day when we will have what the Devlin group so rightly pointed out we lack at present, a general conception of total welfare.  I think that is a very good phrase, &ldquo;a conception of total welfare&rdquo;.  I look forward also to the day when we can say we have done everything within our power to prevent ill-health in our community and, in particular, when we can say we have done everything possible to see that institutional care really is the last resort in the treatment of our aged and handicapped.</P>
      <P>My look at the Bill will be taken in the light of these preconceptions.  I should also like to look at it accepting that larger organisations and administrative units will be necessary in the interests of economy and efficiency in the health services.  While accepting this, I recognise that it is desirable that any health service should be a personal service.  I shall be keen to point out, where I think it relevant, what future developments will help to retain at least the feeling of community service people have regarding the health services, as at present administered through the health authorities, which are largely identified with the local county council administrations.</P>
      <P>Looking at the Bill in this spirit I should like to comment first of all on the structure of the health boards. Speakers on all sides of the House have welcomed the amendments made by the Dáil which now mean that representatives of the local authorities have a majority on the health boards. I accept why these amendments were made.  Speaking as a politician, speaking as a democrat, I fully appreciate that you should not have taxation without representation.  I appreciate also that our electoral system in local government is the time-honoured and established way for the people to express their views on certain matters, but I still wonder whether it is entirely desirable that the major voice on these bodies should be that of the representatives of the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this sounds a bit like heresy from <Col N="939" /> a politician, could I make my point a bit clearer?  In many aspects of our life today there is a lot of general dissatisfaction with our political institutions as an adequate expression of the voice of the people.  We see this particularly in many of the writings and expressions of our young people. Though in a sense one always gets the Government or the representatives one deserves, at times, nevertheless, the people they see in office, whether on local authorities or in government, may not appear to the community to have all the necessary and desirable expertise.</P>
    <P>I find myself in a dilemma.  On the one hand, I respect our political institutions and the role of democracy and, on the other hand, I recognise the genuine criticisms which people can make about the electoral process whether at local or national level.  In local terms, for example&mdash;I do not know if Senator Belton would like to comment on this as we both come from the same area&mdash;in an area like Dún Laoghaire there might be many people who would feel that a representative of one of the very fine voluntary organisations in the area with an interest in health problems, like the Dún Laoghaire Borough Old Folks' Association, would be able to make a better contribution to the deliberations of a health body than many of the representatives of the local authority. I am just suggesting that this is the way many members of the public see it.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest some compromise which, without altering the situation as it is at present proposed&mdash; this structure of the health boards with a majority for local representatives&mdash; would give a better voice to local people, on the health boards, or in the field of local government generally. One idea&mdash;I will just suggest it in general terms; it is a concept which we will hear a lot more about in the future and which will have a lot more support&mdash;is the idea of local community consultative councils.  These can be recognised and approved by local authorities, I understand, under the Local Government Acts, 1941 and 1955. <Col N="940" /> A local community consultative council could bring together all the forces of the voluntary organisations in an area with health and other interests and could play quite a role in advising the local elected representatives on health matters.</P>
    <P>On the same point&mdash;and I should like to inquire if my reading of the Bill is correct on this&mdash;do I understand that the local authority, when electing a representative either to a local committee or to a health board, can elect only a member of that local authority? If that is the case it is a pity.  Why cannot a local authority have power to elect any member of the community in that area?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a realistic view, but I have a great belief in the implicit goodness of man.  I think that goodness will &ldquo;out&rdquo; if only we have structures to encourage people to be good and to express a bit of idealism. Even if initially it means nothing in practice, it is a gesture which is well worth making.  It should at least be put up to the local authorities that, when looking around for members to elect to local committees or to health boards, if they feel that in their midst they may not have perhaps the same expertise as some well-known figure, who is working in a voluntary capacity in an organisation doing good work, they may at least consider electing that person to go forward to represent the community on the local committee or the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to move on now in much the same spirit to the sanctions in the Bill dealing with officers and servants.  There is quite a bit about the appointment of the chief executive officer of these regional health boards. I understand the terms and conditions will be decided jointly by consultation between the Minister and the Local Appointments Commission.  There is <Col N="941" /> one point I should like to make which is, I think, in the spirit of the Devlin group report and also in the spirit of progressive thinking in this field generally.  It is important that these posts of chief executive officer should be open to competition from people outside as well as inside the existing local government service.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more to-ing and fro-ing between industry and commerce and local authority services so that we could have an exchange of managerial and administrative skills. When the conditions of appointment are laid down the possibility of someone from outside the local authority service being appointed should be left open.</P>
    <P>Again, it seems to me that an officer who wishes to leave his post temporarily will have the task of finding a locum to replace him during that period.  I have experience of this from the point of view of the attitude of school managers; it is up to the teacher to find a locum when he is away.  I do not think that is a good idea.  If we have planned personnel administration it should be the responsibility of the chief executive officer to deal with this type of situation.  There should be a constant watch kept and people should be encouraged to leave their posts from time to time to attend courses of study, or whatever it may be, in order to encourage career development in their sphere of work.</P>
    <P>Again, the chief executive officer will be open to surcharge and the work of the health authorities will be subject to Local Government audit in the same way as it is at present.  One often hears what seems to be justifiable complaints from those working in local authorities that this practice of surcharge and audit exercises a constraining influence on genuine initiative. Some relaxation in this respect might be desirable in the working out of administrative details.  In a health service it is desirable there should be as much flexibility as possible.  Those administering the service should not be all the time looking over their shoulders at the Local Government auditor.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that if, at any stage, a chief executive officer has to <Col N="942" /> be removed, there may be a local inquiry.  Similarly, if a hospital is being closed there has to be a local inquiry. Obviously the local inquiry on the removal of a chief executive officer would be somewhat different from the inquiry necessary in regard to the closure of a hospital.  Should there not be a little more detail here describing what is actually meant by a local inquiry in these situations?</P>
    <P>With regard to eligibility for the service, I welcome the clarification of the conditions and the future uniformity of conditions, plus the right of appeal.  These are important advances. Nevertheless, I am somewhat pessimistic in that I recognise that there will continue to be disputes about decisions in particular cases.  Now that there is provision for appeal, it would be very helpful, if, in addition to the normal information leaflets, either the health authorities or the Department would publish leaflets giving case studies on decisions with regard to eligibility and on appeals.  These would, of course, be anonymous, but anyone who felt aggrieved would be able to look at the cases stated and thereby get a better understanding of the workings of this service.</P>
    <P>I recognise that one of the major problems will be that facing the middle income group and those who are above the £1,200 level.  I appreciate that this is a financial problem which will always be a matter of concern, but I should like some information on a point made in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, at page 183.  I may have missed a report on progress since its publication, but we are told that an examination of the feasibility of introducing a contributory scheme to finance part at least of the cost of the service available to the middle income group is almost completed and I would be very interested if the Minister could report further on this and tell us what the results have been.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 58 (2), the explanatory memorandum makes it quite clear that the purpose of this section is to introduce a new scheme for persons with limited eligibility under which they will be entitled to <Col N="943" /> get assistance on drugs, etc.  The cost, or a proportion of it, over and above a fixed amount within a prescribed period will be met by the health board. That is the explanatory memorandum. In the Bill itself I do not think this quite comes across.  It is, of course, one of the provisions I welcome in principle.</P>
    <P>Another point I very much welcome is the provision of home help.  I gather &ldquo;home help&rdquo; is a very basic term, literally meaning help with cooking, cleaning and so on.  Of course, in the background, we have the work of the public health nurses and doctors themselves. In all our health legislation one rarely finds a reference to the role of professional social workers.  Some indication of how drastic the situation is in this country, with regard to the professional social worker, is gained by reading Career Leaflet No. 141 on the Social Worker, which is produced by the Department of Labour.  The child thinking of a career as a social worker is told with regard to the field of the family caseworkers that: &ldquo;Most of the family caseworkers at present work for voluntary organisations&rdquo;.  Where child care and probation are concerned&mdash; and child care is an area we know the Minister is extremely interested in&mdash;we are told: &ldquo;Child Care and Probation are other well-established fields of social work abroad&rdquo;.  This is a sad state of affairs.  I should like to see much more involvement by professional social workers.  I was glad to hear the Minister say in his opening speech in this House that one of the grounds for recommending the larger health regions was because they would make it more economic for the employment of social workers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the news that the home assistance service will be tied into the new health regions.  It is important that there should be close liaison between the health services and the home assistance services.  I also welcome the news that the whole role of home assistance is under review.  It was ironical, when thinking about speaking here today, that I received in the post this morning the news that Séamus Ó Cinnéide's book, &ldquo;A Law for the Poor&rdquo;, which is a study of home <Col N="944" /> assistance in Ireland, is to be published this week.  In the autumn, 1969 edition of <i>Administration</i> Séamus Ó Cinnéide said, in a timely comment which his book will expound: &ldquo;Home Assistance is the last bastion of the Poor Law; Home Assistance recipients will, it seems, be the last to benefit from social change&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to child health I particularly welcome the priorities laid down by the Minister in the Dáil Committee Stage, on 3rd December, 1969.  At column 274, volume 243, of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that my own priorities in regard to the health services are in keeping young children healthy by the development of the child health service and in looking after the old people and mentally-handicapped people, particularly, the mentally-handicapped people.</P>
    <P>Those are fine priorities and I wish the Minister well in this work.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the link up of social problems and health problems. It was suggested in the Devlin Report that the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare be merged.  I welcome this proposal and look forward, for example, to the day when the Adoption Board will be reporting to the Department of Health instead of to the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Whilst the provisions in existing organised social welfare legislation may seem to be extremely generous, in practice they may not mean a great deal because of the non-availability of funds.  If we are really serious about reducing the amount of institutionalised treatment, and I am certain the Minister is, we must spend money building up our strengths in areas like social work and the information service which Senator Jessop talked about.  We cannot hope to keep people out of hospital until they know what services are available and until we have field workers to bring these services to their homes.  In times of financial difficulties the irony is that services like the information service and the employment of social workers are usually the services which are pruned.  One of the <Col N="945" /> few decreases in the current Health Estimate was a decrease of £1,000 in expenditure for the dissemination of information on health and health services.  If we really want to keep people out of institutions we must advertise the services available to them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill generally.  I look forward to the future legislation, which will bring in many of the fine things already in the pipeline.  I hope in administrative terms future legislation will also bring in procedures which will further the spirit of the Devlin Report.  I join with Senator Ryan in looking forward to the day when we will have a consolidated Bill which will be a health code or charter for the community because certainly it is an extremely difficult task for anyone coming to study health legislation as it is at present to find his way through the jungle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to set a good example by being rather brief. A great deal of detail can be gone into during Committee Stage.  At the outset I wish to congratulate the Minister on the work he has put into the Department of Health since taking over and on the very patient and cooperative approach he has adopted to this very important reorganisation of our health services.  My only hope and wish is that he will be left in the Department to see this through&mdash;that there will not be any other calls on his services from another Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been impressed by the way the Minister has quieted down the turmoil that has surrounded health in this country for many years.  He has cleared up many of the misunderstandings and misapprehensions that were prevalent in former years.  The general tone in this debate so far, and the general feeling abroad, is that the Minister can be assured of the cooperation <Col N="947" /> of all in his efforts to make a success of this reorganisation.</P>
    <P>Health is something that touches all of us very intimately.  We all share the concern to make available the best facilities possible to all, but we must equally be realistic and appreciate that this costs a great deal of money. We have got to face up to financing: we must all the time be conscious of the fact that we cannot provide as much as we should like to because of considerations of finance and shortage of skilled personnel.  We can always go on improving and having our goal continually set for the future.</P>
    <P>Regionalisation is certainly overdue because no longer can administration on a county basis serve our needs. Therefore, the division of the country into eight regions would seem to be a fair arrangement and there should not be any real geographical difficulties. However, it is a very big undertaking and the amount of money involved at present, between contributions by the Central Fund, by rates, by voluntary bodies and so on, must be somewhere in the region of £100 million a year. Consequently, the administration of this is a major undertaking and I welcome the initiative of the Minister in this Bill in selecting the chief executive officers for those regions even before the setting up of the regions concerned and, if necessary, sending these CEOs away for training.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is as it should be because hospital administration has become very specialised.  Especially in the United States, there are many excellent courses available that profitably could be taken by future administrators here.  On this matter, however, I suggest that the Minister does not go far enough.  I do not think it is sufficient to pick merely the No. 1 man in each area.  The second line are even more important still because they in their way carry much greater specialisation than the CEOs in the different areas, whether it be responsibility for engineering or the other main subdivisions of the health boards.  I would suggest, then, that the Minister should adopt a very flexible approach to this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> It may not be possible or even desirable to pre-empt these posts below CEO level but certainly training grants should be made available on a very substantial scale to suitably selected persons who are anxious to train themselves for consideration for these posts. Young graduates of two to five years standing might be interested in taking up a career in hospital administration. Provision should be made now to give them the necessary scholarships to enable them to go to, say, the United States of America, to England or elsewhere in order to get the necessary training.  Then they would be suitable for consideration for these posts.</P>
    <P>On a lower level still, the Minister would do well to approach the university authorities about the provision of graduate diploma courses in hospital administration.  In future, hospital administration will be quite different from what it has been in the past. Hospital administration will draw much more heavily on the skills of management, operations research, and all the rest.  It will become increasingly involved with the computer.  It is desirable, therefore, that there should be the necessary training background. It is a type of training for which a diploma could be provided.  It probably would take two years for graduates from various streams, the commerce stream, the engineering stream, to gain the diploma.  Some qualified medicals might wish to take the diploma.  The need for the diploma exists.  The Minister might consult the Higher Education Authority in regard to the provision of the diploma or, alternatively, he might make direct approach to some of the university centres with a view to establishing the diploma.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the past, a great deal of hospital administration has been bedevilled by a clash between the professionals and the non-professional administrators.  Only three days ago I was speaking to a resident medical superintendent of a large hospital.  I was shocked by the picture he painted of the idea of administration possessed by some of those in high positions in the health authority. Apparently they had no hesitation in <Col N="949" /> going right through his line of authority and contacting people in his hospital in any way they wished without his knowledge or without going through him.  In modern administration that should not happen.  He had often heard secondhand about happenings in the hospital in connection with appointments.  He had heard about them from others before he was officially communicated with.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to clear the channels of communication in his investigations into proper administration.</P>
    <P>We must look to the future.  With increased opportunity for university education these administrative posts will be filled by persons who have a basic university degree.  Otherwise, why are we encouraging university education on the scale on which it is being encouraged?  The graduate has a very distinct contribution to make, especially in dealing with professional people and, above all, in dealing with the medical profession. Very often there is a great deal of misunderstanding in communications.  If the Minister could persuade persons with medical education and with a talent for administration to go to the States and to take a two year course in hospital administration he would have the ideal type of CEO for these health districts.</P>
    <P>On the question of specialisation, the Minister has mentioned the scarcities involved and the necessity to conserve specialists.  I fully agree with conservation and with the proposal made by the Minister.  I would, however, suggest that in the recruitment of specialists we have been a little too orthodox in our approach in that we define a specialist, largely, as a man who has a particular training or speciality at the time at which we want him, whereas in an economy like ours, in a situation where there is change, we should be eager to get persons to specialise, to go away to study and acquire a qualification.</P>
    <P>If radiologists are not available in sufficient numbers I would suggest to the Minister that it is a case, again, for going along and saying that we want to give six, eight or ten attractive fellowships that will appeal to existing people who are already in pretty good <Col N="950" /> positions to change their line of work and become qualified as radiologists. The same approach should apply to any other specialisation.  The graduates are there, they are people with a fundamental training and they are available in most positions.  What is missing in many cases is anticipation of demand in various specialist areas.  I suggest that we can solve that simply by selecting and sending abroad.</P>
    <P>Again, a speciality which the Minister will require very much in this matter in the future is aid to medicine by the computer, whether for storage of case histories or statistics, data, etc. This is a very rapidly developing side of medicine, in fact in America you are almost completely handed over to the computer in many instances.  I suggest that this is something we should act on quickly because we are going to have to move with this as well.  Again the question is one of having people trained on the medical side of computer usage and it is a very important one.  Indeed in connection with the three regional hospital boards in each of those areas Dublin, Galway and Cork we have computer facilities based on the universities.  It would be a very profitable and long-sighted act by the Minister to make available in each of those centres sufficient to appoint to the computer centre in those places one research officer to develop and investigate and get established locally the use of the computer in the medical problems of the area.  The cost at most would be a few thousand pounds in each area, yet if this is done, and done pretty soon, the computer capacity is there at least for the experimental stage and it can be experimentally used, with certain of the hospitals in the area and the necessary knowledge for more widespread usage can be built up.</P>
    <P>Speaking for Cork, I know that the computer centre at the university there would be very happy to co-operate in that work, but the plain fact at the moment is that their very meagre resources in the computer centre are already strained beyond breaking point with our immediate problems of servicing the university departments concerned, and therefore <Col N="951" /> I would say that nothing short of having one well qualified man completely designated as research officer in the application of the computer in medicine would really achieve quick results.  I would therefore commend this to the Minister for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in the Minister's introduction and also in his provision for Comhairle na nOspidéal and the health boards recognition is given of the work done by the voluntary hospitals and of the great contribution they have made.  We can never be too grateful to the voluntary hospitals and the voluntary educational bodies for what they have contributed to our country at a time when finance was scarce and the idea of the State getting more actively involved in those areas was not operative.  Now in the development for the future we should see these in as active members.  I think that nobody need worry about the fact that the voluntary hospitals are going to take over the country or anything like that.  The statistics show at the moment that they cater for 44 per cent, and this is a declining percentage, due largely to the expensive equipment and the fact that the recruitment of members for orders and so on is posing further difficulties.  All this means that there is going to be a gradual decline in the amount that will be done by voluntary hospitals in the future, but the amount that they are going to do is really very important, both because of what it provides and also the type of somewhat different service or approach compared with the public run hospital.  There will be a difference of approach, and that is all to the good.  Each will learn from the other.  By and large the voluntary hospitals tend to be more personal in their approach, and again that is very good.  I would suggest that just as in every other field we have recognised that we have here a mixed economy, neither socialist nor capitalist, in so far as education, industry and so on are concerned, and that we should encourage and promote partnership so that the voluntary or private sector does what it can and the State complements or supplements it where <Col N="952" /> necessary, the same thing, I hope, will characterise and mark the Seventies in the evolution of this Health Act.</P>
    <P>Above all in the representation on the various boards I think that the Minister should see that those voluntary groups are adequately represented. I share Senator Keery's questioning of the percentage on the health boards, that more than half should be elected directly by the local authorities.  I think that the other half would provide for election of medical groups, by nominations by the Minister and so on.  I have a feeling that a half is going too far and I think that one-third would probably be more reasonable, especially as the main claim in the past by the local authorities to be represented was the fact that the financing was so dependent on the rates.  Now there is a shift away from financing by the rates and that shift will become much more marked in the decade coming; in fact I would suggest to the Minister to do the bold thing right now and cut the financing from the rates.  I would be realistic about it in so far as rather than cutting completely we should freeze it at its present level of contribution or else freeze at the present level of contribution as a basis with a sliding scale that would be applied nationally.  The sliding scale need be no more than taking account of the depreciation in money values. Thereby you would ensure that all the wrangling that is bound to arise as to whether the rates should be increased by this extra amount to provide those extra services would no longer be needed.  That is a type of arid controversy which we should seek to avoid.  After all, whether you provide the money from the rates or from central taxation, it is coming from the taxpayers in any case.  This would lead to much cleaner administration and the removal of needless controversies, if some formula could be worked out that would rule out in the future any discretion at county level as to the amount that the rates have to pay for the health services.</P>
    <P>Membership of those boards, especially health boards covering an area, is a very specialised task and therefore it should be something much more <Col N="953" /> than the undoubted good service that local representatives have given in the past.  It is now removed that much further from the local scene and consequently, as the Minister indicated in his opening speech, the board should be prepared to allow the running of affairs to the officials.  They are becoming more policy-minded; they are moving up a stage and there is a logical case for more specialised representation so that each member of the board will be seen to be capable of contributing not merely to the health problems of his own district but to the development of a health system for a region of three or four counties which requires a totally different approach and much bigger thinking.</P>
    <P>The other necessity for the local knowledge and the intimate link with the people would surely be better met in the subsidiary local committees that the Minister envisages the health boards having in the various areas.  I share Senator Keery's fear that the Minister has gone too far both in taking over past ideas of representation and in yielding too much to pressure for a democracy that does not altogether fit in with the best functioning of health boards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the efforts by the Minister in the Bill to ensure that local authority representations will be proportionate. Where each member is elected by a quota of the council it means that each section in the council will have its representation on the health board and there will be no case in which because one party or another controls the council an undue proportion of places on the health board are taken by such a party.  This is a worthwhile provision and I hope it will be followed in regard to representation on other boards.</P>
    <P>I think the provision whereby GPs can be admitted to local hospitals on the lines suggested in the FitzGerald Report is good and long overdue.  I have often felt there was too much of the closed shop element in the medical approach to the question of who in the profession had the right to enter hospitals. Admittedly, this is at the lower level of hospitals but it is still a step <Col N="954" /> in the right direction.  I can see the Minister's concern about the provision for a proper coverage of GPs throughout the country especially in remote areas.  Undoubtedly, inducements will have to be given but the main thing necessary is to try to organise the provision of these services in a twentieth century manner.  We no longer can have a situation in which one man is on call 24 hours a day.  A panel system is overdue whereby you have three, four or five members with regular hours and, consequently, a doctor available at all times.  This is beginning to operate in the cities and is doing quite well.  The Minister should encourage this as much as possible.  It is the only way to make life tolerable for GPs and at the same time ensure that for any really serious cases medical advice is available 24 hours a day.  That is a real step forward.</P>
    <P>The provision of home nursing and home help is very well worthwhile but, as envisaged, I think it is largely intended for those qualifying for free services.  The need in all the other income groups is just as great but they are quite prepared to pay for the service provided they get it.  The paradox of the modern affluent society is that things that really make life pleasant such as provision of home help in case of sickness or when otherwise required such as at the time of having children and so on are far less available than they were 30 or 40 years ago.  This service is something that, perhaps, will require to be organised on some kind of co-operative basis.  Paying for it is never a problem; it is a matter of getting suitably trained people for the service.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that services made available for the homes of those qualifying for free treatment should also be made available to all who need such services but on the basis of paying an appropriate fee.  Not alone will that give an excellent service to those in the paying category but it will demonstrate that the same service is available to rich and poor alike.  It is the quality of the service and not who pays for it that really matters.</P>
    <P>Help through local community efforts should be stimulated.  We find <Col N="955" /> local voluntary groups making great efforts to help old people, for instance, by means of meals on wheels, holidays and so on.  Very often these efforts are hampered by lack of funds.  Could funds be made more easily available to such voluntary groups while at the same time calling for the maximum voluntary help from the community?</P>
    <P>We are dealing with the most expensive side of living in the health services and consequently we have a right to look for economy and efficiency. The key is provided by the medical schools turning out well-trained graduates equipped to deal with the community, providing refresher courses and everything else required.  Under the present system of financing of our schools a great deal is left to be desired and I ask the Minister to take some interim steps to try to increase facilities.  Above all, I appeal to the Minister to look at the whole question of medical education and our involvement in it in the context of the world and examine how far we in this country can get into the medical training business for the world as a whole, whether in the training of medical personnel for the ordinary medical functions or training for the hospital administrators I have mentioned or for any one of the myriad skills that are required in the administration of a health service.</P>
    <P>How far can we go to get into that industry?  I use the word &ldquo;industry&rdquo; deliberately because this is something that is required and will always be required by the world at large, and they are prepared to pay for it.  I believe that when we have sufficient people trained for ourselves, there is unlimited scope for training people for other nations, on a strictly commercial basis.  We have the example of the College of Surgeons doing that here in Dublin and doing it very successfully. The other facets of a modern health service can probably be approached in the same way.  Let us see how far we can go.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for the Minister's imagination.  I know he is capable of envisaging the day when we are really in the export business in this field.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> Most of the other points can be left to Committee Stage.  It is more satisfactory when we can have question and answer and when we can really tease out the problems.  The success of this service will be ensured if the Minister can avoid local &ldquo;wrangling about increases in rates due to this amalgamation. He can do that only by working out some formula or scale that will make the local contributions completely mandatory, and decided on a national basis.  If this can be worked out, we will get away from looking at it on a county basis.  We will get away from feeling in one county that we are paying through the nose for a huge establishment in another county.  We will get away from that parochialism. The Minister has his remedy if he puts the rates contribution on a mandatory basis.</P>

      <P>First I should like to deal with the boards and particularly with the remarks made earlier by my colleague, Senator Keery.

He has been with us for a few months only but, when we send him to a few by-elections in Dingle, Galway, West Donegal and Cork, we feel we will be able to knock some of those ideas out of his head, and he will return convinced that public representatives have a very important and responsible part to play in the running of boards of this kind.</P>

      <P>I am not certain what their representation is.  Any member of a local authority or a committee who has a financial interest in any debate by that authority or committee is obliged to disclose his interest and leave the meeting.  This is a very important regulation and unnecessary trouble could be caused if it were not there.  Here we are to have on the regional boards men who have a definite financial interest in the discussions that might take place, men who have a definite stake in them.  If they are to be given this representation there should be a regulation that when a subject of financial interest is being discussed they are precluded from voting on it.</P>
      <P>Earlier on I said I do not think this Bill goes far enough.  There is nothing in it to prevent abuse in the Irish medical service as we know it.  I should like to discuss local authority hospitals in particular.  We are told that the local authority hospital caters for people in the lower income group and people in the middle income group, but there is no obligation on that hospital to cater for anyone in the higher income group.  This was a statement made by my county manager some seven or eight years ago in reply to a query at a meeting of Donegal County Council. From that one would get the impression that the people in the two groups mentioned are the people who benefit most from the local authority hospitals. But that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien told us earlier today that we still had the three groups and I believe that, so long as we have them, we are encouraging class distinction. We are encouraging snobbery and we are encouraging wholesale exploitation by the Irish medical service.  I speak as a representative of Donegal County Council who, down the years, <Col N="959" /> since the building of a county hospital in my county, has fought to prevent such exploitation in my county.  There is only one solution to the problem: there must be no private beds in local authority hospitals.  No specialist should be allowed to have private rooms, or private beds, in his hospital. Until we reach the day when specialists are paid a salary and are not dependent on private patients then, and only then, will we be in a position to say that we have a fair medical service. Until we reach the day at which everyone who enters a hospital, be he rich or poor, is treated in the same way then, and only then, will we have a fair medical service.  I know that such a service would be very expensive.  I do not know how it could be provided, but I hope that the day is not far distant when we will have a free medical service for all.  By not having a free medical service for all, by making the rich pay, one might imagine that we are giving the advantage to the poor. That is certainly not the case in some of our local authority hospitals.  By making the rich pay we are giving the advantage to the rich and the poor are suffering.</P>
    <P>The Minister may recall my drawing his attention to this when he visited my county.  In Donegal we have a situation&mdash;I am sure the same situation obtains throughout the country&mdash;in which a medical card holder who wishes to avail of a clinical service is placed on a waiting list for two, three or four months.  There is evidence of this in my county.  I am quite sure there is evidence of it throughout the country.  On the other hand, if a patient wishes to see a specialist in a private capacity an appointment can be arranged within one week.  Is that a just system?  Can we do anything to prevent it?  How often have our dispensary doctors told their patients, particularly those in the middle-income group: &ldquo;If you want your operation immediately you should go in as a private patient.  If you do not want it immediately you may have to wait a few months for it&rdquo;.  That is the advice, provided, of course, that the operation is neither urgent nor dangerous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> This is a serious situation.  It is one which has not been tackled.  It must be tackled.  When the Minister's predecessor toured the various county councils and spoke at public county council meetings on this matter he summed up the position by saying: &ldquo;Let us face it.  The £ still works&rdquo;. There is only one way of solving this problem; that is by treating everyone the same.  We have in our hospitals private patients who benefit by better food, nicer, daintier trays and better quality cutlery and china.  The public patient does not receive the same amenities.  Because of that we are encouraging a society of snobs.  We are certainly encouraging class distinction. I know many people in the middle-income group who could not afford to be private patients but who feel their neighbours would talk if they were to go into a public ward.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view that a physician, a surgeon or a gynaecologist should have the benefit of a room built by the ratepayers and taxpayers for the accommodation of his private patients.  I do not subscribe to the view that such patients should be fed by the staffs employed by the county council, tended by nurses employed by the county council.  Above all, I do not subscribe to the view that these patients should receive priority at all times in county hospitals.  Some may say that the number of specialists who would indulge in practices of this kind is small.  I hope it is very small.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to table a motion at a meeting of Donegal County Council seven or eight years ago on this matter and when I handed that motion to an official of the county council, he said: &ldquo;Thanks be to God that someone at last is raising this matter&rdquo;.  It is too bad, to say the least of it, that the first question a patient is asked when he goes into hospital is what his income is and the first decision to be made is whether or not he pays.  The county physician in Donegal stated on oath in a court of law: &ldquo;One generally treats one's private patients oneself. One generally treats one's public patients through one's house surgeon&rdquo;. The physician sued for fees because the defendant refused to pay in the <Col N="961" /> belief that the physician was charging too much.  That was the opinion of a specialist who could quite easily be a member of the regional board in the Donegal/Sligo/Leitrim area.</P>
    <P>The ratepayers and taxpayers are providing hospitals for specialists, one of whom stated under oath that, if you can pay, he will treat you; if you cannot pay, his house surgeon will treat you.  That was published in the local papers.  This kind of practice cannot but lead to many abuses.  I remember a colleague of mine in Donegal who complained that an old age pensioner was treated and charged as a private patient.  The county manager maintained that he had signed the form indicating that he wished to be treated as a private patient.  An investigation took place and, as a result of that investigation, it was found that the old age pensioner had something wrong with his hand; he had not written for years and the form was signed by one of the nurses, at the behest of the specialist, because it was thought the old age pensioner had a bit of money.</P>
    <P>Two years ago a doctor in Derry, whose practice is on the Donegal border, told me he had to send his Donegal patients to the County Hospital in Letterkenny.  He was often amazed, having sent some most interesting medical cases to the specialist there&mdash;cases which any specialist would give his right eye to get&mdash;to receive an acknowledgment of the case, the first line of which would read: &ldquo;Can this man pay?&rdquo;  I know it is difficult but I should like to see this sort of abuse stopped.  The vast majority of the medical profession will put the interests of the patients first but it is the few exceptions who can cause trouble.  Anyone earning over £1,200 today must pay through the nose for his medical expenses, yet these people, through the rates they pay, are already contributing a large proportion of money.</P>
    <P>Up until now an X-Ray cost anyone earning under £1,200, 7/6.  The charge has been dispensed with in this Bill. I know of someone earning over £1,200 who paid £6 16s for an X-Ray this week.  That person may only be earning £1,250 but still he must pay. <Col N="962" /> Admittedly, he only looked for the X-Ray one week ago and because he was a private patient he was able to get that X-Ray within the week.  I know of people in Donegal who have been waiting two months for X-Rays and they will wait on because they are not paying a specialist.</P>
    <P>I hope the day when there will be no private beds in local authority hospitals is not too far distant.  If a consultant wishes to provide private beds let him do so in private nursing homes and, if necessary, let the State assist him to provide them.  We are codding ourselves that we are really catering for the medical card holders. If two people have the same complaint and require an operation or need treatment under a physician in a local authority hospital and one is a medical card holder and the other is in the higher income group and prepared to pay privately, which of the two will get that bed?  It has certainly been my experience that the man who is prepared to pay, and pay well, will get priority in every case.</P>
    <P>I recall the case of a man living five miles from a county hospital who had an appendicitis.  He was refused admission to the county hospital in Letterkenny.  He had to be driven, even pushed through the snow in the Barnesmore Gap, in order to get to the Shiel Hospital forty miles away in Ballyshannon. Yet, in the county hospital in Letterkenny there were four private rooms for each specialist and still a man with a burst appendix had to be pushed through the snow.  Until we treat everyone the same, until we make the medical service available to rich and poor alike, until we do away with private beds in county hospitals to my mind we will never have a fair medical service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in paying tribute to the Minister for the very co-operative and helpful way he has met the various groups of public representatives during the regional conferences he held throughout the country.  I should like to pay him personal tribute for the very patient way he dealt with the many points put forward at the meeting of the mid-western regional <Col N="963" /> group at Nenagh a few weeks ago.  The Minister has indicated to all of us that he is prepared to co-operate fully and deal sympathetically with helpful and constructive suggestions put forward by public representatives and in this regard we all wish to pay him tribute for showing a degree of flexibility that is not always associated with a Minister for State.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, and certainly from the speeches that have been made so far today, Members of the Seanad appear to be in agreement with the proposed outline for a health service in this country under the terms of the Health Bill, 1969.  Certainly, I support the general outline.  I think it is reasonable to divide the country into eight regions.  There may possibly be some criticism on the grounds that the population between, say, the smallest areas with fewer than 200,000 and the largest area, the Eastern Health Board, with almost one million.  These differences are rather wide but on looking at the circumstances in each area I do not think the Minister could have come down with a more suitable solution. In the mid-western area of Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary we have the advantage of being an established grouping for economic development and also for tourism, and as far as we are concerned the proposed set-up under the new Health Bill is very acceptable.  This was indicated by the representatives of all three participating counties and the Limerick Corporation, irrespective of political affiliations.</P>
      <P>Health services can be divided into three categories&mdash;prevention, cure and rehabilitation.  This Bill deals fairly adequately with the cure and rehabilitation of patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I suggest to the Minister that more emphasis, particularly in regard to one factor about which I propose to speak at some length, should have been laid on the preventive side of medicine.  As the Minister pointed out in his introductory statement, the cost of specialisation accounts for 75 per cent of the total health charges in the country, which is a very substantial amount.  The smallest <Col N="964" /> charge and the one that has given the greatest results at the lowest cost is that appertaining to preventive services. We can all boast with considerable pride that successive administrations and successive Ministers for Health have succeeded in eliminating certain sources of illness, and in some cases death, amongst our people in past years such as diphtheria and polio and to a very considerable extent tuberculosis. These have been eliminated under the policy of preventing disease rather than curing it and rehabilitating the patient afterwards.  More emphasis and more money might be directed towards preventing illness rather than spending money on curing it and rehabilitating the patient afterwards.  In this regard I should like to pay tribute to the district nursing service which I regard as one of the very successful services under the health services.  The fact that that service is going to be extended is a very worthwhile step.</P>
    <P>The question of financing the services has been touched on by almost every speaker and indeed the Minister heard many comments on the matter from the various local authorities he visited.  This Bill proposes that the State will make a minimum contribution of 50 per cent and this will be supplemented thereafter by a sum to be decided on by the Minister.  I did make the point, and it is worth reiterating it, that having regard to the fact that the realistic State contribution is in excess of 50 per cent&mdash;it is 55 per cent or 56 per cent&mdash;and that the declared intention of the Government is not to call on the ratepayers to carry a larger burden, a start might be made in this Bill towards transferring the greater proportion of the health charges from local to central funds.  In other words, instead of the figure of 50 per cent which the Minister has written in, a figure of 55 per cent at least, which is the present minimum figure, should be written into the Bill.  The Minister did not accept that and I do not know whether he has had second thoughts about it, but it would be an indication of the Government's feeling that the rates are no longer a suitable means by which to get the health charges, if he did this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> Those of us who are members of local authorities will admit that unless something can be done to reduce the health charges there is no possible way open for reducing or even controlling the huge and rising burden of rates in every local authority.  I should like also to touch on this proposal to sever public assistance from the public health service.  Under the present system of health boards, such as we have in Limerick, public assistance is administered by the officials of the health board and it is now proposed that public assistance will revert to the county councils or corporations as the case may be.  I understand that to some extent the Minister has met this point by agreeing that public assistance will be administered by the new health boards but financed entirely by the contributing authorities.  It is very difficult to draw a line of demarcation between public assistance and public health and I should like the Minister to have another look at the question of financing public assistance through the new health boards.</P>
    <P>After an illness there is a period during which the person requires rehabilitation and that rehabilitation must be provided in various ways, such as by medicines, but also by some form of monetary assistance.  For this reason you cannot divorce public assistance from public health.  The two, in my view and in the view of other public representatives, should form a single service and be financed from the same source.  It may only require some adjustment of the contribution made by the State but I do not think it would be outside the competence of our public officials to find such a means.  Although I do contribute to the ideal of having a choice of doctor I must confess to having some doubts in regard to how the matter will work out in certain rural areas.  I know that in theory it would appear to be a desirable solution, and indeed it is, but in practice it may not be possible to work it.  In sparsely populated areas it may not be possible in practice to give a choice of doctor and before changing over completely from the present dispensary doctor system there should be a period of transition to see <Col N="966" /> how the new system is working.  I hope the Minister will allow for this.</P>
    <P>The subject on which I should like to speak in some detail is the very important subject, and one which is growing more important every month, of the efficient supervision of food and drink supplies.  By drink here I mean milk.  The present legislation governing the supply of food and drink is highly complex and that is understandable in view of the fact that the various orders and enactments governing the supervision of food and drink go back to the start of this century.  To take an example: the duties of a whole-time veterinary inspector in a county borough are concerned, amongst other matters, with: public health duties under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, the milk and dairies code which imposes obligations on various sanitary authorities, intercounty arrangements whereby services are supplied by, say, corporation staff to health authorities to ensure the discharge of important duties under the Health Acts and food hygiene regulations by qualified personnel, the Slaughter of Animals Acts which necessitate the supervision of abattoirs by sanitary authorities and the Diseases of Animals Acts.  All of these form part of the general protective health code of the country.  The administration of this complex set of Acts and statutory orders can result in difficulties which include overlapping, lack of efficiency and high costs where control does not rest in a single authority.</P>
    <P>A fair example, and one which probably applies more directly to my own county of Limerick, is the inspection of dairies in rural areas.  These inspections are carried out by two groups of people: (a), veterinary inspectors employed by county councils as sanitary authorities or (b), health inspectors employed by health authorities acting under powers of food hygiene regulations. The end product, milk, sold in adjoining urban areas, is subject to another set of inspection which cannot be reasonably effective except in county boroughs and a few other areas where whole-time veterinary inspectors are employed.  An anomaly arises here because chief veterinary inspectors and <Col N="967" /> chief medical officers, who have serious responsibilities for the health of the community, have not the effective power to remedy unsatisfactory supplies at source.</P>
    <P>It must be appreciated, of course, that legislation governing the supply of milk was introduced when boards of health and public assistance were single authorities dealing with all health and sanitary matters.  In prewar days, the only division of control related to Diseases of Animals Acts whose operation continued to be the responsibility of county councils.  In fact, we have now reached the position where a revision of the old order, without applying the methods of that old order, is called for so that all these various enactments and powers controlling the efficient supervision of food of all kinds, from the producer to the consumer, is necessary.  To ensure its efficient working, it should be administered under the new health boards.</P>
    <P>The responsibility of the health authorities for personal and public health matters has produced a new set of circumstances, and a very strong case now exists for the transfer of inspecting functions and supervisory control of the production of food and drink to the new regional health boards.  In 1935 the Oireachtas made provision for sampling and examination in bacteriological laboratories. The procedure should now be streamlined to ensure that samples effectively can be examined in special laboratories of the health authorities under control directly of the county and city medical officers of health, as the case may be.  In this manner, enforcement of food hygiene regulations could be effectively combined with the administration of Food and Drugs Acts and the milk and dairies code in a single supervisory system.</P>
    <P>If I may suggest to the Minister the outline of the possible type of organisation that I think would fulfil the responsibilities I have outlined during the past few minutes, I should like to suggest that in each regional health board area a chief veterinary officer should be appointed.  At the moment, there are only five chief veterinary <Col N="968" /> officers in the country&mdash;two in Dublin, two in Cork and one in Limerick.  My suggestion would entail increasing these appointments by another eight or ten chief veterinary officers, thereby apart from ensuring an efficient supervisory system of food and milk, opening the way for promotion to young men in this profession.  It entails also the establishment of regional food hygiene laboratories where all food and milk could be tested by qualified personnel; the transfer of functions at present carried out by a section of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries dealing with food hygiene matters and milk inspection, to the Department of Health; the appointment of whole-time county veterinary inspectors to be assisted by part-time officers under the regional health boards; and finally, and most important, the revision of the existing laws relating to food and milk inspection.</P>
    <P>The changing circumstances of our times, to which I have made some reference, necessitate that food regulations, the supervision of all food and milk products, must be brought, of necessity and quickly, up to the highest international standards.  Tourism, our increasing export trade, the provision of faster and bigger aircraft, particularly the jumbo jets, all point to the necessity of ensuring that the quality of our food products will be as high as in any other country, and not only must we do this but we must be seen to have an effective system of supervising the production and distribution of food right down to the consumer.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is no doubt aware, under the Milk and Dairies Acts, milk cannot be inspected in hotels.  Under the proposals which I have put forward, this can become the responsibility of the new health boards, and properly qualified officers would be entitled to call at hotels and have examined milk and food products served to customers generally.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length on this because I feel very strongly on it.  I mentioned it at the conference at Nenagh but the Minister said then that he saw some difficulty because the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries at present have responsibility <Col N="969" /> for some of these services.  However, my feeling is that we are now setting out on a new form of health service structure which offers the present Minister a golden opportunity, perhaps, the last opportunity, of bringing our outmoded health and food hygiene regulations up to date, co-ordinating them and ensuring their efficient operation under a single authority.  The obvious authority to do that, in my view and in the view of most Senators, would be the new health boards.  I hope the Minister will take particular note of this point.  He has shown himself to be receptive to new ideas in regard to all health matters and I should like to think he will give this facet of our health services his sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>From all speakers has come general praise of the Bill now before us and congratulations have been offered to the Minister for his handling of the Bill.  I should like to associate myself with these sentiments. I do not intend to go into detail on the Bill but I should like to repeat what the Minister said in his opening statement to the effect that much more is contained in this Bill than has been suggested here.</P>
      <P>One sweeping change envisaged in the Bill is the disappearance of county boundaries for the first time in the administration of our health services. One can see the advantages of such a change.  From a point of view not connected with health, it will be interesting to see how this proposal works because in any regionalisation scheme that has been introduced up to date county boundaries have been firmly entrenched.  Here we talk of catchment areas rather than county boundaries and this, I think, is a development to be welcomed.  I hope it will be successful.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred a few times in his opening statement to the FitzGerald Report.  Therefore, I feel that I am in order in speaking about this report in so far as it deals with the future structure of the hospitals of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said on the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil&mdash;Volume <Col N="970" /> 242, column 2026 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Obviously, the report needs study and, no doubt, there will be amendments and changes to it.  It is not a sacrosanct report.</P>
    <P>This was a great relief to persons who felt that in a large measure the regulations under this Bill would be centred around the FitzGerald Report.</P>
    <P>The Minister, again at column 2026 of the same volume, said:</P>
    <P>I could comment on certain inadequacies in the FitzGerald Report, not caused deliberately, but caused simply because it was a report prepared by people who did their best to examine the whole hospital situation in the country.  They could not possibly have known all the factors surrounding the hospitals in different places.</P>
    <P>One has now to stop and consider why, then, the committee took it upon themselves to make a report of the nature which they did make, when they were not in full possession of the facts.  As a justification, may I say that we know they were asked to report back in six months whereas one would expect a report of such magnitude would have taken, at a very minimum, two years to complete.  It took two and a half years to examine the general medical service in the highlands and islands of Scotland.  This was a service for approximately 278,000 people.</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree that there are some excellent suggestions in the FitzGerald Report and that some form of regionalisation and centralisation is required to make the most economic use of manpower and of the expensive equipment available.  Indeed, it is a welcome thought that we will have down through the country large hospitals with facilities that perhaps heretofore existed only in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We must however guard against too much specialisation if it is going to be detrimental to large numbers of the rural population.  The hospital plan for Scotland of 1962 advocated the building of ten new hospitals in each of the main areas of population and states that this should reduce the degree of dependence on the regional centres and <Col N="971" />&mdash;something that I would consider very important&mdash;the amount of travelling for patients and their relations.  It also states that there are parts of the country where the population that a hospital can conveniently serve is too small to warrant a district hospital of normal size but where facilities for acute treatment must be provided to avoid travelling.</P>
    <P>The hospital plan for Northern Ireland of 1966 provided for district hospitals in many of the smaller towns. At least as far ahead as can be foreseen these hospitals will continue to provide the basic specialities of general medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology with the addition of other specialities as may be appropriate to the needs of the population and the distance from the main hospital.</P>
    <P>Both of these reports are based on situations which are very similar to the situation which prevails in Ireland. In fact the North of Ireland is part of our own island.  They are diametrically opposed to what is stated in the FitzGerald Report.</P>
    <P>The FitzGerald Report is almost silent on the question of transport, both public and private, and ambulance organisation.  The logistics of the ambulance service have not been worked out.  No matter how sophisticated the service is that may be envisaged&mdash;and it must be sophisticated in the sense of the skills and appliances available to offset the time lag in dealing with emergencies&mdash;there are still the hazards beyond human control of flood, snow and ice, common in our situation.  There is also the hazard of the increasing motorised traffic, the traffic load on roads, particularly at peak tourist and holiday periods and at holiday weekends.  Apart from the type of ambulance and the degree of skill of the crews, the number of ambulances that will be required and the bases that they will need will represent a very big capital outlay.  It would be only reasonable to evaluate and quantify this and to weigh the cost of such a structure against the capital and revenue charges of a simple addition of beds to already existing modern hospitals.</P>
    <P>Here, like every representative, I <Col N="972" /> come to my own neck of the woods, which is Roscommon, where we have a modern hospital, built in 1941, extended in 1953, extended again in 1968, where there are at present 126 beds and where an addition of 74 beds to bring the hospital to 200, and a duplication of the specialities required to make it comparable to what is proposed for Letterkenny, might be a far more feasible proposition than to try to provide the roads, the ambulances and the skills that would be needed if the surgical facilities at Roscommon were to be closed and moved to Galway.  This is something that was not considered by the FitzGerald Report. They did not examine the ambulance situation at all.  I hope that the Minister, before taking any decision on the downgrading not alone of Roscommon hospital but of other modern hospitals, would take this into consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his mention of the mentally handicapped.  Mentally handicapped and mentally retarded children and their parents have not got a very fair deal up to this under our health schemes.  Certainly, mildly or moderately handicapped children are being fairly well provided for, perhaps in a large measure through voluntary effort. The severely mentally handicapped child is not being provided for.  There is a great need for more beds to be provided very, very quickly for this type of child.  I should like to join with Senator McDonald and Senator O'Brien in pleading the cause of these children.  Any public representative will know of cases of extreme hardship where there are children who need care and who cannot gain admission to homes and where there is extreme anguish caused to parents every day of the week.</P>
    <P>I can cite the case of a little boy who is now five years of age and who is the same as he was as an infant. His name was put down very early on in several institutions to try to get him in by the time he was five.  He is now nearly six and his name is 72nd on the list, which means that in the normal course of events he will be 28 years of age before he could be taken in and be hospitalised as he should <Col N="973" /> be.  We did great work when we were trying to eradicate TB and I cannot see any reason why such a drive and effort cannot be made now.  The Minister has expressed himself as being extremely interested in child care.  I feel that when he has this Health Bill through, which of course has occupied a great deal of his thought and time since he became Minister, that he will apply himself with the greatest energy to this and that within 12 months there will be a definite stride forward in this field.</P>
    <P>The Minister, too, is to be congratulated on the speed with which he acted in bringing in a section to deal with drugs.  Those of us who are parents of young children are very worried about this problem.  We know that extensive and good legislation will come in on it later, but I think that coupled with this must come a massive education system, whether it is done by the Department of Health or by the Department of Education or taken up by the press and the radio and television I do not know, or whether it should be a combination of all these things, but it certainly is needed, because this is a growing menace and children and parents must be warned of the dangers.</P>
    <P>It is indeed a very welcome thing&mdash; and I forgot to mention this when mentioning mentally handicapped children and disabled children generally&mdash;that means tests are being abolished, because people who are in the middle income group and the higher income group even have such ghastly bills to meet with regard to long disablement that they find themselves not in the higher or middle income group but very much in the lower income group by the time that they have their bills paid for those people.  It is the same thing with the drugs and medicine that will be provided.  I realise that it is very hard to give everybody everything they want, and this is a step forward, but we have a long way to go if we are to supply the type of service that we would all desire.  But this Bill is certainly going a long way towards providing the ground work for it.</P>
    <P>In the administration of the health <Col N="974" /> boards, I should like to say just a word in support of Senator Keery who I think was misinterpreted by a Senator on our own side here.  Senator Keery was looking for representation of voluntary groups on the boards, and I think that in this he had a very logical point.  As a fairly prominent member of one voluntary organisation I know that the voluntary organisations of this country have a lot to offer and if given a place on those boards they would certainly pull their weight. It is time, I think, that the efforts of the voluntary organisations in the country were recognised in this way.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak about what Senator Quinlan said as he was finishing. He mentioned that he could not see why we should not become the medical school of the world.  I feel that somewhere along the line he must have read something that I had written at one stage on this.  It is one of my pet theories, and I actually wrote at one time, when I was talking about the consumption of butter and the export of our food, that I felt that what we have a need for in this country is to bring people in to eat our food rather than export it and subsidise it for people to eat it abroad. One of the things I did say at that time was that in the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries we were the university of Europe.  I cannot see why, when our Health Act is in operation and we have the marvellous hospitals that will be built under this in the future, we cannot be the university of health for the world.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me congratulate the Minister for his patience and forbearance in sitting listening to yet another criticism of the FitzGerald Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Senators who spoke yesterday said that they would confine themselves to a few remarks because they regard this Bill as basically a Committee Bill.  I have looked over it and obviously it is a Bill which will have to be taken extensively in Committee; but we must appreciate that this is the first time that this Bill has been debated before this new Parliament on its general principles at <Col N="975" /> Second Reading.  I have heard the debate so far and I think that it has been well worthwhile.  We have been discharging our duty in this respect on the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is necessary, in considering an important piece of social legislation of this sort, to speak on the general principles before getting down to the details.  Perhaps the new Dáil were at a slight disadvantage in that they had to take the Bill at the Committee Stage.  Nevertheless, I would agree with those Senators who have already stressed the extent to which the Bill was improved as it went through the Dáil, and I associate myself with the remarks made complimenting the Minister on his willingness to accept amendments, and I also associate myself with the compliments of the last Senator who congratulated him on his stamina in being present here at the debate.  As one who is used to speaking before Parliamentary Secretaries, it is a great pleasure to find oneself speaking in the presence of the Minister concerned.  I should also like to say that, even though there is an obvious value in getting this Bill on the Statute Book in the very near future, I should like this House to be treated as a body which can make a positive contribution and which can put forward further amendments to this Bill which will improve it.  I hope that we will not be regarded as a rubber stamp or that there would not be a priority put on getting it through the House, but rather that we should be enabled to make a constructive contribution.</P>
      <P>Looking through it in my relative inexperience of medical matters, but with some experience of looking through legislation, I can see already a number of matters which might be improved and a number of amendments which could be put in.  I hope that they will be treated in the same spirit as the Minister showed in the Lower House and that he will not try to confine himself to the Bill as passed by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having made these general remarks I should now like to turn to the Bill itself, which I regard as an extremely important piece of social legislation which will determine the future of <Col N="976" /> health services in this country for the next decades.  The first point is that, as has already been noted by some speakers, the provisions of the Bill are largely based on the FitzGerald Report. This was a report of the Consultative Council on the General Hospital Services, which reported to the Minister in June, 1968.  I wish to ask an important question: whether this report had its priorities right in providing health services for this country, because to me the first priority is the people of Ireland.  Looking at the composition of this FitzGerald Commission, there were 18 members, of whom ten were Dublin-based and eight were from around the country, four of them county officials associated with the medical schools in Cork or Galway. It is noticeable that a commission reporting on the health services of this country had no medical practitioner representative.  I find that rather a narrow basis, and it may be responsible for the fact that there is a certain concentration on what I would regard as important matters but not necessarily the first priorities, such as the future of the teaching hospitals in this country and future specialisation.</P>
    <P>In my view, where there is regionalisation&mdash;and I would agree that in theory regionalisation can be helpful in the employment of facilities&mdash;the rationalisation of priorities must not be to improve either teaching facilities or specialisation at the cost of depriving people around the country of a lifesaving type of medicine.  I do not want to exaggerate this point but, since the Bill is largely based on the FitzGerald Report, it may be presumed that its guideline will be followed to some extent.  Map 3 on page 37 of the report sets out 12 general hospitals as well as regional hospitals.  All other hospitals in the country will presumably be diverted to other purposes such as geriatric homes, mental institutions and so on.  The point made in the FitzGerald Report is that, except for a few areas of Donegal, Mayo, Clare and the south of Kerry none of these general hospitals will be more than 60 miles from the people of any county. In commenting on this structure members of the Commission stressed that <Col N="977" /> with the increased improvement of roads <i>et cetera</i> these journeys will no longer be a problem.  I happen to know from my own experience, having a father who is a general practitioner, that there is already a problem when the nearest general hospital is 30 miles away if there is a serious accident. The first quarter of an hour is often the time that determines whether a person's life or limb can be saved. Further&mdash;and this is an extremely important factor&mdash;there is no likelihood in the near future that we can have the type of ambulance service that would be necessary to make 60 miles a viable distance in order to save life.  The type of injury we are discussing is that arising from road traffic accidents often of a very severe nature, involving head injuries or accidents with heavy agricultural machinery.  Looking at the turnover in general hospitals throughout the country, it is easy statistically to prove that these hospitals have an enormous turnover in the fields of general medicine, general surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, a much wider turnover than many of the larger teaching hospitals in Dublin in strict surgery cases where it is a matter of saving a life or a limb.</P>
    <P>This is one of the points I am making.  Has there been a tendency to think in terms of administration, in terms of teaching hospitals and specialisation rather than of ensuring the first priority that the people of Ireland, including the people of rural Ireland, will continue to get the necessary lifesaving hospital service they must have?  I stress this point because I know from various contacts in the country that there is a general fear in rural areas that they will be deprived of hospitals within such a distance that if they suffer either a serious accident or serious disease they will be able to reach a hospital in time to save life. I know that this is the awful problem bothering many medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>One problem which I do not think will arise is that which Senator Jessop mentioned.  He may have overlooked the statement of the previous Minister, Deputy Flanagan, who introduced the Bill in the previous Dáil regarding the possibility of a clash between the dispensary <Col N="978" /> services and the new provisions. I quote from his statement at that time: &ldquo;Within the general framework of policy, however, the Bill proposes a number of important changes. The most notable of these is the intention as expressed in section 56 to replace the dispensary service with a service offering choice of doctor in the general medical service for the lower income group....&rdquo;  We have already had praise of this improvement in the system but as I read it&mdash;and I would ask the Minister to clarify this completely in his reply&mdash;the old dispensary system will no longer operate and that it is hoped to have general medical service giving a choice of doctor to which existing permanent dispensary doctors and also general practitioners throughout the country will belong through a panel and that the number will be restricted.</P>
    <P>One of the things I noted in reading the Bill is that nowhere in the Bill is there a guarantee of security of payments or that the present position of the permanent dispensary doctor will remain the same and that they will not be at a loss.  In his explanatory statement the Minister said that agreement has been reached on most points of the new arrangements in relation to medical service and he said it had been agreed also that a special guarantee in relation to entering the new health service will be given to those permanently established dispensary doctors and presumably the same type of guarantee will be given to any type of medical practitioner, not a dispensary doctor, who joins the scheme.  My point is that this is not something that should be left to ministerial regulation.  The principle should be contained in the Bill but it is not; certainly, I could not find it there.  The implementation of this measure may very well be carried out by regulations but the principle should be in the Bill because you there confer a definite right on dispensary doctors.</P>
    <P>I raise this point because I know from my own experience&mdash;again I dissociate myself from Senator Jessop's praise of the existing system which I know is not working very well&mdash;that in the area from which I come in Mayo&mdash;I think it is the same in many <Col N="979" /> other areas&mdash;there is a shortage of dispensary doctors.  Many of the posts that are filled are filled on a temporary basis because they cannot get permanent staff.  When we talk of priorities, I think the first priority in health legislation as comprehensive as this should be the people of Ireland and I submit that the second priority is the doctor. I have heard it said many times in academic circles that we tend to educate too many doctors and that we educate doctors for export, that the State is contributing a large measure of finance to the training of young doctors and such a large percentage of them go abroad to work either as practitioners or to specialise.  The tragic counterpart of that is the great shortage of doctors, either dispensary doctors who will be the new doctors taking over the new health services or general practitioners.  That is the tragedy for this country.  We are perpetrating that tragedy and, perhaps, increasing it if we do not give basic guarantees that there will be no loss to the permanent dispensary doctor in joining the new scheme and if possible that his remuneration will be improved.  It is my opinion that dispensary doctors and GPs in this country are not paid in proportion to the work they are expected to do.  I noted that it is hoped to encourage group practice and I think that is a practical way of attracting young doctors to remain and work here.  I would, therefore, regard the service to the people as the first priority and I would not recommend rationalising and centralising and regionalising to the extent of depriving them of basic services.  Secondly, there is the priority of ensuring that we shall have a strong force of medical practitioners and former dispensary doctors&mdash;in other words, doctors who will participate in the scheme around the country.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has been commented on already and which strikes anybody reading the Bill is the extent to which this is a skeleton Bill which will be implemented by ministerial regulation.  In large measure this is the nature of this type of Bill.  You can only lay down general principles and there must be a certain flexibility <Col N="980" /> in implementing them.  I hope that, as the Bill goes into Committee Stage in this House, we shall go through it with a fine comb and prevent, if possible, by amendment, any unnecessary delegation of functions and any unfettered discretion either on the part of the Minister or the council concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to this, the type of thing I am referring to is contained in section 40 of the Bill which refers to the setting up of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  It sets out the functions of the council which are very vital ones.  Subsection (1) (b) (vi) of section 40 says that the functions of the council shall be &ldquo;to perform such other functions in relation to hospital purposes as may be prescribed&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, to do anything in relation to hospital functions that may be prescribed.  Under paragraph (d) of section 40 (1), it is provided that regulations under the subsection may provide for procedure for the selection of persons for appointment to the council.  These seem to me to be very wide statements.  I am taking them as examples of what occurs frequently throughout the Bill. I do not deny that there must be a certain amount of regulation within the general framework of the Bill; I still say there is a real danger in unfettered discretion.  This is something that leaves the regulations outside the control either of the courts, because they would not interfere with ministerial discretion, or of the Committee on Statutory Instruments since, if the power of the Minister is too widely framed, it will not come within the terms of reference of the committee to be drawn to the House for special intention.</P>
    <P>Another point which I want to make on this Bill is that the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The FitzGerald Report emphasised the desirability of having a common corps of consultants, under the regional hospital boards, who would serve in the different kinds of hospitals and who would be selected by common selection procedures.</P>
    <P>I would certainly echo that.  It is a very fine suggestion but on my reading of the Bill&mdash;again I would ask for clarification&mdash;further on in section 40 there <Col N="981" /> is a very unnecessary problem emerging.  It may be that we will have two types of consultants, one for the State hospitals, if you want to call them that, and the other for the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>It appears that the consultants to the voluntary hospitals, although they will be paid by the regional boards, will be governed in their day to day operations by whatever the hospital board is, whereas the consultants to the other hospitals will be paid by the regional health boards and yet appear to come under the local health board for their day to day regulation.  Coming under the local health board means coming under the executive officer of the local health board particularly if sections 21 and 22 apply.  These refer to the suspension of members.</P>
    <P>I do not say whether this is good or bad but, from my knowledge of consultants, I do not think you will get them to work in terms of reference under which they can be suspended by the chief executive officer of the health board.  They just will not accept that. Therefore, you will find that there will not be interplay between the consultants to voluntary hospitals and hospitals set up under this Bill.  This would be very sad because it would only perpetuate and continue the distinction which people now make, and often quite a wrong distinction, that the voluntary hospitals are somewhat better than the local authority hospitals or the hospitals to be set up under this Bill.  I would ask for clarification particularly on subsection (8) of section 40 because it seems to me that a distinction is being made between consultants to voluntary hospitals and consultants to other hospitals which would prevent what the Minister obviously wishes for, the interplay between the consultants when this distinction no longer exists.</P>
    <P>Since one tends to be critical rather than complimentary in referring to a Bill, I should like to say that there are a number of small matters I hope to see amended on Committee.  Apart from that I welcome the Bill.  It is a very commendable piece of legislation. It has been brought in, in a short time. I associate myself with those who complimented the Minister on getting it <Col N="982" /> through the Dáil so rapidly and yet accepting so many good amendments from all sides of the House.  I would again appeal to the Minister not to regard this House as a rubber stamp but to realise that we are willing to do our homework in the hope of contributing other amendments so that the legislation will reflect the best health services for this country.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to the voices of those who complimented the Minister on bringing such a well thought out and well designed Bill before us.  Some time ago I had the privilege and pleasure of listening to the Minister delivering a lecture on health and the health services.  The enthusiasm with which he spoke and the fervour of his words and sentences showed how his heart was set on healing which in essence is, I suppose, one of the greatest extensions of the precept of charity.</P>
      <P>I remember that night when I listened to him some words of St. Luke's dealing with the miracles of Our Lord came to my mind: &ldquo;When the sun went down all those who were sick with divers diseases were brought to Him and He laid His hands on them and healed them.&rdquo;  Those are the sentiments of the Minister.  They are our sentiments.  It was with a sense of shock that I listened to the contribution of Senator McGlinchey when he so rightly exposed what he considered to be abuses in the health service as it exists now.  I am sure this came as a shock to most of us.  We were not aware of such abuses.  Even though there may be abuses, and there possibly are abuses, I like to think that there are very very few and that, by and large, our medical service in all its disciplines is one of the finest in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Healing, as I said, is a great act of charity whether it be the healing of the soul, the mind or the body.  Down through the centuries traditionally the healers, doctors, nurses, mid-wives <Col N="983" /> were always honoured and revered in this country.  Many of our old surnames&mdash;Hickey for example&mdash;were derived from words dealing with medicine or healing.  A collection of our proverbs on health if put together and expanded would, indeed, make a very fine textbook: &ldquo;Tosach sláinte codladh; deireadh sláinte osna&rdquo;; &ldquo;Is fearr an sláinte ná na táinte.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our wise men in the past in our own language put in a few sentences what many modern medical textbooks would not say in hundreds of pages.  If I say that our doctors and nurses today are in the best traditions so far as healing is concerned, healing of the sick and comforting of the afflicted, I am not guilty of exaggeration because in general, in spite of the abuses we come across now and again, they give something that no Minister could legislate for, that is, kindness of disposition, great charity and a very high standard of integrity.  Very often we do not give our doctors and nurses credit for all this.  In Britain they are given credit. I have heard nothing but the highest praise of our nurses and our doctors in Britain.</P>
    <P>There are many disciplines in medicine and one is tempted to deal with a number of them, but I shall confine my remarks to just one section of the profession.  I refer to dispensary doctors.  The dispensary doctor is, in my opinion, one of the unsung heroes. As small children we went to him with our cuts and our bruises.  He came to our houses and treated our parents and ourselves.  He knew us and he always had a kind word.  We often called to him on the way home from a hurling or a football match and he tended our wounds, putting in a stitch or two when that was necessary.  There was never any question of who would pay or how soon.  His main concern was: &ldquo;What kind of a match did you have?&rdquo;  and, above all, being a local man: &ldquo;Did you win?&rdquo;  That is my picture of the dispensary doctor and I believe that the more that can be done to facilitate him the better it will be. Many people prefer to go to their family doctor first.  No one likes going to a specialist.  Many of these dispensary <Col N="984" /> doctors are very skilled men.  Not alone have they an excellent medical training but they have a kind of instinctive power of diagnosis.  I could give instances of dispensary doctors who diagnosed in a matter of minutes cases which subsequently baffled specialists for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>As most Senators agree, this is primarily a Committee Stage Bill. There is just one particular section upon which I should like to say something. I refer to section 65.  It is, I believe, the most important section in the Bill.  The old apophthegm runs: &ldquo;Is fearr galar a sheachaint ná é leigheas&rdquo;. Roughly translated, prevention is better than cure.  This section deals with the child health service and the school health service.  Subsection (2) of section 66 provides that a health board shall make dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and dental, optical and aural appliances available in respect of defects noticed, without charge.</P>
    <P>Speaking from my long experience in a national school, I can say that practically every childhood disease or physical defect hits children from birth up to the age of 14 years.  It is in these years they contract measles, whooping cough, skin ailments.  It is in these years that defects in speech, in limbs, in sight and in hearing will show themselves. It is a vital matter that these ailments and defects should be diagnosed early and successfully treated. One of the most important examinations a child undergoes is the first medical examination in the national school.  The medical officer does not examine the child as the result of a complaint by the child.  Normally, people go to a doctor when they feel ill and they are examined for the particular ailment about which they complain.  The medical officer in the school examines the child from top to toe and looks for defects.  I can give a particular instance.</P>
    <P>Some years ago following an examination by the medical officer the parents of one of the pupils called on me.  His little girl of 11, a fine healthy child apparently, was ordered to have a specialist examination.  She had never complained.  To all appearances she was in perfect health.  On specialist examination it was found that her heart <Col N="985" /> was defective in some way.  She underwent a six to eight hour operation.  I was subsequently told that if the operation had not been performed then she would not have lived beyond 35 years of age.  There is a happy ending; the child took up nursing herself subsequently.</P>
    <P>Many, many children suffer from severe defects in hearing and in eyesight. Very often these defects are not noticed by the parents.  Very often they are not even noticed by the teachers, especially if the child has a very high IQ.  A child with a high IQ learns to lip-read very quickly and learns to anticipate.  In some cases we ourselves performed unobtrusive tests when our suspicions were aroused and recommended the parents to have the children examined and the examinations invariably proved we were right.</P>
    <P>The most efficient way in which to deal with these health problems in children is by having regular school examinations.  At the moment there is an examination every three or four years.  That is not enough.  School medical examinations should be held not less frequently than every two years.  I note with great satisfaction that the Minister intends to have a pilot scheme in both the vocational and secondary schools.  That is all to the good.  It is only right that there should be continued medical supervision. The greater care we give children at primary school level, the surer we are that there will be less need for hospitalisation in later years.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Health to have an informal chat with the Minister for Education, or some of his officers, in an effort to get co-ordination between these Departments on other health matters.  In every primary and secondary school lectures are given on hygiene and health matters.  Most pupils in national schools come from homes where they have been well trained, but some are not so well trained in matters of health and hygiene and these require training.</P>
    <P>A large number of national schools have no playgrounds or playing fields. One of the greatest safeguards against disease in later life&mdash;when I say disease I mean mental and physical disease&mdash; is a childhood and adolescence spent <Col N="986" /> playing games whether free play or organised games.  Such games give children a healthy outlook.  They learn to use their lungs in order to breathe properly; their interests become focused on sports and athletics and they develop a balanced mind.  Unfortunately, many people who are mentally ill today lack the training that games can give.  We have often heard that the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.  I am sure my friends on the other side of the House will not take umbrage if I say I believe the last general election was won on the football pitches and hurling fields of this country with particular reference to Cork Athletic Grounds and Croke Park.  Be that as it may, I think the provision of playgrounds and playing fields is an investment in health.</P>
    <P>I should like to end by again complimenting the Minister on the excellence of this Bill.  I look forward to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally agreed there is a need to improve our health services.  There is a humanitarian obligation on every society to provide a health service for its people. It is not an easy task to draw up a Health Bill.  What we are doing today concerns the lives of thousands of people who are walking around at present in perfect health, but when this Bill comes into operation a high percentage of these people will benefit from it.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the Minister's contribution of 50 per cent.  I do not think he was over-generous.  Rates are a problem.  As sure as night follows day the rating system will get out of hand and we shall have to introduce some form of insurance to meet our demands for a health service.  At present most firms and responsible trade unions have accepted that a large increase in wages has to be granted. This will directly or indirectly increase the rates because all local authority employees will get an increase as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man earning between £15 and £16 with two or three children is not really covered.  That sort of wage is not a colossal amount in the year 1970. Many of these people are paying loans on houses as well as furniture repayments. <Col N="987" /> I do not want to suggest that the health authority was not generous in the past.  It gave as much service as possible where hardship was proved but in the sort of case to which I have referred there was no way out.  When the wife or one of the children was sick and the doctor had to come to the house, if the family did not have a medical card, the doctor looked for his fee which might be as much as two guineas.  If the doctor had to make three or four visits in a fortnight that could well mean eight guineas, almost 50 per cent of the man's earnings.</P>
    <P>Another category which concerns me are the people around the £1,200 mark, as well as those with a valuation of £60. When a man in the £60 valuation enters a private ward in a hospital his bill for maintenance alone is £26 5s. That may be an alarming figure but I have checked on it and that is the figure in the Limerick Regional Hospital. I think it is excessive.</P>
    <P>I come now to people, who I think have always got a very unfair crack of the whip, and they are the mothers and fathers of mentally handicapped children. I know of cases in my own county where people have to keep the child at home to look after it.  It is a very great cross for a family to have a mentally handicapped child.  These are not isolated cases.  Recently I read that in 1966 in my own city and county out of 3,000 births 75 were mentally handicapped. In view of that alarming figure we should have a single authority under the Minister for Health to deal solely with the mentally handicapped. The matter should be regarded as a priority. In 1948, when a very serious disease threatened the nation, I am glad to say it was eliminated because the matter was taken seriously and treated as a priority.  I am referring to tuberculosis which, thank God, is no longer the threat it was in the past.  There are many other aspects of the Bill to which I should like to refer but, if I move a little to the left, I hope it will be accepted because I am interested in national health payments.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to health benefits.  Very often people have to wait for five or six weeks before they receive benefit and I hope something will be done about this in the near future.  I should also like to refer to nursing staffs.  I think we take too much for granted and vocation and dedication have their limitations also.  We should be very sure that nursing staffs who work long hours and on night shifts are being looked after while we are resting at home.  I wonder if we recognise fully the service they give to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I would like to raise is in regard to the assessment for medical cards.  We often come across cases where people have a basic rate which <Col N="989" /> would qualify them for general medical services but because they have worked overtime they have exceeded what the health authority have allowed.  Overtime, particularly in isolated cases, should not be taken into consideration because some of the people to whom I am referring, who earn overtime work for very long hours, often have broken time or work at night-time and these hardships should be taken into consideration. Finally, I should like to congratulate the Minister for accepting some of the amendments in the other House.  With that outlook and with our co-operation I hope the Bill when it is passed will be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Dublin Health Authority I should like to welcome this Bill.  It is only natural that members of a local authority should welcome any improvement in the health services.  The opening words of the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill state that &ldquo;the objects of the Health Bill, 1969, are to provide for a number of improvements and extensions in the health services.&rdquo; I was somewhat concerned when I received a memorandum which set out the proposals regarding the setting-up of the health boards and when I read that the local authorities were not going to have a proper majority on them.  As a member of the delegation of the eastern board which met the Minister some time ago I should like to compliment him on the manner in which he received us and listened to our views.  I was very pleased when I heard him say that he was prepared to give local representatives a majority on the health boards.</P>
      <P>Other speakers today have mentioned that up to now members of local authorities and of the Dáil and Seanad have played a very important role in the administration of the health services. Members of local authorities do play a very important role in this regard.  Senator Boland mentioned that the responsibility for striking the rate falls on the shoulders of local representatives. It is the local representatives who will have to listen to people's complaints when they do strike a rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for themselves.  I did not contribute to that.  In regard to the proposed improvements and extensions one has to ask what improvements are there in the Bill, and the one that strikes me most is in regard to the choice of doctor.  It is a wonderful thing for ordinary people to have a choice of doctor, that they can be treated in hospital by their own doctor.  I listened with great interest to Senator McGlinchey.  There is no doubt that in our present system there are a number of weaknesses and this applies very much to the matter of medical cards.  I would welcome and support any improvement in this service at any time.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Senator Belton asked the Minister if a body would be set up to ensure availability of doctors and the Minister said this would be done. Following that, a number of rural Senators expressed concern about the availability of doctors in rural areas. That may be a problem, but speaking as a representative in a built-up area, I am faced from time to time with a problem of a slightly different nature but still a difficult one&mdash;the availability of a doctor at night for people living in built-up areas.  I am not criticising any particular member of the medical profession but I hope the Minister will have a look at this problem with a view to ensuring that the medical boards will be able to deal with it in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the industrial sector, various organisations arrange for such things as a night medical service.  Today, when planning is playing such an important role in our everyday lives, I cannot see why some members of the medical profession should not be available at all times in these areas. What I am saying is that in a particular area one member of the medical profession should be available at all times.  It could be so arranged and organised that a member of the profession would be available in a particular area on a particular night. I have been approached when going home late at night by members of families unfortunately unable to get a <Col N="991" /> doctor.  They have asked me for help. This is something I am very concerned with and I ask the Minister to take a serious view of it.  It merits serious consideration because of its importance in our lives.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to compliment the Minister on is the abolition of the means test&mdash;the fact that it will be only the earnings of the man and wife that will be taken into account. I have a number of cases in mind which will be affected.  I am thinking particularly of people suffering from asthma, people who pay £4 or £5 a week for drugs which they must have to keep them alive.  They are deprived of medical cards because two or three members of their families are earning. Some of these are looking ahead, some of them are about to get married, and in these circumstances the amount they have to hand over is very little.  However, the fact that they are earning, perhaps, £17 or £18 a week is taken into account.  Therefore, this revision of the means test is most welcome.</P>
    <P>Now I wish to speak of hospitals. In Dublin, and I am sure the other members of Dublin County Council will agree, very often we are faced with the problem of getting a person admitted to hospital.  I wonder to what extent there will be an improvement in this under the new health boards. There are people in the border areas between Louth and Dublin, people from Drogheda for instance, who would welcome any improvement. People have to wait too long for admission to hospitals.</P>
    <P>When I first read the Bill I became worried about the chemists employed by health authorities and I was glad to hear the Minister say that none of them will become redundant because of the closing of dispensaries and the issuing of drugs through local chemists. These men have given a very fine service to the health authorities and to the people and I hope that when the Bill is implemented it will not be just a matter of giving something to them.  Their positions should be considered seriously.</P>
    <P>Like other Senators, I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he steered the Bill through the Dáil.  Without <Col N="992" /> doubt, each section of the Bill received wide discussion and a number of amendments were accepted.  I have no doubt that on Committee Stage here some amendments will be included. The best tribute to the Minister, I suppose, is the fact that Senators from all sides have complimented him.  As I have said, I met him with other local authority delegates in the Custom House and I was impressed by the manner in which he received us and listened to us.  When our views were made known, he said that from time to time amendments would be made to the Bill.  Members of local authorities play a very important role in the administration of the health services, they are very much in touch with local problems and they are the problems which must be solved if the Bill is to be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as most Senators have said, has a great deal of good in it and I think the Minister has piloted it in this House and previously in the Dáil with his usual patience and flexibility.  He has three or four colleagues who tend to regard the text they submit to us as if it were Holy Writ, quite incapable of improvement or amendment in any way.  The present Minister for Health is prepared to listen to argument, he is very well acquainted not only with the text he puts before us but also with its implications and the possible consequences of certain amendments, and he is always prepared to argue the point and to concede it if he thinks it merits further attention.  Therefore, I associate myself with those who have thanked him for his long and patient listening to the debate and his attitude towards it, which is characteristic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, there is good in the Bill.  There are many points to which we did not advert enough because, as Senator Bourke said, on Second Stage we tend to talk critically on certain points.  One should underline the fact that out-patient treatment is to be free. It has been mentioned that as far as possible people are to get choice of doctor.  This is excellent also, and we await the implementation of it in order to see it in practice.  However, I am <Col N="993" /> sure the Minister intends it to be as big a choice as is reasonable.</P>
    <P>There has been reference also to mentally handicapped children, to the stricter control of access to drugs and to the examination and the treatment of children at school.  There have been times in the past when defects in children were discovered but there was no treatment for them.  In those times it was regarded as enough to examine the child, and that was that.  Now, the question of active treatment is coming into being.  Free access to optical and hearing aids is not yet readily available. It is something the Minister has in mind and we hope that in the future this may be given.  He is very strongly to be congratulated also on the administrative implications of these regional health boards, the coalescing of several counties.  All of this deserves the greatest praise and in practice will work out very well.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned&mdash;and I think the point is a good one&mdash;that it is important that the counties from which the various people come to a given hospital ought through their local representatives to have some say at least in the running of that hospital and this, one feels, will be done far better by these regional health boards than it can be done now by a county health authority.</P>
    <P>I recall that when one of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Tom O'Higgins, was Minister for Health, when he was introducing the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill he mentioned the fact that at that time&mdash;it must have been about 1956&mdash;all but one-sixth of the population of the Republic was covered by a State health scheme, covered at least to some extent; that only one-sixth of the population remained uncovered by the various Health Bills and authorities.  I should like to ask the Minister now what is the present percentage or present fraction of the population which remains uncovered by our official health services.  It is a point of interest. My guess is that it is now less than one-sixth.  So that a great deal of our concern about means tests and the rather complicated and sometimes expensive apparatus that is brought <Col N="994" /> into play to discover how much money is available to various people, to know whether they come under a health scheme or not, is devoted to a tiny fraction of the population.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Senator McGlinchey and the various anecdotes he gave us from real life about private patients and the terrible things that happen in the case of, he made it quite clear, a small minority of doctors.  I thought he was leading up to a speech condemning all means tests and asking to have the health services available to all, to let it become a State service in full, but he seemed to stop short of that.  I was not quite sure what was the logic of his speech.  He was very indignant at the different treatment apparently being meted out to people who can pay and to people who cannot pay but he stopped short of asking for the abolition of means tests which would seem to me to have been the logical outcome of his speech.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is asking for an insurance scheme to cover the health needs of the country.  I find myself quite definitely and directly opposed to this and in this &mdash;I make it clear that I am referring to a specific instance&mdash;I think Fianna Fáil is right and Fine Gael is wrong.  I do not think the answer lies in generalised insurance.  I think the answer lies in a total extension of our present health schemes to cover the whole population.  This is based, after all, upon income tax which is based on capacity to pay and this, in fact, is a principle which is not only invoked but applied in my experience&mdash;which is not small&mdash;by the vast majority of doctors in relation to their patients.  Doctors do as a rule give treatment to the patients in accordance with their needs and take from the patients in accordance with their capacity to pay.  This is very laudable, very just and an almost universally applied principle in medicine.  Certainly, I can testify that in the case of many doctors this would appear to me to lead to a wider extension of the scheme and to the elimination of this means test which I think most of us find it embarrassing to defend.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of eligibility and this new phrase &ldquo;limited <Col N="995" /> eligibility&rdquo;.  I find, for instance, when I refer to the First Schedule of the present Bill, on page 35, the various enactments that are repealed.  For instance, the whole of the Health and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Act, 1958, is repealed.  That was the Act in which the point at which the means test started was carried from £600 a year to £800 a year.  Another Act that is totally repealed is the Health and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Act, 1966.  That was 18th January, 1966, just four years ago.  That was the Act which brought the limit for the means test from £800 a year to £1,200 a year, the present figure, and brought the rateable valuation for farmers benefiting by the scheme from £50 to £60.</P>
    <P>Section 45 which deals with limited eligibility, says, in subsection (1):</P>
    <P>A person in any of the following categories who is without full eligibility shall have limited eligibility for the services under this Part&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952,</P>
    <P>(b)  adult persons whose yearly means are less than £1,200,</P>
    <P>(c)  adult persons whose yearly means are, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, derived wholly or mainly from farming, if the rateable valuation of the farm or farms concerned (including the buildings thereon) is not more than £60,</P>
    <P>(d)  dependants of persons referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).</P>
    <P>I note that subsection (2) reads thus:</P>
    <P>Yearly means for the purposes of this section shall be calculated in accordance with Rule 1 of the Rules contained in the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and shall include, in relation to any person, the yearly means of a spouse of that person where the spouse is resident with that person.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and the House to consider whether this is not a rather dangerous method of legislation. We read that and say: &ldquo;Yes, yes, let us by all means apply a means test in <Col N="996" /> accordance with previously agreed rules&rdquo; and very often we do not bother to look up what the rules are.  We might pause and ask ourselves just what was this Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and what was Rule 1.  I have it here.  It reads as follows: (1) In calculating the means of a person, account shall be taken of the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The yearly value of any property belonging to the person (not being property personally used or enjoyed by the person) which is invested or is otherwise put to profitable use by the person or which though capable of investment or profitable use is not so invested or put to profitable use by the person, the yearly value of the property being calculated as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  the first £25 of the capital value of the property shall be excluded, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the yearly value of the next £375 of the capital value of the property shall be taken to be one-twentieth part of the capital value, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the yearly value of so much of the capital value of the property as exceeds the sum of £400, shall be taken to be one-tenth part of the capital value,</P>
    <P>but no account shall be taken under any other provision of these Rules of any appropriation of the property for the purpose of current expenditure.</P>
    <P>Now, what that means is that anybody who is applying to be counted as having limited eligibility will find that in his or her income is included not only capital sums which bring in interest but also capital sums which could bring in interest even if they do not bring in any.  Not only that, but we note that the first £25 of the capital sum gets off scot free, the next £375 of the capital sum is included as being one-twentieth part of the capital sum or coming in as income at the rate of five per cent.  All right, that is not unreasonable, even if it is not producing income, but the rest is treated as if it were bringing in income at the rate of ten per cent.  Even with the change <Col N="997" /> in money values it is rather difficult for any of these applicants to make sure that their capital is bringing in a full clear ten per cent, and I suggest that the firm application of this particular rule is a dangerous thing.</P>
    <P>I note with pleasure that in the present Bill the third subsection says that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by regulation substitute for subsections (1) and (2) other provisions defining in such manner as he thinks fit the categories of persons eligible on a limited basis.  I would urge on the Minister the necessity both for reconsidering the maximum figures of £1,200 a year and £60 valuation, and would also ask him to consider revising the principle underlying this Rule One of the Seventh Schedule of the 1952 Act which suggests that, if a man or woman has a capital sum of a certain amount after the first £400, it is treated as if the rest was bringing in 10 per cent.  I also suggest that in legislating we must be very careful not to refer to previous legislation without having a full awareness in this House of what it is exactly that we are further approving.</P>
    <P>In this connection I want to illustrate the point I am making by mentioning a case which drew my own attention to this fact.  A man of 75 or 76 who was a retired civil servant had to be hospitalised.  His wife had to be hospitalised first and then he had to be hospitalised, and because his pension was £650 a year it was assumed by the hospital that the Dublin Health Authority would be able to meet a pretty big proportion of the cost.  Both those people were quite ill when brought in and they were put into semi-private wards on this assumption. The amount due by them when they left hospital exceeded £110.  I think it was £120 for the two of them.  Now the man's pension was £650 a year. Because they were elderly they had recently, within a few months, moved from a big house which they had sold into a small bungalow.  There was a residue of £2,000, for furniture that they had sold and also for the house, standing in his name in his current account in the bank.</P>
    <P>He was an honest man and, when <Col N="998" /> asked what money he had, he mentioned this £2,000.  Under this rule I have read out the first £25 was excluded, after that the next £375 was charged against him as if he was getting 5 per cent on it, which he was not in fact.  Nevertheless, that was not unreasonable. That would give him between £18 and £19 a year; but the remaining £1,600 which was lying temporarily in the bank before he could fully equip and decorate the new house, was charged at 10 per cent, amounting to £160, which meant that a total of £179 was added to his pension of £650, which brought it over the £800 level by less than £30, which rendered him liable for the total amount.  This meant that it was assumed that he did not come within the means test.  That was decided because there was this unwarranted assumption that anybody with £2,000 is getting at least 10 per cent on that.  I think that this is unjust, and we may even be surprised that it was allowed to slip through in 1952.  I would draw the Minister's attention to this in the hope that perhaps some amendment or change in this might be thought of before the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is another point that I want to make in connection with this £1,200 a year maximum.  I have mentioned that this was introduced in 1966.  The Act became law on the 18th January, 1966.  We all know that in January, 1966, £1,200 a year was worth in real terms quite appreciably more than it is worth now.  We have had in the interim a devaluation of the £ and I do not think that it would be an exaggeration to say that £1,200 in those days would now be about £1,360 or £1,370.  It might in fact even be as much as £1,400.  Therefore I feel that to continue in 1970 a means test based on £1,200 a year is to fail to allow for the fact that money values have appreciably changed since January, 1966, and I am hoping that the Minister will advert to that point also.</P>
    <P>I recognise, of course, that in this Bill, as in previous Acts, certain discretionary powers are given to the executive officer of the health board or the health authority.  In the case which I mentioned those discretionary powers were used to a certain extent but I <Col N="999" /> feel not to a sufficient extent, but they were brought into play, and if my memory serves me correctly the bill of £120 was reduced to about £70, which was a fairly high hospital bill to pay. The person in question is dead and gone now, leaving a widow of a Civil Service pensioner who was entitled at the time of death to no pension at all. I therefore feel that our law is too stringent and that the discretionary power, although we welcome it, is perhaps not always used with a sufficient sense of mercy.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to say that it was mentioned to me&mdash;and I am not speaking now about this particular case, because the reasons were given &mdash;that always when a discretionary power is refused it seems just that the reasons should be stated for the refusal.  The executive officer or the official should be prepared to give reasons for excluding the person from the scheme and to state his reasons.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House much longer, but there is one point that I want to make briefly, and it is a very important one which has been referred to by Senator William O'Brien, about the conditions and the pay of nurses.  We all feel this and can speak easily about it, and of course great improvements have been made in the pay of nurses, but the fact is that they are one of the most grievously underpaid sections of our community at this date.  Senator William O'Brien said that there is talk about vocation and dedication, but this can be abused and we can take advantage of it in that way.  I am mentioning it here simply to draw the Minister's attention to it.  It does not come strictly within the terms of this Bill but it is something that is a major priority&mdash; the improvement of the pay and conditions for nurses and sisters.</P>
    <P>Now I should like just to refer to section 61 which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  A health board shall make available without charge medical, surgical and midwifery services for attendance to the health, in respect of motherhood, of women who are persons with full eligibility or persons with limited eligibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> (2)  A woman entitled to receive medical services under this section may choose to receive them from any registered medical practitioner who has entered into an agreement with the health board for the provision of those services and who is willing to accept her as a patient.</P>
    <P>(3)  When a woman avails herself of services under this section for a confinement taking place otherwise than in a hospital or maternity home, the health board shall provide without charge obstetrical requisites to such extent as may be specified by regulations made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I shall not quote section 62 which refers to the medical care of infants. This is, of course, a mother-and-child scheme without charge.  I want to welcome the fact that the present Government have at last, partly at any rate, caught up with Dr. Noel Browne. It has taken 20 golden years but it is very satisfactory that we can introduce a mother-and-child scheme under the present Bill totally free of charge.  We can all remember the kind of opposition that idea met with 20 years ago and the way in which the Coalition Government cravenly dropped their Minister because they were, I think, afraid to back him on something that now may pass and nobody questions it.  I want to salute the Fianna Fáil Government for at least, in this respect, catching up with Dr. Noel Browne's mother-and-child scheme which was killed or mutilated 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech said that in the case of many draft regulations, according to the terms of the Bill, they will be placed before both Houses and will require to be approved and may be vetoed by either House.  He legitimately drew the attention of the Seanad to the fact that if we reject one of these regulations we are, in fact, being given by him in the Bill more power than is normally ours because normally we have the right to delay but not to reject a piece of legislation.  Here we can actually reject; we can veto it for good.  Nevertheless, I am a little worried at so much being done under this Bill by means of regulations even if we have the right <Col N="1001" /> to reject them because I think I am right in saying we have no right to amend them.  If we reject a regulation, out it goes.</P>
    <P>I speak subject to correction but I think I am right in saying that we shall not have the right to amend.  I should feel happier even if our power was less if some at least of what will be covered by regulations was covered by the Bill itself so that we might amend it or propose amendments with, in the case of the present Minister, some chance of his seeing the particular amendments were reasonable and accepting them. We are being asked, in other words, to give the Minister very comprehensive power to make very comprehensive regulations in return for the right which he has conceded in the Bill in the final analysis to veto all these powers for which he is asking.  I should prefer that much of what is being dealt with by regulation should be dealt with by ordinary legislation so that we could debate it and so that points for and against would be brought out and so that we would have at least the option of proposing amendments, so that the Minister could explain or defend and possibly accept amendments.  That would be better in many of these cases than a regulation which has to be either vetoed or accepted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill for the reasons I have stated.  Some criticism is merited but this can better be developed on Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille.  Mar adeireann an tAire níl ann ach creatlach ach is creatlach iontach é agus nuair a bheidh an fheoil air i bhfoirm rialacha agus ordaithe beidh an cóir sláinte is fearr sa domhan againn.  Sin rud mór le rá.  Sé an chéad rud a cuirim fáilte roimhe ná an rogha maidir le dochtúir a chuirfidh an ghnáth-dhuine ar aon leibhéal leis an othar príobháideach.  Is rud é sin a bhfuilimid ag tnú leis le fada an lá. <Col N="1002" /> Tá áthas orm, leis, gur féidir as so amach druganna agus cóir leighis a faidh sé seans do na poitigéirí sna sráidden ualach óna dochtúirí agus tabharfaidh sé seans do na poitigéirí sna sráidbhailte a sheas an fóid le fada an lá agus a thug druganna agus cóir leighis dona daoine.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo freisin tríd na forálacha atá ann maidir leis na réigiúin sláinte.  Cuirfear dá bhárr seirbhís níos fearr ar fáil don duine breoite.

    <P>Tá brón orm go mbeidh orm labhairt i mBéarla ach mar adúirt mé cheana ní féidir deagh-rud a rá go ró-mhinic.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister first on the manner in which the Bill is laid out because it is really the outline of our health services.  As I said in Irish, it is the skeleton on to which much of the meat will be put in the form of regulations and orders.  As many people have said, it is good to have this flexibility.  As far as I can see, the measure is built around the patient, the doctor, the health board and the administrator and this is the order of priority in the Bill, which is as it should be.  The central person in the whole health service should be the patient.  Next comes the doctor and last, but by no means least, comes the administrator.  Several times when a suggestion is made we are told it is very hard to administer.  It is a very poor reflection on us if something <Col N="1003" /> which is very good must go by the board because some way cannot be found to administer what is a good idea.</P>
    <P>I think everybody in the House has admitted that this is a most progressive Bill.  It should bring many of the advances of modern medicine within reach of the rural areas to a far greater extent than up to now.  First, I wish to welcome regionalisation.  As I said in Irish, up to this we have had all our specialists grouped in the bigger centres, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, In each of those regions we will have those people nearer to the sick.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on the long and, I would say, tedious consultations he had with the Irish Medical Union and the Irish Medical Association, and with the local authorities. Those consulations were well worthwhile.  Their fruits are evident in the Bill to anyone who views it with an unbiased mind.</P>
    <P>In all professions and in all walks of life money is no longer the be-all and the end-all of a job.  In today's paper Con Murphy outlined this very well.  We should all read and re-read it.  Conditions of service and job satisfaction are just as important today as money.  This is more important in regard to medical services than any other service because a tired and overworked doctor cannot possibly do justice to the patient nor can he do justice to himself.  I am very glad that some arrangement has been made to give time off to doctors and that the Minister is doing everything he possibly can to give them better terms of service.</P>
    <P>I should like to add my voice to the voices of those who welcomed the eligibility provision.  Only the income of the husband and wife will be taken into account in future.  I also welcome the fact that a uniform standard will be laid down, declaring who is entitled to full service and who is entitled to partial service.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington suggested that the ceiling should be raised.  That is only fair.  Not only would I ask to have the ceiling of £1,200 raised, but I would also suggest <Col N="1004" /> that this should be reviewed at intervals, because of the change in the value of money.</P>
    <P>Referring to eligibility I would ask that the application forms be made more simple.  I would also suggest that the rights of people in the health services should be made known to the people in a very simple form.  I know there is a booklet which sets out what people are entitled to in the health services, but I would like it to be even simpler for rural people.</P>
    <P>The hardship clause is very welcome because many people have been worried about some people not being able to afford medical service.  We have our county managers and people in politics of course and when we bring hardship cases to their notice they are only too willing to meet us half-way and all the way most of the time.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the right of appeal because, no matter what laws we have in relation to social welfare or health or anything else, there are some people who will have a grievance.  It may be a real and genuine grievance in some cases but, on other occasions, it may be an imaginary grievance so, from that point of view, I am glad that there is a right of appeal.  I would appeal to the Minister to deal with those appeals faster than they are dealt with, with regard to social welfare, because I know people have to wait months and months before their appeals are decided.</P>
    <P>All Senators welcomed choice of doctor and the people of the country will certainly welcome it also.  This will give a proper doctor-patient relationship consistent with the dignity of both. Choice of doctor is also welcomed by the doctors themselves.  This was not possible under the old dispensary system and, while the whole pattern of the health service is changing, at this changing of the guard we should pay tribute to the dispensary doctors who have served us so very well and given a wonderful service in their time.</P>
    <P>Any doctors I have spoken to have said that the day of the one-man service is definitely gone and they are hoping that, under the new Bill, there will be group practice arrangements.  This would give us a continuous service. <Col N="1005" /> Some people were worried about a night service.  If a group service is introduced&mdash;and the doctors are thinking along those lines&mdash;there is no reason to believe we will not have a night service.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that drugs can be obtained from the local chemist.  We all know that our chemists in the small villages have held the fort and have given us medicines morning, noon and night.</P>
    <P>Senators have welcomed the provision in regard to home help.  I will not discuss &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to which some Senator referred.  The country has been clamouring for home help.  It will be of great benefit to our older people and to incapacitated young people.  Perhaps before the Bill goes through this House the county councils could start making a survey of the number of those people in their areas and avoid a mad rush when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington dealt with the maternity service.  I should like to refer to the £8 grant.  This is completely inadequate.  I know cases where the husband had to stay at home while the wife was in hospital and I would ask the Minister to have another look at that grant even though he did increase it a hundredfold.  I think the minimum should be £20.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch dealt very well with the child health section.  On Committee Stage we can say more about this.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton referred to preventive medicine.  We are all agreed that prevention is better than cure.  I should like to see more tests for cancer and diabetes detection.</P>
    <P>I come now to drugs.  Again, the whole country has welcomed the Minister's quick dealing with this drug question.  I should like to mention another problem, that is, the harmful effects on men and the possibility of thalidomide-like deformities in the unborn that may result from food additives.  I do not know whether this is the place to suggest legislation dealing with them, but I should like the Minister seriously to consider legislation in relation to food additives. I know he moved very quickly on the <Col N="1006" /> cyclamates, but I understand this monosodiumglutamate is also a very serious additive.  I do not know whether it is Agriculture or what Department should deal with it.  There are also the problems of pesticides and insecticides and proper labelling of foods.  I am sure that between whatever Departments are involved this will be looked into by the Minister, and that we can look forward to more legislation on health and on foods.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if all bodies concerned would bring the benefits of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme more to the notice of the people.  I also hope that in administering this service our doctors will not be tied down to the kind of paperwork to which doctors in England are tied down.  Someone told me that in Britain more time is spent filling in forms than treating the patients.</P>
    <P>Tribute was paid to our nurses and I should like to join my voice in that tribute.  I would ask the Minister to look into existing training facilities because I understand there is some point about the number of beds available. Nurses being trained in hospitals have not a sufficient number of beds. I would ask the Minister to bring our training facilities into line with international standards.  We know our Irish nurses are second to none and, knowing that, it is only right that their training should take place at international level and on international standards.</P>
    <P>Many people have cried out for a free-for-all health service.  Wealthy countries like the United States of America have not been able to afford this and surely a country of our size could not aspire to it.  Even in England, where a free-for-all has been attempted, it has been far from ideal.  Doctors in England have told me that in order to make a decent living they have to take on so many thousands of patients that they cannot possibly give the proper treatment to their patients.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned for tea I stated that many people in this country were crying <Col N="1007" /> out for a free-for-all health service although even wealthy countries such as America cannot afford this.  Some countries have in fact tried, but they found it far from being an ideal way of dealing with health problems.  Even if we could afford such a service I believe that people with good jobs should pay for their own health services. This can easily be done by joining the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme for a fraction of what it costs these people to go on their annual holiday.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to help the mentally retarded. I want to congratulate the religious orders who were the pioneers in this field when nobody else did anything to help these unfortunate people. I want to congratulate the Minister for putting forward a Bill with many excellent provisions.  I am sure when he has drafted the regulations these will lay for us the foundation of an ideal health service in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as striking evidence of the ending of a conflict which has had too long a history and the beginning of an era of co-operation between the Department of Health and the medical profession. The distrust which existed was unnecessary, unhappy and bad in its consequences for the health services of this country.  It is appropriate I say this in the presence of the present Minister for Health because he has shown by his attitude that he wishes to be seen as a sort of bridgebuilder between the different sections of the community.  It would not be right if I did not point out that his predecessor introduced this measure and had a similarly happy relationship with the profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When opening this debate the Minister said&mdash;unfortunately I was not able to be present to hear him&mdash;that there was much more in this Bill than one would infer from its length.  He described it as short, but I do not think it was short enough.  He said there was much more in it than there appeared to be.  I sense that we can happily look at the reports made to his predecessor and by the Department to see the background <Col N="1008" /> to this and I also sense that there is behind this Bill a plan in the preparation of which the experts, on the professional level, have participated and have learned much from their association with those who have to advise the Minister in the public interest.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of devolution of power which I welcome very much as being desirable in the interest of the country and its harmonious government. I would prefer to reserve myself on this matter of the degree of devolution and the nature of the organisation for Committee Stage and to direct myself now to the fundamental matter involved in this.  A Health Bill, like any Bill, involves a choice by its promoters and by those whose duty it is to consider it and, if they deem fit, to pass it, a choice between what they are enacting and what they could be enacting.  It seems to me that a correct decision has been made here.  The welfare of the patient has been felt to be paramount.  I understand what is intended here but the degree of running down of existing hospitals which is planned has been greatly exaggerated.  Inevitably there must be some running down somewhere; rationalisation involves a curtailment but if we are talking about health we should think very carefully about the choice which is involved.</P>
    <P>We have to believe in the existence of goodness.  The only thing we know is the existence of evil and one of the greatest evils is human suffering.  Any plan which is designed to relieve that suffering seems to me to force you to simplification which otherwise might be thought to be injurious to culture. A great Swiss historian, Burckhardt, referred to &ldquo;these terrible simplifiers who have come along to destroy our old Europe.&rdquo;  I should like that to be put up as a text in Departments of State.  The terrible simplifiers.  Things should not be simplified unnecessarily. As far as I can understand the argument for the simplification and rationalisation planned here is justifiable. The situation is&mdash;it is something which should be repeated in this House and in the other House so that we should always be reminded of it&mdash;that we are dealing with the administering <Col N="1009" /> of scarce resources.  There is not anything unlimited available and therefore we must try to eliminate waste.</P>
    <P>A suggestion came from the surprising person of Senator Bourke that the report, which I prefer to call &ldquo;The Report of the Consultative Council on the Hospital Services,&rdquo; is weighted in favour of specialists.  I should like to say about that, that in the rationalisation which seems to me to be required in our health services, we have a right to get, must get, the benefits of specialisation.</P>
    <P>The arguments for specialisation can be derived from economic history and from economic theory and I can supplement that argument by some references, which may be of interest, to the proposition contained in that report that the extent to which you can devise labour to increase productivity is determined by the market you can serve.  In other words, you are limited in the degree of specialisation possible by the extent of the market. This proposition does not appear in the report but it is implied in the writings of a gentleman who has no economic training that I am aware of: &ldquo;The bigger the population served, the more comprehensive the service, the better the people can be served, the more suffering can be relieved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be useful to anyone who wished to argue against that proposal if they had come here with evidence against it.  It is claimed that the significant benefit of specialisation here is safety.  We all know we would benefit from the experience of each other if we listened to each other.  We can all benefit from discussion, if we listen to each other.  If we share experiences, discussion is very helpful.  Repetitive action, even on the highest level, means that one tends to do that action better, that one knows the new problem which is coming up and, as the example in the reports puts it, if you have three surgeons working together&mdash;they have got to be working together, they have got to be in agreement&mdash;they will do more work and do it better and serve their patients better than if each of them was working separately.  We all know that.</P>
    <P>One of the psychological factors in <Col N="1010" /> this is that you waste time.  This point is 200 years old&mdash;it was made 200 years ago.  You lose time moving from one occupation to another.  Senator Bourke lost time moving from the Law Library to this House and she will lose more time going to Galway where she has to be tonight.</P>
    <P>One of the things involved in specialisation is that you do not have to do other things: you do the things you know how to do and you get to do them better, and one of the results of that may be that life is saved&mdash;we are not talking here about one of the borderline questions of whether life should be maintained: we are talking about the question of saving life.  As I have said, the benefits of specialisation are spelled out in the report as being the safety of the patient.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that there is another, perhaps even more important, benefit to be derived from specialisation, and I am thinking all the time of the potential rationalisation of the whole health system.  It is the benefit to the general hospitals from the experience of the regional hospitals in conjunction with the universities&mdash;the extent to which the knowledge of the specialist hospitals can be shared by the general hospitals and ultimately by the people of Ireland.  That must be our concern, and it obviously is.</P>
    <P>We are living at a time when there is a scientific explosion taking place. Somebody has asked what would be the position if 80 per cent of all the scientists of all times were alive at the moment.  The point is that it is not possible for us to stand still in this situation without Ireland going backwards. That is why the regional hospitals, in conjunction with the universities, are the foundation stone of our medical services, of the Minister's thinking and of the Department's activities.  There is important international co-operation in medical research and we must be in on it.</P>
    <P>Somebody initiated a biological study and he said that it would be completed 70 years after his death. That gives some idea of the approach being made in these matters.  It gives some idea of how essential it is that we have the regional hospitals, and <Col N="1011" /> quickly, in association with the universities, sharing benefits with the general hospitals, with the doctors and nurses and ultimately with the people.</P>
    <P>There is a whole background to medicine which was not there half a century ago.  We now have the benefits of automatic devices, the computers, the measurements in the social sciences, the measurement of things like cardiovasculars.  It all means that lying behind the work of the hospitals is the experience that will benefit all the doctors in Ireland.  The need is that the work in the regional hospitals reaches the doctors of Ireland.  We have heard about pure science.  The work of pure scientists is seen to have application to the practitioners in the field. Of course, one must be a specialist to see this.</P>
    <P>It is argued for the proposed regional and associated hospitals that we will be avoiding waste&mdash;waste in using acute bed accommodation.  It has been suggested that this provision would reduce the number of beds from about 14,000 to 12,000.  The point about that is that an acute bed is a more expensive bed than another one.  The benefit of this will be that we will be able to provide a 24-hour service which is obviously an enormous advantage.  It will mean that out-patient work will be on a larger scale and will cover a greater distance.  Many people think that to be free of this work is enormously important.</P>
    <P>The equipment, of course, will be come more expensive as it becomes more complex.  We all know this.  We simply have got, therefore, to have regard to the fact that we are not a country with unlimited resources and we have got to see how we can keep getting the best equipment to save lives that would otherwise be lost.  It seems to me that the general plan here is right for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I understand that the approach made to determine what was the appropriate size of a hospital was, first, to determine what was the appropriate size of expert staff.  I am talking now, of course, about the general and regional hospitals which will have many similarities except that the <Col N="1012" /> regional hospitals will be bigger and, working in association with the universities, located in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  They ended up with a figure which was the result of research done in Scotland but arrived at by a different route, if I am correct in understanding the procedures.</P>
    <P>There is that degree of originality in the approach of this body that they came to the conclusion that they should look at the costs that experts of this kind must have and see how much work they would be likely to get through in a day if they were kept busy all the time.  These were chaps who would turn over work rapidly and who would be pathologists and radiologists.  They decided that there should be two pathologists and two radiologists and this would give rise to the need for eight physicians, obstetricians and gynaecologists who could manage approximately 45 beds per skull&mdash;if that is a Parliamentary expression&mdash;working out at approximately 300.  This is the only part of this report in which there is a particular emphasis laid on the importance of the size of the general hospital not falling below 300.</P>
    <P>To attack a report on the basis of who made it seems to me not a proceeding of as high a level as I would hope every Senator would adopt. According to my analysis, there would be a total of 18, seven of them surgeons, nine physicians, one obstetrician and one pathologist, ten for Dublin, four from the south of the country and four from the west, eight having to do with local authorities and ten with voluntary authorities.  Politically, somebody made a mistake in not putting on a number of GPs and benefit would have been found in this report if someone had thought of doing that.  It was overlooked, apparently.  The distribution is given.  The point I wish to make is that these people, coming with these different backgrounds and different disciplines, are unanimously of the view that the hospital must not be less than 300-bed in size and unanimously of the view that regional hospitals are an absolute priority for the beginning of the rationalisation scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been an underrating of <Col N="1013" /> the importance of education.  The better the regional hospital will be, the better it will be able to aid in the training of doctors and nurses and, incidentally, on nurses, the report on England and Wales was that the number suitable for proper training of nurses was a number not less than 300 beds, which is the recommended size here for general hospitals.</P>
    <P>If the regional hospital skills are developed, obviously, they will be training their doctors better and the general hospitals will be better.  They will develop in a natural kind of way ancillary services.  There should be agreed specialisation between these three surgeons and three physicians and, a very important point, a matter of local loyalty, fewer patients need be sent to the bigger centre.  This will be one of the real communal benefits that, in fact, a patient will be much nearer his home, if he is an acute case unable to get back, as is intended by the plan, to the county home or the district home, reconstituted and renamed.  He is more likely to be closer to his own people under this system than he is at the moment.  He will not necessarily be in Dublin.  He will be in one of these areas that are suggested, and suggested only.  It is worth noting all that.  This shows the political unwisdom of the authors of this document.</P>
    <P>If one reads them closely one finds that the recommendations for the areas are quite diffident and they leave it open for examination by people better equipped.  It might well be that there would emerge out of the experience of the Minister a proposition that a special body might consider whether in particular cases other areas might not be chosen for general hospitals than the ones recommended by these gentlemen who would not have any particular expertise in this matter, it seems to me.</P>
    <P>This business about the county home and the district home has got to be emphasised.  As I understand what is planned, they will continue, even at the stage when the specialised surgery is gone from one area to another because it is going to be better done in the other area and the lives of persons will be saved by going to that other <Col N="1014" /> area; that there will remain normal obstetrics in that home.  It will be a nursing home where a patient would convalesce very close to his own home. If he is an old man receiving geriatric treatment he will be in his own environment and if he is in a hospital, as so many unfortunate citizens are, when they need not be if their own homes were better&mdash;socially necessary medicine I believe it is called&mdash;needing attention there because he cannot get it because of the lack of facilities in his own home, he will be at least near his own home.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is planned that these county homes should have increased diagnostic facilities.  It is planned that they should have more comprehensive out-patient departments than they have and the out-patient department's work, being served by the general hospitals and the regional hospitals, will, as I understand it, be more extensive, will go further and be better and is intended to be.  This is all to rationalise and to make the skills of doctors and nurses available to people in a rational way and to have beds at present occupied in the expensive way that they are in these other county and district homes occupied in a less expensive way.</P>
    <P>It is also intended that the x-ray and laboratory facilities should continue and that there should be as part of this plan&mdash;and this is something I feel very strongly about&mdash;an integration of the general practitioner, the family doctor, into this system.  He should be in association with these hospitals and get benefit from that and can go and enjoy the medical libraries and listen to the lectures and have discussions with the more specialised people who will be in the general hospitals.</P>
    <P>One matter has been mentioned with regard to the ambulance service. Senator Mrs. Farrell said that there was no reference to an ambulance service, that the committee had not thought about it.  I read this report with care, as even my markings may indicate.  Section 3.59 gives a good deal of attention to it.  Paragraphs 7.28 to 7.35 deal with it.  There is also reference to a possible alternative use of hospitals for rehabilitation, a <Col N="1015" /> reference to the necessity for resuscitation, talk about accidents.  In fact, there is a recommendation that every district hospital should have a high standard of first aid ready and available.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to know any more than I learn in listening about this but I do know that, in fact, though this is not something that one would wish to stress, there are many matters which are thought capable only of treatment if you get there in a few minutes.  This is a matter of which there are a few illustrations given in the report, but, perhaps, it is better that I should not give them; but many acute cases anywhere in the country, including the city of Dublin, depend for the survival of the person concerned on the ready availability of the advice and good sense of the general practitioner, which looks to me as if he is dead within a few minutes if he is not available.</P>
    <P>On the question of the ambulance service, I am given to understand that already the Department have undertaken and set in motion work of a valuable kind on this.  I think that the Minister and the Department are to be congratulated on doing this.  On this question of the ambulance services it does seem to be vital to the success of the whole scheme that there is a speedy and properly equipped ambulance available for the cases that have to be brought to these general hospitals.  I do not know who makes our ambulances, but I am told that they are not adequate.  I hope that no economic consideration, no question of protection or anything else, will affect the making available to the people of Ireland of the very best ambulances that can be got anywhere in the world. I do not know whether there are better ambulances than those that we have serving the Irish people at the moment but I believe there are.</P>
    <P>It would not be right for me to sit down, having said nothing but nice things as I have tried to do and wanted to and believed to be true, without saying one thing that I think should be said.  I do not know whether it is in the Minister's mind that he is so much opposed to the present extraordinarily inequitable system of valuations that <Col N="1016" /> he has chosen to kill it in this fashion. It may be very subtle, and I would congratulate him if he succeeds, but it seems to me that the local financial system is like a man with a bad heart disease and a great big trunk is now being given to him to carry.  Either one of two things will happen.  Either he will drop dead or&mdash;which I would prefer to see&mdash;he will go quickly to his doctor and the valuation system will get revised as quickly as this health report was made and this Bill enacted in consequence of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelGallanagh" hpid="Mr. Gallanagh Mr. Gallanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like in the absence of Senator Farrell to say that on the matter of ambulances what she said was that the report was almost silent.  She maintained that eight paragraphs in a report like this is almost silence.</P>
      <P>May I say that I agree entirely with the system of devoting a percentage of the local rates towards the health system.  It is 44 per cent at present, but the percentage is more, I think, because I maintain, though people disagree with me, that there is a relief to the lower income groups in this.  These people pay a big lot already in direct and indirect taxation, and there is a measure of relief to those people by the fact that 44 per cent of what is going towards health is paid out of the local rates. The second reason I say it is that it enables the Minister to exercise his preference in the appointment to the board of more than 50 per cent members from the local authorities.  In this I disagree entirely with those on this side and the other side of the House who say that this board should be made up of all these pious people who believe in the social services at every level, because you would finish up with a mutual aid society spending <i>ab lib</i> and there would be much more in the latter end to pay. The local authority member knows that he must go back at the next election and meet the people and be responsible to them for any increase that may have come in the rates or his handling of their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a big question here on this matter of rates today, and there must be many people who do not understand the rating system.  To compare County Cavan with County Meath <Col N="1017" /> in the matter of rates or what a penny in the £ means is completely misleading. Anyone who has ever travelled through County Cavan can see farm residences and farms there corresponding to those in Meath but you have to have regard to the comparative valuations. Without doing this there is no point in comparing one with another. If the rates are £5 in one county and £2 in another, a man paying £5 may be on a £7 valuation and so would be paying £35 while the other man could also be paying the same amount on a much higher valuation. You cannot, therefore, make any general comparison.  Another point is that an increase in rates is still in direct proportion to the increase in the cost of living.  Today people are paying about as much in proportion on rates in comparison with what they were years ago.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his very fine Second Reading speech.  But I should like to disagree with him on one point on page 6 when he says &ldquo;In addition, for rural areas, the State, from the agricultural grant, makes a further substantial contribution to the cost of the health services through relieving farmers from paying rates.&rdquo;  I disagree with that.  I think that it is a contribution to the farmers, not to the health authority.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House very much longer, but I should like to make some points on section 40 and section 60.  Section 40 provides for a body to regulate consultant appointments. I would welcome anything in legislation of any description that would bring these consultative services to the people.  It is scandalous at present.  People from the country are coming up here to Dublin, being sent by their local doctors to a name in Dublin.  They go in there because they must.  Many of these people do not have medical cards, and not all people can afford this great expense, because the £1,200 allowance is very small. They come to Dublin into the consulting rooms and see the doctor for five minutes at the most.  Because he says that they have to go into hospital, for saying that there is a ten guinea demand and no receipt in most cases, <Col N="1018" /> because it seems unprofessional to give a receipt&mdash;it is not done.  Then this same man operates on those people and charges a fee for operation.  I cannot see the justice of this.  If I go to a shoemaker, although maybe I should not compare one with the other, he tells me that my shoes need soles but he is not going to charge me for that advice.  He will look after the shoes and then charge me for his work.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the matter of voluntary health, which somebody else has mentioned.  I should like to mention it again because I think that there is not sufficient publicity in this matter.  Not sufficient people realise until they are in trouble how important voluntary health is and how cheap it is and how necessary it is for people to have this voluntary health service. This should be brought home to them more forcibly, and in this respect I think that they should be warned not to disclose to the hospital that they are in the voluntary health when they go there as patients, because the voluntary health are going to be taken to town by the hospitals, and if the voluntary health are taken to town, then in return the following year the people will have to be paying increases, so people should not tell any hospital that they are paying voluntary health.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something on section 60 with which I agree very much.  This is the section which deals with home help.  I knew a case recently, as late as December.  There was a mother in a home at 60 years of age. She had creeping paralysis.  There was a father with an old age pension.  The daughter of 18 was looking after them but because she had not three years' stamps she could not get anything for looking after them.  This is changed now under the social welfare code.  The father gets an additional 55/-.  With the provision made here I think they will be able to get something else.  As the Minister said this is a very important section.  Apart from humanitarian considerations, I think people should consider, if they feel they are not getting sufficient allowances, sending their invalids to the local authority hospital where they can say to the local authority: <Col N="1019" />&ldquo;It cost you so much to keep them in hospital.  Give me so much and I will keep them at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Possibly Senator Dr. Belton could tell me what it costs to keep a bed in hospital.  At present it may be £20; I do not know.  The people who are keeping invalids at home should get something reasonable.  Otherwise, their task is impossible.  What are the prospects for a young girl who is going to look after her parents for perhaps five or ten years and then finds herself at an awkward age and cannot get a job? It is bad enough to go on without training while looking after her parents but to go on doing so on an insufficient income is asking too much.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  I am delighted that he has introduced this provision in particular and I shall not delay the House any longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is a major one in the number of sections involved but to me in many respects it is like the curate's egg.  Unfortunately, I fear that the bad spots are so bad that to a large extent they outweigh the merits of the good parts.  But before I begin to speak about it I want to join with other speakers on all sides of the House in congratulating the Minister on the manner in which he handled the Committee Stage of the debate in the Dáil and on the minor surgery he carried out on the patient and which I hope he may again undertake on the Committee Stage here so that we may be able to send out some sort of patched-up measure that will be capable of being implemented by the local authorities and the new health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other speakers on this side of the House I want to say that to us at this stage to have a Bill introduced which purports to be a major measure in relation to health services and which in no way seeks to change the method of financing those services is totally unacceptable to us as members of the Fine Gael Party. Surely it is unacceptable to the people who drafted the Government's White Paper in 1966 which clearly said that in their opinion the rates were not a <Col N="1020" /> suitable way of financing the health services.  For that reason we should oppose vehemently the particular section which sets out the proposed method of financing these services.</P>
    <P>The White Paper clearly said that they did not consider the rates a suitable way of financing health services. In the explanatory memorandum we are told that the Bill is primarily based on the proposals for changes in the health services and their administration contained in the White Paper. Yet, in this most important aspect of the service we find no change whatever. We find a rather interesting situation arising where, in the tentative details which were sent to members of local authorities, of this House and of the Dáil last September, we were told that in recent years the State's contribution to the health services as an average was 56 per cent.  Yet, following that, the Minister, as in the other House and here again yesterday and today, asks us to accept a measure which provides that the State will make a contribution of one-half or 50 per cent.  Bearing in mind the fact that the State is at present contributing on a national average&mdash;I emphasise that because there are parts of the country that insist they are not getting anything like that figure&mdash;56 per cent, even if the Government have decided not to deviate from the policy of financing a large part of the health services from the rates, one would imagine that they would have provided for at least a statutory 55 per cent contribution in accordance with the amount that has been contributed in recent years.  We do not get that in section 31.  We get instead a clear statement that the State's contribution will be half and this may or may not&mdash;and this is the important part of it; it is not obligatory&mdash;be supplemented by additional payments to a health board.</P>
    <P>As Senator Belton pointed out yesterday, at the time of the estimates meeting last year we in the Dublin Health Authority received a circular from the Minister's Department which had the temerity to ask us to effect economies in our estimates for the year.  Senator Belton dealt very efficiently with the way in which that <Col N="1021" /> circular was received not alone in the Dublin Health Authority but also in other health authorities throughout the country.  I want to refer to an interesting sideline.  We in the health authority examined our estimates and we duly contacted the Department of Health and said: &ldquo;Yes, we can immediately effect a saving of £60,000 if the Minister would sanction oil-fired boilers in our hospitals instead of turffired boilers which we have been requesting for the previous five years to no avail.&rdquo;  The answer from the Department was silence.  So we have a situation where somebody in the Minister's Department would send a circular of this nature and when he receives an answer pointing out where £60,000 can be saved, because it does not suit either that Department or some other Department of State, the economy which was so urgent and pressing when the circular was issued is suddenly no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>It seems to us that this Bill has set out deliberately and clearly in certain sections to straitjacket and confine further the power of local authorities to protest about the amount of the contribution they will have to make to the area health boards in any year. We have written into the Bill a specific provision that if any local authority hesitates about making its contribution in response to the statutory demand that will be made upon it by the area health board any Minister of any Department may withhold from that local authority funds to the amount which the local authority is hesitating about transferring to the health board.</P>
    <P>Presumably this is a section which may have originated to some extent from the other Department which uses the Custom House rather than from the Minister's own Department and is intended, to some extent, to prevent the type of democratic protest which was engaged in last year by members of Dublin Corporation against the excessive increased demand being made upon them.</P>
    <P>It would seem that never again in this democratic country can the majority of members of a local authority decide, as it their right, that they will refuse to meet a demand <Col N="1022" /> because they feel it is excessive, unjust and unbearable from the point of view of the ratepayers in their community because, instead of registering their protest in this way, we will have the Minister for Education, perhaps, withholding the financing of the higher education grant money from that local authority area or, perhaps, the Minister for Local Government withholding the State grant for road works in that local authority area and transferring the money directly to whichever health board happens to be administering the health services in that area.  This does not seem to me to be an extension of the democratic system which was referred to by some speakers over the past two days and of which this Bill is supposedly a part.</P>
    <P>We also have the provision written into this Bill, again for the first time, that no health board may, save with the Minister's consent, engage in any excess expenditure over and above the estimate adopted.  We, and by &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean especially my colleagues, Senator Belton, and Senator Walsh from the Fianna Fáil side of the House, are members of the Dublin Health Authority which was, in effect, the one big regional health authority operating heretofore.  We know, as I am sure the Minister and his officials know, that that authority handle a budget so vast, for a population so vast and constantly changing, the needs of which are always increasing and changing, that it is impossible in any year to arrive at a proper estimate.</P>
    <P>In fact, the estimates presented to the members of the Dublin Health Authority in any year are little more than a calculated guess and, for the remaining 11 months of the year, excess expenditure authorised, I think, under section 11 of the 1955 City and County Management Act, has always been sanctioned by the members, and the moneys form part of the estimate at the following year's meeting.</P>
    <P>Now we will be prevented from authorising that excess expenditure unless we have the specific permission of the Minister.  This, I think, is in section 30 of the Bill.  It seems to us that this section, taken in conjunction with the right of the Minister to <Col N="1023" /> transfer funds from the local authority to the health board, means that the Government can, if they so desire, completely straitjacket the health board, decide how much money it will spend, how much money will be contributed to each of its component local authorities, and whether it will spend any additional money in a particular year.</P>
    <P>A situation could very easily arise in which the Government of the day, in a particular year, for financial reasons might not want to see a great amount of extra money being spent, and a particular health board in a particular area, because of special circumstances, might need very badly to spend quite a sizeable sum over and above the estimate they had adopted. The Minister of the day of whatever Government we happened to have could, under the provisions of these two sections, refuse point blank to allow that expenditure to be made. To us this does not seem to be progressive or the sort of thing one would expect in a Health Bill which has been so long awaited and so much talked about as this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister deserves our thanks and compliments for the great time and trouble he took in travelling around the country to meet representatives from each of the local authorities and hear their views at an early stage in the course of the debate on this Bill.  I should like to think it was to a large extent because of the views he heard that he agreed that the local authority members should have a majority on each of the health boards.</P>
    <P>However, I feel very strongly that we can still ask the Minister to go further in this regard.  The Minister has provided that the local authority members will have a slight majority.  The rest of the members will be nominated by the various professions of which they are members.  These appointed men, faceless men I think they were referred to as either here or at some stage in the other House, have not got the responsibility at any stage of going before the people to explain their actions during the previous four or five years since the election took place in their own <Col N="1024" /> county council area, or of explaining to the ratepayers why the rate demand has risen, or why it is that they have not got additional health services.</P>
    <P>Yet, these people will constitute almost half of the health boards which will decide how much money is to be spent, and the sad slight majority will be sent back with their tails between their statutory legs with their statutory demands to their local authorities, and they will have to give an account of their services to those authorities. Whether or not their fellow-colleagues on the local authorities like the account they hear, they, too, will be obliged to adopt whatever levy is made upon them.  When the next election comes around, the members who were representatives on the health boards and their colleagues on the local authorities will all have to go out and explain actions which were decided upon by almost 50 per cent of people who were not public representatives and who, despite any assertions to the contrary, will never be public representatives because they never had to and never will have to stand before the people and ask them for their votes and give an account of their stewardship.</P>
    <P>By any standard this does not seem to me to be an extension of the democratic system.  Once again an additional burden is being placed upon the very excellent members of local authorities. They are now being asked to explain the expenditure of money over which, to a large extent, they had no say. Remember, most of the members of any local authority will not be on the health board.  There will be at most three or four from most local authorities out of a membership of 25 or 30. They have to accept the financial demand made upon them and explain it to their constituents.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Dublin Health Authority, and fully aware of the type of administrative difficulties which that authority had to face over the years and, to my mind, the magnificent way in which the senior officials of the authority have worked to surmount these difficulties, it seems to me and to both the officials and members of the different parties that the powers of the new CEO under this Bill will <Col N="1025" /> be far less than the powers the CEO with the Dublin Health Authority has at the moment or the powers county managers have in their local authorities. We do not believe that will be a good thing.</P>
    <P>The administration of the proposed health service by the eastern health board, with a population of 1,000,000 people, may require the board to meet two days a week to examine accounts, to authorise various purchases of individual items and discuss small details of administration which, up to this, the senior officials, in whom we had every confidence, attended to on our behalf.  The Minister gave an assurance in the other House that if we, in the eastern region, felt strongly enough about this he would be prepared to make concessions.  My reason for referring to the matter at the moment is to forecast that the Minister may very well be receiving urgent representations within two years from the setting up of the eastern health board for permission to revert to the system which obtains at present.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that a braver step was not taken in this Bill to untie the strings running from the Custom House and tied tightly around the hands of senior officials of local authorities throughout the country.  I do not think anyone will disagree with the suggestion that it is conceivably possible that there may be men in the local government service, working for county councils or health authorities, who are more efficient, more intelligent and who have a more enlightened attitude to the administration of the service than the officials in the Custom House who have the final say and sanction in regard to schemes put up by the men in the local area.</P>
    <P>Professor Chubb and Deputy Thornley wrote a book called <i>Irish Government Examined</i> and on page 30 of that book they state:</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement among public officials themselves that control over the local authorities is often far too detailed, a view echoed recently by the Secretary of the Department of Local Government himself.</P>
    <P>When changes in the relationship between <Col N="1026" /> the CEO and his board were being mooted, irrespective of whether or not we agree with them, there could have been and should have been a braver look taken at the relationship between the officials in the Custom House and the senior administrators in local authorities and health authorities throughout the country.  This did not happen.  It is another omission I regret.</P>
    <P>There is, in my opinion, excessive representation in regard to the professions. The members of the local authority are the people responsible to the public.  The medical profession and the nursing profession have a fair case for representation but having six or seven doctors serving on a health board will, I am sure, prove to be an unworkable proposition.  I am a young man with a brief three years experience of health administration in this city and those of us who serve on the boards of hospitals, other than local authority hospitals, are not always enamoured of the administrative abilities of the medical people, however highly skilled or qualified they may be in their own professional field. There are, of course, notable exceptions and I would include Senator Belton in these exceptions.  It may not be a very valid criticism, but I did hear someone remark rather ironically that we would end up with everybody represented on the health board except the patient.  Public representatives, of course, represent the patient and that is one reason why I think public representatives should have a sizeable majority on these boards.</P>
    <P>There would not be a health service of any kind were it not for the contribution made by public representatives over the years, public representatives who gave of their time and their energy, without payment, to assist in the evolution of our health services.  To turn around at this stage and say to these public representatives that we are so unhappy with the present health services we have decided, having heard a great many complaints, to give these public representatives a bare majority over professional representatives does not seem to me to be a very graceful way of saying &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; or of acknowledging the debt society owes <Col N="1027" /> to these men for the contribution they have made.  They are quite willing to go on contributing and I suggest there should be a re-examination of the proposed structure of the health boards to see whether or not public representatives should not have a sizeable and clearcut majority.</P>
    <P>If the forecast of the administrators of the Dublin health authority is correct the amount of time members of health boards will be asked to give weekly will be so great that I fear the Minister will very soon have to consider making some sort of financial payment to the members&mdash;certainly, if not to the members, to the super-chairman, because super he will have to be.  Attending those boards will involve members in a considerable loss of time, loss of revenue in their normal occupations and considerable expense.</P>
    <P>This Bill will regionalise and rationalise our health services.  It would be a useful exercise to examine the before and after situation.  The before situation, which is the position as it exists today, is that there are 27 county councils in the country.  In the case of four of these, namely, Dublin, Limerick, Waterford and Cork, the health authorities administer health services for both the city and the adjoining county and in the remaining 23 county councils the councils themselves are the health authorities.  The 23 county councils plus the four health authorities and one hospital commission give a total of 28 bodies administering health services in the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>The after situation will, I think, be something like this: each county council will have a local committee. They will total 27.  Presumably, the corporations of Dublin, Limerick, Waterford and Cork will each be allowed to have a local committee and that will give us a further total of 31. The Borough of Dún Laoghaire is in some doubt, but I imagine in the normal democratic process they will be allowed to have a local committee and this will bring the total to 32. There will be eight health boards which will bring the total to 40, three regional hospital boards which will <Col N="1028" /> make it 43 and Comhairle na nOspidéal will make it 44.  After the policy of regionalisation and rationalisation has been carried out we find there will be 44 committees administering the health services at present being administered by 23 county councils and four health authorities.  I feel sure the delegated committees, which the health boards will be allowed to appoint to investigate the suspension of officers and deal with local inquiries, whenever a hospital is about to be closed or extended, will mean that the bodies administering the health services will number more than 50 for the first few years at least.  In an effort to rationalise our health services we are almost doubling the number of bodies administering those services.  I feel sure the situation would be of considerable interest to Parkinson.</P>
    <P>It seems to me rather strange, when embarking on a policy of regionalisation, that it should be decided in eight areas that local county boundaries are to be abolished.  By that I mean within a particular area the county boundaries of counties forming part of that area will no longer exist as far as the health services are concerned and yet for the exterior of each health area we are maintaining the county boundaries. This is going to produce a rather ridiculous situation bearing in mind the policy of regionalisation.  There is a rural area in North County Dublin which is only a few miles from the town of Drogheda.  A very fine hospital exists there and it is much more convenient for the people in this area to go to Drogheda.  The Dublin Health Authority has realised this and over the past years it has maintained an ambulance at the Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda to carry out work on its behalf in North County Dublin.  When the new boards are operating I should like to know if an arrangement can be made to allow a patient living on the edge of a boundary where facilities are much nearer in the adjoining health board to cross the border and receive their treatment in that area?</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the Minister's assurance on that.  We all realised that, whatever areas had <Col N="1029" /> been suggested for these health boards, there would have been criticism from various local members who felt their area was being downgraded.  I think a long, hard look should have been taken at the county boundary system in an effort to produce eight, ten or any number of regions which it was felt to be administratively possible and which could work to the best advantage of the service without taking into account county boundaries.  I think it would have been better to decide the areas on a geographical basis as well as on the basis of existing road networks and hospitals instead of simply containing ourselves within existing county boundaries.  I imagine my suggestions are rather late at this stage.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister can tell us what is going to happen to the existing dispensaries and health centre buildings once the choice of doctor system comes into operation.  The Minister is no doubt aware that Fine Gael have for some years been advocating major reforms in the health services.  One of these reforms involves the choice of doctor system.  The suggestion was then made that when the dispensaries were no longer necessary these buildings should be changed into community welfare centres which would contain the district nurse's office, the family social worker's office, the welfare clinic for mothers and babies, out-patient clinics and the home help centre. This seems to me to be a useful way of using existing buildings.  I would be interested to hear if any thought has been given to what is going to happen to these buildings.  I understand it has been suggested where a general hospital is to be closed down that the administrative centre for the health board should be sited in the county where the hospital is being closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps, the Minister would let us know whether it is the intention to have the administrative headquarters for each health board sited in the same town or city in which the main hospital for that board will be sited.  It seems to be the obvious thing to do, both from an administrative and an economic point of view, but, perhaps, there are reasons for suggesting that it <Col N="1030" /> should be placed in one of the other counties.  I am inclined to think that the only reason at the moment is to have it act as a sop to disgruntled members of the county in which the hospital is not sited.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not be considered parochial if I refer to the Dublin region and, indeed, it could not be termed parochial as we have in the region, certainly if we want to refer to the eastern health board, almost one-third of the population.  Indeed, if present trends continue we shall have more than one-third within a short number of years.  I want to suggest to the Minister, as I did when local authority members from the proposed eastern health board area met him, that the area at present administered by the Dublin Health Authority is as large, if it is not too large, as can be administered properly bearing in mind the vast population already in Dublin city and county and Dún Laoghaire borough.</P>
    <P>It has been stated by officials of the Dublin city and county planning department that the rate of expansion taking place in County Dublin is one of the most rapid either here or in Britain.  They forecast that within 15 or 20 years the population of Dublin city will remain static, in the region of 600,000, but that the population of Dublin county will rise to equal that figure.  I am not quite sure what figure they give for Dún Laoghaire but it does not represent a sizeable increase because of the fact that the major part of the borough area has already been built upon.  One can see that Dublin county is fast becoming a largely dormitory area in which new suburbs are being created and new towns being planned so that within a relatively short number of years&mdash;and I presume this Bill is intended to cover the functioning of health services for a considerable time to come&mdash;the Dublin county area will be an area of one rather large city surrounded by satellite towns between which there will be large suburban dormitories.</P>
    <P>It does not seem to me in the long term to be a good thing, bearing in mind these forecasts, and, indeed, just taking the evidence of one's own eyes <Col N="1031" /> as one sees these developments taking place, to join with this urban and surburban area, which is essentially becoming more urban, the essentially rural areas of Kildare and Wicklow. Whatever expansion may take place in Kildare, and to whatever extent the towns in Kildare will expand, as they obviously will, the terrain in County Wicklow&mdash;as the Fine Gael Leader in the House could so well explain&mdash;is so mountainous that it will largely remain a rural area for some time to come if not for ever. To join the mountains and hills of Wicklow to the urban complex of Dublin does not seem to be the best proposal administratively.  Even at present in Dublin County Council we resent our link-up with Dublin Corporation because we feel that the larger body gets the better deal.  We may or we may not be right but I am afraid that once Wicklow and Kildare become joined with the main area there will be serious complaints from those counties, especially Wicklow, that they are not getting a fair deal from the health board and that all the services are geared towards Dublin city and county at the expense of the ratepayers in the other counties.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to examine the situation which exists in Dublin in view of the population forecast and also the fact that Wicklow will remain an essentially rural area and to see whether or not Wicklow might not be served better, and, indeed, whether Dublin area might not be served better, by leaving the Dublin area much as it is at present and joining Wicklow with, perhaps, the south eastern region.  The Minister stated that 56 per cent of the health costs had been met by the State in recent years.  In the case of the Dublin Health Authority the official percentage in recent years has been 54.7 per cent but there is a feeling that the State contribution has not even been 54.7 per cent.  The main reason for this is that many of the good provisions in later sections of the Bill were already being provided by the Dublin Health Authority because we &mdash;and as Deputy Ryan pointed out in the Dáil the Fine Gael Party are in <Col N="1032" /> the majority in this authority&mdash;and our officials were conscious of the need for a home help service, meals-on-wheels and a domiciliary service and we were providing these services and providing them in a number of cases by financing them completely from the rates.  Someone has done the mathematical calculation which I was always too frightened to embark on and has arrived at the conclusion that instead of 54.7 per cent &mdash;the figure thrown up by the Dublin Health Authority accountant&mdash;we were only getting 46 per cent of our health costs from the State because some of the services were services for which we could not seek a State contribution.</P>
    <P>An interesting point about the Dublin region is that while there is a national average of 30 per cent of our people holding general medical cards&mdash; and in some counties the figure rises far beyond that&mdash;on the last occasion I inquired about the percentage of the total population covered in the area the figure was 14.5 per cent and that percentage, of course, was taking the actual number of card holders as a percentage of the whole country as shown by the 1966 census.  It is obvious that the 1966 census is quite out of date: the population has increased substantially so that the percentage, if it were accurate, would be even less for that area.</P>
    <P>Bearing all these things in mind, the Dublin area deserves closer attention. A special scrutiny and study should have been made of the present Dublin Health Authority.  The eastern health board, as the provision stands, will administer for a population of one-third of the country, and of the figures given in the Minister's memorandum, therefore, 30.9 per cent of the total estimated budget, estimated presumably by the Minister's officials, for the entire country, will apply to this region.  I am taking the figure given by the Minister's officials.  I am not being in any way critical: I am merely pointing out how rapidly things change in regard to health services and how difficult it is accurately to estimate financial need to run a service.</P>
    <P>The budget the Minister's officials gave was £15 million for the eastern region, comprising Dublin City, Dublin <Col N="1033" /> County, Dún Laoghaire and Counties Kildare and Wicklow.  Yet we, as members of the Dublin Health Authority, have in the past three weeks tentatively accepted a budget for the coming year of £16½ million, not taking into account the amount of money needed for the present health services in Kildare and Wicklow.  If the estimate for Kildare and Wicklow could be added to the Dublin Health Authority estimate, and if the population of Dublin is to continue to increase, it must become obvious to the Minister that the eastern health board will be administering approximately 40 per cent of the total budget for health services throughout the country, due largely to the suburban area with the rural tag on it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the representation of local authority members on health boards.  County Dublin has a population of 174,000 and they have three representatives. The whole of the midland region has a population of 178,000&mdash;approximately 4,000 more&mdash;and they will have 12 local authority representatives.  It seems to me that when considering local authority representation account should be taken of population increases and of immediate future increases and decreases.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it was through my inattentiveness or because of the dreadful acoustics in the House &mdash;something should be done about this &mdash;but I understood Senator Belton to speak about the transfer of the Dundrum Central Mental Hospital to the health board or to the Board of Works.  The question the Senator was asking was whether the ratepayers of the eastern region would have to bear half of the cost of running that hospital. I was not able to hear the Minister's answer and, perhaps, he would be able to repeat it when he is replying.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that the administration of that hospital will be undertaken by a civic board, whether it be the eastern board or the board as suggested my myself and other Senators. It is long overdue that the administration of that hospital should be taken from the hands of the Department and <Col N="1034" /> handed over to proper administrative people.</P>
    <P>Following the debate in the other House, I noticed that the Minister&mdash; I can congratulate him&mdash;decided to allow the health boards to appoint chairmen and vice-chairmen.  That decision interfered with one of the schedules.  The Bill at that time used the schedule to explain the set-up in regard to the hospital boards and as a result of the Dáil discussion the Minister is allowing the boards to appoint their own chairmen and vice-chairmen, and consequently he abolished part of the schedule which allowed him the right to appoint the chairmen and vice-chairmen of the regional hospital boards.  The suggestion was made to me&mdash;I felt, rather unkindly&mdash;that the Minister was retaining the right to make these appointments because the three regional hospital boards would be what I might call the crunch boards which would set up the procedure in relation to the closing down of any hospital or institution, a process which would be most unacceptable except from a political viewpoint.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was that consequently the Minister was taking on himself the responsibility to make the appointments of strong personalities in order to ensure that this line would be carried through.  I do not imagine that is what the Minister had in mind.  It may be that he wished to retain these appointments to himself because these were the boards that would be engaged in the long-term planning of the hospital services of the country and that he felt there should be some close connection between these boards and the country.  It would be useful if the Minister opened his mind to us in this respect when he is replying.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has also been made &mdash;it is hard to decide whether there is validity in it because of the vagueness of the relevant section&mdash;that when the regional boards are set up there is a danger a clash may occur between these boards and the employees of the boards, between the CEOs and the senior officers of the health boards.  It would appear from certain indications in the section allowing for the setting up of the regional hospital boards and <Col N="1035" /> Comhairle na nOspidéal that a consultant employed by the boards to provide services in general hospitals might be in conflict with the CEO or the administrator of the local general hospital and that the consultant might adopt the attitude that he was not an employee of the board and that he would not accept the dictates of the administrator&mdash;that he owed his allegiance to Comhairle na nOspidéal.  This might lead to discussion on lines of demarcation.  It is something that should be clarified by the Minister so that there will be a clear-cut distinction between whom allegiance is owed to.</P>
    <P>In relation to the three hospital regions as specified in the Bill as being based in Dublin, Cork and Galway, these boards will provide the new regional hospitals.  It was suggested that the board based in Cork would administer the area of the south and mid-west, that the Galway board would administer the west and north-west and that the Dublin board would administer the eastern and midland regions.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor said in the course of the debate in the other House&mdash;Volume 239, column 2087 of the Official Report&mdash;that approximately 80 to 90 per cent of the surgical problems in any local authority area at present were within the competence of the county surgeon and that presumably it would be&mdash;I think Senator Ryan referred to this early today&mdash;only the remaining 10 to 15, perhaps as much as 20 per cent, who would have to go to the regional hospitals for surgical treatment.  If this is the case, presumably contained within that percentage would be a fairly large number of persons who were urgently in need of an operation and whose condition was so acute or so dangerous or so rare that it could not be dealt with in the local general hospital. Why, then, are we to have a situation where the county of Waterford, in the south-eastern health board region, will have its regional hospital in Dublin and where a patient in west Waterford who would be approximately 40 miles from the regional hospital in Cork would have Dublin as <Col N="1036" /> his regional hospital board area?  A similar situation would obtain in parts of north Clare where the people would be very convenient to the regional hospital in Galway but presumably would be expected to attend the regional hospital in Cork because they were living in the mid-western health board area. Such anomalies will arise in any policy, programme or suggestion for rationalisation or regionalisation and we ought to get a clear-cut, categorical assurance from the Minister at this stage as to whether people will be allowed to cross regional hospital board boundaries if a regional hospital in another area is more convenient or adjacent to them.</P>
    <P>It seems ridiculous to suggest to somebody who is in urgent need of surgical attention and who is living in west Waterford that he lives in the Dublin regional hospital board area where there are the finest hospitals, the finest medical and surgical staff, the finest equipment and the finest nursing-home waiting for him if only he can survive the rather dreadful 120 or 130 miles trip by road by ambulance. Unless this problem is tackled at this stage we will get a situation where the press of rural Ireland will be reporting that the verdict at various inquests was that the patient could have been saved had it been possible to get him to the regional hospital in time where the finest equipment awaited him and everybody will regret that fact.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give us some clarification on this point at this stage? Obviously the new regional hospitals will be ambitious.  Presumably they will have the very best and most modern equipment available and will be staffed by the most competent persons.  All of this will involve very high costings.  I do not think we have got any indication from any source as to who, in fact, will be responsible for the financing of regional hospitals.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the proposed constitution of the regional hospital boards.  One-half of the membership of these boards will be ministerial appointees and one-half will come from the health boards.  It is interesting to bear in mind that the health boards <Col N="1037" /> are creatures which already have almost one-half of their members appointed so that by the time the regional board comes to be set up we will be lucky if even one-fourth of the members of the regional board are local authority members, public representatives, the people who are responsible to the general public.  Indeed, as one goes through the proposals for administration one sees that the power, influence and scope of local authority members, public representatives, is diluted to such an extent that it is almost washed out.</P>
    <P>I rather facetiously referred to the creation of all the additional committees which will be necessary to administer the policy of regionalisation and rationalisation.  I can assure the Minister I realise that many of them are very necessary but I want to say something which perhaps will not be very acceptable politically either to members of my own party or to other parties.  As far as I can see, the proposed local committees, who will have solely an advisory function, are being set up as no more than a sop to members of local authorities who realise only too well that their powers are being taken from them and that the health services will be controlled very definitely from the Custom House in future and the only reason for setting up these local advisory committees is to endeavour to convince county council members that they still have some power and some say in deciding on health policies.  They have not and they know it and they resent it.  If these local committees are still meeting six months after the initial meeting, that will be a matter for surprise.  There was provision made in the 1960 Act for local committees to meet within the Dublin Health Authority.  These local committees ceased to meet after a few months because the members realised only too clearly that there was no point in meeting to discuss something on which they could not take any decision.</P>
    <P>No man becomes elected to a local authority unless he has some degree of commonsense and some intelligence. He will not be a member of any body for very long before he realises what <Col N="1038" /> its power or usefulness is.  Normally, he is a busy man and he will resent being expected to appear on committees like this where he cannot come to any decision or make any clearcut recommendation.  It would have been better if the Minister had been more honest and had said: &ldquo;We are taking the power away from local authority members.  We are allowing some of the members of each county council collectively to form just over one-half of the membership of the health board. We are restricting the way in which the health boards can spend money.  We are ensuring that no local authority can refuse to provide the money.  We are doing all this because we do not like the way in which you have been administering the service, because we do not like the way in which Dublin Corporation protested, and in order to make sure that our system of financing almost one-half of the health services out of the rates will continue. We are going to make darn well sure that nobody is going to protest about it in the future.  We are not going to have any local committee because it would serve no function.  It would be a waste of time&mdash;of your time and our time&mdash;and incidentally it would waste a considerable amount of the ratepayers' time because of the necessary attendance of officials there and the rooms that must be available, and the expense of subsistence allowances and all that, which will be of no avail.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps, it is not too late yet for the Minister to consider either doing away with those committees or deciding to give them some real power, recognising the contribution which the members of those committees have to make and deciding to give more teeth to those committees and allow them to do more work.  I assure the Minister&mdash; and I am sure that from his visits around the country he knows it only too well&mdash;that these people are only too ready and anxious to help in furthering the administration of our health services.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting departure in this setting up of those local committees in that for the first time ever as far as I can see or find out the <Col N="1039" /> county manager, a man who derives his whole position from the Management Acts and who had a very definite position in relation to members of his local authority, has been taken out of that official position, which is clearly laid down by the Management Acts, and is being told &ldquo;You serve on a committee with elected members and you serve as a member of that committee.&rdquo;  Now I am not the greatest advocate of the management system. I believe that there are many changes that could be made to the Management Acts, but to just decide to make one small change like this which changes the position of the county manager in relation to public representatives does not seem to me to be a very worthwhile thing to do, especially when it is in relation to a committee which will have no useful function anyway.</P>
    <P>Many of us hoped that when a new Health Bill would be introduced the old Victorian poor law system, the concept of someone being eligible for services if they could not provide from their own income or other lawful means, would be recognised as what it was, and that a fresh approach and a new look would be taken at this whole business and that there would be a clear-cut definite line laid down.  While the Bill does abolish this dreadful phrase of &ldquo;lawfully from his own income or other lawful means&rdquo; it gives us instead the equally trite and meaningless phrase &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;.  My definition of undue hardship, the Minister's definition and the definition of any of the other 58 or 59 Senators in this Chamber could differ, and differ radically, from each other.  What might be undue hardship to the Minister might not be undue hardship to one of the Members here, but it might very well be great and grave undue hardship to somebody sitting in the public gallery. We are asked to accept this as the modern 1969 replacement for this Victorian set of words.  I think, again, that this is a section which should be examined to see whether there cannot be some definite and clear-cut things laid down here to give a fair indication to the general public as to what <Col N="1040" /> undue hardship or whatever it is was in the mind of the Minister or of his officials or the draftsmen when they wrote that section.</P>
    <P>I want to welcome with all my heart &mdash;and that is an awful lot to give&mdash;the provision that from now on only the husband and his wife will have their incomes taken into account in deciding upon eligibility.  How often have so many seen the situation where a large family were refused a general medical services card because of the income of one of the eldest children where we as public representatives knew, and knew only too well, that that eldest child either through selfishness or for personal reasons was, in fact, making no financial contribution whatsoever towards the home?  Yet the health authority were obliged to take a certain amount of the income of each child into account.  They were not allowed to investigate whether or not that child was making a contribution to the home.  I can assure the Minister that the numbers who will immediately become eligible for general medical service as a result of this move will be considerable and I hope that the increase in numbers has been budgeted for.  I know that it will be welcomed in many parts of County Dublin.  Indeed, if the Minister ever has to seek a new constituency he might well think of coming down there after this. However, what I do want to say is that it is rather a dreadful thing in this year of our Lord 1970 that we feel it necessary to consider continuing this blue card system, this general medical services card system with its means test to any extent.  As far as I understand it virtually every country in Europe with the exception, I think, of one particular part of Finland has managed to provide some sort of medical service for all its people, and apart from Finland the Republic of Ireland is the only place where a general service for all the people is not provided and this continuing means test with all the annoyance and embarrassment which it invariably must cost is to be continued.  I am sure that the Minister would like just as much as I that this should be abolished, and I recognise that presumably it is just not economically possible at this time, but I would <Col N="1041" /> hope that it is the thinking of the Minister and his officials that as soon as ever we may we will get rid of this means test and of the questioning and probing which almost invariably fails to elicit the true picture, fails to bring out that, perhaps, the husband has gone on spending more money on drink than actually reaches his wife, which is a very small sum indeed.  It often amazes me that with all the questions asked by these inquiry officers about the family's situation hardship of that degree is invariably overlooked, and they seem to be more concerned that the people may have cabbage planted in the back garden from which they might derive an income of 10s than to find whether, in fact, the husband brought his wage packet home at all last week or the week before.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the future rather than each local health authority deciding on what should be acceptable standards for the issue of the general medical services card the Minister or his Department will issue clear-cut standards which cannot be deviated from by any health authority.  This is a good thing which is to be welcomed, and I hope that it is something which will be brought into operation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the provisions of section 45 whereby there is a ceiling of £1,200 for limited eligibility.  This is a ceiling fixed late in 1965.  If I may I would point out, as other speakers have done, that there has been a very definite and marked fall in the value of money since then, as Members know, and as Members of the other House know even better, because shortly before the Christmas Recess, in answer to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Finance explained that the 1969 pound was worth 16s 8d in 1966 or 16s 4d in 1965 terms. Taking it in terms of 1966 and working out what £1,200 is worth in terms of 1969 we arrive at a figure of £1,440.  Yet, here in this Bill we have the same ceiling of £1,200 continued even though it must be quite obvious to the Minister's advisers and draftsmen and to himself that the people who were entitled to services with <Col N="1042" /> £1,200 in 1966 would be no better off today if they were earning £1,440. There is a clear case for asking the Minister to amend this figure and at least bring it into line with the fall in the value of money, if not to increase it substantially.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 52, I very much regret that the Minister has felt it necessary to continue the provision whereby charges may be made per day for hospital service.  I think the Minister and his officials know that the amount of revenue derived from this charge in the past few years has been a very small fraction of the revenue required to meet costs, something like one-sixtieth, without taking account of the administrative costs of collecting that 10/- per day.  A Bill that sets out to be a modern Bill dealing with health services should not continue this provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated in regard to his decision to allow free choice of doctor where possible.  This is something for which the people have been agitating for a very long time, something which has formed one of the cornerstones of Fine Gael policy on health in the past few years.  We have been agitating for it at every available opportunity.  As a party we feel proud that this part at least of our suggestions is to be implemented in this Bill.</P>
    <P>When we refer to free choice of doctor&mdash;this is a choice of general practitioner&mdash;it is only right to acknowledge the debt which Irish society owes to general practitioners down through the years.  Very often, especially in remote rural areas, they have acted as friends and advisers as well as medical practitioners.  They have given very considerable service and because of this I am specially concerned that, wherever it is not found possible to provide a choice of doctor, every effort should be made to ensure that some doctor is available.  Obviously, in more remote areas doctors will be reluctant to stay and we should see to it that very definite incentives are made available so that they will consider it worthwhile to live in these remote areas.</P>
    <P>Remote areas are not always, as <Col N="1043" /> Senator Dr. Belton suggested, in places like the Aran Islands.  In this respect I want to quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 8th January of this year an article on the front page dealing at some length with the fact that the tiny village of Tinahely perched high in the County Wicklow mountains has been endeavouring to combat a raging flu epidemic without the aid of a resident doctor.  &ldquo;Already,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;one villager has died from flu complications, according to a local resident.  Almost every house in the village (population 417) has been struck by the virus and the only medical assistance available is from the doctor in the district dispensary who travels the six miles from Shillelagh twice a week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Interestingly enough, a member of the other House who is also a medical practitioner, Dr. Hugh Byrne, who travelled to the stricken village at the request of the <i>Irish Independent</i> said: &ldquo;There is near-panic here at the moment.  When there is a fantastic incidence of flu as at present, it is these isolated places which are worst hit.&rdquo;  Dr. Byrne blamed the new Health Act, to become law in April, 1971, for the difficulty in attracting resident dispensary doctors to places like Tinahely.  &ldquo;These temporary part-time non-pensionable positions are not attracting any applicants because they offer no security.  The shortage of doctors in such areas should have been anticipated when the legislation was being introduced,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to my colleague, Deputy Dr. Byrne, perhaps he is a little bit harsh but this does emphasise the problem which exists even in areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That report was inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so I am glad I have given the Minister the opportunity of making it clear now. Presumably, there is some difficulty in providing a doctor in Tinahely.  If we take it as an example it is quite obvious that, when a choice of doctor is being made available to people who are <Col N="1044" /> fortunate enough to live in populous areas where doctors are willing to live, the loss to people in remote areas is even more severe and rather than having a choice of doctor, they may not be able to get a doctor at all.  That is why I again urge that every effort be made to see that doctors are available in all parts of the country.  This must be done by making it advantageous to doctors to live in remote areas.</P>
      <P>If I understood the Minister correctly when he intervened yesterday when Senator Dr. Belton asked about the method of payment of GPs I am glad to know that the Minister has now accepted in principle the fee for service system which operates so successfully in many other countries and which the Medical Union are so anxious to see introduced.  This is in no way a criticism of the present Minister who has been only a few months in this office, but it is remarkable that a White Paper was published in 1966 which dealt with all these problems and which, as far as I know, almost immediately initiated a series of meetings between the Minister and his officials and the Medical Union and yet, when a Bill is introduced in Dáil Éireann in 1969 and in Seanad Éireann in 1970 by the Minister for Health, the Minister does not know if he has got a definite, agreed system of payment of GPs who will be carrying out the choice of doctor service.  It is regrettable that in all this time negotiations could not have been satisfactorily concluded.  The blame must be laid to a large extent at the door of the Department officials who, for some reason, seem to be opposed to the fee for service system.  They have given in at last and presumably some form of working agreement will now be arrived at.  I hope it will not in any way hold up the implementation of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously when the dispensary, <i>per se</i>, no longer exists and a choice of doctor system operates, there must be some way in which the patient can get drugs which are prescribed for him.  So far as I know, at present the local authorities buy the drugs at something like 46 per cent of the retail cost of drugs purchased over the counter in a <Col N="1045" /> chemist's shop.  Presumably, some register of chemists will be drawn up in the same way as the suggested register of doctors participating in this proposed new service will be drawn up.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether an acceptable or accepted system of payment has been decided in relation to chemists because, obviously, if the chemists were to look for the full retail cost of drugs that would mean that the cost of drugs to the health service would immediately double.  Perhaps, the Minister could enlighten us in this regard.  Perhaps, he might also tell us how the chemists will be selected to enter this register and to participate in this service.  Will all the chemists in a town be entitled to enter the service or will it be only one?  If it is only one, how will he be selected?  Will he be selected by tender or will he be selected because he is more competent than the others?  If he is selected because of that who will decide whether he is the most competent in the town?  These are the things we should have been told.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is a need for a national formulary.  Some time ago we in the health authority witnessed a fantastic increase in the cost of drugs despite the fact that we were not providing service to a greatly increased number of people.  There had not been any tremendous or costly epidemic during the period in question.  When we investigated it the report which came back to us from our chief pharmacist was that the dispensary doctors had been influenced by pressure exerted by salesmen on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies and that they were now, in the main, prescribing drugs that were far more costly and no more effective than the cheaper versions which had sufficed up to then.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if we had a national formulary it could lay down what was the minimum standard of drugs necessary to treat the various diseases or ailments and what might be the maximum which would serve as a guide and be a very effective guide for GPs.  In this modern world with its increasing pressures they are having more and more difficulty in keeping up to date and they very often prescribe the most modern drug because it is the <Col N="1046" /> one they heard of most recently from a visiting pharmaceutical representative. A national formulary could lay down clear guidelines for GPs participating in this scheme.  Obviously, this would produce economies and it would assist chemists.  They would not have to carry fantastic supplies of drugs in order to meet all possible types of prescriptions that might come to them from the various doctors who had different ideas or different friends in the pharmaceutical companies.  Do I understand that there was an agreement that the Minister would get in at 9.15?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will press on then.  I welcome the section which provides for the setting up of the home help and home nursing service.  This is something which the Dublin Health Authority have been doing for a number of years without official approval. It is something which we in Fine Gael have been pressing for and advocating. We welcome this very much. Obviously, when it becomes operative it will be of great help in dealing with the problems of the aged and in dealing with geriatrics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For quite a long time there has been great pressure on our geriatric homes which arose because of the fact that many old people had to enter these homes, not because they were completely helpless or incompetent, but because there were certain small things they could not do for themselves.  If someone was living with them and could give them a little help or even <Col N="1047" /> cook one hot meal a day for them they could stay at home and be far happier and the pressure would be taken off our institutions.  It is good to see that the Minister recognised this and introduced this provision into the Bill making it operative on a national basis.  I am also glad to see that it covers section 61 in relation to pregnancies.</P>
    <P>Provision must be made for the nursing of the aged.  This is becoming an increasingly pressing problem and it is becoming increasingly obvious in the Dublin Health Authority area probably because it is a large urban area.  It is regrettable that our young families are becoming more and more reluctant to have older members of the community living with them, perhaps, even their own elderly fathers and mothers.  If these people have any disability they are inclined to insist that they should be taken into an institution rather than keeping them in the bosom of their families.  If this continues the pressure on our homes for the aged and our geriatric homes will be very considerable.</P>
    <P>Already there is a great amount of pressure on the nursing staffs in these hospitals and there is a marked reluctance on the part of nurses to serve in hospitals and homes catering for geriatric patients only.  Obviously, there is a small extra financial inducement available for any nurse who chooses to serve in a geriatric home.  I do not think that alone is sufficient.  In this regard I regret to have to say that I do not believe that the Dublin voluntary hospitals generally have played their part in taking their share of the geriatric patients over the past few years and because of this an increasingly heavy burden is being placed on the health authorities and consequently on local authority institutions.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries several times in the course of the past year or two about the general accident hospital, St. Columcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown, and I discovered that at all times in those two years one bed in every seven was occupied by long-stay patients, by old people.  Those people had relatives and the matron asserted that they could be living at home if <Col N="1048" /> their relatives were prepared to give them a little care.</P>
    <P>I am sorry more coverage has not been given to mental handicap in the Bill.  The Fine Gael attitude on this question is that one statutory authority should be set up to co-ordinate and expand the mental handicap service. More diagnostic services, five-day recreational centres and day centres and hospitals should be provided for the mentally handicapped.  I should like to have gone into this in more detail but I appreciate that there is a time factor.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 62 could I suggest to the Minister that the period of six weeks which is stipulated for free treatment of ailments in new born infants might be far too short?  We should consider expanding it considerably. I believe, as do many other Senators on this side of the House, that the abolition of the unlimited eligibility for treatment of the ailments and defects discovered in school medical examinations is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>Like the curate's egg, this Bill is good in parts.  It is bad in regard to financing.  That a Bill should, in the middle of the rather good sections, turn around and provide: &ldquo;We will remove a service which already exists, the service by which every family with school-going children suffering from defects or ailments discovered in school medical examinations can avail of free treatment for those defects and ailments&rdquo; is most regrettable.  The system that obtains at the moment will no longer apply when this Bill becomes law.  It is not a good thing to remove a facility already provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look into the urgent need for a review of the Infectious Diseases Act.  This is something about which members of local authorities and others concerned with health administration are somewhat exercised in their minds.  It is a pity there is no provision in the Bill for large-scale grants for cancer research and for an enlightened approach to the considerable financial burden placed on any family unfortunate enough to have a member stricken with cancer, terminal or otherwise.  I welcome the introduction of section 76 <Col N="1049" /> for the purpose of controlling drug abuse.  This control is long overdue. I shall not go into this matter in detail now.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that special emphasis should be placed on preventive medicine?  Such medicine is safer and ultimately cheaper.  The more we engage in this kind of activity the more economies we can effect in the long run.  The point has been made to me that, when mass radiography is advertised, there should be special emphasis on the danger of lung cancer because that is something which frightens the general public to some extent and, if this aspect were concentrated upon, one would get many more people availing of this service and in the course of the examinations, we would discover heart ailments and chest ailments.  Nobody pays much attention to posters calling attention to chronic bronchitis.</P>

      <P>I have practically finished.  The Bill must be welcomed because of the many useful provisions, but the fact that the method of financing the service will not be changed in any way and that local authority representation is unfair causes me to have grave reservations about the Bill as a whole.  When we come to deal with these particular sections on Committee Stage I will again be talking to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank all the Senators for the very kind things they said about me.  I do not think I merit them, but it was very nice to hear them. I should say that the Bill before the House is the work of many people, people who work silently and without advertising themselves.  There were the people who prepared the FitzGerald Report, the people who prepared the three other reports, professional people and people interested in public health, the draftsman and the absolutely dedicated and splendid officers of my Department.  The Bill was also the responsibility of two of my predecessors <Col N="1050" /> so we had better get our sights in order in so far as I can be held to be responsible for the Bill itself. It was, of course, examined in great detail by the Government.  Nevertheless, I thank the Seanad for the very kind reception they have given to the Bill. I think Senator Boland was the only Senator I heard speaking who sounded as if he would like, perhaps, to tear up the Bill and write another one. There was criticism of various clauses by some Senators, but Senator Boland seemed more hostile than all the other Senators together.</P>
      <P>I shall deal as briefly as I can with the enormous number of points raised, many of which will be more relevant for consideration on Committee Stage. With regard to expanding populations and changes in population, quite obviously we may have to change the character of the boards in future years. I hope the Dublin conurbation will not increase excessively but, if it is necessary to change the character of the board, this will have to be done by amending legislation.  I have not made any decision so far as to how to confer a majority upon the local authority representatives on the regional health boards, but I imagine that in most cases it will be through an increase in the number of representatives in relation to the total size of the board.  I still do not believe that local authority representatives will vote <i>en bloc</i> against the professional representatives.  It might happen in the case of some boards on occasion but I do not believe it would happen in the case of many boards.  Nevertheless, I am yielding to the request made to me that local authority representatives should be in a majority.  I trust the members of these regional boards will meet in their corporate capacity and that they will work together as a team, understanding each other's point of view and doing excellent executive work.  From the point of view of numbers, if the boards are to work effectively I believe the number should be in or around 30.  I could not possibly conceive designing a board which would satisfy all those wanting representation.  I do not believe such a large board would be able to do really effective work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the enormous turnover <Col N="1051" /> of work in the Dublin Health Authority, I have already explained that there can be delegation of authority to the chief executive officer.  I shall, however, have a management examination made throughout the country.  We will ask the managers to give us the number of orders they had to make or the decisions they had to take, which did not relate to staff or remuneration, or the decisions about eligibility of service relating to day-to-day management of the whole of the health business.  From that examination we will be able to estimate to what extent we can recommend some further delegation of authority to the CEOs other than that specified in the Bill at the moment.  Delegation can be done under section 16 (4) (e) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I decided I would appoint the chairman and vice-chairman of the regional hospital boards because they will be doing not alone the work of the Hospitals Commission but also some of the work of my Department in the planning of hospital services in the future.  In view of the huge capital commitments involved and the fact that the central Government provides, in one way or another, some 75 per cent of the cost of the health services, and a very considerable amount of that cost relates to hospitals, it is only right, I think, that I should have some clear-cut and definite relationship with the regional hospital boards.</P>
    <P>In reply to the Senator who raised the point about crossing regional hospital board boundaries, people can cross such boundaries; in other words, patients can be sent from, say, Galway to Dublin for specialist treatment.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that we should abolish completely the present medical card, but even the Fine Gael Party, in their proposal for an insurance scheme, made it absolutely clear that people in the lower income group could not be included in an insurance scheme and, therefore, in one way or another, there would still have to be some kind of test even if an insurance scheme replaced the present rating system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not be <Col N="1052" /> required to contribute.  I think that is what the Minister has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>But you still have to have some way of distinguishing between them and the middle and upper income groups.  Senator Boland objects to the Minister controlling the level of expenditure of the health boards and, at the same time, he holds that the local authority should have the right to refuse to raise its share of the cost. Now that is inconsistent.  I think a local authority should not have power without also having financial responsibility for raising the money.</P>
      <P>There have been complaints about the budgetary control which the Minister exercises in this Bill, but I do not believe it will prevent the development of an effective health service.  It is a good thing to have proper budgetary control.  Supplementary sums can be secured in an emergency of any kind with the Minister's permission.  I assure the House if there should be a disaster, an outbreak of some fever or any difficulty of that kind, that emergency expenditure can be sanctioned by telephone if necessary.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was made that as Minister for Health I should make quite sure that the Department has a complete and absolute stranglehold over all these new authorities.  I do not think that is true.  I think the formation of the new bodies is a step towards the devolution of authority in health administration.  Of course, the Minister for Health must have ultimate responsibility; he has responsibility to the Government for the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Boland made what I think was rather a joke about the number of bodies involved in administering the health services.  He included the local advisory committees, which are advisory bodies, and from the point of view of Parkinson's law they cannot be included in the number of bodies doing executive work.  If he had made the comparison by including the present number of health authorities and the present number of consultative local committees that exist at the present time he would have found that the figure is 60 compared with his figure of 44.  I do not think such calculations are genuine.  It must be borne in mind <Col N="1053" /> that we are having larger regional boards but I do not think there will be a Parkinsonian result.</P>
    <P>Some Senators referred to the relationship of regional health boards to the local government regional areas. We have tried, as far as possible, to draw the regions to correspond with the regional areas for local government planning purposes and for tourist purposes. I need not go into detail about how far we departed from that.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan spoke at length about the need for specialists in the health services.  I agree with a lot of what he said.  I hope the people who will join the regional health boards and the regional hospital boards will not only be specialists but people with a good general administrative sense.  I think that is very important.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop, who made a very helpful and good contribution to the debate, asked why psychiatric nurses are to have a special representation on health boards while obstetric nurses are not to have such representation.  I am afraid we could not divide the nursing community up into its various categories in such a way as to provide two places for nurses, other than psychiatric nurses.  Psychiatric nurses have a separate register and different training and this was the only way we could make the division.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators from the Dublin area asked what will happen when the regional health boards are formed if there are still no representatives on the Dublin Corporation.  I understand that the powers that the Minister for Local Government has to fill vacancies in subordinate boards consequential on his dissolving Dublin Corporation are very wide.  Either Mr. Garvin, the Commissioner, on his own or with a number of persons could be appointed.  I cannot make a pronouncement on that at the present time.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald suggested that section 10 of the Bill could be used to establish three regional health authorities, presumably by making the proposed health boards into joint bodies, but it is not intended to use section 10 for that purpose.  The general purpose of that section is to enable <Col N="1054" /> health boards to undertake joint action in order to provide facilities where the economies of scale would make that worthwhile, such as, for example, the payment of chemists and doctors.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop referred to the necessity of bearing in mind the importance of the teaching hospitals when appointing members to regional hospital boards.  That will certainly be done. Quite evidently, in the case of the three very large bodies we shall have to take into account the importance of teaching hospitals.  Senator Jessop referred to the difficulties in connection with the method of appointing consultants under Comhairle na nOspidéal.  We already have a precedent in that the Local Appointments Commission, when making certain types of appointments where teaching hospitals are involved, have departed from normal procedure, and has a committee of selection formed in a special way in which the teaching hospitals and universities are represented.  This is a good precedent for our being able to work out, over a period, some new method of selection procedure which will satisfy the medical confraternities.  Senator Jessop also raised some very important matters in relation to teaching appointments and the formation of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  These points have been discussed with the President of University College and with Senator Professor Jessop, Trinity College.  They are reasonable points and we shall consider, on Committee Stage, whether section 40 setting up Comhairle na nOspidéal requires further amendment.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Keery, the chief executive officer's post will be open to people outside those engaged in local authority service.  The terms of reference will be sufficiently wide to attract people with the required administrative experience.  The selection of each administrative centre of each regional board is being left to the boards themselves. If they cannot decide I shall have the rather unpleasant duty of making the decisions and will, surely, make some enemies in borderline cases. Senator Keery asked, with regard to the removal of a chief executive officer, what the nature of the inquiry would be.  The local inquiry into the proposed <Col N="1055" /> removal of the chief executive officer will normally be held in private, whereas an inquiry into the proposed closure of a hospital will normally be held in public with the press in attendance.</P>
    <P>Senator Bourke raised some matters in relation to the security of existing district medical officers now that the choice of doctor system is coming in.  I have given an undertaking&mdash;and I do not think it is necessary to put this into the Bill&mdash;that no district medical officer need have any fear that he is going to be dismissed or that he will lose his position.  All district medical officers will be retained until normal retiring age.  Many of them will be required in the remoter areas.  We already offer doctors, practising in remote areas, additional salaries, and in future we shall have to do all we can to attract doctors to practise in these areas.  I can see the inevitable retention of the district medical officer as distinct from the doctor in private practice who engages in a fee per service operation.  Unless there are some changes we shall need these people and we may even have to appoint new district medical officers in some remote areas in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Bourke also raised an interesting question, whether <Col N="1056" /> consultants of health board hospitals and voluntary hospitals, to be employed by the regional hospital boards, would be subject to the routine regimen of the hospitals to which they were assigned.  An arrangement has been made as a result of consultations with the consultants' organisations.  I need not go into detail but the Senator need have no fears in regard to regional hospital boards being unable to appoint consultants who have functions both in voluntary and health board hospitals.</P>
      <P>I have to some extent dealt with the organisation of these boards and other matters of organisation and now I had better say something in reply to the many observations made about the services. First of all, I should like to remind the House that the volume of health services expenditure, after eliminating inflationary cost increases, has doubled since 1958 and the volume of our gross national product has increased by about 50 per cent in the same period.  We always have to be careful not to allow the cost of social services to increase beyond the growth of real production but certainly we have endeavoured to expand the health services enormously.  When I mention the fact that the actual volume of expenditure has doubled in the last ten years I should like also to mention that by international comparisons we are in the top bracket countries in regard to effective health services.  We still have very great improvements to make and many changes to make and I am not being complacent when I say that, judged by the well-known statistics available from the United Nations handbooks in relation to death rates, life expectancy and so on, we are making progress and we are among the leaders in that respect.  Our job is to see that we make further progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to mention, by the way, that with the exception of remarks about mental handicap not many Senators, and indeed not many Deputies in the other House, spoke in detail about mental illness.  This is perfectly natural and I find myself as Minister for Health having constantly to remind myself that in about ten years time mental illness is going to play an even more overwhelming part <Col N="1057" /> in our lives than it does at present.  We are paying attention to this and we are improving the mental illness services but we have got to go a great deal further.  I will not go into the future but I feel the stress of modern existence and people's acceptance of that stress is going to present us with tremendous problems.  In fact the effect of modern stress is already presenting not only psychiatric specialists but GPs and consultants with some pretty frightening problems.  We have constantly to watch the emphasis we place on the various types of health services offered in relation to the growing importance of mental illness and health as it reveals itself not only in this country but in every other country.</P>
    <P>Some Senators did suggest that we were not doing enough in relation to prophylactic and preventive services. I have not given in detail what I propose to do in the child health services but this will be announced next Monday when I will be opening a course for assistant county medical officers.  I should like to say that my greatest enthusiasm is for the development of preventive services for young people and the development of child health services.  We are going ahead with this and I hope that we will have a sufficient number of examinations between a child's birth and the child leaving primary school so as to give the child every opportunity to arrive at later life in a healthy condition.  As I say, that is one of my greatest enthusiasms.</P>
    <P>It is not true, therefore, to say that prophylactic or preventive services are being ignored.  I might also say that we will be expanding our publicity services in the coming financial year and the number of films and leaflets and the amount of publicity in relation to all aspects of the health services will be steadily expanded because I believe they are of very great importance.</P>
    <P>Senator J. Fitzgerald suggested that the Bill was only a watered down version of the White Paper proposals but all the changes proposed in the White Paper are provided for in the Bill, every single one of them.  I wish to make that clear.  I do not think I need go into detail about sections 55 and <Col N="1058" /> 58 which do in fact provide for free out-patient service and drugs, medicines and appliances for children suffering from prescribed long-term illnesses or disabilities.  In section 51 the health boards will be empowered to provide in-patient service for children in all income groups suffering from certain long-term diseases and disabilities and I am certain that one of those which will be prescribed will be mental handicap.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop raised a number of matters in connection with the information services which he regards as being essential.  He and some other Senators mentioned this and I will consider whether we can adjust the terms of the Bill in relation to the particular arrangements available to health authorities to provide information services in order to see whether they cannot be made a little bit more mandatory. It is remarkable that only one health authority up to now has provided a genuine information service. We will look into that matter on Committee Stage.  I should like to see that kind of development continue much more rapidly.  Senator Lyons and some other Senators raised the question of the public being educated on the danger of drugs.  I am awaiting a report from the working party on dangerous drugs in regard to what they think should be done in the way of education.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the necessity to give an opportunity to general practitioners to have more close connections with the general hospitals. There was general agreement on it, and I do not intend to go into it in detail now.  Senators seemed to imply that we are behindhand in the provision of places for severely and moderately handicapped children.  We have about 1,500 extra places being arranged and provided for.  We are working as fast as we can.  We depend on the wonderful religious orders who have helped us along throughout the years, with assistance from some splendid lay organisations.</P>
    <P>I repeat that there will be 1,500 extra places available over the next year or two when we shall be able to provide places for all the severely <Col N="1059" /> handicapped and moderately handicapped of whom we have knowledge. We have taken the views of those who have written the report in this respect. If I have one priority in so far as a particular field of activity is concerned, it is to provide that all those children can get properly looked after.  I have been quite aware of all that Senators said in regard to the anguish of parents of such children and their despair because some of the children have to go to mental hospitals, although everything possible is being done for them there.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop made some very important comments on the matter of general practitioners in this country.  I wish to say now that I believe group practice will develop.  The Todd Report made some important statements in regard to the general practitioner world.  It is quite evident that they will require some further training in the future, and it is possible that encouragement will be given to them to attain some specialist knowledge from the consultants in general and regional hospitals&mdash;some slight speciality in a particular discipline that will mean the growth of group practice, particularly in the more remote rural parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who said there should be some sort of apprenticeship in this field and I have examined the reports of the Royal College of Practitioners in regard to two English hospitals. There has been an arrangement with the board of one hospital that students should have an opportunity of moving around with a general practitioner when they have passed the medical degree examinations.</P>
    <P>Senator Lyons suggested that we could be doing some research on rheumatology in Galway.  That would be beyond our means at the moment, but the consultant most recently appointed in Galway has special knowledge of rheumatics and arthritis.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the nursing profession, which I have not time to deal with in detail.  This is a great Irish vocation, and people have said that we train more nurses than we need.  Of course many of them go <Col N="1060" /> abroad, some of them come back and some of them go permanently away. The whole hospital system in England would collapse were it not for Irish nurses.  As I have said, nursing has been a very great vocation for Irish girls.  Indeed the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently told me that he found ten Irish nurses in Kuwait, which shows how far-flung our nurses are throughout the world.  We are keeping a careful eye to see there will not be any apparent scarcity in regard to the placement of nurses throughout the country.  The situation may, of course, change from one year to another, but there are no real permanent shortages of nurses here except in very tiny areas. We have asked an Bord Altranais and the Matrons' Association to establish clearly the whole question of nursing shortages, to examine problems regarding nurse-patient ratio in hospitals and to do everything they can to advise us on these matters.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators asked about home helps.  I agree that home helps should be available to everybody who requires them but they will still be scarce even when the health boards are getting sufficient money.  It will not be easy to get home helps to deal with everybody, but I hope I am wrong in this.  There has been consideration of the entire principle of community associations, with the help of voluntary organisations, providing part-time home helps for this very valuable service. As has been said here, I am quite sure the people in the higher and middle income groups will be willing to make contributions towards home help for those in the lower income groups who will receive this service free of charge.  First of all, we have to see how many people will be available.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the fee for service principle for doctors.  We naturally are considering such matters as the remoteness of patients in relation to fees and also the provision of a guaranteed minimum income for doctors in regard to fee for service in remote areas.  These matters are all included in negotiations taking place.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Boland who suggested we should establish a formulary for drugs.  He said there are <Col N="1061" /> drugs with the same content which cost three times the price from one manufacturer as against another. However, with the aid of a computer we should be able to devise some kind of formulary so that we would be able to analyse the cost of drugs in an effort to try to keep down the cost to the people who so badly need them.  I cannot go into detail on this matter now but Senators will appreciate that the control of the retail price of drugs is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We have co-operated with that Department in cases where the prices of drugs seemed to be excessively high.</P>
    <P>There is a course of training in radiology being conducted at the present time.  There are about four or five doctors engaged in this training. St. Luke's and some other voluntary hospitals co-operate in running the training.  It lasts for about four years. It will therefore be some time before the training of this group is completed. I may add, in reply to Senator Quinlan's question, that radiologists are scarce, not only here but over the whole of Europe.</P>
    <P>A number of questions were asked about food additives and ingredients added to food, and so forth.  It would take too long to explain to the House what we can do under existing legislation to prohibit the use of certain additives and what we will be able to do when the Poisons and Drug Bill is passed some time during this year. We intend to take every possible action to have sufficient control over a wide variety of products and substances for the sake of the health of the community.  It would take far too long to give the details of it.</P>
    <P>Senator Seán Walsh made a complaint about the medical night service in Dublin.  I wish he would give me some examples because my Department have not received letters of complaint in this regard and people are not afraid to write to me or to the Department when they receive what they regard as very bad medical service. So, I should like to hear more about this because I have not had any complaints about failure to provide prompt medical assistance at night in the city of Dublin.  As Senator Walsh <Col N="1062" /> said, with the development of group practice there will be less cause for this than there is now but I would like to hear complaints about it if they exist.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop asked why we could not include a provision giving general practitioners the right of entry into hospitals.  This is scarcely appropriate for direct legislative provision.  By administrative action under section 25 of the Bill we can do this but to put it as a statement into the Bill might cause difficulties for us because we do have, naturally, to have the consent of the medical profession to this and it has to be done by way of negotiation in certain cases because of the particular rights of the doctors in various hospitals. I think it would be better if we do it by administrative action and through general discussion with everybody involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton asked if there is any element of compulsion on school managers in section 65, subsection (4). There is a right under the subsection to require a manager to provide facilities, which is quite reasonable and, in fact, is a re-enactment of an existing provision in section 32 of the Health Act, 1953.  In the year 1970 it is quite reasonable to suggest that school managers should be agreeable to health examinations in the primary schools over which they have authority.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, it is rather late to talk in great detail about the whole of the controversy in relation to the concentration of hospital facilities.  We have already had some excellent speeches about it from both sides of the House, including a recent speech by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  I have got to listen to experts on the subject.  It is no good listening to the man-in-the-street.  I have got to listen to people who I believe can tell me whether mortality can be reduced; whether people will remain a lesser time in hospital; if we can have more healthy people by the concentration of acute surgery and medical services in large hospitals.  My decision will be based on that and no one is going to dissuade me from taking the right course if I believe we can have less mortality and a better health service thereby.  But, I do want <Col N="1063" /> to say that I cannot see why people think that a hospital becomes downgraded or inferior when, first of all, there is a far better out-patient service provided by visiting consultants, with all the laboratory equipment required in the hospital, when, secondly, general practitioners from the area can have a greater interest in the hospital, enter it and look up their patients there and, thirdly, when the obstetrical facilities in that hospital can be continued and even improved and when, fourthly, in the area there has been, not a concentration of services, but a decentralisation of services through development of the public nursing service, through the choice of doctor principle, through greater domiciliary care for old and sick people and through the provision of all the services that can be seen as possible under this Bill.  I just do not believe that a county hospital is downgraded if all those things are happening at the same time.  One has to think of the total services available to people in the area within ten, fifteen or twenty miles of such a hospital.</P>
    <P>I should say, also, that while I cannot predict this absolutely, I do not believe that eight or ten years from now it will be possible to appoint a single surgeon to a hospital in this country, if the implications of the Todd Report are fully appreciated.  If the Todd Report is implemented in Great Britain there will be such a development of speciality work by surgeons and by consultants of various kinds that I do not think it will be possible to have a single surgeon consultant unless he did simply the simplest dry surgery, the very simplest operations.  The actual fact is that we have now a tremendous growth of specialisation, specialisation to the point that all the conditions which affect, for example, a child from birth to four years of age can now be dealt with by special paediatric surgeons of a great number of different types of disciplines.  There are paediatric surgeons solely specialising in cardiac conditions of new born babies.  This kind of specialisation is growing and growing and there is nothing we can do to stop it growing.  It simply means that more <Col N="1064" /> and more when a person becomes ill and has to be hospitalised the situation will be that there will be always more than one consultant to look at him at the time of the operation and a great deal more laboratory apparatus will be required and it will be impossible to get people who wish to have full time work and a great deal of experience in a particular speciality unless they are appointed to a sufficiently large hospital.</P>
    <P>These are the facts and all I can say is that I will consult the local advisory committee of any county hospital where these changes may have to take place and will have regard to all the facts and all the circumstances involved but it is the kind of change that is taking place not only in relation to the medical world but in a great many other activities where science is involved.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators asked about the regulations that are coming before the Dáil and the Seanad in relation to the standards to be adopted for the medical card group and the answer is that the House can either accept or reject the draft and if they reject it then I will have to bring another draft before the Dáil and the Seanad.  The Seanad can imagine that if you had a long debate proposing endless amendments in regard to the standards of means tests of that kind, the debate might never end and the Minister might be in very great difficulty because there could be so many permutations and combinations in regard to various ways of calculating people's means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be able to explain to me the difference between regulations in draft and regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>When a regulation in draft comes before the Dáil and the Seanad and when it is passed by both Houses it becomes a regulation.  As far as I know that is the position.  I was asked a number of questions about means tests but, perhaps, we had better leave these until Committee Stage as some of them are rather complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Boland asked about the change in the value of money.  He is <Col N="1065" /> right in saying that if you take the date when the means test was last fixed in 1965-66 at £1,200 a year you would have to change the figure to £1,450.  But in answer to the Senator the Minister for Social Welfare and I would have to agree about any changes that would be made so that they would be the same for the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare in connection with social welfare insurance.  It is impossible for me to say what changes are likely to take place.  If the Senators work out the changes in the cost of living they will find that if you go back to 1958, £1,200 is a reasonable figure.  It depends on how far you go back as to whether you decide it is no longer reasonable.  I do not think that is something we can debate tonight.</P>
    <P>I must contradict a statement made by Senator Belton who said that in the White Paper we said that rates would be frozen permanently at the 1965-66 level.  The White Paper at paragraph 116 quite clearly said that the Government had decided to make arrangements which would ensure that the total cost of the services falling on local rates in respect of the year 1966-67 would not exceed the cost in respect of the year 1965-66.  It goes on to make certain statements about local rates not being entirely suitable as a form of taxation or that they were now representing a very heavy cost to the community.  That was the only promise made and that promise was kept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I referred to the White Paper.  I referred to statements made by previous Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I should have to get the statements made by previous Ministers before I could discuss this matter.  I wanted to quote the White Paper which is the authentic document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people suggested that we should put the rate of the statutory grant at some specific figure above 50 per cent.  I do not think that would be practicable.  The amount varies from 54 per cent to, I think, 57.8 per cent <Col N="1066" /> in various health authorities at present. Naturally, we shall always do the best we can to make contributions to supplement the rates in every area Senators might be interested to know that in relation to all health expenditure as expressed in the cost of living index analysis of the expenditure of households for what, generally speaking, is the middle income group, health expenditure is reckoned to be 7s 6d per week per household.  That compares with 45/- per week expenditure on drink or tobacco.  I shall not comment any further on that; I merely mention it in passing.</P>
    <P>Many Senators spoke about the heavy incidence of health charges on the rates.  The House is aware of what the Minister for Local Government has done in the way of legislation to enable the rates to be paid by instalments and to enable an extra rate to be levied to assist in the reduction of rates to necessitous persons.  Although strictly it does not appertain to my Department, I should like to mention that I think rates by instalments should help because a person who smokes 20 ordinary cigarettes a day is paying about £65 a year in cigarette tax Naturally, the same person is appalled at the thought of paying £65 rates on his house in two instalments at £32 10s each.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He can control his smoking.  He cannot control his rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but they do not control the smoking.  There are other comparisons which were made by the Minister for Local Government on this matter.  I think the petrol tax expenditure on a car of medium size before the last increase in petrol tax if the car travelled 10,000 miles in a year, was, again, between £60 and £65 I do not say that the rating position is perfect.  The Minister for Local Government has a committee that has been examining it but I should mention that rates, as a percentage of the total expenditure of the State in all forms, have been falling in recent years and rates as a percentage of gross national production have not risen.  May I again mention that 75 per cent of all <Col N="1067" /> health services expenditure is paid by central Government although, admittedly, that does not benefit some of the towns and urban and city areas where there is no agricultural grant and very inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but my particular criticism on this point was based on the valuation system to which the rates apply.  This is antique and very inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you increase the valuation the rates will go down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like at this hour of the night to be briefed by somebody to speak on the subject of valuation.  Senator FitzGerald and other Senators would know far more about it than I do.  The whole matter of the growth of valuation and the changes that have occurred are an utter mystery to me and I am sure we shall have to examine this matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Belton raised the question of loan charges.  There are separate arrangements for the recoupment of authorised loan charges to health authorities.  Overdraft interest is not recognised as recoupable health expenditure. I have had complaints about this and I have asked my Department, following the raising of the matter in the Dáil, to take up again with the Department of Finance the question of more frequent payment of health grant instalments.  I think I have answered a great many questions and that the remainder <Col N="1068" /> of them can be answered in the course of Committee Stage.  Again, I should like to thank the Seanad for the very helpful and constructive debate which we have had and I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I believe we can make progress there.  I should like to give a very gentle warning that I believe that a great many amendments which I accepted were in the minds of the Senators and I do not know if I shall be able to accept as many amendments on Committee Stage here.  Many of them would be very obvious to either House.  I hope I shall not be asked to accept amendments that would better the Bill too much or make it difficult for me to maintain the principles of the Bill which I regard as very valuable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not ask the Minister to accept amendments that he has already accepted.  Before the question is put may I, by way of explanation, say that there seems to be a misunderstanding in regard to the time schedule agreed on?  I understand Senator Nash wished to speak and it is only fair to him to record that fact.  Certainly, it was not intended to crush him out.  I understand he wanted to speak and there was some misunderstanding and, as a result, he did not get his opportunity.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, 28th January, 1970.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 28th January, 1970.</P>
