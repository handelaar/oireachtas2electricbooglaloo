    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>1.  In subsection (7), lines 5 and 6, to delete &ldquo;unless the Minister otherwise directs,&rdquo;&mdash;(Senator McDonald).</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning we were discussing this amendment.  The Minister was not too clear.  I suspect that the Minister in including this novel piece of legislation is ensuring that in future where members of a State board disagree or do not toe the line according to the Department the board shall not be rendered ineffective by members walking out.  The Minister has included this novel idea to ensure that even if they all go the chairman will be able to act on behalf of the board.  I think this is quite unnecessary.  In starting a new board like this we should have complete faith in the personnel to ensure that they carry out their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> There should be no need to include any provisions like this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In most legislation where a quorum is laid down, invariably it is fixed as being one-quarter the total number which goes to make up the board.  If that quarter does not come to a whole number the next highest number is taken.  One-quarter of 11 would be brought up to four.  I am surprised that the figure is five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Eleven divided by four equals two-and-three-quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes the subsection even worse.  The Minister should look at this figure of five, and fix the figure on the basis laid down in most local government legislation. This frightens me as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one could apply the same type of logic to this assembly here.  Let Senators cast their minds back to this assembly at about 1.55 a.m.  I do not think anybody would seriously contend that there was a full attendance of the Seanad, but, nevertheless, we were transacting important business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a quorum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>A quorum is obviously a necessary device that must be included in the Bill in order that the board can function properly.  The provision that the Minister can direct otherwise at certain times is also included advisedly because, as I pointed out last night, there may be occasions when a very quick decision is necessary. It is conceivable that on such occasions it might not be possible physically to assemble all the members. The Minister can then direct the number of the quorum.  This section was amended in the Dáil and was acceptable to Members of that House.  The suggestion would appear to be that it is open to abuse by the Minister.  There is also a suggestion that the other members of the board would not be present at the meeting in question&mdash; they would be lying down on the job, so to speak&mdash;and that the Minister for some unexplained reason would be able to get away with this type of practice.  The provisions for a quorum <Col N="1605" /> such as is laid down in this Bill works satisfactorily in cases of many other boards under the aegis of my Department and I would expect under other Departments also.  Therefore, I can see no reason whatever for accepting the amendments and I do not propose to accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience of these matters there is no analogy between the meeting of the Seanad which ended at 1.55 a.m.&mdash;I was not there then&mdash;and a meeting of this board.  One is a deliberate assembly while the other is an executive body.  As far as I know, the normal procedure in regard to executive bodies is that it is left to them as trustworthy people to determine their own rules and regulations and it is normal to indicate that a quorum shall be a number specified in the constitution of the body in question unless the executive body otherwise determine because they realise that, say, a half dozen people are going to California in the morning so they must reduce the number from five to three.  The Minister and the Seanad will realise that I am not being mischievous.  We are here debating this Bill.  The horse will not be dying while this legislation is going through the Houses and the Bill could possibly go back to the Dáil in the autumn, without suffering great injury, if we make good points here.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to various statutory provisions in which this subsection appears.  The Seanad would be interested to know whether the Minister has found it advantageous to have this subsection whether, in relation to other bodies to which this subsection applies, he has been invited to give such a direction, and whether it has been found useful and necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously since it has been included in other Acts such as the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act, 1958, in which the relevant subsection is that the quorum for a meeting of the board shall, unless the Minister otherwise directs, be three. It is included in order to provide against contingencies such as the ones I have mentioned.  I cannot conceive of any reason why this provision should <Col N="1606" /> be abused.  I have endeavoured to point out the advantages of its inclusion.  For that reason the argument against it, in my opinion anyway, does not stand up.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not strange that a section setting out the manner in which a meeting shall take place, and the procedure of the board, should not outline the manner in which members will receive notice of meetings when they are being convened?  The Minister's remark about being able to vary the quorum would seem to indicate that, from time to time, there might be a need for urgent meetings and that this was a reason why the quorum could be lowered.  If the board have to meet as a matter of urgency and if the quorum is, therefore, lowered by the Minister, would that not suggest that there could be caucus meetings? That would be very wrong.  A subsection should be written into the section outlining the manner in which members would receive notice of meetings.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is looking for precedents I would point out to him that subsection (4) sets out the manner in which the members of the board will vote.  It does not follow the normal precedent which is to state that the manner in which members of the board vote shall be recorded.  Subsection (6) states that subject to the provisions of this Act, the board shall regulate their procedure by rules or otherwise.  Is it not strange that the board are not allowed to stipulate what the quorum shall be?</P>

      <P>The first part of the question was in relation to the section not having included in it the manner in which members are to be sent notices of pending meetings in view of the fact that the Minister has suggested that meetings might have to take place at short notice and the Minister may vary the quorum for that reason. Rather than have it suggested afterwards that this was a caucus favourable to the Minister and who met at his behest without adequate notice being sent out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand subsection (2) and I should like some elucidation.  I would have thought that the word &ldquo;income&rdquo; is misused in reference to section 14 (c) where there is an exclusion of something that could not be income.  You do not get income by borrowing.  You get a receipt.  You receive money but you do not receive income.  You receive capital sums.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that instead of the words &ldquo;if the amount of the income exceeds such amount as may be determined by the Minister&rdquo; the section should read &ldquo;if the amount is less than the amount&rdquo;.  Surely it is only if it is less that there will be an increase in the grant.  Is that right?</P>

      <P>Paragraph (b) provides that the board may purchase, take or let on lease or sell horses.  I am sorry I was not here for Second Reading.  Does this mean that the board will have a similar function to that of the National Stud in buying or leasing stallions or mares of different types?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The words &ldquo;other premises&rdquo; might be construed quite narrowly as meaning premises analogous to offices.  It would seem to me that this board, if it is to acquire horses, should have the right to own a farm.  I know that at present in regard to the existing tax laws it does not matter whether one has a farm or not if one has got a stallion on the land but that law might change.  It should be changed in my view.  This board would have power to acquire property other than premises analogous to offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too happy with the Minister's explanation. I feel he is not too sure of the reply. Under this section they may buy Irish draught mares.  They are a scarece commodity; they are a dying race and it is very desirable that they do purchase these.  It says here: &ldquo;purchase, take, or let on lease or sell horses.&rdquo;  Can they lease stallions to farmers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Those horses would be leased to a school of equitation, to a show jumping committee or to somebody like that?  Not to farmers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the board have the power to lease Irish draught stallions for stud purposes to farmers?  If the board has not the power to do that I think the whole scheme is lost because draught horses are a dying race.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, yes, but the due performance of their duties is <Col N="1610" /> not the breeding of horses but the securing of a situation in which horses can be bred.  It is not contemplated that they go in on a large scale for the breeding of horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that this is very desirable.  The Minister will agree that the Irish draught has become world famous for the production of the chasing, show jumping and hunter class. Due to the mechanisation of farms these are becoming much scarcer and anything the board can do to ensure that we have sufficient mares is most desirable.  I feel the Minister should ensure that that aspect will be pushed forward.  I feel it should be the principal function of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries lease bulls for the production of high-class cattle and also rams.  It is only right that when we are trying to build up this type of horse, which is becoming very scarce, the Department should lease Irish draught stallions and place them in areas where it is necessary to improve the breed and increase the number.</P>

    <P>he shall during the period (in this section referred to as the secondment period) commencing upon his becoming entitled under the Standing Orders of that House to sit therein and ending either when he ceases to be a member of that House or, if it should sooner happen, upon his resignation or retirement from such employment or upon <Col N="1612" /> the termination of such employment by the Board, stand seconded from such employment.</P>
    <P>I have looked through several pieces of legislation dealing with semi-State organisations and bodies and I could not find the piece at lines 24 and 25: &ldquo;Or upon the termination of such employment by the Board&rdquo;.  This seems to be something new.  I feel it is a pity because it may happen that people would offer themselves for election to Seanad Éireann.  An officer or servant of this board might get a Seanad nomination from the Bloodstock Breeders or even the board itself might be a nominating body and a member could find himself elected for one term.  Perhaps I am wrong but I think that under this section a man could find his superannuation discontinued and the board can just summarily dismiss him.  Employees of the ESB or CIE can keep their superannuation alive and if they should cease to be Members of either House of the Oireachtas they can revert to their original employment.</P>
    <P>This is desirable.  If people from different walks of life have the flair and the ability to serve they should be able to serve as members.  If this is allowed to go through it could be the thin end of the wedge and perhaps next year we would find that teachers or some other section of the community who are either directly or indirectly employed by the State if they became Members of either House of the Oireachtas would have broken service as far as their pension rights were concerned.  I am worried lest this be the case here.  I do not see any good reason why the Minister should want this in and, therefore, I wish to press, the amendment strongly.  As I said, I cannot find a similar provision in legislation of this nature.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  Perhaps, the Minister might be able to clear up this matter.  If it means that a person who is elected to either House has to resign from his employment, then I agree that it should be taken out.  It would be a tremendous infringement of civil rights.  Perhaps this is tied up with subsection (c) which relates to superannuation <Col N="1613" /> rights and which are in question.  Perhaps the Minister could clear up the problem in regard to (a) and then we might be able to discuss the problem in relation to superannuation which is of primary importance.  I cannot quite understand whether subsection (a) means that a person employed by the board would have to resign his job on election to either House.</P>

      <P>There is no question of resignation.  It is merely a definition of secondment.  The paragraph merely defines the beginning and end of the secondment period.  The effect of the amendment would be to leave unprovided for the circumstances of an officer's employment being terminated by the board.  He could hardly be on secondment from employment which he no longer held so obviously it was necessary to say that this is one circumstance in which secondment ends.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) to delete paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to have paragraph (c) clarified.  I tabled the amendment because I was not sure of the situation here.  An employee of the board should be entitled to continue, while serving as a Member of the Oireachtas, to pay his superannuation in order to keep his pension rights continuing from the board.  I think this is reasonable and this is, in fact, what is happening in every case of this kind.  We have some <Col N="1614" /> Members in this House who are seconded from their previous employment. It is most desirable that this situation should continue.  It is important that membership of the Oireachtas should be drawn from as wide a field as possible so that we can have the views of people with different backgrounds and working in different professions or occupations.  People must be encouraged to offer themselves for election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. As Senator McDonald pointed out, the existing situation is that people can be seconded and pay their full superannuation contributions themselves. This ensures their full superannuation benefits and rights.  I do not know if the draftsman of this legislation really thought about the full effects of withdrawing superannuation benefits.  You could have an employee of the board who had nine years service and if the normal period required to be eligible for superannuation benefits is, as it is under the local government code, ten years, then if that person came into this House for one year and died then his widow would be deprived of all his death benefits which would have accrued if he had stayed on and had ten years service with the board.  I hope this was not the intention of the draftsman because it would be very wrong.  Superannuation benefits cover a fairly wide range of benefits and not just simply a pension.  The pension could be lost by the type of situation I have described.  I take it this does not include sick leave benefits because normally this depends on service. If this was covered an employee could be very badly treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would make the section largely pointless. The aim of the section is to say what happens a man's pay and pension rights when he is on secondment.  In regard to pension rights what is provided is what has been evolved by the Department of Finance as the most appropriate arrangement in present day circumstance.  Formerly, Bills of this kind contained elaborate arrangements which amounted to giving a man an option of either continuing to participate <Col N="1615" /> in the pension scheme by paying his own and his employer's contributions or liquidating his pension rights by withdrawing all his contributions which were previously paid into the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since the advent of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pension Scheme it is thought that contributions under this, coupled with increased contributions under the arrangements of continuing to participate in the pension scheme, would make for an undue imposition.  On the other hand, very few people would wish to liquidate pension rights.  Therefore, the section makes a straightforward arrangement that a man continues to be pensionable while on secondment but cannot reckon the period of secondment for the purpose of arriving at the amount of the pension.  It is to be noted that it is only the pension that is affected.  Secondment would not reduce the rights to a lump sum on death or widows and orphans pensions.</P>

      <P>This does not really answer my point.  If a man had not enought service with the board and came into the House and did not qualify here, he might not be re-elected, are you going to aggregate the service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be remembered that Members of the Oireachtas must be successful in at least three general elections before being entitled to a pension.  This section would definitely penalise an officer or servant of the board should he become a Member of the House.  Last night the Minister expressed the view that he would have the best possible personnel on the board.  It is to be hoped also that this board will recruit a very highly skilled and excellent staff and it might very well be that at some stage one or other will possibly be elected to this House.  I do not think that, because of that, he should be penalised. The regulations which apply in the case of CIE, the ESB and other State and semi-State bodies should be incorporated into this Bill.  I see no reason why people in industry and other employment should be treated differently from those employed in agricultural employment. <Col N="1616" /> Agriculture gets the wrong end of the stick the whole time.  I wish the Minister would take this opportunity to bring about a speedy change.</P>

He might have served in local government for, perhaps, nine years and he might have seven years service as a member of the Oireachtas, which would give him a total of 16 years, but at the end of the time he would find himself with no vestige of pension at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the mind of the Minister, as shown in the remarks he has just made is it desirable to prevent people of high calibre employed by such bodies as are <Col N="1617" /> established under this Bill becoming Members of this House or of the Dáil? I ask this quite apart from the effect of their becoming Members in terms of superannuation rights and so on.  If the board think they are capable of doing their jobs well, even though they are Members of either House of the Oireachtas, is there any reason why they should not continue to work at their jobs, as many members of both Houses of the Oireachtas do at the moment?  Is it right there should be a statute providing that they shall cease to retain these offices or cease to be entitled to perform these services.  Is that desirable?  Is it in the national interest? Is it not better that this House be filled with people who know more about horses than I do?  Would it not be undesirable to have such a statutory requirement?</P>
      <P>There might be a person doing an excellent job with the board who, if he were elected to this House, would be prohibited from continuing his work with the board.  It might be that the board would take the view that he could no longer perform his job for the board.  That would be quite all right because the board could always remove him and make other arrangements, but is it desirable to create such a complete block as to prevent an employee becoming a Member of this House without sacrificing something which, in terms of income, might be much more valuable to him than anything he might get by the secondment involved in this section?</P>

I remember in 1948 I was riding at a flapper meeting in a place called Raheen and the horse that beat me was dyed.  These things can happen and the Irish character does not change.  In this horse industry there are so many rings, and rings within rings, that it is necessary to have strict regulations to exert some control over this industry.  The rings must be taken out of the horse industry and there must be fair play for all. What should count is the quality of the stock.</P>

      <P>The Minister may by regulations under this section provide that this Part shall not apply to any class of riding establishment specified in the regulations (by reference to such matters, including the number of horses kept, as the Minister may consider appropriate), and this Part shall apply and have effect in accordance with the provisions of any regulations for the time beings in force under this section.</P>

As Senator McDonald knows, there are many small one-horse riding establishments in the country and in the introduction of a licensing scheme it may be desirable at the beginning at any rate to go easy on these people.

      <P>It is a question of the laying down of standards of competence, size and accommodation and the provision of equipment.  We shall arrive at a norm over which licences will be issued.

      <P>What surprises me is all this talk about class and licensing but no numbers are laid down.  We all know of farmers with, perhaps, two horses who do not ride themselves but hire them out to friends who ride them at race meetings and possibly at point-to points.  Will these people come into the class or will only riding schools with nice palatial premises and up-to-date amenities who hire out hunting horses, jumpers or anything of that kind fall into that class?</P>

      <P>Section 28 (b) (ii) and (iii) states:</P>

      <P>(iii)  in relation to the personal representative of the holder of a licence, during the period of six months beginning on the date of the death of the holder.</P>
      <P>I do not think a period of six months is sufficient for an individual to take out the normal probate.  Certainly, three months is too short a time to get the title in order.  It is simply impossible to do it in that time.  It is a pity the Minister should specify time limits which from the word go, to my mind, will be non-effective.</P>

I can assure the Minister it is impossible to extract probate or personal administration within six months under the existing Finance Act if the unfortunate deceased was so foolish as to establish a private company on the advice of his advisers in an attempt to avoid duty.  Two years would be a reasonable estimate of the length of time required to get probate or personal representation.  Where there is a <Col N="1624" /> case of a person having tried to arrange to avoid duty every query that can possibly be raised will be raised by certain parts of the offices of the Estate Duty branch of the Revenue Commissioners because they are very alive to the situation.  Six months is completely inadequate in this instance.</P>

      <P>This is an unrealistic figure.  If these people were attending the Horse Show or some three-day event they would not have time to think about the post.  I am surprised the Minister should penalise people in this way.  Most of the people concerned are the type who get wholly involved in whatever meetings or competitions they are competing in.  The prescribed time for making applications for licences should be not less than 30 days.  It would be fair of the Minister to concede that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Any period for making applications could meet with the same objection that an even greater period was needed.  An amendment was accepted in the Dáil raising the period from seven to 14 days.  To put the matter in perspective, it should be <Col N="1625" /> noted that the decision to refuse a licence can only be taken when it is clear that the applicant is not willing or able to meet the requirements set out in section 29 of this Bill.  Visits of inspection and correspondence would be involved. The applicant would not be taken by surprise if he is turned down. While the section says 14 days the effective time of the notice is greater than that.  The licensee will know that he is under inspection for longer than that.  If he is serious and thinks the Department are being unreasonable 14 days seems ample time for him to make representations.  On amendment No. 5, all that the licensee has to do is request the inquiry.  Seven days seems to me to be adequate for this.  It must be remembered that the intention to revoke a licence will not lightly be formed.  Any man who gets notice of such intention will have ample warning.  He will be expected to prepare his mind as to the course of action he will follow.  In both of these cases the stipulated periods of 14 days and seven days normally afford the licensee ample time to make his representations because of the fact that he will, in practice, be under notice from inspections by representatives of the Horse Board and that his licence may well be coming under examination.  He is not being taken by surprise.  The amount of time made available to him is ample.  I am not accepting the amendments.</P>

      <P>The section is very fairly composed.  It is a fair way of dealing with the matter of granting and revoking licences.  There is almost every right given to the person concerned.  I would join with Senator McDonald in suggesting that seven days was rather short.  People who are good at managing riding establishments may not be expert in looking after their business interests. Holidays and curious weeks, like next one, result in people being utterly distracted. As I understand it any such notice that would be given would be given to the riding establishment itself which might not necessarily be the residence of people who are the proprietors of that establishment.  It might be necessary to transmit letters. A letter might arrive on a Friday. <Col N="1626" /> Time might be short for doing something about it.  Does the Minister lose much if he changes the period and substitutes a longer period than the seven days mentioned?  The section is fairly drafted.  The only point at which injustice could be caused, if Senator McDonald will forgive me, is in relation to the seven rather than the 14 days.  I am happy about the 14 days but the seven days seems short.  The Minister has referred to dealings between the Department and the person in question.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6.</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), after paragraph (d) to add the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) fails to maintain reasonable safety precautions or fails to provide adequate first-aid facilities for the people hiring the horses.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the Minister's Second Reading speech I am not satisfied that the Bill provides in any way for the safety of riders, and especially of young riders, in the proposed training establishments and riding schools.  I proposed this amendment to ensure that at least if a customer or a child who is learning to ride should fall, there will be some arrangements, or even a simple first-aid kit, to ensure that the injury will be as minimal as possible.  It should be compulsory for the riders to wear helmets. These would not be unreasonable regulations <Col N="1628" /> to write into the legislation. While the Bill shows great concern about the condition of the quarters and about the care of the animals, there is no protection in it for the public.  This has been a serious omission.  In relation to section 9, the Minister in his Second Reading speech referred to the regulations and said that broadly speaking they could be summed up as concern for the welfare of the horses and the safety of the riders.  However, I cannot see any concern for the riders in any part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDonald mentioned this particular aspect on Second Reading and I expressed the view at that Stage that riding, of its very nature, contains an element of risk.  Even the riding of ponies by children contains this element of risk. Perhaps this is one of the great attractions of the sport.  If regulations were to be introduced which would make it almost physically impossible to fall from a mount, then it would not be a sport any more.</P>
      <P>As regards the use of helmets I think the Senator will agree that most riders wear the hard type of riding cap.  I have noted this to be so at shows and gymkhanas all over the country.  This particular type of cap is in the nature of a helmet and it is advisable that riders wear a cap of that kind.  It is plainly necessary in the Bill that riding establishments have proper equipment&mdash;saddle girts, suitable harness, reins and so on in order to ensure that there is the maximum safety for riders.  Thereafter a person who conducts an intelligently-run riding establishment will suit the mount to the rider.  This is universal practice.  A young and inexperienced rider would hardly be given a very lively horse.  This will be a matter for the licensee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of this is that the accidents which occur inevitably in riding commonly occur at places not accessible to first-aid facilities of any real value.  As I said earlier one of the intrinsic dangers of horse riding is that if one bends over too far, he is liable to fall off and stick his nose in the ground but it would be impracticable to hedge the business around <Col N="1629" /> with regulations.  It is a matter that the board might consider in the general equipment of a riding establishment. Personally, I would not be prepared to recommend the type of equipment that it would be necessary to carry.  It is not unusual for people to break a leg or a collar bone in a fall from a horse but I would not know what type of first-aid equipment one could carry to deal with a serious condition such as that.  Perhaps the best type of equipment to deal with such an accident would be simply a telephone so that a doctor could be summoned immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all worried about the vast majority of these licence holders but in any walk of life there will always be the few who are careless and who are interested only in making handy money.  Many parents will be anxious that their children be taught to ride but children can be put off riding forever by being given an unsuitable pony.  Riding is now becoming a very popular pastime and I think that the provision of helmets at these establishments should be obligatory.  Surely the Minister will agree that many people or children would not have helmets of their own and I would not consider it unreasonable that licence holders would have a half dozen or so helmets available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

Because of this omission many people or children may sustain avoidable injuries and this, in turn, will fall on the ratepayers.</P>

Perhaps this would be the most useful item that could be provided apart from the usual first-aid outfit but, then, it would hardly be practicable to give a child such an outfit to carry with him when he goes riding.  We must be realistic about this. The Minister's suggestion that the board will lay down certain standards is satisfactory.  While we would hope that there would not be any serious accidents, we realise that accidents are inevitable in a sport of this kind.  I do not know what sort of first-aid outfit one could carry around that would fix a broken leg, for instance.</P>

      <P>I have got some additional information on section 23. This section covers only superannuation, that is pension, of the person concerned.  If a person becomes a Member of the Oireachtas, his period as a Member will not qualify for pension purposes.  It will not affect his other benefits such as a lump sum on death or widows' and orphans' pension. A particular case is, say, where a man with less than the minimum pensionable service becomes a Deputy or a Senator and, after a period which would have brought him up to the minimum, he becomes ill so that he cannot resume work.  He would not get a pension because a pension is for a minimum period of actual service.</P>

The same thing applies and should not apply in the case of doctors.  I do not mind saying this.  This is an old practice which went on before Fianna Fáil came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A doctor goes before a very competent board and is recommended for the position of county medical officer and gets it in competition with other very competent people who attend the interview. He is then elected to this House and he can employ a junior who has no rights but who has to do his work <Col N="1634" /> while he is in the House.  The people in the area have to put up with the qualifications of that junior while the man, who had the great qualifications before the interview board, is in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that this is relevant because the junior has no obligation to take the employment. He is lucky or happy to get it.  I feel that politics should not be made a closed shop in this country and should not be made the preserve of the self-employed. Every worker and every professional person and even the unemployed&mdash;anyone who wants to have a go and come in here&mdash;should be encouraged. It is monstrous for any sane Minister of State to bring in legislation victimising people who offer themselves and are elected to Dáil Éireann.  It is sharp practice.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is as Draconian as the Senator suggests. Under the old dispensation a person in such a position, in order to maintain his pension position, had to take very serious cuts in his income. Under this arrangement that is no longer necessary.  His pension status is merely suspended for the period while he is a Member of this House.  I do not think it is as severe as Senator McDonald suggests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>When one reads it with subsection (a) it means that the board can fire him.  Quite clearly and beyond doubt if, say, somebody with opposite views to the Minister was elected and served 7½ years not qualifying for a pension and served, say, nine years on the board before his term was up he could very well be fired and obviously the board does not have to give any reason.  He can be victimised with 17 years service to the State.</P>

      <P>The question of wrongful dismissal is fully catered for in other legislation and ought to be.  It <Col N="1635" /> is quite right.  The board cannot just dismiss a man because they do not like the colour of his eyes or the colour of his politics either.</P>

      <P>I would agree with the Minister on that but I would ask the Minister again to look at the case we were discussing of a man who under this legislation is being put in a position in which he would not be put under legislation establishing other statutory bodies, where he has no right.  At the sacrifice of a loss of income it is agreed to maintain superannuation benefit, a right which he need not exercise if the loss of income is too much for him.  The Minister has given as an excuse for this that he will have superannuation rights under membership of the Oireachtas scheme.  The Minister should view with the greatest suspicion any balance sheet or project of any person who takes into account as being one of his assets possible superannuation benefit to be got for membership of the Seanad, whatever about membership of Dáil Éireann.  I seriously urge the Minister who is a fairminded man&mdash; the Bill is fairly drafted and October will soon be with us&mdash;not to press this at this point and to consider a variation of this section so as to preserve the right, even if it involves a very complex kind of section, a kind with which I am not familiar but apparently the complexity of which has driven people to the dubious simplicity of this section which simply has the effect of possibly doing injustice to some future Fianna Fáil TD or Fianna Fáil Senator and I would not wish that to be done to him.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that since this measure is in a sense rather new, it should be allowed a trial period and if it is found to be deficient it can then be amended.  I do <Col N="1636" /> not really see the pitfalls which Senators McDonald and FitzGerald see in it and I would respectfully ask them to withdraw their amendment.</P>
