      <P>Since our last meeting Senators will have learned with deep regret of the sudden death of our colleague Senator Owen Sheehy Skeffington.</P>
      <P>Born and educated in Dublin, he entered Trinity College in 1927 and graduated from there with a first class moderatorship in modern languages.  He later studied at the Ecole Normale and at the Sorbonne and held doctorates from the Sorbonne and the University of Dublin.  He joined the academic staff of Trinity College in 1934 and was appointed reader in French in 1954.</P>
      <P>A man of strong humanist and liberal beliefs he was a central figure in many public controversies.  In debate he was fearless, ardently and relentlessly espousing the causes he championed. He was never dismayed if his point of view was a minority one and indeed seemed at times to revel in a position of isolation.</P>
      <P>First elected a Member of the Seanad in 1954 by the graduates of the University of Dublin he was again elected at the Seanad General Elections of 1957, 1965 and 1969.</P>
      <P>As a Senator he was most zealous in his parliamentary duties and rarely missed a meeting of the Seanad.  The range of his interests was wide and he employed his qualities of wit and irony to lend force and cogency to his arguments. His contributions always compelled attention.  Though few Senators had not crossed swords with him at one time or another, no one could with-hold admiration for his honesty, integrity and moral courage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of a courteous and kindly disposition in personal relations his sense of <Col N="410" /> humour endeared him to all with whom he came in contact.  In Senator Sheehy Skeffington we have lost a colleague whose gifts of intelligence, courage and humanity were widely appreciated and whose passing will be keenly felt.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Cathaoirleach and Members of this House I wish to convey to the widow and family of the late Senator our sympathy and appreciation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this is the section on which I should make the point that this Bill which does not give any civil right should give such right.  Had I an opportunity of reading carefully the Minister's remarks I could have decided whether an amendment should be put down to this section. However, I had not this opportunity earlier and I made special arrangements last evening to collect the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I made this particular point last week the Minister referred to the provision of the Sale of Goods Act as giving the necessary right which could be civilly enforced to any person who would suffer damage as a result of a breach of this Act.  I would refer the Minister to the particular section&mdash; section 13&mdash;of the 1893 Sale of Goods Act which is relative to this matter. This Act provides that where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the goods shall correspond with the description.  The decisions on that take in the matter of the quantity of goods so that if certain other sections of the Act were not availed of <Col N="411" /> by the vendor, there would be civil protection for a person damaged as a result of a container not containing what it ought to contain in accordance with the Minister's Order but there is a provision, supplementary to the Act, in Part VI, which provides that where any right, duty or liability arises under a contract of sale by implication of law, it may be negatived or varied by express agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by usage, such as to bind both parties to the contract.  There is in fact a like provision in the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, which is the Principal Act to which this is an amending Bill.  The like provision of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887 contains a saving in section 17 which provides:</P>
    <P>On the sale or in the contract for the sale of any goods to which a trade mark, or mark, or trade description has been applied, the vendor shall be deemed to warrant that the mark is a genuine trade mark and not forged or falsely applied, or that the trade description is not a false trade description within the meaning of this Act, unless the contrary is expressed in some writing, signed by or on behalf of the vendor and delivered at the time of the sale of contract to and accepted by the vendee.</P>
    <P>The commentary on this which I have from the standard textbook on this subject <i>Kerly on Trade Marks,</i> Eighth Edition, is that the saving at the end of the section is carefully expressed; that the statement required to prevent the implication of a warranty must be in writing, signed, delivered at the time of sale and accepted by the vendee.  It is not clear what &ldquo;accepted by the vendee&rdquo; means.  It can probably be construed to import at least that the vendee understood he was to get no warranty and that he completed the purchase on that footing.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any objection to an amendment to this section which I would propose to introduce on Report Stage, if the Minister were not prepared to introduce such an amendment. As I said the last day I would prefer if he drafted such an amendment. <Col N="412" /> This would be a provision giving civil rights to persons damaged by a breach of this worthwhile Act so far as it goes and should also contain a provision excluding the saving of the kind which is contained in the Principal Act and which is contained in the Sale of Goods Act and which being not excluded in the Sale of Goods Act is not a protection for the damaged person such as the Minister suggested might be available to him under the Sale of Goods Act, when he addressed the House on the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald has got me rather seriously bogged down on this because he has been quoting from sections there.  My understanding of this, as I explained during the course of the Second Reading, was and is that the affected party, the purchaser, has the right of bringing civil action under the Sale of Goods Act. I gather from the Senator's observations on this at the present time that he feels there is a saving in an original Act, the 1887 Merchandise Marks Act, whereby the supplier and the vendor can protect himself if he issued some document at the time of sale.</P>
      <P>I went into this during the course of my reply on the Second Stage.  I conveyed that the case visualised by the Senator at that time was one where maybe an importer or a packer might be found to have sold an insufficiently filled package of goods to a retailer or a distributor.  We are getting away from what is covered here&mdash;I mentioned this&mdash;that is that the purchaser of the retailed article has the right because I cannot visualise the normal retailer in the selling of the goods to the purchaser can ever arrive at a situation where he is issuing some type of document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator's reason for suggesting this amendment during the course of the Second Reading was from the point of view of protecting the retailer who would have bought from an importer or a manufacturer against the sort of consequential case which would involve him in difficulties arising from a subsequent complaint by the purchaser at the final retail end.  I cannot visualise a situation whereby the <Col N="413" /> middleman, in this case the retailer, could get himself seriously into trouble in this regard, because of the provision, as conveyed in another section of the Bill&mdash;this arose from an amendment which I accepted in the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whereby it is sufficient defence for the retailer that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all reasonable diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the necessity for the amendment at this stage.  There is no particular reason why I should be terribly anxious to get the Report Stage today.  If what the Senator is anxious for me to do is to look at all aspects of this in relation to difficulties, or the possibility of difficulties, I would be prepared to have a look at that particular section, together with what the Senator has in mind, between now and the Report Stage.  If I felt it was necessary I should be quite willing to include an amendment on the Report Stage.  If not, I would propose to give a better outline of my reasons for not accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his reply.  I referred to the Merchandise Marks Act and to the Sale of Goods Act because both have the same defect in that the provisions which give civil rights in these Acts contain also provisions which enable the vendors to deprive the buyers of these rights.  I referred to the Merchandise Marks Act for that reason.  I was primarily directing myself to the Minister's suggestion that anyone damaged by virtue of the failing to comply with the provisions of this Bill, when enacted, would be saved by the section in the Sale of Goods Act.  I referred to it particularly because there is no saving in effect for anybody damaged because the practice would be when one comes to deal with any sizable order&mdash;and Senator Nash referred to it in a particular connection&mdash;that one is given something called a guarantee which is in effect, when studied carefully, a document which deprives one of his <Col N="414" /> statutory rights which he would have had if he had not got the guarantee. This is, in effect, in the form of a document which is offered.</P>
      <P>The Minister has advisers to tell him how this would operate in fact.  I would have thought it would operate right along a chain.  I imagine the retailer would not give any document which would deprive the purchaser of any rights he might have, if damaged. The quantities of any particular retail buyer would not be large anyhow. The retailer would possibly be in a position of being liable to his buyer and having no remedy against the wholesaler or manufacturer for whom the goods were packed.  The manufacturer might not have any rights against the firm who packed the goods for him. One might be dealing with orders of a very substantial character.  No civil remedy might be possible.  Civil remedies are excellent because people are very attentive in looking after their own affairs.  It is good to alert people to their rights and to give them rights to exercise and to protect themselves.</P>
      <P>The merchandise marks code has been notorious in that it has not been enforced.  The Minister has been advised to introduce this particular measure, which I think is a weights and measures measure, as a merchandise marks code.  The history of that code is that it has not been enforced. It is desirable to give civilians the right to enforce it and to get their remedies. Obviously this is a wholly desirable Bill and is welcomed.  I wish merely to improve it to this extent by this suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might explain the purposes of section 2 (6) and (7).  Section 2 excludes people preparing goods for export from any provisions under this Bill and also allows those who intended to export to market goods packed in a manner not in accordance with this Bill if the Minister is satisfied of the authenticity of their case.  In relation to subsection (7) there is a case to be made, if the Minister agrees, where the manufacturers would put those goods on the Irish market and would take some steps towards informing the general public, <Col N="415" /> either by way of a notice inserted in the newspapers or otherwise, as to why they are doing this.  I suppose it would be interesting to know the reasons behind subsection (6).  In relation to line 35 of sub-paragraph (a) of subsection (1) might I suggest to the Minister that in any order to be made in the future there should be provision that either a weight or measure should be given both in the new system and in the existing one?  If at this stage people were told there were so many grammes in a packet they might not be too clear as to how much it contained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the Senator's first query with regard to subsections (6) and (7) let me explain first about subsection (6).  I may make an order under this subsection that the regulations may not apply to goods exported from the State.  This is rather a necessary subsection because goods manufactured in Ireland for export will be exempted from the requirements relating to the marking of quantities, and the name and address of packers as well as the requirements to mark the packets in standard quantities.  If these marks differ from those applying in the export markets the cost to the Irish manufacturer could be quite seriously increased.  In fact, it could transpire that packers might not be able to pack the goods in accordance with the regulations which could be operated in the country to which the goods were being exported.</P>
      <P>The Senator in the second part of his remarks dealt with section 2 (1) specifying arrangements to be made.  I take it that what he was referring to was the change-over to the metric system.  Perhaps I might avoid answering that for the moment and say that if the regulations here were that the packets must be as they are at the present time and if an order were made specfying that the goods must be packed in 16-ounce containers this might not be appropriate to goods exported to France or Germany.  This is the reason why provision is made under subsection (6) enabling the exporter not to be bound by the order applicable in the regulations here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> In regard to the second part of the Senator's query about the regulations in connection with weights and measrures and numbers, there is provision whereby there would be discussions before making any order with the affected parties with a view to trying to have general agreement and there will be consultation with the affected parties beforehand.  This is one of the things which are in the transitional stage at the moment in the change over to decimalisation and the metric system.  It will be worked out in such a way that the packer and manufacturer shall not be too seriously discommoded while at the same time giving effective protection for the consumer.</P>
    <P>I do not know if my explanation as to the need for subsections (6) and (7) answers the questions raised by Senators. The effect of them is that regulations which I might make in relation to weights, measures and number might not be applicable in the destination country and might give rise to a situation whereby the packer or manufacturer here might have his expenses increased by having to remark or reset a consignment.</P>
    <P>The object behind the Bill is to protect the consumers on this side I do not want to see the consumers in any country to which we export goods being fleeced or disappointed with our produce and I do not think the exclusion of items for export under this subsection will have that effect.  It is a necessary subsection in relation to exporting firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The very first line of section 2 states in effect that the Minister is not obliged to make any specific order in relation to any specific set of goods; he may, if he so desires; whereas in section 6 it is stated &ldquo;shall not&rdquo;.  In other words, the power to exempt goods for the export market or otherwise does not rest with the Minister: the Minister or the Oireachtas have no choice in the matter.  The goods in question will not have to be marked as will goods for sale on the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, it might be better if it were left to the discretion of the Minister to decide whether particular goods <Col N="417" /> intended for export should be marked in a particular way.  The point of subsection (7) is that where a manufacturer had a relatively large consignment of goods ready for the export market and then found that his export market no longer existed or that the order was cancelled he could with the consent of the Minister redirect those goods to the home market.  If that were so, that manufacturer would have goods going on to the Irish market which were not marked because the subsection did not allow the Minister or anybody else to see that the goods were marked.  That is why I thought the Minister might have been given some discretion in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The taking jointly of subsections (6) and (7) probably created a certain amount of confusion in the Senator's mind.  Subsection (7) is a provision which enables me as Minister to give a permit in respect of goods packed in containers intended for export, to allow them to be sold in the State.  What is visualised here is the type of eventuality which might arise in the case of perishable goods which could not be exported, for example because of a shipping strike or a dock strike, circumstances which would be out of the control of the exporter.</P>
      <P>As conveyed in subsection (6), my order shall not apply to goods for export.  Subsection (7) is intended as a protection against the type of event which might then ensue when an urgent necessity might arise to dispose of those unmarked articles on the home market.  That type of situation could arise in the event of goods being held up through one of the situations I envisaged.  The manufacturer, exporter or owner of the goods might then be allowed to dispose of the articles here, especially if they were perishable articles.  This is, as I have said, the long-term reason for the provision of this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest it is highly unlikely, but one might come across circumstances in which a manufacturer, unscrupulous, allied with a Minister&mdash;I do not, for a moment, include the present Minister&mdash;might release on the home market goods which were <Col N="418" /> not as large or which would not give as good value as the equivalent product packed for the home market. There could be a manufacturer, supposedly having a buyer from a foreign country, and that supposed buyer could supposedly say at the last moment he did not require the goods, and it could be agreed that the manufacturer could release the goods on the home market. They could then be placed on the market and although bearing a similarity to the properly packed goods would not be as good value to the Irish consumer, who would be misled in this way.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason that I suggest subsection (6) is so slack as to allow a possible abuse by an unscrupulous producer operating under subsection (7).  I still say the two subsections could be used by a manufacturer, if operating on a sufficiently large scale, to make unfair profit for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point being made but I thought subsection (7) envisaged an unusual type of situation which, of course, is quite possible. In an effort to meet that situation this subsection was included.  The likelihood of what the Senator suggests is a little too far-fetched from my point of view and from the point of view of my accepting it seriously.  The suggestion of connivance of that nature in relation to it is not sufficient for me to be willing to give any sort of undertaking that I would look into it again to see if the provision could be amended, deleted or enlarged.  In regard to subsection (6), it is understandable that I should not make regulations making it incumbent on exporters to put particular markings on their containers.  The necessity for subsection (7) is justified from my point of view.  I do not visualise the type of situation arising which the Senator posed.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> Before subsection (2) to insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) The authorised officer shall be a person suitably qualified to undertake the powers and responsibilities vested in him under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was encouraged to put down this amendment by the Minister's statement on the Second Stage in reply to a point I made in regard to who the authorised officer or officers might be.  The Minister stated at column 307 of Vol. 68 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>That inspector would be an officer of my Department or of a local authority especially selected for the purpose of enforcing the legislation.</P>
    <P>I then asked:</P>
    <P>Would that officer have any special qualifications?</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>Not specifically... there would be a point of making use to a great extent of local authority officers who at present handle weights and measures.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities under this Bill and under the more comprehensive Bill which the Minister has promised to bring in at an early date in connection with the whole complex question of goods offered for sale in packets is far too wide to be properly catered for by the members of the Garda Síochána who at present act as weights and measures officers for the local authorities.  I would visualise that an authorised officer would be a person specifically trained for these duties, who, if necessary, would have to undergo a special training course.  I know the Minister can directly appoint such officers but I hope the Minister will agree it would be much more desirable if the local authority appointed their own officers to carry out the provisions of this Bill.  The persons concerned would be required to have expert knowledge of all types of containers and a very wide range of containers are covered by the Bill. &ldquo;Container&rdquo; is in fact an ominous word.  An authorised officer would also have the right to enter into manufacturers' <Col N="420" /> or packers' premises and to take samples and to examine books and, in fact, do a lot of other things that he will be authorised to do under the provisions of section 3.  I feel this goes far beyond the responsibilities and duties of a weights and measures inspector.</P>
    <P>The Minister should include in the Bill some qualification or some indication that the officer concerned will, in fact, be suitably qualified and experienced to carry out these very responsible and, in some cases, complex duties, having regard to the fact that in addition to the duties under this Bill he will have presumably even more important duties under the comprehensive legislation which the Minister has promised to bring in at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to include this provision in the Bill.  If he so desires, he could specify a qualification, possibly using different wording, in some other section of the Bill though it seems to me that this is the appropriate section in which to introduce it. I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment on the grounds I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with Senator Russell on this because manpower must be used to the best advantage.  Tins and containers in a factory are usually turned out automatically on a machine not as individual items but by the hundred and by the thousand.  Therefore, if one is wrong they are all wrong; if one is right they are all right.  I visualise that the only circumstances in which a complaint like this would arise is if somebody, having bought an article in a shop, finds it is wrong and that person forthwith complains.  The authorised officer then goes to the factory or to the shop and purchases a similar item.  In many of these cases the individual who buys the item, whether he is the local weights and measures sergeant or otherwise, will not be capable of doing the analysis himself.  If one takes tinned fruit, one must discriminate between the actual fruit and the juices.  He will have to send it away to an expert for analysis.  It will have to come to a Department in Dublin. <Col N="421" /> This is just the same as in the case of the garda who calls to the creamery to find out whether milk is up to standard. All he can do is take a sample and send it away.  If we are to have an expert in every county, in every corporation, in every town, to do all this expert work which is done by the Institute of Research and Standards or to some such body it would be a hopeless waste of manpower and in this country above all we must endeavour, in the expenditure of money, to ensure that we get the best value for it.  I can see no reason whatever why the person who ordinarily takes samples of milk cannot do this as well and send it up to the Institute of Research and Standards or such other appropriate body for expert analysis because it is only the certificate of a top grade expert which will be accepted in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Nash's view on this.  I noticed that Senator Russell having outlined his reasons for the amendment suggested that the Minister might look at it from the point of view of finding some more suitable wording than &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo;. The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>The authorised officer shall be a person suitably qualified to undertake the powers and responsibilities vested in him under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This assumes that the authorised officer whom I would be appointing would not for some reason or other be suitably qualified.  I feel that without having a definition of &ldquo;suitably qualified officer&rdquo; the amendment would not serve any useful purpose. The section itself sets out under (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) the powers an authorised officer would have.  The officer is empowered at (a) to enter premises at all reasonable times and carry out inspections, tests and measurements and remove containers.  This is the only function for which any technical training would be required and as Senator Nash has said when it comes to going into any greater detail it is necessary to remove the containers or the item with which he would be finding fault to have it properly measured or examined to see if it <Col N="422" /> would conform to the standard required by me under the order.  In that case the officer need not carry out any test himself but would take the containers away.  I would not visualise a situation in which anybody except a suitably qualified person would be appointed as an authorised officer and from the point of view of adding in by way of subsection the necessity that a person should be suitably qualified assumes that I as Minister might appoint somebody who would not be suitably qualified as an authorised officer and we could get bogged down on the question of what constitutes a suitably qualified person.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, the purpose of the Bill is to protect the consumer, and already in the Dáil I accepted an amendment which, if you like, took a certain action.  It is the one that has been referred to earlier, subsection (4) (b) of section 4, which to a certain extent took some of the teeth out of the Bill.  By providing a type of platform whereby some defendant might arising from a prosecution for an offence use an amendment such as the Senator is proposing for inclusion here and go into a great deal of detail as to whether a particular officer who was responsible for the prosecution was a suitably qualified officer, this in its own way would take further teeth from this measure and could provide an additional basis for a clever defence of an offence in this regard.  I do not think that the addition of this amendment would in any way make this section more helpful, and therefore I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Russell's amendment and I wish to mention a point arising out of Senator Nash's observations.  If you look at subsection (3) you will find that the officer hereby authorised is to be given powers which relate not merely to the exercise of his functions under this Bill.  Senator Nash's point with regard to that may indeed be a valid one with regard to the exercise of his powers under this Bill in so far as the goods are, I imagine, packed or prepacked in the way he describes so that if one is wrong they are all wrong, if one is right they are all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> The section however gives the authorised officer powers of a much greater kind than merely the exercise of functions under this Bill.  The section proposes to give him powers which are set out and are very extensive, under (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) with regard to the exercise of his functions under the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 to 1931 which relate to these matters and which are set forth in the 1887 Act and the 1931 Act.  The code is deficient, it is true, but nonetheless I would like the Minister to consider an amendment on Report Stage as to whether these powers are not too extensive that are related to the general matter of the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 to 1931, because the officer can do all these things&mdash;inspect and copy, take extracts from books, documents and records, and so on.  At the moment he can do any of these things in relation to the other functions which he has under the Merchandise Marks code unless he gets a search warrant, but he does not have to get any warrant under this.  The warrant is given if he can satisfy a justice by sworn information that there is reasonable cause to suspect a breach of the Act and that an offence has been committed.  He is then entitled to do these things, which is much less than he is being empowered to do here without being required to put anything before anybody. I think that that is a point which has to be considered by Senator Nash.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald's point is quite valid, but with great respect to him I should like to reconsider it and see just exactly whether it is relevant to what this Bill proposes to do.  The real purpose of the Bill is to ensure that if there is a container that container shall be labelled as to what is in it with regard to number, weight and so on, and that if it is so labelled the label must be accurate.  That is really the purpose of the Bill, and if the label is not accurate somebody can go into court and the authorised officer can go into court and if the person is proved guilty there is an offence committed and the court imposes a penalty.  No penalty can be imposed unless the court is <Col N="424" /> satisfied that he is guilty.  A person giving evidence can be cross-examined as to his capacity and his ability to give the evidence which he has given in court, and if he is not qualified and is not sufficiently capable then the court discounts his evidence.  But if the subsection suggested by Senator FitzGerald were to go into this Bill the first thing the man will have to do in court when he turns up to give evidence is to prove his qualifications. He may be a graduate of chemistry and and he will still have to prove perhaps something else.  He may be a graduate of physics and will still have to prove something else.</P>
      <P>Now, by and large, nobody is guilty of an offence of course unless it is proved beyond all reasonable doubt. Nobody could have the slightest doubt about the qualifications of the person to go into court because his evidence would be only as to whether there are 20 items in a particular packet or container. The evidence is always weighed against the prosecution and in favour of the accused.  Every single item must be proved, and if this subsection went into this Bill I cannot visualise any case almost without exception in which the accused would not be entitled to an acquittal no matter how guilty he might be.</P>
      <P>Again, this will lead to expense.  At the moment in these cases there is usually provision for a certificate from the State chemist or the Institute for Standards and Research or some such body from <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  This is produced in court and you usually have a sample yourself and you can get your own chemist or physicist as the case may be to examine your own sample, and if you wish to challenge the State witness the can attend the court and give evidence and the State witness can be cross-examined, but if this subsection goes in I can visualise all sorts of difficulties.  I can visualise also that it would be practically impossible to get a conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real purpose of the Bill is to ensure that when the ordinary John Citizen goes into a shop and buys something he gets what the label on the container sets out should be there.  That is the real purpose of this Bill.  It is not to leave loopholes for guilty persons to escape.  They will have loopholes <Col N="425" /> enough, and if they are not guilty they can prove their innocence.  I would recommend to my colleagues that they should reconsider it in that light when I think that they would be disposed perhaps to agree with me.</P>

      <P>I should like to oppose this amendment on the grounds that I do not think it meets the objection put forward by the proposer in that in stating that the authorised officer should be a person suitably qualified it could well be the situation that the Minister would be authorising in writing and he will determine up to what standard the person shall be qualified.</P>
      <P>I think, however, that some of the remarks made today by Senator FitzGerald are very relevant.  The powers given to an authorised officer under this section are very wide, and the court may be asked as to the method under which this can be enforced when the officer may require a person to in fact incriminate himself or commit an offence.  This is not a general principle of the common law, that a person would be required to produce books, documents, records or to give under paragraph (d) of section 3 to the officer any information he may require in regard to any persons carrying on the activity, and under paragraph (e) to give to the officer any other information which the officer may reasonably require in regard to such activity.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (e) requires:</P>
      <P>such a person to give to the officer any other information which the officer may reasonably require in regard to such activity.</P>
      <P>It is provided at the end that:</P>
      <P>A person who obstructs or impedes an authorised officer in the exercise of a power or does not comply with a requirement under this section shall be deemed to contravene this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this is giving very wide powers to the authorised officer. Since it is laid down here that the officer should be suitably qualified without in any way setting out what is meant by that, presumably the Minister would be as good a judge as anybody else of such qualifications.  I should <Col N="426" /> prefer if an amendment were put down on Report Stage in relation to whether this ought to be a matter for a search warrant or that type of machinery rather than having authorisation in writing considering the implication of this in going against the principle of self-incrimination in so far as that a person may remain silent and have the presumption of innocence in his favour. Under this section a person may not refuse to disclose his books.  This is a rather unusual principle.</P>

      <P>While agreeing with a number of Senators who have spoken on this amendment, I would disagree with others.  I was most impressed by the final point in the Minister's last intervention when he referred to the possible legal difficulties which an amendment like this might create in the courts if an action were taken under one of the sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This point made by the Minister exposes the fundamental problem underlying both the section and the amendment we are now discussing.  It seems to me that the fundamental question is whom exactly is this Bill intended to protect and, in particular, whom exactly is this section intended to protect.  I believe that the bias of the Bill, slight though it is, is in favour of the consumer.  I believe, also, that the bias of this particular section is in favour of the consumer but the bias of the whole Bill should be very much stronger in favour of consumer protection. For that reason, I am inclined to oppose the amendment because, as it stands, the amendment does either one of two things.  In the first place, there is the possibility that, as the Minister has contended, it adds nothing to the substance of the Bill, in which case it is irrelevant.  In the second place, it may take away from the rather scanty but still welcome element of consumer protection and reinforce the element of protection for the manufacturer. If this is the case, the amendment should be opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I remarked during the past 24 hours in another context and in another place, it is a truism that we in this country have more laws to protect property than we have laws to protect the people.  This Bill, however limited <Col N="427" /> in its effects, is a step in the right direction.  For these reasons, while I oppose the amendment I would also express some criticism of what my colleague Senator Mary Bourke has said about the powers given to officers under the Bill.  In the game of profit and loss in this acutely competitive society there cannot be too many powers given to representatives of the community to protect the consumer.</P>

      <P>I find myself in sympathy with a good deal of what Senator Nash has said in relation to the difficulty of determination of the qualifications of a person who may be authorised to carry out these investigations. I do not agree that the naming of such a person by the Minister even after the Minister had received the expert advice of officials of his Department would be adequate because there may be required a considerable spread of expertise and the need for this may develop only in the course of the investigations.  Therefore, the amendment as put down would be very difficult to operate.</P>
      <P>I find myself in sympathy, also, with what Senator Mary Bourke has said about the amount of responsibility that would develop on this person under the section.  As I see it, there are two things involved.  First of all, there is the entering the premises and making limiting investigations and establishing a case.  There is also concern with the obtaining of the necessary documents to prove the case for which the officer has, at the same time of his entry, procured <i>prima facie</i> evidence. I wonder if this could not be put into two separate sections.  Is it fair to embody all this investigationary work in the one section?  I am not very competent to discuss the legal implications but, as I see it, this section is rather cumbersome.  It gives to an officer a tremendous amount of responsibility which should be taken in a much more deliberate way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">

      <P>I would agree entirely with Senator Mary Bourke if the business circumstances of today were the same as were the business circumstances of 30, 40 or 50 years ago <Col N="428" /> when the earlier Acts were passed and when everything was manufactured by hand and packed by hand.  In today's circumstances if I were to pack a million items they would probably be put into packages of ten so that I would require 100,000 containers to pack those one million items.  I can visualise that by having the slightest shortage in those 100,000 containers. I would stand to make a great profit at the expense of the consumer.  One way of proving such wrong against me would be if my books could be inspected but if my goods could be inspected and it was found that instead of packing 100,000 containers I had packed only 99,900 it would make proof that much easier because, after all, what comes in must go out.  I cannot visualise this happening in every case that would come before the courts but the power must be there for the authorised officer, if he so requires, to inspect my books and ascertain what raw material I had used because, by ascertaining that information, he can prove beyond doubt if I am cheating the public.</P>
      <P>There is also power given to the officer to inspect my books to find out who exactly I am.  As laid down in the Bill, he can:</P>
      <P>require the person who carries on such activity and any person employed in connection therewith to produce to the officer any books, documents or records relating to such activity which are in that person's power or control and to give him such information as he may reasonably require in regard to any entries in such books, documents and records.</P>
      <P>He can also require the person to give him any information he may require in regard to the persons carrying on such activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these days of limited companies and, in particular, of holding companies&mdash;I look on holding companies as ones who hold the sack of loot while the police or the officer, as the case may be, is inspecting the others &mdash;there are so many loopholes for fraud with the formation of companies and firms that it is very important that in investigating a case of this nature, <Col N="429" /> the authorisation, if so required, should be there.  The fact he has the authority does not necessarily mean he has to exercise it.</P>
    <P>I could give a practical instance in my own experience within the past 12 months where a very grave wrong was done to a client of mine involving a loss of thousands of pounds and I was not able to trace who owned the firm who committed that wrong.  You could have a firm known as Jones Brothers and the real owners may be Paddy Murphy and John Ryan.  Unless you can inspect their books you cannot possibly find out.  Therefore, if the authorised officer finds an offence is committed there is no use in his knowing that unless he knows whom to prosecute.  It is due to the change in circumstances, the change in manufacture, the change in business dealings, the multiplicity of companies and firms and the various loopholes that people have been thinking out from day to day and from year to year to use companies and firms to avoid their liability, that in my opinion it is necessary, as protective clauses, to include those subsections.</P>
    <P>I hope the Senator will appreciate I am not just criticising her point of view for the sake of doing so.  I know from practical experience the various loopholes which can be used and I know from practical experience that it is absolutely essential if you are going to trace a fraud in a company or firm in those days that every authority and every power must be given to be utilised, but only to be utilised, if necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all agree that the purpose of the Bill is to protect the consumer as much as possible and in that regard there is no argument at all.  The thing that concerns me, and this point has been brought out even by the Senators who opposed the form of my amendment, is that first of all you have an authorised officer who has been given very wide powers under this Bill and the previous Acts.  It is necessary as Senator FitzGerald pointed out, to take into consideration previous Merchandise Acts. The Minister has indicated on Second Stage that such an officer is likely to <Col N="430" /> be an officer at present employed under the Weights and Measures Act. Such officer would not necessarily be the proper person to carry out the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not understand Senator Nash's point about the utilisation of manpower and naturally as a businessman I would be opposed to putting any extra expense on the local authority or the Exchequer.  If it was for the better protection of the consumer I do not think this House or the Dáil would cavil at the additional expense of each local authority employing one extra person to carry out the provisions of this Bill if we thought that would make the Bill more effective.  I am concerned at the case put forward that my amendment might very well have the opposite effect to that desired, in other words, that a clever lawyer might succeed in proving that the officer concerned was not suitably qualified to carry out certain provisions under this Bill and for that reason the case against the manufacturer and the importer might fall.  I am not a lawyer but if that is so I would regard that as a valid point.</P>
      <P>I am still concerned, and I do not think the Bill as at present drawn covers the point sufficiently, as to whether the wide and complex duties under this Bill can be properly dealt with by what the Minister visualises as an appointment by a local authority of a weights and measures officer.  The duties go far beyond that and having regard to that and pending legislation the Minister should have another look at the section of the Bill dealing with the appointment of an authorised officer.  We are giving him tremendous powers.</P>
      <P>I appreciate, as Senator Nash says, that nowadays items for sale are not manufactured in dozens, they are manufactured in thousands.  If we were satisfied that that mass production method was sufficient to guarantee protection of the consumer we should not be discussing this Bill at all.  It is because we feel the present legislation is not sufficient and the consumers' rights are not sufficiently protected that we are discussing this Merchandise Marks Bill, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider the authorised officer is <Col N="431" /> a key person in this whole Bill and for that reason the Minister should have another look at it.  I presume, taking up Senator Nash's point, if it could be proved by a competent lawyer that the suitably qualified person was not suitably qualified the same argument could apply to an authorised officer such as a weights and measures inspector who in fact had no apparent qualifications, and possibly even on the grounds of education, for doing his duty.  Some measures would need to be laid down to ensure the officer concerned was at least competent to carry out his duties.  In saying that I do not wish to suggest the Minister would not appoint a person suitably qualified but, as I said when I was talking on this amendment earlier, I would hope this section of the Bill would be operated through the local authorities.  I want to try to ensure in my amendment, although it may be wrongly worded and it may have the very opposite effect to that intended, is that the authorised officer would be competent to discharge what are very complex and onerous duties.  That is the single purpose of this amendment.  If the Minister can interpret my wishes, and indeed the points better made by other speakers here this afternoon, certainly I would be very happy to allow him to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment as moved by Senator Russell has been quite useful from the point of view of enabling such a discussion over the whole section.  While I consider the discussion we have had confirms and, to a great extent, supports my view in relation to my opposition to the amendment as such, it has brought out some pretty useful points.  Some of the earlier remarks by Senator FitzGerald, when he said he looked forward to the more comprehensive measures and the more comprehensive Bill he hopes I will be bringing forward for consumer protection, solidified me in trying to hold on to what we have in this section without, as I have already said, taking the teeth from it by enabling a sort of loophole amendment to be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald commented that this Bill in itself is not sufficiently protective. <Col N="432" /> At the same time, Senator Miss Bourke suggested that under the various subsections of section 3 there are, if you like, too many powers being given to the authorised officer that it is proposed to appoint.</P>
    <P>Let me say, in connection with this question of the powers of the proposed authorised officers, those same powers are at the present time held by officers of my Department under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.  They have exactly similar powers.  As Senator Nash emphasised they are powers which it is necessary that the authorised officers should have.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan drew attention to the fact that the consumer is not as well protected as he might be.  The Consumer's protection is not as well provided for under this Bill as the Senator would hope for.  At the same time the protection I am trying to arrange for the consumer would be whittled away if I were to accept the amendment.  I do not think there is a necessity to reduce the powers or even to question the appointment of authorised officers.  It is quite normal to assume that with the powers which the authorised officers will of necessity have it will be necessary to ensure that the officers will get a certain amount of training.  It is quite possible that Senator Russell has overemphasised my reply on the Second Stage when he said that it was likely that the same officers as are being used by local authorities will be used.  This is what I am recorded as having said but I know what I would prefer to be recorded as having said and that is that they were liable to be the same officers.</P>
    <P>During the course of the passage of this Bill through the Dáil the particular point of introducing amendments in order to envelop local authorities officers&mdash;possibly from the same point as the Senator has in mind of ensuring that the local authority could be brought in to have a direct interest in this was mentioned.  With the powers I am endeavouring to take in this Bill, I want to have the type of qualified officer who can properly carry out the functions which I propose to assign to him.</P>
    <P>In relation to subsection (3) (a) undoubtedly it will be necessary that <Col N="433" /> the officer should have a certain amount of preliminary training.  I propose to give him the power under this Bill for the protection of the consumer. I want to emphasise as solidly as I can that the whole object of the Bill is the protection of the consumer.  If Senator Horgan finds that the bias has been just slightly in favour of the consumer I do not want to have that bias whittled away even a little.  If Senator Russell and Senator Alexis FitzGerald were to insist on the acceptance of their amendment I cannot see that it would help the Bill in any way.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the nature of the researches which Senator Horgan has carried out to establish that there are more laws favouring property than favouring persons.  It would take a long time to establish that proposition.  I doubt that the Senator has been able to devote very much time to it.  I made my position clear as to where I think the bias ought to lie.  It should lie in favour of the consumer.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator Nash's point about the nature of the activity of packaging and pre-packaging goods, I am personally satisfied that it would seriously interfere with the enforcement of this Bill if, in fact, the authorised officer were denied any of the powers given to him to exercise his functions under this Bill.  While I want to have a merchandise marks code which is adequate to protect the consumer, I should like to feel that it is in the context of this new code that we would consider the nature of the powers of enforcement which should be given to authorised persons.  Subsection (3) of this section gives to this authorised officer not merely the power to enforce the section but also all these powers in relation to the merchandise marks code generally. Senator Nash made the point in relation to pre-packaging.  If one reads subsection (a) the language is in the alternative.  The language gives the authorised officer the right to</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> at all reasonable times enter premises at which any activity in connection with the packing of goods in containers or the manufacturing, processing, supplying, distributing or importing of goods is carried on and inspect the premises...</P>
    <P>Therefore it is not limited merely to pre-packaging goods in containers.  It deals with all types of manufacturing, processing, supplying and importation. It should be in the context of new legislation with enlarged powers and with greater rights for the consumer than are there at the moment, that we should consider giving persons who have to enforce this new code these additional functions which might be more extensive than were necessary in relation to small manufacturers who might be prejudiced by the subsection, people engaged in manufacturing, processing, supplying, distributing or importing. In making this point I would be in favour of giving notice of my intention to consider whether it would be proper to put down an amendment at the proper stage to delete the words &ldquo;functions under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887 to 1931&rdquo; and to leave it at &ldquo;exercise his or its functions under this Act&rdquo;.

      <P>My point here is one of clarification.  Subsection (1) states:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> A person who contravenes or is deemed to contravene a provision of this Act or of an order under this Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both the fine and the imprisonment or, in the case of a person who contravenes a provision of an order aforesaid, on conviction or indictment to a fine not exceeding two thousand pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear as to how the person will know whether he has committed an indictable or a summary offence.  It is clear that any contravention of the Act can only be a summary offence, but a contravention of an order may be tried summarily or on indictment.  This seems rather hard to interpret.

On the question of summary and indictable offences, I am not in a position to express in detail the comparisons between the various types of offence.  All I can do is to point out that the penalties prescribed are the comparative type of penalties which are imposed in other Acts for this type of offence, and if the Senator will bear with me I could be more explicit when presenting the Bill for Report Stage.

We altered the amendment, as moved in the Dáil, and I spoke specifically of making it too easy and too convenient to be able to offer such a plausible defence.  I eventually accepted the proposition that a person accused could establish that he had taken all reasonable precautions and that that should be a just defence if he were able to establish it.

      <P>There is one small point which the Minister might consider.  It is well known that before the Companies Act of 1963 people managed to direct companies without being directors of companies, by various means; but the 1963 Companies Act provided that the term &ldquo;director&rdquo; would include any person in accordance with whose directions the company were accustomed to act.  This section might need the extended definition of &ldquo;director&rdquo; which is contained in only one section of the Companies Act and which therefore might not apply to this Bill at all.  The question arises of who is really the person in accordance with whose direction the <Col N="438" /> company is accustomed to act and who really is the person who should be prosecuted. The Minister should try to get him in by an appropriate amendment of section 7.  I do not think that the definition of &ldquo;director&rdquo; in the Companies Act will get such a person in under this Bill.  The Minister should consider that.</P>

      <P>Section 10 reads:</P>
      <P>Where,... the Minister is of opinion that enforcement of the prohibition would cause undue hardship, the Minister may, at his discretion on application being duly made to him, grant a licence (in this section referred to as a licence) authorising the importation by the person named in the licence of those goods.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister what situation he visualises here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Federation of Trade Associations and the Revenue Commissioners recommend this.  The federation were concerned about the hardship caused to importers by detention by the customs of goods not meeting the requirements of the Bill and felt that importation should be permitted under licence subject to a condition requiring the importer to ensure compliance with the requirements.  The Revenue Commissioners represented that the enforcement of an import prohibition under the Bill could be a source of serious delay and congestion at the ports and might involve hardship for importers acting in good faith. They suggested that a licensing power should be used to enable the proper marking to be applied after the goods had been cleared from customs but before being put on sale.  The reason for this subsection is that goods being imported may be found not to be properly marked as provided by me by <Col N="439" /> order and this is in order to have them released and got through port with the provision that they be properly marked afterwards.</P>

      <P>That is it.  The importer may be bringing in stuff and may have assumed, having made an arrangement with a supplier from overseas, that certain things would have been done but finds that they arrive at port not having the required markings.  This is included in order to have the discretion of granting a licence for them to be imported until such time as they are put in order prior to sale.</P>

      <P>Senator Russell has raised a very important point.  While I understand the Minister's intention in this, in regard to the importation of certain articles, particularly articles for remanufacture or components of articles that may be re-exported, I do not think it would be possible for the Department, unless they envisage some new kind of organisation, to allow these articles to be imported subject to re-inspection afterwards, because in many cases these articles find themselves on the domestic market and it is possible nowadays to vary trade descriptions of articles in order to bring them outside the import Orders that are in existence.  Very often&mdash;I have personal experience of this&mdash;in regard to articles that are imported loosely under various trade descriptions the Department have not any machinery, unless they employ experts to do it, by which they can determine whether the descriptions given to the goods are accurate.  There is evidence that a number of articles are being brought in which do not comply with the trade descriptions given to them. It would take experts to determine whether they do or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment there is a certain amount of evasion going on. I would be a bit perturbed about this. Many of our new industries require imports of certain raw materials for manufacture and they find that a lot of goods are being imported in the finished state which do not comply with the trade description given to them.  If a situation is permitted where somebody can get quite a large quantity of goods in without any definition as to their trade description and that has to be sorted out afterwards, how long afterwards will it be?  How much of this material will find itself on the domestic market and how much of it will be available for export in sizeable consignments?  Somebody would need to be on the spot straight away to determine it.  If the Department are to clear a lot of this material at ports and leave the matter to subsequent investigation they will find, when they go to investigate it, that a lot of the material will not be there at all.  I feel this is something the Minister should be careful about because I can see that this is a section that might be abused very considerably.  The Minister can give an import licence for goods which have wrong trade descriptions and it has to be investigated afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing in this with merchandise marks&mdash;the question of weight, measure and number on packaged goods for sale by a retailer and these are orders that would be made under this Bill.  We are dealing with a different type of situation from the one the Senator envisages, as far as I know.  This deals with import licences as relating to goods which are being brought in here by importers in a packed state and it deals with orders in relation to weight, measure or number or all three.  I can see the problem the Senator has in mind.  It is an administrative problem from the point of view of evasion of normal regulations. I do not think it is in fact related to this even though section 10 <Col N="441" /> deals with import licences, because it deals with them in relation to goods about which orders under this Bill may have been made.</P>
      <P>The difficulties as expressed by the Senator are ones which normally could be described as the normal run of administrative problems that would have to be tackled as they arose.  I have no practical experience of the type of problem to which the Senator is referring, but I do not think that it arises under the particular subsection we are dealing with at the moment.  This Bill has to do with the marking of packets and containers in relation to retail sales and I think that what the Senator has been speaking about is items being imported under one heading and being broken down and sold under some other heading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making is that if you have a large consignment of any particular kind of goods and they come into the port of Dublin and a certificate of origin and an invoice are provided describing the kind of goods they are, if it eventually turns out that the certificate of origin and the invoices were not strictly in accordance with what has been brought in, by that time all these goods have got into the distributive channels and all the investigations you have to carry out will be nullified because the stuff is already sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has to do with the actual selling situation and it is drawn up from the point of view of consumer protection.  In actual fact an offence is committed if the commodity is sold without being properly marked or without the specified weight that has been provided for in an order made by me under this Bill.  If no order has been made by me under this Bill in relation to the particular type of article then it is not covered, but if the article is covered and if it does not conform to the standards set out in the order then the person who sells it at the point of retail sale will be guilty of an offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour this matter further, but I was visualising a situation where a cargo arrives in Dublin and the importers had to <Col N="442" /> ask the Minister for permission to import it and under this Bill he would make an order permitting them to import, after the making of the order and after the goods had got into the distribution channels, there would not be much point in investigating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Licences to import would not be given unless the articles were marked or weighed or measured or counted, and the weight or quantity was printed on the package in conformity with the requirements which I laid down under an order.  If they do not do that, the licence to import would not be forthcoming unless the importer was in a position to establish to me that there was a particular reason for those articles coming through.  The question about the goods being taken away from the docks and distributed would not arise at all because of the prohibition against their importation if they do not conform to the standards that I will have set out.</P>
      <P>I think that is all I can cover now. This section of the Bill exactly meets the requirements in so far as the goods cannot reach the distributive trade and cannot even be sold without me as Minister being satisfied that they have been marked properly, or if they have not been marked properly&mdash;and that is what this section here is all about&mdash;an offence will have been committed. I will have to be satisfied before I give a licence to allow them to be taken in by the agent or the importer and then marked before they are subsequently distributed.</P>

    <Title>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objectives of the Bill are: (a) the periodic updating of the statutory limits on expenditure in relation to the company; (b) the <Col N="444" /> provision of finance for the extension of the company's operations to the industrial development of the Limerick-Clare-North Tipperary region; (c) the clarification of certain incidental and ancillary matters.</P>
      <P>As the House may know, it has been the intention to use the unique expertise of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company for the purpose of regional industrial development in the area in which it is situated.  The promotional work of the company at Shannon Airport has already produced a fall-out of industrial development in some adjacent districts.  This region is, therefore, placed in a favourable position in having a team experienced in industrial matters and one which has shown worthwhile achievement over the years.  The company have already commenced their work in the region and have published a five-year programme in which they outline the possibilities for industrial expansion. This programme is, of course, being revised in the light of changing factors and of the budgetary position of the company.</P>
      <P>SFADCO has already engaged in factory construction in Newcastlewest and in the provision of factory buildings or sites and services at Limerick and elsewhere.  These activities have been undertaken in advance of the provisions of this Bill so as to lose no time in realising the potential of the region.</P>
      <P>The mid-west region has been an important place in the western area and it already has an industrial base upon which further developments may take place.  The work being done by SFADCO in the stimulation of local enterprise and initiative will have an important significance for such work in other similar regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside the mid-west region the job of industrial development will be carried out by regional offices of the Industrial Development Authority.  The company will, in effect, be the regional industrial office in the mid-west and it will operate in the context of the overall national responsibilities of the authority in conjunction where necessary with the many other local bodies <Col N="445" /> and organisations represented in the regional development organisation.</P>
    <P>In general, regional industrial development offices will meet needs which now exist for services to assist manufacturing firms, in particular in connection with re-development and expansion, the encouragement of initiatives and linkage between existing and new firms and the better use of the facilities and inducements provided for small industries.</P>
    <P>This Bill also relates to the provision of funds for the work of the company at the airport.  I should explain that while the present division of Ministerial functions is that the Minister for Transport and Power is responsible for the tourism and aviation functions of the company, I am responsible as Minister for Industry and Commerce, for their industrial functions, their housing activities at the airport and any other activity in which they may engage.  The achievements of the company at the airport are well known and at a recent date more than 4,500 workers were employed on the Shannon industrial estate.  In addition, persons employed at the airport proper, in community services, construction and other activities numbered about 2,360.  The company have pursued a policy of creating employment for men and almost two-thirds of the industrial jobs at the airport are so filled.</P>
    <P>Of about 47 firms at the airport, 30 are engaged in manufacturing and 17 in servicing or warehousing.  These industrial activities have resulted in a net balance of trade at the airport estate&mdash;exports less imports&mdash;of more than £13 million in 1969 which is more than four times that of 1964.  The firms at the airport are largely export oriented and generate about 20 per cent of national industrial exports.  The general trend at the airport estate has been expansionary in terms of volume of trade and of employment which has increased at a rate of about 450 jobs a year on average since the inception of the company's work.  This achievement is proof of the company's success in attracting a number of diverse projects from six different countries which makes it a suitable instrument for the <Col N="446" /> additional burdens imposed upon it by regional activities.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for both capital and current expenditures.  Under previous legislation, from 1959 onwards, a total of about £6½ million has been spent by the company on the capital side in respect of industry and tourism. Of this some nine tenths relates to the industrial estate at the airport and about 1 per cent to tourist amenities. The balance has been spent on regional industrial development.  A further capital item arises from the need to create a community at Shannon where there are almost 900 completed company houses and flats and 167 under construction.  There are now 72 houses completed there by private enterprise with a further 28 in course of building. The State capital spent on housing at the Shannon community is more than £5 million.  The town population is at present more than 3,000 persons and it will probably reach the target level of 6,000 by 1974.</P>
    <P>I should explain that capital provision for SFADCO is met out of share capital subscribed by the Minister for Finance, and&mdash;in so far as it relates to housing&mdash;out of repayable advances made by that Minister and from housing grants made by me.  The company's running expenses and industrial grants for firms at the airport come from grants-in-aid of which about £4½ million has already been issued to the company. Of this £4½ million about £2 million has been used for grants to industries and the remainder for the running expenses of the company.</P>
    <P>The principal change with which this Bill deals is that envisaged in section 2 which empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to issue a grant-in-aid to the company for industrial development work, mainly promotional, in the mid-west region.  The House will see that a general co-ordination between the company and the Industrial Development Authority is involved.  This provison does not affect the company's existing powers at the airport, which remain untouched.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority are the body charged with providing financial incentives for industry <Col N="447" /> in the State generally, but sections 3 and 4 of this Bill provide that specific functions may be delegated by the authority to the company in respect of financial incentives for industry in the region.</P>
    <P>Some anxiety has apparently been caused by the wording of previous legislation which provided for State assistance for dwellings in connection with the industrial estate at the airport. Sections 5, 6 and 7, in the first place, remove any doubts of this kind in relation to tenants who may be the widows and dependants of workers on the industrial estate or persons who have lost their jobs on the estate.  The company have not, of course, taken such a strict view of the matter in the past.  I need hardly say that in all new lettings of houses provided by the company, the principal factor will be the needs of the industrial estate and the Shannon town community.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 also provide technical amendments, the effect of which is to continue the entitlement of the company to housing grants and repayable advances in the same manner as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for an increase of £9 million in the amount of share capital in the company which the Minister for Finance may take up.  This additional money will be used mainly for industrial development&mdash;including the erection of factories for sale or rent &mdash;at Shannon and in the region outside the airport up to 1973.</P>
    <P>The maximum amount of grants to be provided to meet the running expenses of the company and to enable it to give assistance to manufacturing at the airport is increased by section 9 by an amount of £4 million.  This amount also includes the grants-in-aid to be issued by the Minister for Transport and Power towards the substantial part of the company's running expenses which is devoted to tourism.</P>
    <P>Housing and community services at the airport are financed from advances repayable to the Minister for Finance. Section 10 increases the permissible aggregate of these advances by £3 million.</P>
    <P>Section 11 has been drafted, on <Col N="448" /> technical legal grounds, to clarify the manner in which reports and the accounts of the company shall be prepared and presented and pension schemes approved following the division of Ministerial functions by Order under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</P>
    <P>The other sections of this Bill are in customary form and are self-explanatory and ancillary.</P>
    <P>I will bring the provisions set out in this Bill into operation by Order shortly after its enactment.</P>
    <P>The mid-west region is benefiting from the existing activities of the company and will continue to have the use of the expertise and enterprise which made the company an appropriate and unique instrument for regional development.  I expect that the experience of the company in the region will provide useful lessons as well as an example for regional development throughout the rest of the country. I am confident that the House will agree with me that every encouragement should be given to such enterprise at the present time.  I recommend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give a very warm welcome to the Bill and to assure the Minister of the co-operation of my party in getting it through with all possible expedition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill marks a further milestone in the remarkable success of the industrial development at Shannon Airport over the past decade.  The figures which the Minister has given in his introductory speech are an indication of the importance of the industrial estate at Shannon Airport to the contiguous areas of Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary.  Of the 4,500 workers at present employed in the Shannon industrial estate some two thirds, or almost 3,000, are domiciled in the city of Limerick.  As a representative of that city I should like to emphasise how important to the economy of Limerick city and the contiguous area the Shannon industrial estate has been.  In fact, the same statement could be made in respect of County Clare and other areas.  I am <Col N="449" /> sure other Senators who speak after me will wish to emphasis that fact.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect from the point of view of our current balance of payments difficulties is the fact that Shannon Airport is a net exporter of some £30 million.  This is a very important factor in redressing a large proportion of the present adverse trade balance.  The increase in employment over recent years at an average rate of 450 must be without parallel in any other section of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the details of the Bill at a later stage and to confine myself at this juncture to some general remarks in regard to the current and future developments at Shannon Airport and in the mid-western region.</P>
    <P>The objectives of SFADCO have altered dramatically since it was established as a limited company under the 1959 Act.  The Minister may not recall it but at that time the principal aim was to develop alternative employment for what was feared would be substantial redundancy arising from a decrease in air passenger traffic consequent on the introduction of the jet planes.  The company's objectives could be summarised as the development of an estate for industries oriented towards air freight, ware-housing facilities and the promotion of tourism and commercial air services through the airport.</P>
    <P>I took the view at that time, as a Member of the other House, that rather than concentrating industrial development at the airport an industrial complex comprising Limerick, Shannon, Ennis and the contiguous area should be developed with industrial estates in the principal centres such as Limerick, Ennis and elsewhere in the region where established communities existed and where there was the necessary infrastructure, including schools, churches, shops, hotels and entertainment facilities.  I believed then, I still believe and I think the House would agree with me that workers should obtain employment as near as possible to their place of residence and that finished goods intended for air freight could and still can be easily <Col N="450" /> and quickly despatched to the airport by road from Limerick, Ennis and other centres.</P>
    <P>The then Minister, Mr. Seán Lemass, did not accept those arguments at the time and Shannon was developed on its own as an industrial centre.  For some years after it was first established in 1959 Shannon drew substantially on the surplus labour available in Limerick, Clare and elsewhere.  The need for housing ultimately arose when it was found that labour had to be recruited from a wider area.  Other social amenities had to be established and in fact out of the very nature of the development of the industrial estate a new town has arisen.  Incidentally, I might say that at that time also I took the view that despite a temporary falling off in air passenger traffic the need for Shannon as an international passenger centre would continue notwithstanding any further technical developments in the field of aviation.  Now that we are on the verge of the jumbo jet age I should like to express my personal conviction that Shannon will continue in the years ahead as an essential transatlantic international centre for all types of air traffic.  Indeed, I visualise its importance as an air centre will continue to grow rather than diminish.</P>
    <P>Shannon now finds itself as the hub centre of industrial development in the mid-west.  In fact, the Bill which we are now discussing here today is very much in line with thinking on regional development over the past six or eight years.  As the Minister will be aware, we have had several reports recommending the establishment of growth centres and industrial estates.  The mid-western area is an obvious centre for such a development.  The advantages of an industrial complex have been outlined in those various reports, the advantages of having groups of industries, rather than isolated industries, in a single centre where common technical requirements can be shared and which provide a viable base for technological training and advanced skills.</P>
    <P>The formation of the Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary Regional Development Organisation&mdash;incidentally the only such organisation in the country&mdash;has given a further impetus <Col N="451" /> to the development of industry on a regional basis.  I am sure this has encouraged the Minister and his predecessor to proceed on the lines outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The mid-western development organisation carries very wide representation from all the local authorities and statutory bodies in the area.  In addition, it has representatives from various Government Departments, SFADCO, harbour authorities, chambers of commerce, and others.  These are all working and thinking together how best to promote the region in the best interests of all its citizens.  As a member of that development organisation since its inception, I should like to pay a special tribute to the co-operative spirit which has been evident in that body since the first days of its establishment. It has been a very pleasing experience to work with the representatives of other counties, bodies and authorities in the advancement of the region as a whole.</P>
    <P>We have been accused from time to time in this country of being too parochial in our attitudes.  There has been ground for such criticism in the past.  Any Member of this House who is conversant with the operations of the Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary Regional Development Organisation will support me when I say that this is regional development working at its very best.  I should like to express the hope that other regions will follow the example of the mid-western organisation and by mutual agreement come together in the establishment of a body to look after their regional interests.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest that the proposal to utilise the experience and expertise of the personnel of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company was first mooted by the Limerick Chamber of Commerce about six or eight years ago.  At that time the proposal fell on somewhat deaf ears. It is now clear that the wisdom of the directors of the Chamber of Commerce, who were all businessmen in different spheres, was right and that the promotion of industrial development in the difficult current world conditions is <Col N="452" /> a matter for professionals and not for amateurs however enthusiastic they might be.  I do not wish to decry the efforts of voluntary bodies or of people who are prepared to give some of their time and experience and a little of their expertise, to developing their own and contiguous regions in co-operation with representatives of other areas. Anybody who gives time and effort to help his own and contiguous communities cannot receive too much praise.  In this day and age of international competition the securing and the establishment of industry and the appraisal of the potentialities of industry are not matters for the layman but for the professionals.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport has built up a team which is without equal anywhere in the world today.  We are fortunate that the mid-western development organisation has this team available to extend their promotional activities over the area as a whole.  Representatives from SFADCO have sat on the board of the Limerick-Clare-North Tipperary organisation and have been guiding and dynamic factors in promotion development of that body and its work. They brought forward a five-year development plan for the establishment of factories throughout the area.  That plan was received and endorsed unanimously by the members of the mid-western board.  As a further indication of co-operation in the Limerick area, I might mention that sites for two advance factories have been provided by the Limerick Corporation and sites for an initial two factories have been provided by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and more will be provided when necessary.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill which causes me some little concern, and was adverted to in the Dáil debate and replied to by the Minister, is the possible overlapping of the functions of the various organisations in the mid-western region now concerned with industrial development. I refer specifically to the IDA, SFADCO, the county development teams and the regional development organisation.  I appreciate that the IDA must retain its functions in regard to the payment of grants to industrialists, but I wonder if it would simplify matters if the Shannon Free Airport <Col N="453" /> Development Company could be charged with this task as an agent, if necessary, of the IDA?  It seems to me that such a move is possibly visualised by the intention to regionalise the activities of the IDA.</P>
    <P>The Minister might take cognisance of the different types of incentives available in the mid-western region. There is Shannon Free Airport where the major incentive is that 20-year tax free concession on profits emanating from the airport.  There is the grant incentive available in that portion of the region which comes under the underdeveloped areas.  Finally, there are grants and other incentives available in the rest of the region.  It might lead to better organisation, more efficient administration and greater success generally in the establishment of industries throughout the area as a whole if these various incentives could be brought up to a common level.</P>
    <P>All these plans for industrialisation in the mid-western area make it more than ever urgent that in Limerick, Ennis and other centres in the area the necessary technical and technologcal facilities should be available.  I see a danger at the present time in that the new Institute for Higher Education in Limerick has not yet got off the ground notwithstanding the very energetic efforts of the new director, Dr. Walsh.  Unless there is tremendous impetus to establish this Institute of Higher Education where full technological training will be available and unless these developments are pushed ahead almost of the projected industrial development, I can see that this region will run out of skilled operatives from the highest technical level down to the level of skilled workers.</P>
    <P>That is a point the Minister might take up with his colleague in the Department of Education.  The plans are there.  As far as I know there is no provision in this year's Estimates to put them into effect.  Everybody will agree that the establishment of an industry nowadays is dependent on an adequate complement of fully trained operatives, from the highest level downwards.  A scarcity of skilled operatives could affect the projected industrial development.  As the Minister is <Col N="454" /> aware, it is proposed during the next five years to establish industrial projects throughout the area.  I cannot see those going ahead effectively unless we have the personnel to work in them. Therefore, I hope the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Education will get together on this important problem.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to discuss the development of the mid-western region without making some reference to the development in the Shannon estuary.  In this regard the Minister is aware that after four or five years of negotiation the stage has been reached where the establishment of a single estuarial authority for the entire estuary is almost certain.  However, it is very disconcerting that there has been a considerable lack of co-operation and encouragement, not from the Minister's Department because he is not concerned in this, but from the Minister for Finance.  It is rather sad to think no grant or no assistance towards expenditure by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners of £17,000 to investigate the bar at the mouth of the Shannon has been forthcoming in spite of the fact that both the harbour commissioners and the regional development organisation have made several applications for assistance towards this very small sum.  In fact, the replies from the Department concerned have rather taken the line that the harbour commissioners should not have proceeded to the extent of exploring the nature of this bar across the mouth of the Shannon.  The value of this expenditure will be understood when I say that the removal of this bar would permit ships in excess of 500,000 tons, to come into the Shannon estuary with safety.</P>
    <P>I am sure other Members of the Seanad have read, as I have in the last few days, that one of the Japanese shipyards will shortly be laying the keel of a vessel of 477,000 tons, so that we are in a very real sense in the era of the gigantic ship.  The Shannon estuary is one of the very few waterways in Europe than can take ships of that size.  It is, therefore, vitally important that simultaneously with the industrial development of the mid-westtern region the development of the <Col N="455" /> Shannon estuary is proceeded with and that it does in fact become the centre of a major industrial complex.  It is the ideal site for the establishment of heavy industries.  Oil, smelting, chemicals&mdash;all these are industries for which Shannon is ideally suited.  In any question of regional development this should be kept in the forefront.  I hope the Minister will induce his colleagues in the Cabinet to take active and early steps for the promotion of the Shannon estuary as a site for major industrial development.</P>
    <P>We read recently that further developments are mooted for Cork. While I have the greatest respect for the Cork people and wish them every succes with their industrial development I suggest that there is a very serious gap in the west and mid-west where industrial development up to now has fallen far behind development in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the function of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in relation to tourism. Here again I should like to pay them a very sincere tribute for their successful promotional activities in this field.  I would suggest to the Minister that their work in this regard would be greatly assisted by better and more frequent air services between the Continent and Shannon Airport.  Indeed there is room for vast improvement in the service between Shannon and London.</P>
    <P>I noticed from the Dáil Debates that some of my colleagues from Limerick city referred to the development of King John's Castle.  I should like to add my voice to support this project which has now been outstanding for the past five or six years and for which funds have been earmarked by the Departments concerned and also by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.</P>
    <P>King John's Castle is one of the finest landmarks in the country, and the necessary capital, not from the Minister's Department but from one of his colleagues' Department, to rehouse some eight families contiguous to the castle should be forthcoming without further delay.  The projected expenditure <Col N="456" /> there is in the nature of £200,000 and it is estimated that something like £1 million a year would be spent in Limerick city area.  Surely the Department of Local Government could find in its coffers the sum of £25,000 or £30,000 to rehouse the eight families who would be disturbed by this development?</P>
    <P>Within recent months in Limerick we had the serious experience of the sole shipping service between Limerick and the United Kingdom being withdrawn. I would like to suggest to the Minister that here again the development of the mid-western area cannot go ahead without cognisance being taken of the requirements of shipping services between the area and the United Kingdom and the Continent, and the continuation of a shipping service between Limerick and the Continent or between Limerick and the United Kingdom should not be left to the vicissitudes of private enterprise. If the Minister makes the necessary inquiries from industrialists in the Shannon Free Airport Estate he will find that there is very considerable disappointment because the sole shipping link between the area and the United Kingdom was withdrawn a few months ago.  I would ask the Minister to take up with his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, the question of restoring that link, because I am satisfied, and indeed results of a market survey in the area have confirmed that such a shipping service, provided that it is pushed energetically by the people concerned, could be a viable enterprise.</P>
    <P>There are many other provisions in the Bill that I do not need to go into in detail.  They mainly concern the provision of additional capital for the services that the Minister has outlined in his report, but I would like to ask, is the Minister satisfied that the financial provisions in this Bill are adequate to deal with the very substantial industrial promotion programme visualised over the next five or ten years? On the face of it, they would appear to be adequate, but in these days of rapidly increasing costs of every kind under every head I would question whether the additional capital which <Col N="457" /> now, indeed, looks adequate is, in fact, adequate.</P>
    <P>This region is too important, and means too much to the people living in the area, for there to be any cavilling at the expenditure of a few more million pounds, and I am quite certain that this House and the Dáil would co-operate in giving the Minister every facility if further funds are required. There have been, and I presume some of us have participated in them, public meetings and debates about the urgent necessity of saving the west.  A lot of crocodile tears have been shed down the years about this very real human problem.  One way of ensuring not only the saving of the west in human terms but also the development of the west is to provide with all possible speed for the development of the mid-western region as a centre from which other developments would naturally follow in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I again would like to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill. I assure him of the full support of the Fine Gael Party and urge on him the necessity of having the provisions of the Bill put into effect without any avoidable delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill in so far as it will help the northern portion of the County Tipperary, namely Tipperary North Riding, but naturally, coming from the south of the county, I am disappointed that the portion of South Tipperary very near Limerick is not included in this region. While North Tipperary is included in the Limerick and Shannon region, South Tipperary is included in the Waterford region.  While this would suit towns like Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel, it certainly does not suit Tipperary town, which is at least 50 miles from Waterford city whereas it is only 24 miles from Limerick City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senators study the map of the area they will see the position of Tipperary town and the surrounding parishes.  They are completely encircled by County Limerick.  In fact, to travel to certain parts of County Limerick from Limerick City one must go through Tipperary town.  That town is on a main arterial route, and <Col N="458" /> we feel that inclusion in the Limerick region is our only hope of securing industries. If we are allowed to remain in the Waterford area it will mean that Tipperary town will be the last town that will benefit from industries extending from that area, whereas Tipperary is the nearest large town to Limerick City.  The county of Limerick itself comes within three or four miles of Tipperary town.  Parts of Tipperary, South Riding, are within 15 miles of Limerick City.  To develop the region properly you must take a radius from the city, and that radius should take in Tipperary town.  Again, it is a market town for a good deal of the county of Limerick.  Indeed there are a number of parishes on the border, where half the parish is in county Tipperary and the other half in County Limerick.</P>
    <P>Down through the years Tipperary has had very close associations with Limerick.  A large number of workers, both male and female, travel every day from Tipperary to Limerick and to Shannon.  Eventually those people settle down in either Shannon or Limerick, which means that the population of the Tipperary area is declining.  At the moment, I understand, there is a population of about 13,000 in this area. The population was much greater about ten years ago.  There are a large number of villages there, and in those villages there are only two industries, one in Dundrum and another in Cullen.  While there are some industries in Tipperary town we badly need others because it is a town where there is unemployment.  We are lucky enough at the moment to have the mines in Gurtdrum quite close to the town, which use Limerick port for the export of all their raw materials to the Continent but, like all mines, Gurtdrum will not last forever, and when Gurtdrum has run out of raw materials the unemployment problem will increase.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, there is in the area the greatest junction in Ireland, Limerick Junction, which is not far from Tipperary.  This is another reason why Tipperary should be placed in the Limerick mid-western region.</P>
    <P>The industries that would suit Tipperary <Col N="459" /> best are industries of the dairying type, because there are a large number of creameries in the area, and the rationalisation of creameries in the next five years will mean that a large number of creameries will close.  That will mean further unemployment. Therefore we must try to secure some alternative industry.</P>
    <P>There is a milk powder plant in Tipperary town which comes under the Dairy Disposals Board and which takes a large quantity of milk from the creameries.  The plant is rather obsolete having been installed 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister seriously to consider including the Tipperary area in the Limerick industrial area.  According to the Buchanan Report it should be in Waterford on the basis that boundaries should not be infringed but boundaries have been infringed before and in any case we are one county.  We may have two county councils but for all other purposes we are one, and therefore I would make an earnest appeal to the Minister seriously to consider allowing West Tipperary into the Limerick industrial area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wished to explain that I did not intend following the Senator's example.  Nevertheless, since I come from the constituency in which is situated Shannon Airport, I consider that there is an obligation on me to say a few words on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember Shannon Airport in the beginning when it had nothing but grass runways, and I have watched its <Col N="460" /> progress through the many years since then.  I have seen the inauguration of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and, in association with everybody in Clare, I recognise the exceedingly good work that has been done by the company.  As Senator Russell has said, they have acquired an expertise that distinguishes them in many respects from many of the other State bodies in that they started off from ground level.  They founded an industrial complex that has been of considerable benefit to the area.  They have given a new dimension to the viability of a western area as against the situation as it was before their establishment.</P>
    <P>As an organisation such as SFADCO grows bigger, very often their expertise is recruited into other fields and they are now the industrial development company for the regional area.  Within that area there are a number of other complexes.  There are the county councils, county development teams, chambers of commerce, the regional development association and there is the Mid-West Tourist Organisation so that there are now so many complexes that it has become difficult to know who is in charge of what.  However, in saying that I am not detracting in any way from their efforts or the success that SFADCO have achieved in their own right but at some time or other these various complexes will require further co-ordination.  A considerable amount of public money will have to be spent on these bodies and, after the experts have had another look at the situation, it is possible they will be seen to be in competition with one another.</P>
    <P>The company were faced with a sizable problem on the question of whether there would be enough workers because of the speed at which they developed factory operations. They realised that houses would have to be built in proximity to the airport area so that workers could be housed near the factories.  As Senator Russell has pointed out, also, there was a divergence of opinion as to whether the areas which already had the infrastructure required for the building of suitable houses should not be used to <Col N="461" /> create a domiciliary area around the airport where there were established communities so that it would be easy to fit the new workers who were to arrive at Shannon into already established communities.  However, the opinions of other people were listened to and we now have a situation at Shannon where a new town is in the process of growing up.  I am sure Senator Russell is also aware of this but many of the people who live there are not alone from Clare or Limerick but from Donegal, Roscommon, Wexford, Waterford and many other places throughout the country.  The question will arise with regard to the integration of those people in the community in their own right but because Shannon Development Company are the owners of the houses those people have not any way to express opinions with regard to how they would like the community to be developed.  We hear complaints that those people must eventually gain some status in their own right whether by way of town commissioners or urban councillors, so that they can meet and deliberate their own problems.  My advice to those people would be to stay the way they are.  Nevertheless, they feel they are inhibited from creating the kind of community they would like to have, in which they would be masters of their own decisions.</P>
    <P>The question arises about how big this town should grow.  We have the domiciliary areas around Shannon with the infrastructure.  Should Shannon grow so big that instead of solving problems in relation to employment it will in the long run create more difficulties than it is likely to solve?  Many of the people employed in Shannon would prefer to live in the settled communities which already exist around the area.  My opinion is that there is some justification for that preference because if a town grows to a large extent and a huge number of homogeneous people from various places and having no common bond, are set side by side it will take two generations before they are integrated into the kind of community most people like to live in.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything that <Col N="462" /> would give the appearance that SFADCO have not done a wonderful job there, even in housing.  The question arises, which will have to be answered by somebody, whether it be the Department of Local Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Department of Transport and Power, as to the limitations that should be placed on this kind of development.  As a member of the county council I know that in areas contiguous to Shannon having the requisite infrastructure there are many people who are asking what can be done with regard to building houses in their areas so that they can live in the areas where they were brought up and where they may be able to give a certain amount of help where there are small farms.  A considerable amount of money is being provided for housing at Shannon and this prevents people in those outlying areas from obtaining housing.  This matter should be considered at some higher level.  The concensus of opinion in our area is that the interests of the people who are going to work there would be better served by giving them the option of living where they want to live rather than telling them that if they want a job at Shannon they must come and live at Shannon.</P>
    <P>These are matters of considerable import but nobody in the area has any voice in deciding them because, with the exception of the Chairman, Mr. Brendan O'Regan, there is not anybody from the region on the board of Shannon Development Company.  This development started within the area of Shannon Airport, within the customs closed area.  If the company are to be the chief arbiters of the type of development we are to have in the region it is only fair and equitable that the people in the region should have one, two or three representatives on the board.  They, in a general way, will decide the future of the area.  The company have statutory authority and if they use it in the way they are entitled to use it county councils, urban councils and all the other various bodies will be standing by watching developments without having any voice in the final decision.  I would recommend <Col N="463" /> to the Minister that this matter should be looked at.  The regional development association or the county development teams are under the umbrella of SFADCO.  Nobody from the area has any voice in decisions.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell raised the important question today of skilled workers.  He advocated the case for the technological school in Limerick.  I am a member of the Clare Vocational Education Committee.  We have considerable success in training people for skilled purposes.  There should be some liaison established, not with the Clare Vocational Education Committee, but between the Vocational Education Committees of Limerick and North Tipperary and SFADCO so that training schemes could be initiated in the schools which would be orientated towards the preparation of young people to fill the jobs being created at Shannon.  Some of the factory people at Shannon have complained to me that they cannot get people to work for them.  We have the schools and we have the capacity but we do not know the requirements.  The Minister should mention to SFADCO the necessity for this kind of co-operation because if we are to work within a region you cannot exclude any part of the region or any of the activities in the region from the general scheme.  If we are to have regional work then we must have it in the fullest sense so that all those living within the region can feel they are participating in the work of the region.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell made a lengthy discourse on the region as a whole.  I do not wish to discuss the points he made. If regionalisation is to be accepted, every organisation in the region must have the right of participation.  Conditions that are laid down must apply throughout the region.</P>
    <P>Senator William Ryan made a point about Tipperary town which he said is close to the county boundary line. It is also true that parts of County Clare are 60 miles from Shannon. Children from west Clare are continually leaving the county while there are jobs to be filled at Shannon.  They <Col N="464" /> cannot get to Shannon because there is no transport to take them there.  This poses a problem as to whether the activities of SFADCO should be spread into areas which are not immediately accessible.  I do not know the optimum distance a person should commute to work.  There are various opinions on this point.  It is ridiculous to bring people 25 miles to work and to expect them to travel back 25 miles in the evening after their day's work. Clare County Council have provided a number of industrial sites in the county.  They have provided one at Ennis, and one at Miltown Malbay, and are in the process of providing one at Kilrush because it was not possible for people to commute 25 miles every day, leaving home at 5 a.m. and returning at 10 p.m.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Development Company should provide areas with the types of employment suitable to them, provided the infrastructure is correct.  This is not impossible.  It must be seen as part of regional development.  Regional development must not be seen as the creation of a big complex at Shannon while the remainder of the county is left without industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse and underline practically everything Senator Honan has said.  The Senator is speaking from his experience in Clare and has dealt very realistically with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  On many occasions in the past we have discussed this point.  I have held that it was crazy to try to build a new town at the end of a runway and that the logical development should have been to build up the neighbouring areas and the transportation involved.  I do not think that a distance of 15 or 20 miles' travel by modern standards imposes any great barrier.  Be that as it may, we have the situation as it is now where, at considerable expense, the nucleus of a town has been built at Shannon.  We should study very carefully what has been done and what has been achieved there.  Foremost among what has been achieved, we can see a very successful financial picture and the creation of an industrial complex involving <Col N="465" /> 4,500 workers.  This cost a good deal of money.  I believe that the State's direct contribution to this has been £10 million. There are many hidden contributions to other facets of community development.  These came out of other funds.  If we are prepared to put money into any region it can be developed. The other necessary counterpart is technical skill and know-how. We are pleased to see that our own men, many of them graduates of our universities and vocational schools, when given the opportunities have shown themselves second to none in imagination and enterprise.  We have those two ingredients and we should use them in many other areas.</P>
      <P>I would be very slow to see any of our funds committed to building more new towns.  We have more than enough towns at present which are crying out for development and for an industrial complex.  When we come to considering the Buchanan Report the picture will become clearer as to what is to happen to these smaller towns.  I hope they will not be decimated as seemed to be foreshadowed in the Buchanan Report which suggested that the country should be split into a small number of large industrial complexes.  The intervening position would be difficult to imagine.  We have something here which must be studied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see a cost/benefit analysis done of the whole Shannon project.  What does it really cost the taxpayer to provide 4,500 jobs?  How much of that money went towards town development?  What would it have cost to have spread that town development over four or five neighbouring centres while still maintaining the complex at Shannon?  It would seem probable at some stage that a more central location could have been chosen.  The figures are quite impressive, as they stand. There has been an output of £13 million per annum which is 20 per cent of the total of our industrial exports.  That is almost £3,000 per worker.  In the complex almost two-thirds of the workers are males.  It is a very wellbalanced type of complex.  The distances some workers have to travel by bus impose great hardships especially for female workers.  Some workers <Col N="466" /> travel as much as 40 miles or more to Shannon and home again each day.  A concept of regional development would obviate that.  It would ensure that the transport costs were directed towards developing industries in a co-ordinated way.  A reduction of travelling time would leave people with more time to spare to become part of their local communities.</P>
    <P>The idea of committing the pilot region of Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary to the Shannon Airport Development Company is a helpful experiment because they have at Shannon quite a pool of expertise, though I feel that their experience is rather one-sided.  In other words, their experience is in the development of Shannon which, as I see it, is largely a development based on outside capital companies and there is little or no local capital in it, as far as I know.  I should like to ask if there is much local capital in it.  Certainly there is not any capital of a co-operative nature in it.</P>
    <P>That is what you expect in an industrial estate that is largely dependent on the outside.  The type of regional development we want to see is very different from that; it would be of a more co-operative nature and would entail much greater involvement of local communities.  If I interpret Senator Honan rightly, he was calling for that.</P>
    <P>In such a situation it would seem that the thinking of the Shannon group may not be along the proper lines. Certainly the IDA would want to see that development is balanced and that particular stress is placed on co-operative enterprise in those areas.  We cannot simply regard development as an effort to procure an industrialist from Japan or from Mars who would put his capital like manna from Heaven into a local community.  I should much prefer to see the local groups coming together, putting up their portion, and the State helping by way of grants and loans that would later be taken up by the workers becoming part shareholders.</P>
    <P>In such a small community there is <Col N="467" /> not room for two classes in the operation of factories.  The workers must feel it is their factory, operated from their savings and in the form of the overtime work they put into it.  Therefore, when the going gets difficult, they know that the answer is long hours of hard work to keep the factory going. It is some kind of co-operative development along those lines I should like to see fostered in the pilot area of Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary.</P>
    <P>The State has invested about £1,500 per worker directly in Shannon, whatever the indirect investment is.  We have built up there to 6,000 and before we move further I should like to see an assessment of what planners regard as a viable community.  When they get to 6,000 the next viable community is 10,000 and once 10,000 is reached it goes up to 20,000.  We want a settled policy on this.</P>
    <P>The factories at Shannon have created a demand for a number of skills that call for a high level of training of the personnel involved.  Training can be supplied by the vocational schools and through the proposed new institute of technology in Limerick.  As a Limerickman who is concerned with the development of the region, I am anxious and eager to see the institute progress and play a useful part in our development.  I advise those involved that they will make far better progress if they begin by not thinking that all innovation in Ireland begins with this new institute.  Those who for long have carried the burden in our universities have made their contributions and they think along the most modern lines. They know the deficiencies of our system&mdash;they know the lack of capital and of other resources we are constantly up against.</P>
    <P>It ill becomes Limerick to try to build its new institute by denigrating the established universities of the country. I hope we shall have less of that and that that, in turn, will pave the way for much more genuine co-operation between the new institute and the existing universities.  The type of courses suggested for the institute in Limerick are sandwich courses, part-time study courses and so on.  They <Col N="468" /> are all useful, but they supplement or are companions of the normal degree courses and both have their function. The main part of a degree course is to train a man to think.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the success and the development of the region is tied in a great deal with the success of the new institute and I wanted to give those concerned a few words of friendly advice on how to do it on a proper co-operative basis.  I will pass on from there.  I would hope that the planners will seek to make the fullest use of agricultural produce in the area and not to follow the dichotomy of regarding agriculture as being on one side and industry on the other.  The one thing in this region we must think about is the processing of agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>There is near Limerick the Golden Vale Group and if the new development can link in and achieve friendly co-operation with the Golden Vale people it will be on the right track.  If we look at Limerick itself, it has almost one million acres of first-class arable land.  In that way we get an idea of the significance of what is done at Shannon.  In other words, the net output there is £13 million at the moment. That is quite good but what is it but £13 per acre on the million acres in Limerick, and any industrialist looking at the Limerick scene and its potential will see the scope there not for a £13 million increase but for twice or three times that.</P>
      <P>Again, I appeal for the proper place of agriculture in our development and I do not think there is any agricultural side to the Shannon development.  The Company must appreciate that agriculture is a fact of life and therefore must see that that fact is constantly kept in mind in promoting the areas entrusted to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for planning as a whole, we must see that it is interwoven into a proper <Col N="469" /> scheme and with proper regard for the amenities of the area and above all the amenities of Limerick city.  A city can deteriorate very quickly and get into the unfortunate situation in which many of the fine resorts in Cork are at the moment with oil spillages.  All these things must be guarded against and severely dealt with and Limerick might be forewarned by what has happened elsewhere.  We must see that standards are maintained and that Limerick remains, as it has been, a very fine environmental area.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether anything has happened in this area in regard to the development of the Europort which made such headlines six to eight years ago.  I presume this would be too big an undertaking for the development company as it is but it is something that we hope has not been lost sight of.  Certainly, the need for larger ships is growing and becoming more evident every day and consequently the claims of Limerick to a major port are obvious.</P>
    <P>There is little else to say except to ask why this grotesque name&mdash; SFADCO, or whatever one calls it? Why should that not at least be abbreviated to something that can be used readily?  Why not cut it down to at least SDC&mdash;Shannon Development Company?  It is the most grotesque contraction I have seen in a long time.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the company and those associated with it for the great work they have done. Anything I have said or indeed that Senator Honan or other Senators have said does not detract from their great work but we must be prudent and learn from it.  We are in the happy position that our need is not for new cities or new towns but simply to strengthen and invigorate those we have got.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say because I have no great interest in Limerick or Shannon Airport.  I am interested in the west of Ireland.  However, we have the greatest admiration for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  It has done a magnificent job of work.  Those of us who are <Col N="470" /> outside the area certainly are envious of it.</P>
      <P>We are a little bit concerned about this development and the amount of money that has been expended on it. One wonders how long the millions of pounds that are being poured into this area will continue to be poured into it. To develop it to what size?  Senators here have expressed the opinion that towns around the area should be developed.  I would join with them in expressing the view that this should be done and that somewhere and soon a halt should be drawn to the growth of the development there.</P>
      <P>It may be argued that it is an economic necessity to make the big places bigger.  I fail to see this because I feel that in order to keep our country viable we must keep our people, to a large extent, in the areas and in the communities in which they now are.  I would say that if a certain number of the millions of pounds that are being now spent on Shannon were to be diverted into any other area that area would be bound to grow also.  I am not in any way denigrating the job that has been done in Shannon.  It is wonderful.  However, whatever Buchanan says about natural growth areas, I feel that we can do with a certain amount of growth in other areas.  If, for instance, the port of Galway had the amount of money spent on it that Shannon Airport has had spent on it I have no doubt that it would develop into a very fine port indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech today the Minister said that the mid-west region has an important place in the western area.  I have a different idea of geography from the Minister's.  Anyone living in the midlands and anyone over in the west of Ireland would certainly consider south Clare or Limerick very much the south of the country which would not affect to a large extent what we would call the west of Ireland.  This is a thing we are concerned with.  I suppose it could be a matter of whose geography is at fault. I know where I think the west of Ireland it.  I know that north Clare may be regarded as part of the west of Ireland but to a Mayo man, for instance, Clare is not the west of <Col N="471" /> Ireland, Clare is the south of Ireland.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to think and to tell us how much more money will be poured into Shannon and whether, by pouring in this money, we will be depriving other areas of a certain amount of development with which they could do because populations are leaving many areas very fast and once they leave it is very hard to get people to come back.</P>
    <P>The only other thing that would exercise my mind is the part of the county development teams in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  My impression was that, under the new regionalisation plan&mdash; and I may be wrong in this&mdash;the county development teams would still be responsible directly to the small industries division in Dublin and would deal with them directly where small industries were concerned.  I may be interpreting what the Minister said in the Dáil incorrectly.  He said at column 2104 of Volume 246:</P>
    <P>I cannot spell out what the county development team is doing....  There is no doubt but that it is on SFADCO's competent shoulders that the industrial development of the mid-west region will lie.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to be slightly different from the impression we got about the role of the county development teams in the regional plan for the future.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying he will clarify the situation for us because the county development teams have done very great work in their counties and it would be a pity now if responsibility for developing the small industries in these areas were to be taken away from them.  We know that under the new regional offices the regional officer will be responsible for the overall development in the area but I understand that county development teams were still to be concerned with small industries.</P>
    <P>Once more I should like to say that I admire greatly the work that has been done in Shannon.  They have even written it up in the <i>Reader's Digest</i> as the Airport that refused to die.  The men down there who have set the headlines for regional development as <Col N="472" /> a whole are to be congratulated.  I hope their work will continue to prosper but that it will not prosper at the expense of the rest of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Senators, should like to welcome the Bill. I welcome the extension of authority into the region including Clare, Limerick city and county and Tipperary.</P>
      <P>We in Limerick are rather dissatisfied with the portion of the industrial cake that we have received both in the county and in the city.  It may be argued that Limerick city is fortunate by virtue of the fact that it is only 16 miles from Shannon and as a result a very high percentage of our working population are employed in Shannon. Nevertheless we feel that over the past ten years we have been forgotten in the industrial field.  We feel particularly concerned about west Limerick.  While Shannon Development has helped west Limerick to some extent by bringing industry to Newcastlewest we feel that it is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>Several Senators have mentioned the long distance that workers have to go to work.  That was a point on which I wanted to speak in particular.  Some girls travel 50 miles each way by bus and prior to joining the bus at Newcastlewest some of them cycle five or six miles.  These young girls return at 9 o'clock at night and sometimes have to cycle along dark lonesome roads.  It must be a health hazard that they should be asked to work and to travel these long distances.  I believe that Shannon Airport, in spite of the great service it has rendered to the workers of the area, is a bit top heavy, and that we should concentrate more on rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company for the interest they have shown, outside the industrial field, in tourism.  They have taken part in the introduction of the scheme known as &ldquo;rent an Irish cottage&rdquo; in the region, which has in its own small way become very beneficial to the small villages. Some of these villages, while they particularly badly need an industry, will never be fortunate enough to get one. For that reason this scheme will be a <Col N="473" /> big advantage to the community in small villages.  People who come here from England, America and even farther away are very happy when they return to say that they lived in and enjoyed a holiday in a traditional Irish home.  This scheme, in my opinion, should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by asking the Minister to do all in his power for the people in rural Ireland and to bring more industries into places like west Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be truthfully said that this Bill has met with an overall degree of welcome in the Seanad, and I would like to take the opportunity of thanking the Members for the constructive manner in which they have dealt with this subject.  There is no doubt that overall this measure is welcomed.  Senator Russell in his opening remarks spoke on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, welcomed this measure and hoped that it would be enacted and that the consequential Orders would be made as soon as possible. I welcome this approach, and I should like in reply to endeavour to cover a number of the matters that were raised during the course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to select, if I may, a number of the subjects that were referred to on both sides of the House in relation to the effect of this piece of legislation.  I find that there was reference to the further expansion of the Shannon area industrial estate and the housing complex, and there were questions asked as to whether it was a good thing to be pouring more money into industrial development in this area, and into further housing there. At that stage a number of Senators lost sight of the actual purpose of the Bill, in that this piece of legislation is in its own way an expression of confidence in the ability of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to extend its area of supervision into the much wider areas which embrace counties Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary.  The additional money being provided under this enabling legislation is not specifically for the further development of an estate which <Col N="474" /> is flourishing and has flourished over a period.  It is money being provided for the further development of the two and a half counties covered in this new legislation.</P>
    <P>The last speaker, Senator O'Brien, did call for a greater spreading of the benefits of SFADCO, and in fact this is embraced in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell, who spoke earlier, wondered if I was satisfied that the financial provisions in the Bill were adequate.  Let me say that the intention in this regard, and it is spelt out, is to provide for a reasonable period of three years ahead and then to come back to the Oireachtas for more if necessary.  This short period, as I see it, is an ideal length of time, because it does enable both Houses of the Oireachtas to express themselves again on the progress or otherwise made by SFADCO in the intervening three-year period.  If, in fact, the amounts that are being provided prove inadequate it will mean coming back sooner than at present expected, and this presents no real problem.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the Minister for Industry and Commerce will provide an increased share capital from £8 million to £17 million as well as an increased provision for grant-in-aid from £6 million to £10 million.  In addition, the Bill provides for an increased amount of repayable advances from £7 million to £10 million.  This is the ideal way to superintend the operations of SFADCO, in that both Houses will therefore have the opportunity of reviewing the progress made by the company in conjunction with the IDA over the three-year period.</P>
    <P>This would to a great extent cover the points made by Senator Quinlan, who was rather worried about the overall continual expansion of the development in the industrial estate area.  I was rather intrigued by Senator Quinlan's approach to this subject, because though he did find reason to criticise in the early stages from the point of view that it did not seem sensible to him to create an industrial estate and a town at the end of a runway, at the same time the general overall tone of the debate here and in the Dáil in relation to this has been <Col N="475" /> one of congratulation on the success of the operation of this Shannon development company since its establishment. Many tributes were paid to the inception of the idea.</P>
    <P>Listening to Senator Quinlan developing the idea of providing the industrial estate at Shannon and developing housing in the surrounding towns for the people who would be working there it seemed contradictory that he should, at the same time, find occasion to criticise the necessity for workers to travel 30 or 40 miles to the industrial estate area.  Senator O'Brien also referred to this question of travel. SFADCO have taken the right attitude in endeavouring to create a town at Shannon in order to cultivate a local community and in order to meet the housing requirements in the immediate vicinity that would tie in in a most comprehensive way with the further development requirements of the Shannon industrial estate area.</P>
    <P>A point raised by Senator Honan and one which was also raised in the Dáil was the question of the need for someone from the community area to be represented on SFADCO.  This brings us back to the idea that SFADCO are only catering for the industrial development and the housing development in the airport area but in actual fact under this Bill their domain of responsibility is becoming so extended that it would be improper at this stage to give serious consideration to the appointment of someone from the local community to the board of SFADCO from the point of view of solving local community problems or expressing local community views, because of the wide spectrum of responsibility now being given to SFADCO.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed by Senator Farrell and by other Senators about the danger to the small industries development in this area in view of the expression of confidence in the operations of the board of SFADCO and in view of the expression of congratulations to them for the progress they have achieved up to now.  It is rather contradictory to compliment them on the one hand on the success of their endeavours so far and, on the <Col N="476" /> other hand, to express doubts or reservations about the possibility of their being able to make a success of development in this wider area which I describe as the mid-west region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was questioning the role of the county development teams in areas which would be controlled by SFADCO in view of what is envisaged for the county development teams under regional planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping to reach that point.  Senator Farrell stated specifically that her interest was directed to a great extent to the well-being of the west of Ireland.  I do not accept that this mid-west area is not in the west but we can agree to differ on this.  Let me say, however, that what Senator Farrell possibly forgets in this regard is that not all of the area within this mid-west region is an area to which is attached a county development team.  There are development teams in the designated areas of all counties but the East Limerick and North Tipperary regions are not in the designated areas and, consequently, they do not have county development teams.  From the point of view of the industrial development that comes within the ambit of the IDA as a whole, there will be regions such as Clare in this case which has a county development team whereas North Tipperary has not, where SFADCO are now being assigned the responsibility for the further industrial development, having already established and proved themselves to be experts in the field of development within the sphere of the industrial estate.  As a group, they will be a separate entity from the type of situation that will exist in all other developing regions.  I do not think there is any need for Senator Farrell to worry specifically about the possibility of SFADCO being allowed to use up all the available capital resources for industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to a point raised by Senator Russell&mdash;in respect of which the Senator said I had not given satisfactory replies in the Dáil in answer to questions&mdash;namely, the giving to SFADCO of the overall responsibility <Col N="477" /> for being the grant-paying authority. There is adequate justification for maintaining the IDA as the overall grant-paying authority since we must avoid the type of situation where there would be competition, as it were, between a rival responsibility in one developing area as against an interest in the new mid-west region.  I may be over-exaggerating in this but I can see every reason for taking precautions to prevent a situation arising where SFADCO on the one hand would be endeavouring to attract an industry to the mid-west region while the IDA would be endeavouring to attract the industry to some other western area.</P>
    <P>Being from the midlands, I was surprised to hear Senator Farrell say that Roscommon is more west than Clare.  Perhaps we can agree to differ on that.  I suppose it depends on one's point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was in the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Senator Quinlan is not here because he said he found it difficult to get around the contraction &ldquo;SFADCO&rdquo;.  I want to say that I found it difficult also but it rolls off the tongue now.  It struck me it would be difficult to abbreviate.  For instance, if you were to take the &ldquo;F&rdquo; out of it to make it easier to pronounce I do not know if &ldquo;SADCO&rdquo; would be a good contraction either. It has got itself very well established as &ldquo;SFADCO&rdquo;.  Everybody pays tribute to the successful manner in which SFADCO have performed their responsibilities up to now.  I gather from the people representing the areas that they welcome the extension of the responsibilities of SFADCO to all of Clare, all Limerick and the North Tipperary areas and if one were to try to measure the confidence the House has in it one need only refer to the comments by Senator Willie Ryan who was so anxious to get his Tipperary area into the new mid-western region.  It is quite natural in that regard that anybody on the fringe areas of the mid-west who can visualise definite advantages accruing therefrom would want to try to get into it.  It is natural that a case could be made by the local representatives <Col N="478" /> in this regard but when one tries to extend borders in this way the pressures keep developing.  The areas have been assigned at this stage and any interference with the arrangements that have been made and the various boundaries which have been created would not be of advantage at this stage.</P>
      <P>My predecessor &mdash; I propose to keep following this&mdash;arranged with SFADCO and with the IDA that they should consult together in regard to the Tipperary town area in view of its involvement economically in the Limerick area.  Senator Russell paid a tribute to SFADCO and as I am in the House I should also pay tribute to them for the work they have done.  The efforts of many people to get into the area is adequate proof that the people of that region have every confidence in SFADCO.</P>
      <P>Senator Russell drew attention to the three rates of grants available in that region.  As I have just said to Senator Farrell this is not peculiar to the mid-west as it will obtain in many regions where you have some counties designated and other counties in the same region not designated.  This is where the advantage of being able to review the situation in two or three years time arises because with the energy that SFADCO can be expected to put into the industrial drive it will not be necessary to create further inducements to attract industrialists into the areas of the mid-west which are not now designated.  If we were to try to justify that it would take from what is an expression of sincere confidence in SFADCO to get the job done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in my opening remarks, anticipating this, that SFADCO have already moved and I have no reason to think that progress will not be continued. There were other points raised by Senator Russell but I do not think he can expect me to deal specifically with the functions of my colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, in dealing with King John's Castle or the development of air transport between Shannon and London and between Shannon and the Continent.  I am not endeavouring to cast any aspersions on the Chair but those are items which <Col N="479" /> do not come within my ambit as Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan naturally spoke with a degree of authority on this subject because of his vast knowledge of it. He drew attention to the need to try to improve relationships.  I said in the Dáil that I would be endeavouring to give attention to this matter but I do not think it would be properly resolved by appointing somebody from the airport town area on to a company which has a far broader area to look after.  I shall try to see if there are problems of a local nature which need to be properly attended to.  I do not think I have much further to say on this which would necessitate my asking the House to excuse me for the vote in the other House.  Again, I want to welcome the manner in which the Bill has been received.</P>

      <P>Could I say this to the Leader of the House?  It will be acknowledged that Senators on this side of the House and indeed Senators sitting behind the Leader of the House are entitled to give adequate consideration to the question of amendments.</P>
      <P>I should like to get this off my chest very briefly.  I will probably deal with it at some length later.  The practice which seems to be the custom here, of asking the Seanad to give all Stages of the Bill together places Senators on this side of the House in a compromising position very frequently.  They do not want to be discourteous or unobliging. Very often they are not in a position to give the consideration which they feel they should give to the question of amendments.  Even though a Senator may not have formulated a particular amendment I think he is entitled to the opportunity of considering whether he will put down an amendment. He cannot do that if all Stages are demanded to be given together.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This short and, I think, non-controversial Bill has three objects.  The first and main object is to authorise the establishment of places other than prisons to help in the rehabilitation of offenders.  The second object is to reduce the upper age limit for offenders who may <Col N="481" /> be committed by the courts to St. Patrick's Institution from 21 to 19.  The third is to enable offenders detained in St. Patrick's to be transferred to prison during any periods of overcrowding that may occur.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill gives legislative approval to the &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre at Shanganagh.  County Dublin, which was opened in August, 1968.  This centre is for the detention of selected young offenders transferred to it from St. Patrick's Institution, North Circular Road, Dublin or from the prisons.  It is the first &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre to be established here.  Since its establishment, the transfer of offenders from St. Patrick's or the prisons to Shanganagh has been on the basis that the offenders are temporarily released subject to a condition that they reside in Shanganagh and comply with the requirements of the person in charge there.  All in all, this arrangement has worked satisfactorily but it has some disadvantages, not the least of which is that a visiting committee cannot be appointed to Shanganagh.</P>
      <P>Section 2 is expressed in terms which would authorise the setting up of other places of the same kind.  It would cover, for example, the establishment of an open institution for adult offenders or a hostel or hostels within the community, rather than inside prison, to accommodate offenders on temporary release to employment.  There is, however, no immediate intention of establishing any institution other than that already in operation in Shanganagh. There is a good deal of work to be carried out there before its full potential is realised.  Much as I would like to provide a wider spectrum of institutions for the rehabilitation of various categories of offenders, it seems to me that the better course is to concentrate on completing the equipment of Shanganagh with proper facilities and observing the results before embarking on the provision of other types of institutions whose rehabilitative value has in many cases still to be conclusively determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, a word about Shanganagh itself.  It has extensive grounds, there is adequate provision for games and recreation, and formal restrictions are <Col N="482" /> deliberately kept to a minimum so as to foster a sense of responsibility and self-control.  It has accommodation for 55 youths and the whole system is designed to encourage and assist the boys who are sent there to organise and control their own lives along proper lines.  A good deal of experimentation is still going on and a full programme of training will not be possible until permanent workshops have been erected.  Those workshops, which are scheduled for erection this year, will provide facilities for instruction in metal work and plumbing, car maintenance and repair, electrical repairs, building construction and painting, papering and glazing.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with the regulations which may be made by the Minister for Justice under the Bill. They are of two kinds.  First of all, under subsection (1) the Minister is empowered to prescribe the age limits and the sex of persons who may be detained in places provided under the Bill.  As regards these regulations, my intention is to prescribe age limits of 16 to 21 for Shanganagh.</P>
    <P>Then, there are the regulations which may be made under subsection (2). These will deal with the management of these places.  Here I should, perhaps, make it clear that there will be no question of applying prison rules to Shanganagh.  Indeed the regulations I shall make will be as simple and flexible as possible consistent with the necessity for formally establishing guidelines as to what the purpose of the training and treatment of the boys there really is.</P>
    <P>Section 4 applies the existing enactments relating to prisons and St. Patrick's Institution to places established under section 2 of the Bill.  It is under this provision, for example, that a visiting committee will be appointed. The proviso at the end of the section is intended to ensure that the courts will not have power to commit offenders directly to Shanganagh.  With &ldquo;open&rdquo; centres of this kind it is essential that an opportunity be provided to determine the suitability of offenders for &ldquo;open&rdquo; conditions.  This cannot normally be done until an interval has elapsed to enable the behaviour of the <Col N="483" /> offender in custody and the general background reports to be evaluated.</P>
    <P>Indeed, notwithstanding the selection procedure which is operated at present in relation to the transfer of boys to Shanganagh, it has happened on a few occasions that after arriving at Shanganagh boys have had to be sent back to a closed institution because they could not resist the temptation to abscond.  Even with conditions of overcrowding in St. Patrick's Institution, it has been found difficult, at times, to find a sufficient number of boys who could be depended on to stay in Shanganagh and to benefit from the regime there.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the machinery of transferring offenders to and from these places.  It will be observed that the section does not enable the Minister to transfer from Shanganagh to prison an offender who was originally sentenced to detention in St. Patrick's Institution.  Where such an offender has to be sent from Shanganagh to a closed institution, he may be returned only to St. Patrick's or to another &ldquo;open&rdquo; institution.</P>
    <P>It has always been the law that persons sentenced to detention in St. Patrick's may not be transferred to prison unless they are reported by the visiting committee to be incorrigible or to be exercising a bad influence on the other inmates.  As the boys selected for Shanganagh could not be said to come into these categories I think there should be no question of their being sent to prison if for some reason they have to be transferred out of Shanganagh.</P>
    <P>Up to now I have been dealing with the establishment of places like Shanganagh and the various provisions specifying who may go there, how they are to be treated and so on.  Section 6 stands on its own as a straightforward provision reducing the age of committal to St. Patrick's Institution from 21 to 19 years.  I think it is necessary to make it clear why this provision is being introduced.  It has been suggested that it might have been included simply to relieve the overcrowding which, unfortunately, has been experienced for limited periods in St. <Col N="484" /> Patrick's during the past few years and that Shanganagh is being used as a kind of overflow from St. Patrick's to ease the congestion there.  Both suggestions are unfounded.</P>
    <P>The reason for reducing the maximum age limit to 19 is simply that some of the older inmates in St. Patrick's are liable to have a bad influence on some of the younger ones. Of course not all of the 19 to 21s are in this category, just as not all of the 16 to 18s are inexperienced.  What the section proposes is that the courts will no longer be able to send persons of 19 to 21 directly to St. Patrick's but &mdash;and I would like to stress this&mdash;the Minister for Justice will still have power to transfer persons in the 19 to 21 age group from prison to St. Patrick's where he considers that they might with advantage be detained in that institution.</P>
    <P>The object of the provision is, in short, to ensure that the rehabilitative influences in St. Patrick's will not be undermined by the presence of experienced criminals who might have a contaminating influence on others. Clearly any reduction of this kind in the maximum age of committal is bound to have some effect on the numbers but I would expect that a fair number of the less sophisticated offenders in the 19 to 21 category would be suitable for transfer from prison to St. Patrick's after the section comes into operation.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the section will not be brought into operation until certain reconstruction work at Mountjoy Prison has been completed.  This work is necessary to ensure proper accommodation and segregation for the increased number of young offenders who may be committed there after the section comes into force.</P>
    <P>This brings me to section 7.  This section, too, will not come into force when the Bill becomes law.  It will operate only during periods of overcrowding and, before the Minister may make an order bringing it into operation, he must consult with the visiting committee to St. Patrick's Institution as to whether a situation of overcrowding exists and for how long it is expected to continue.  Provision is also made that <Col N="485" /> the Minister may, during the currency of such an order&mdash;again after consultation with the visiting committee-amend or revoke the order.</P>
    <P>Subject to these provisions, the section empowers the Minister to relieve any overcrowding which may arise from time to time in St. Patrick's by transferring some offenders from it to prison but he is authorised, by virtue of subsection (3) of the section, to transfer those offenders or some of them, as may be appropriate, back to St. Patrick's when the overcrowding eases.  I should like to emphasise that I regard the powers which are sought here to relieve overcrowding as nothing more than a purely temporary solution and as being less objectionable than what has had to be done in the past on such occasions, namely, releasing offenders from St. Patrick's before their sentences had expired in order to make way for fresh committals.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the maximum age for committal to St. Patrick's proposed in section 6 will provide some measure of relief when it comes into operation. It may be, too, that the present high level of committals to St. Patrick's will taper off, though it must be said that such a development would be contrary to a worldwide trend.  Further accommodation in St. Patrick's will be available when the women's prison which adjoins it is moved to the place of detention at Marlborough House, Glasnevin, which is expected to be closed before the end of the year.  Such a transfer cannot be expected to take place for a few years yet as Marlborough House will have to be demolished and a new women's prison built in its place.  In these circumstances, I am continuing the search for a suitable site for a new St. Patrick's convenient to Dublin, though I need hardly say that the cost of acquiring a site and providing a modern institution on it is bound to be very considerable.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to give a general explanation of the objects of the Bill and of the effect of its various provisions.  I hope the House will accept it as a practical measure which is an earnest of the effort we are making, within our limited resources, <Col N="486" /> to provide for the rehabilitation of the members of our society who have repeatedly come up against the criminal law.  It makes, I believe, a useful addition to our legislation in this field but I do not regard it as by any means the final legislative word on the treatment of offenders, whether institutionally or otherwise.  Accordingly, on the basis that the Bill is a useful and practical step forward, I ask the House to give it a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the principles of this Bill are concerned the Minister will certainly have the approval of this House.  As I see it, this Bill contains two principles and three objects to which the Minister has referred.  The first object, which I also regard as a principle, is in connection with the legal authority for the establishment of institutions such as Shanganagh. The second is with regard to the reduction of the age limit for committal to St. Patrick's.  The third object is not, I hope, regarded by the Minister in any sense as a principle&mdash;it is the authority in cases of periods of overcrowding to transfer prisoners or inmates from St. Patrick's to prison.</P>
      <P>So far as the principles of this Bill are concerned I certainly support them. I have definite reservations with regard to the manner in which it is proposed to implement those principles so far as the particular drafting of this Bill is concerned.  I would certainly suggest to the Minister the desirability of amending the wording of certain sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has described in general terms the operation of the &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre at Shanganagh.  He has mentioned the fact that it has been possible to operate this &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre on the basis of releasing prisoners from St. Patrick's and, I think, other institutions also.  It has been operated on the basis of releasing prisoners conditionally, the condition being that they take up residence in Shanganagh.  As the Minister pointed out the fact that authority for the operation of Shanganagh as a place of detention did not exist under our legislation and the fact that it was not being operated under the ordinary <Col N="487" /> prison code in the same way as, say, Mountjoy, Portlaoise or St. Patrick's was being operated, meant that it did suffer some disadvantages, one being the fact that a visiting committee could not be attached to it.</P>
    <P>I feel that the experiment&mdash;if we may call it that&mdash;of Shanganagh is one that was well worth making and that it is well worth encouraging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel also it would be well worth the while of the Minister and his Department to engage their attention seriously with a view to expanding this kind of &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre prison service.  I am somewhat disappointed by the Minister's remarks which, rightly or wrongly, I interpret as meaning that at least for the present there are no plans in his Department to expand this type of service.</P>
      <P>The Shanganagh centre is selective in the sense that it is used only for the accommodation of suitable offenders from St. Patrick's or from other prisons.  There is a degree of selectivity in deciding who will be sent there.  It is necessary that that should be so and the fact that it is necessary that it should be so is, as the Minister pointed out, a very sound answer to the argument that district justices and the Bench generally should be entitled to sentence a youthful offender directly to committal to the Shanganagh &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre.  The Minister has been wise in adopting the attitude that the court will not be allowed to commit a person directly to Shanganagh because a certain amount of screening, which cannot be done in court, must be done before a person, on this selective basis, is regarded as a suitable person for accommodation at Shanganagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Shanganagh &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre the whole atmosphere, as I understand it, is one of trust.  The system operating there at the moment is based on an atmosphere of trust; the ordinary prison supervision does not exist in the same close sense as it exists in other prisons.  I understand that neither the inmates nor the staff are required to wear a uniform and that there are <Col N="488" /> adequate facilities for games and recreation.  This house was originally Coláiste Móbhí and there are extensive grounds there.  I feel that the situation of the place and the atmosphere that pervades it, and which was deliberately intended to pervade it, encourage the idea of rehabilitation of the offender rather than emphasise unduly the question of punishment.  The whole set-up is designed, as the Minister has made clear, to foster a sense of responsibility and self-control on the part of the offender.</P>
    <P>This can be regarded as an experiment but provided the experiment continues to be a success I should like to see the Minister making up his mind firmly to go in for an extension of that system.  The number that can be catered for in Shanganagh is something between 50 and 60.  It might be worthwhile considering other ventures of the same sort both on the basis of having smaller hostels or institutions based roughly on the Sanganagh system and possibly even larger ones.  The money which would be required for this sort of development I personally think would be money well worth-spending. There are few things more important for any generation than to cater in a proper way for the education and rehabilitation of juvenile offenders. There is a responsibility on each generation in its own time to consider this question and see what can be done about it.  There is nothing more tragic than to see a young person going wrong and being allowed to go wrong because he is mishandled in the home or, when he gets into trouble, mishandled in a clumsy way by officialdom and authority.  I must say also that I am in favour of the kind of humane approach, the corrective rehabilitative approach, which is part and parcel of the Shanganagh make-up.</P>
    <P>The second object&mdash;and I regard this also as a principle&mdash;of the Bill is the proposal to reduce the upper age limit for offenders committed by the court to St. Patrick's Institution from 21 to 19.  I again support this principle.  I think that the arguments which the Minister set out in his statement to the House are valid.  Between the 16 and 21 age groups there is a very great difference <Col N="489" /> and a very great variation, particularly when viewed from the point of a person who might still in some sense be regarded as of reasonably tender years who gets into trouble for the first time, and who if he is dealt with properly is unlikely to get into trouble again for the rest of his life.  At that period in his life a difference of four or five years is enormous.  If such a person is lumped in with persons who might be not merely older but might be in early manhood and might already have established themselves as habitual offenders instead of getting into trouble once only, he may under bad influence become a habitual offender.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister would claim, and I certainly do not claim, that the mere reduction from 21 to 19 will necessarily entirely eliminate that risk, but I think that it is a step which eliminates it to some extent.  It does, however, create a headache, and I do not think that at the moment the Minister has an answer to it.  It necessarily implies that in future once this Bill is enacted persons in the 19 to 21 age group instead of being committed to St. Patrick's Institution must be sentenced to prison.  This is one of the weaknesses I see in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They can be sent back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that they can be sent back, and I will have something to say about sending them to and fro when I come to deal with particular sections of the Bill.  I know that the Minister is quite right there but, I if may just deal with it in a quick way, the problem at present or for some time past which has been facing the authorities in relation to St. Patrick's Institution has been one of overcrowding, and it does not seem to me to be very likely in the immediate future that if fortuitously&mdash;because I accept fully what the Minister says on this provision, that it is not designed as a measure to relieve overcrowding&mdash;as a result of this provision overcrowding is relieved, the Minister would then invite overcrowding by transferring too many back from prison to St. Patrick's when they are sentenced by the court to go to prison.  So that the difficulty I see <Col N="490" /> here is that notwithstanding the authority which would be vested in the Minister to transfer back, so far as the court is concerned once this Bill becomes law the court will then have no option at all so far as the 19 to 21 age group is concerned.  They will have to be sent to prison.  They cannot be sent to St. Patrick's Institution.  To my mind the only real solution for this&mdash;and possibly it is financial shortage which prevents its being put into operation&mdash;is to have a separate establishment to cater for the 19 to 21 age group.  If that were done I certainly would then feel fairly happy about this provision in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned, there is a section being set up in Mountjoy to keep the 19 to 21 age group separate from the other adult prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, and I think that it is right that that should be done, but I am sure that the Minister both as a lawyer and in connection with the study of this particular problem as Minister will be aware of the fairly widespread view that the correct way to deal with juveniles and with juvenile institutions of detention is to have them segregated completely from the ordinary prisons.  While as, if you like, an emergency measure it may be desirable to use Mountjoy and to set aside a separate section to cater for the 19-21 age group I do not think it is the ideal solution.  The only effective way would be an entirely new institution, or an entirely separate institution in any event, for that age group.  However, I agree in principle with the idea of removing the older inmates from St. Patrick's, but I am somewhat worried about doing it in a situation where the only alternative so far as they are concerned is a sentence by the court to imprisonment notwithstanding what the Minister says with regard to having a separate section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third problem to which the Minister referred is that of overcrowding at St. Patrick's and the power to be given to him under section 7 of this Bill to order the transfer of inmates in cases of overcrowding from St. Patrick's to prison.  I can appreciate the pragmatism behind this move as I can appreciate that it may be a matter <Col N="491" /> of actual physical necessity from time to time that the Minister should have this authority.  However, I do not like the way in which this authority is being given in the Bill and if the Minister does not see fit to put down amendments setting out certain guidelines in relation to transfers that he may make, I shall put down such amendments.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Minister can transfer prisoners only after consultation with the visiting committee but in his statement to us today, the Minister has made it clear that the consultations which he is to have with the visiting committee will be limited to consultations on the question of whether overcrowding as a problem exists and as to the probable duration of that overcrowding problem.  Other factors are necessary in this regard.  There should be some age qualification for a transfer. As section 7 stands, it would not matter whether the inmate at St. Patrick's is aged 16 or aged 90.  As I read the Bill the Minister can make an order transferring a person of 16 years to prison.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister may meet me on this by saying that of course he will not do any such thing, that he would not be daft enough to do that but while I fully accept that to be the Minister's intention and attitude, I do not consider it good enough for the Houses of the Oireachtas to legislate in such a way as to leave the door open to future Ministers to act against the spirit of what is intended in the legislation that is going through.</P>
    <P>There is no age limit, upper or lower, as far as section 7 is concerned nor is there any requirement under this section for the Minister to consult with the visiting committee with regard to records of character and general bearing in St. Patrick's of the persons he proposes to transfer.  As a minimum, there should be a requirement under section 7 not merely that the Minister would consult the visiting committee as to whether a problem of overcrowding exists but that in the event of there being such a problem and in the event of the Minister making an order <Col N="492" /> for the transfer of inmates to prison from St. Patrick's he would also be required to consult with the visiting committee as to who should be transferred.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister will probably say that of course he will find out who should be transferred in the event of any transfers having to be made and that he would leave in St. Patrick's those most likely to benefit as a result of being there as against being put in a separate section in prison.  I would accept such a reply but I do not think it goes far enough.  Without wishing the Minister any ill-luck he may be in office for only a very short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, whether the Minister's stay in office be long or short this Bill is intended to outstay the Minister's period in office.  It is intended to bind not only the present Minister but anyone who comes after him.  There should be a tightening up with regard to section 7 even if that tightening up is only to the extent of requiring consultation between the Minister and the visiting committee not merely on the question of overcrowding but with regard to the actual inmates to be transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as section 2 of the Bill is concerned&mdash;I do not intend making a Committee discussion of this&mdash;I would like to indicate to the Minister certain amendments which, if he sees fit, he might put down for Committee Stage. This is a section which in so far as the principle of it is concerned would have wholehearted support from Senators <Col N="493" /> but the vehicle for bringing that principle into operation is faulty.  This section reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, for the purpose of promoting the rehabilitation of offenders, provide places other than prisons for the detention of persons who have been sentenced to penal servitude or imprisonment or to detention in Saint Patrick's Institution.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands there is authority under this section for the Minister to provide alternative places of detention. From what the Minister has told us what is intended by that section is to operate the &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre at Shanganagh and possibly other ventures on similar lines.  I fully accept that.  However, if the Minister were to have any bad thoughts about returning to the Criminal Justice Bill he would be enabled to transfer people to military custody.  I do not think there is any doubt about that.  There is no limitation in that Bill as to the places to which the Minister can make an order transferring persons to military custody.</P>

      <P>Possibly but I do not know if the Chair will consider it appropriate that this occasion should be availed of for discussion on aspects and circumstances of Irish history. However, I do know that it was proposed in the Criminal Justice Bill introduced to the last Dáil to take these powers of transferring civil prisoners to military custody.  I know the Minister <Col N="494" /> does not intend to do it.  The only thing I say is that under section 2 of the Bill, as worded, it is open to the Minister as I see it to do that.  I would just ask the Minister to make it quite clear on Committee Stage by inserting some provision excluding military custody, that this will not entitle either him or any Minister who comes after him to transfer young persons from St. Patrick's or civilian prisoners from prison into military custody.  That is a reasonable request.  The Minister, I am sure, will see it as a reasonable request and I will expect to see an amendment on those lines from him on Committee Stage.  If not, we can consider it further by an amendment which I will put down.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides that the Minister may by regulations specify by reference to age and sex the class of persons who may be detained in a place provided under section 2 of this Bill.  The purpose of this section is to enable the Minister to make regulations covering the class of persons who may be transferred from St. Patrick's or from prison to another place such as the Shanganagh &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre. I have not any objection at all to that so far as it goes but I do not think it goes far enough.  It seems to me under the wording of section 3, subsection (1) (a) the Minister will not be entitled to take into consideration anything other than the age and sex of the inmates.  There should be some more general guideline laid down.  It should be made clear in the Bill that the Minister would have regard to the general suitability of the person to be transferred.</P>
      <P>After all, the whole framework of the Shanganagh centre, as I mentioned earlier, is based on selectivity, on selecting people who basically and generally are suitable for accommodation of that type.  That is the intention quite clearly and it should be spelled out in the Bill.  Apart from those observations many of which, I suppose, are mainly Committee points, I would extend a welcome to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it would be open to us to discuss the general question of the prison service and of improvements and so on that we would like to have <Col N="495" /> made in it.  I do not propose doing that because I think the three net objects which the Minister has defined exist in this Bill.  There are two principles in the Bill and as far as they go they are worthy of support.  I might say, however, that I think it is regrettable, although I know it is not the Minister's Department, that the reports on the prison service seem to run about two years behind.  I believe I am correct in saying that it was only today that the report on prisons for 1968 was issued.  I have not seen it yet.  I have simply seen a news item dealing with it in one of the daily newspapers.  It certainly would be of very considerable assistance to Senators in considering this legislation&mdash;of course, it is only a coincidence that it happens to be considered by us on the same day as the issue of this report&mdash; if we had an opportunity of reading he report first because from the newspaper report I have seen it apparently deals to some extent with St. Patrick's and with Shanganagh.  I know this is not something the Minister can control other than that it seems to be odd that it is only in the middle month of 1970 we have available the report for 1968.  I wonder would it be possible to make an arrangement, although I know statistics have to be compiled and one thing and another, which take time, that the report be issued somewhat earlier than that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that but people normally have the benefit on occasions such as this of getting an indication. However, I shall be as quick as I can. First of all, I certainly should like to welcome this Bill very much indeed.  I welcome particularly the phrase about <Col N="496" /> the provision of places for the purpose of promoting the rehabilitation of offenders.  I welcome this emphasis on rehabilitation because I realise that it certainly is a very difficult matter to bring about the rehabilitation of delinquents, young or old, for a number of reasons.  Delinquency does not occur solely by the exercise of pure choice on the part of the delinquents or by the chance of misfortune, so to speak.</P>
      <P>We all recognise now that delinquency represents in many ways a habitual anti-social disposition which can be developed by the bitter experience of a hard childhood or a conflict in the home.  Those are causes of delinquency which are very difficult to deal with.</P>
      <P>In thinking about the problem which would face this new type of institution at Shanganagh I was interested in an article in <i>Administration</i> of the summer of 1968 on the social and psychological characteristics of institutionalised young offenders in Ireland by Ian Harte, who is a research officer in the Economic and Social Research Institute.  I was interested in this article because writings about problems of this kind in Ireland are comparatively rare.  Indeed in many ways this article is probably not the most deep piece of research that one would like to see.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, as a result of a survey of delinquents from institutions Mr. Harte reached this conclusion:</P>
      <P>The results indicate the difficulties in the way of reforming delinquent children.  The most hopeful treatment for a large number of boys who are very hostile towards their parents and homes and as so often follows, towards themselves, would seem to be psychotherapy extending over a couple of years.</P>
      <P>The article goes on to say:</P>
      <P>A probation hostel would therefore seem to be about the best place for psychotherapy with these boys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very large requirement for an attempt to assist delinquents.  One would hope that Shanganagh would provide an opportunity for treatment of this kind and I would be interested to hear if the Minister has any ideas <Col N="497" /> at this stage as to how the specialised staff for this new type of institution will be developed over the years.</P>
    <P>The staffing of these institutions will be a major factor in their success.  It will be important that there should be a good ratio between the staff and the juveniles in the institutions and plenty of opportunity to keep the boys there fully occupied during the day.</P>
    <P>I was interested that in opening this debate the Minister talked about future developments there and particularly about the provision of permanent workshops.  The Minister listed facilities such as instruction in metal-work and plumbing, car maintenance and repair, electrical repairs, building construction and painting, papering and glazing.  I feel this is too readily the type of activities which one provides for delinquents, young and old. If we had more information about the potential and IQ of detainees in institutions of this kind we might find that there were many young people with high educational potential.  In an institution like Shanganagh I would hope it might be possible to provide boys of this kind with more unusual types of opportunity for education and perhaps an opportunity of attending courses of a more academic or artistic nature for boys who proved to have abilities of this kind.  Very often in our society we have many discontented craftsmen and builders simply because they are men with a greater potential but who did not have an opportunity of developing their talents.  Someone of a delinquent disposition, on finding himself in a craft which is not suited to him, may suffer and his chance of rehabilitation is affected.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity of having a quick look at the Annual Report on Prisons, 1968 to which Senator O'Higgins referred.  I saw that initially some of the work at Shanganagh for the boys has consisted in clearing the scrub and undergrowth to reclaim the grounds.  The grounds are extensive, consisting of 22 acres.  I would like to suggest to the Minister the possibility of a project which might be considered by the boys at Shanganagh.  This may have come to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> The suggestion was raised initially with the Department of Local Government who have a responsibility in this regard.  I am referring to the fact that the Dún Laoghaire Itinerant Settlement Committee made representations to the Department of Local Government asking them to examine the possibility of obtaining a site for a permanent itinerant camp in the grounds of Shanganagh.  There is plenty of space there.  It is a site in a well-known itinerant area.  There is the great advantage that it is an area in which members of the public would not readily object.  The boys have been encouraged to work in clearing up the grounds.  Here is an ideal social project which might gain their interest.  They might prepare an itinerant site in the grounds of Shanganagh.  Should the Department of Justice receive any suggestions in this regard from the Department of Local Government or people interested in itinerant welfare, I hope they will look on this matter and this type of social project for young offenders with interest and encouragement.</P>
    <P>In looking at the value of these new institutions for rehabilitation we must look, as Senator O'Higgins did, at the regulations which the Minister can make under this Bill and which are likely to shape the working of these new institutions.  I would like to make two comments.  I see that the Minister may make regulations as to the classification, treatment, employment and control of persons to be detained in this type of institution.  I would strongly urge that all juveniles being considered for Shanganagh and similar institutions should have IQ assessment as part of the classifying process. Another small point&mdash;as there is an emphasis on rehabilitation&mdash;would be that Shanganagh and similar institutions might stand the best chance of success if there was some feeling among the young boys that when going to Shanganagh the punitive stage of their detention was nearing its end.  It might be an advantage if it were made quite clear that corporal punishment would not play any part in the discipline at Shanganagh.  I realise there are difficulties here.  I am not sure of the present regulations governing the institution. <Col N="499" /> I recommend this suggestion to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Annual Report on Prisons that the staff at Shanganagh so far have been selected from officers of the prison service.  I hope that every opportunity will be provided for those officers to receive any special training which may assist them in their work. Their work will be most successful if the probation service, which will follow up detention in those institutions, follows the lines which the Minister in his recent announcements obviously hopes it will.  I welcome any development of the probation service.  It is urgently required.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider whether his Department might possibly make grants to the universities for the training of probation officers.  As I understand it the term &ldquo;probation officer&rdquo; is now a technical, social-work term. In other parts of the world there are specialised forces for the training of <Col N="500" /> probation officers.  At present no courses for the training of probation officers are available in the Twenty-six Counties.  I would strongly urge on the Minister that the best way of building up the force of probation officers, through his Department, would be to provide funds to the universities to provide training courses of this kind for the type of specialist officer which this new type of approach to the treatment of juvenile delinquents will require.</P>
