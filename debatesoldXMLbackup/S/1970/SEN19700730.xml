      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister and his officials for introducing it.  I listened with interest to a number of the speeches made yesterday, especially the speech made about the opportunities available to young people in industry.  As a person who has been very much involved in industry over the past few years I welcome the section which states that facilities available in one school will be made available to schools in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been concerned with recruiting apprentices for various trades in industry and on many occasions I was alarmed at the material made available to people from which to make a choice. I feel this section will play an important role here.  I always felt it was a great pity to have to turn down people who did not have the necessary qualifications to take on an apprenticeship.  I believe this was largely due to our education system.  Senator Brosnahan <Col N="1407" /> mentioned a place where there were three different schools, which could be described as new schools, yet the facilities available in one school were not available to the pupils attending the other schools.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the position which existed four or five years ago but within the last 12 months things have improved considerably.  This is probably due to the fact that free education is now the order of the day and therefore education is available to all.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the part played by secondary schools prior to the free education scheme.  I would like to refer to some private schools which have operated here in Dublin.  I am referring in particular to one in my own area which was inaugurated by a family who have been very much associated with education over the years and who have played a very important role in all aspects of Irish life.  People such as these have played an important role in the education of the less well off children.  Now that we have free education I hope these people will benefit considerably.  I hope the Minister will look into their position to see that the facilities available in other schools might be available to these private schools also.  Anyone doing a good job in the field of education and particularly people who have devoted their lives to providing education for the less well off should be helped.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of large schools. A large size unit is now generally accepted as being a necessary prerequisite to proper education.  I would like to refer to this from the point of view of planning.  I notice that in Dublin a new school was sanctioned, building has commenced and may possibly take 12 to 18 months to complete, but there is provision for the erection of many prefabricateds to cater for the number of pupils.  From figures available at the present moment in the planning section of the Department of Education it should be possible to cater for the number of pupils who would be attending in future years.  At present schools are built and just as they are about to open prefabricated <Col N="1408" /> classrooms are provided to cater for some of the pupils.  Thought should be given to this.  I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It gives legal sanction to practices which have been going on already.  A member of the Government has spoken to me on this subject and we agreed that this Bill probably gives legal sanction to what in fact has been in progress for some years.  I welcome this Bill because of the interchange between post-primary educational facilities.  The buildings used for post-primary education can be interchanged. For instance where there is a science building in a small town and where there are a technical school and a secondary school it would cost the State too much money to build a second science laboratory, so there should be interchange of pupils between the schools in using that science building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome this Bill I am sorry we have not had an opportunity of dealing with education as a whole. The emphasis is on taking things out of context and discussing them.  In my view all branches of education are interrelated.  We should deal with primary, post-primary and university education and try to see how these could fit into the future policy on education.  The President of UCD said recently that there would have to be some restriction on places in the university.  I am sure the same applies to Trinity College.  The President mentioned restrictions in certain faculties and disciplines which have not been subject to restriction up to now. It is a pity that we could not have a full debate on education in this House. We cannot do justice in speaking about one aspect of education alone. Vocational education is part of our education, as Senator Mrs. Farrell said, which deals with the crafts.  It is highly desirable that certain children of certain parents should get education in crafts.  Some children may not be fitted for what I might term the mental side of education.  They may be more adept with their hands and the craft side of education rather than the mental side of it might be more suitable for them. <Col N="1409" /> Yearly the craft side of education is becoming more important.  I support the Senator on this aspect.  I support this Bill in general.  I am sorry in view of what the President of UCD said and in view of the other things occurring which will inevitably change our outlook that we have not had an opportunity of discussing education more broadly than we are doing today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtosach báire fáiltím roimh an mBille seo.  Táim sásta gur Bille tabhachtach é agus go gcabhróidh sé le cur ar aghaidh cúrsaí gairmoideachais sa tír seo.</P>
      <P>Even the most ardent opponents of the Government must agree that considerable progress has been made in this country during the last number of years.  If we were to give a prize to the Department that has made the greatest impact in this development and in this progress that prize would go to the Department of Education which has come forward so much in such a short time.  I am glad to have an opportunity of saying a few brief words on vocational education because I feel that this is a model system of education, a system that recognises neither class nor creed, a system where the rich and the poor, Catholic, Protestant, Presbyterian are all treated alike.  I certainly would like to see that if the other branches of education, primary and secondary, are to be improved they too would be modelled on these lines.  I hope that the day is not too far distant when primary schools, vocational schools and secondary schools are modelled alike, and that in all three branches class or creed will not be a factor and children of all denominations will be given an opportunity of growing up together.  In this part of the country this may not be of so much importance, but in the northern half both inside the Six Counties and outside it I feel that if we had a system of education similar to the vocational system on both sides of the Border we would not have had the same fears, the same suspicions as exist there at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one aspect of this that I would like to speak about and that is the hope expressed in this Bill that there would be co-operation between secondary and vocational education. <Col N="1410" /> The word &ldquo;snobbery&rdquo; has been mentioned here a few times and yesterday I heard Senator McElgunn emphatically deny that it exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FarrellMcElgunn" hpid="Mr. McElgunn Mr. McElgunn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McElgunn</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Chair, I did not deny that it existed but I questioned as to where it lay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I am sorry.  Though I certainly would not say that snobbery is encouraged by the Secondary Teachers' Association nevertheless I do say that it exists as far as some secondary teachers are concerned. I myself at one of the preliminary meetings dealing with amalgamations several years ago heard a headmaster state that his teachers would not teach in a technical school.  While this attitude, thank God, is not very common, there is evidence that it exists and that some secondary teachers consider the vocational school an inferior institution.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware, I think, of the threat to some vocational schools in the West Donegal Gaeltacht as a result of the encroachment of secondary schools, and the teachers in some of these technical schools fear that they are not getting the co-operation from the secondary school that they should get and that they deserve.  They fear that their school, particularly the comparatively new school in Gortahork, is in danger of being closed down completely, and this threat has become prominent since apparently the Department has agreed in principle to allow engineering classes in the secondary school in Falcarragh.  It is quite possible that there are no grounds for these fears but, at this stage, before the Department allows classes of this kind in a secondary school, if there is any danger of the vocational system being wiped out in a Gaeltacht area, they should have second thoughts, because the technical school particularly in a Gaeltacht area is of much greater importance than the secondary school, and there are many children who may not have the academic qualifications to pursue other subjects in a secondary school but who could become extremely good tradesmen as a result of attending a vocational school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> I would appeal to the Minister to have this matter very closely examined. If there are no dangers to Gortahork and, indeed, Derrybeg technical schools then he could let this be known to the authorities there.  If he does this I feel that will satisfy the teachers and parents in that locality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Vocational Education Bill, and I do so more warmly because it has given this House an opportunity of expressing the views held by various Senators on education.  Some people were astonished that a Bill so brief, with only two sections, one enabling and one mandatory, and a Short Title, could give rise to a debate of this length.  I think that the reason for this is that there is a genuine concern and desire by Senators to have a Bill relating to education used as a stimulus for giving their ideas on this subject.  I certainly welcome this, and it has been a most interesting debate.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on providing the possibility for vocational education committees to come out of the straitjackets in which they were under the Vocational Education Acts and to be empowered to co-operate with other schools in the ways set out in section 1 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister has reserved for himself a certain power at both ends of the spectrum.  Co-operation between committees will only be with the consent of the Minister and the enabling clause itself is vague.  This is as it should be.  It states: &ldquo;at such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the parties&rdquo;.  It is possible that the wording should be vague because it will vary according to areas, according to the type of co-operation being sought, according to whether it is hoped to use joint science laboratories or to contribute to assembly halls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed that some Senators seemed sceptical as to whether this will lead to genuine co-operation between vocational education committees and secondary school managements.  What we must do is hope for co-operation and provide the facilities for it.  Then we can generate an atmosphere in which there is genuine use of scarce resources. <Col N="1412" /> This is particularly true of the west where I come from and where this type of joint user of scarce resources would be of immense benefit to the community. I therefore welcome the open-ended nature of the clause.  Again, the Minister has control in that this relates only to schools which may be recognised by the Minister for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The reasoning behind the Bill has been analysed by the Minister and by Senators who have spoken.  It provides for the type of co-operation which we should seek at all educational levels, which is being done at university level not through a merger but through co-operation, in relation to the use of facilities and manpower to the fullest possible extent and a getting away from rigid thinking in regard to education.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hope this enabling measure will lead to co-operation between vocational education committees and secondary school managements. Then it will be up to the people around the country to see that the provisions of this Bill are availed of and that what is mainly an enabling Bill becomes a reality.  As I said, I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús buíochas a ghlacadh leis na Seanadóirí a chuir fáilte roimh an mBille. Gidh go bhfuil sí beag, tá sí iontach tábhachtach.  I dtír bheag mar seo, gan móran maoine, ba cheart dúinn gach úsáid a bhaint as an mhaoin atá againn. Is anseo a thagann comh-oibriú isteach.  Cuideoidh sé linn an toradh is fearr a fháil as na nithe atá againn, as na múinteoirí agus as na gléasanna oideachais atá ar fáil.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my thanks to the Senators for the co-operative way in which they spoke.  I think it was Senator Russell who said that perhaps the Members of the Seanad were somewhat loquacious in regard to this discussion.  As far as I am concerned, I am very anxious to get the views of all Members of the Seanad on all aspects of our educational policy.  We are living in a rapidly changing world and I think it is true to say that no aspect is changing as rapidly as education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> Therefore, it is essential that in my efforts to formulate policy I should have the views of all Members of the House and I am grateful for the manner in which Senators spoke, for the encouraging way in which they spoke, on this Bill.  The policy of seeking co-operation between the various type schools is aimed at providing the advantage of comprehensive education in each post-primary centre by making the most efficient use of the facilities available to us, in teachers, in equipment, in buildings and so on and by offering the widest possible choice of subjects at leaving certificate level.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with the situation in smaller towns and in rural areas.  I shall give an example.  We find that in many of our smaller towns very often we have three post-primary schools, a convent, a brothers' school and a vocational school.  One I have in mind has about 140 pupils in each of the three schools.  Working independently, it is very difficult for a small school such as one of those to provide the wide range of subjects necessary to develop the wide range of abilities of the children attending such a school; but with the proper type of co-operation between the schools we would have 420 children in a unit composed of the three schools and we could provide in such an instance a very much wider range of subjects and we could offer what I should like to offer, not only free education but equality of opportunity as well.</P>
    <P>In practice, co-operation has already worked in a number of ways.  It can work in an elementary way by the exchange of teachers and the use of a facility such as a science room or the provision of woodwork instruction for secondary schools boys in a vocational school.  In a more advanced way co-operation would mean the sharing of a common block of specialised facilities, the sharing of assembly halls and gymnasia.</P>
    <P>This may be what Senator Belton was referring to when he said he had been informed that what was contained in the Bill was already in operation.  In fact, this has been on the current expenditure side&mdash;it was possible to operate on the current expenditure <Col N="1414" /> side but not on the capital side, which is what we are legislating for here.  This proposed amendment will give the committees legal authority to co-operate with other post-primary school authorities and to incur expenditure in so doing.  Up to the present, it has been possible to enable expenditure to be incurred by vocational education committees out of current moneys to be utilised in the furtherance of their schemes, but they cannot as the law stands enter into commitments involving capital expenditure.  This Bill will enable them to do so.  They will be in a position not only to co-operate in relation to the provision of teaching services but in regard to the purchase of building land, of sites for playing fields, <i>et cetera</i>.  For instance, if a vocational committee could contribute portion of the cost of acquiring a site they could become joint owners of the site and it would be a matter for local negotiation to apportion the cost.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the flexibility in the Bill.  I deliberately left it flexible because if we were to have a rigid system we would find that in many local areas it would not be possible to get agreement.  I am therefore leaving it to the various areas to come to their own decisions as to how they can best co-operate and I will then consider whatever proposals they put to me.  In regard to the management the position in relation to a few schools where agreement has already been reached is that the management would consist of representatives of vocational education committees and of the other school authorities with the local bishop as chairman.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised was the question of the allocation of teaching staff in the vocational schools for 1970-71. There is a considerable amount of misunderstanding in relation to this.  The staffing allocation now proposed by us for vocational schools is, to say the least, generous.  We are proposing a pupil-teacher ratio which it is not hoped to reach in Scotland until 1975-76 and I think everyone will agree that Scotland is regarded as being far advanced educationally.  Our allocation takes account not only of whole-time day classes but also of part-time <Col N="1415" /> and evening classes including, of course, the courses in adult education. When we were sending out the circular we indicated that we were prepared to consider on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis the case of any school in which particular difficulties or particular problems arose. All I would ask of all concerned is that they should examine carefully our proposals before pronouncing on them.</P>
    <P>I was asked also about the local authority contribution.  As Senators are aware the present legal position is the one that has been in operation for a number of years whereby the maximum contribution from a local authority towards vocational education is 24d in the £.  This contribution has for a long time been taken up by all committees with the exception of one which operates a comparatively small scheme. The vastly increased expenditure to date has been met by way of supplementary grants from my Department. Those Senators who are members of vocational education committees will be aware of this.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery mentioned as did also Senator Bourke my control in relation to local co-operation.  The position is that the educational and financial schemes of the vocational education committees are subject to the approval of the Minister under the Acts.  Major developments in the field of co-operation would also require the approval of the Minister but there is no intention of entering into unnecessarily detailed examination of all co-operative arrangements.  I have dealt, then, in a general way with most of the queries posed by Senators.</P>

    <Title>Tourist Traffic Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purposes of the Bill are, firstly, to raise the statutory limit on the aggregate amount which may be paid to Bord Fáilte for the giving of grants for the development of holiday accommodation, secondly, to raise the statutory limit on the aggregate amount of loans which may be guaranteed for the development of tourist projects and to extend the time limit on the giving of such guarantees, thirdly, to provide for the registration of approved holiday cottages and, fourthly, to increase the number of members who may be appointed to the Board of Bord Fáilte Éireann.</P>
      <P>Grants for the development of holiday accommodation were first introduced in 1959 and provision was made in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, for the payment to Bord Fáilte of sums not exceeding an aggregate of £500,000 for the purpose.  As the tourist industry developed and accommodation needs expanded this limit was successively raised to £1.5 million by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1963, to £3 million by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966 and to £5.5 million by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1968.  The total amount issued to Bord Fáilte for accommodation development grants up to 31st March, 1970 was £4,930,000, which leaves a balance of £570,000 before the statutory limit of £5.5 million is reached.  The amount which the Government have agreed to provide in the present financial year is £1.5 million and amending legislation is therefore necessary to authorise payments in excess of £570,000 this year and to provide for payments in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the funds provided for the development of holiday accommodation, Bord Fáilte operate a scheme of grants with the approval of the Ministers for Transport and Power and <Col N="1421" /> Finance.  The scheme provides for the payment of up to 35 per cent of the total construction cost of new hotels in the western counties and up to 25 per cent in other areas.  Where the total construction grants do not apply, grants up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the cost of new hotel bedrooms are provided in the west and 40 per cent elsewhere. Grants up to 30 per cent are provided for dining areas, kitchens, <i>et cetera</i> in hotels in the west and 20 per cent in other areas, subject to the exclusion of certain locations such as Dublin and Cork.  Twenty per cent grants are provided throughout the State for hotel staff accommodation and for the provision of recreational facilities for hotel guests.</P>
    <P>Guesthouses in all areas are eligible for grants up to 20 per cent of the cost of new bedrooms subject to the condition that at least five guest bedrooms are available on completion of the project.  Caravan and camping sites are eligible for grants up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the cost of the site development and amenity works subject to a maximum grant of £20,000 for each project.  There are grants also for the provision and improvements of youth hostels and for improvement works in colleges and similar institutions providing accommodation for visitors during vacation periods.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the percentages which I have mentioned represent the maximum grants which Bord Fáilte are authorised to pay.  Each development is, however, examined by Bord Fáilte on its merits and it is the responsibility of the board to determine the actual level of grant appropriate to each case having regard to various factors, including the location of the development, type of accommodation being provided, the cost of development, the price level, the market demand, the volume of existing accommodation in the area and other relevant tourism criteria.  Thus the grants are operated on a flexible basis so as to provide maximum encouragement to projects which best meet tourism needs. Hotel and guesthouse owners and other promoters of accommodation have responded to the incentives provided and the £5 million expended by Bord <Col N="1422" /> Fáilte in grants since the schemes were introduced must be related to a total investment of £36 million in accommodation development.  Thus the grant element in the total development programme has been 14 per cent.  The number of bedrooms in hotels and guesthouses has increased from 17,800 in 1960 to 27,890 in the present year, an increase of more than 56 per cent. There has also of course been a significant improvement in the standard of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Policy in relation to accommodation development is designed to achieve a flow of accommodation to match the growth in demand and the standards tourists seek.  It is clear that this balance is difficult to achieve and grant schemes were introduced so that accommodation growth targets could be realised.  The effectiveness of the incentives is assessed on a continuous basis and the schemes are revised in the light of experience.  For a number of years, although grants had been provided, it had not been possible to secure adequate accommodation growth.  So in April, 1967, the accommodation incentives were improved, but in deciding on the level of funds to be provided for this purpose the Government have to have regard to the overall demands on the Exchequer.  The improved incentives coupled with an easing in the availability of credit for holiday accommodation development resulted in an atmosphere conducive to investment in the hotel industry.  By late last year it became clear that the rate of growth in accommodation was beginning to outstrip targets and the level of funds which the Government could make available for this purpose. Bord Fáilte, accordingly, found it necessary to introduce a moratorium, the effect of which is that the board are not entering into any new grant commitments for the time being.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of financial assistance for accommodation development in 1959, income from tourism and travel has risen from £39 million to almost £98 million.  Apart from its important role in the balance of payments, tourism has proved to be an effective stimulus to the economy through the additional spending power it injects, through the enlarged market <Col N="1423" /> it provides for Irish foods and other goods and through the employment it generates.  Tourism has been particularly valuable as a means of improving the economy of western areas where prospects of industrial development are limited.  I am confident that tourism will continue as a strong force for economic development.</P>
    <P>The growth of tourism over the past decade could not have been achieved without a considerable expansion of the volume of accommodation and the improvement of standards.  For various reasons, including high construction costs and the problem of seasonality, investment in hotels and other forms of holiday accommodation, particularly outside the main urban areas, is not as attractive commercially as other types of investment and financial incentives have been necessary to ensure that the expansion of tourism is not retarded by a shortage of the right kinds of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Financial assistance will continue to be necessary to ensure that accommodation expansion keeps pace with the needs of tourism and particularly to encourage development in the less populated areas now being reached by the growing volume of motoring visitors.  In December last Dáil Éireann voted an additional £500,000 by way of supplementary estimate to enable Bord Fáilte to meet grant commitments that had matured more quickly than expected.  This brought last year's provision for accommodation grants to a record £1.5 million and this year I am providing a further £1.5 million. To provide the necessary statutory authority for this year's payments and to provide for the continuation of the grant schemes I propose that the present limit of £5.5 million on accommodation grants be replaced by a new limit of £11 million.  The provision in the Bill is of an enabling nature and the amounts to be provided for accommodation development in each year will fall to be debated and voted by the Dáil in the normal way under the Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>The financing of tourist development projects usually includes an element of borrowing.  The State does not provide <Col N="1424" /> any direct loan facilities but, to assist developers in raising loans, Ministerial guarantees can be given in respect of repayment and interest on loans raised from banks, insurance companies or other lending institutions to finance the cost of holiday accommodation or other amenities or services for tourists. The Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, provided that the aggregate amount of loans which might be guaranteed in respect of such borrowings was £3 million.  The Tourist Traffic Act, 1961, raised the limit to £5 million.  Guarantees have been given to date in respect of some 70 loans accounting for an aggregate of approximately £2.6 million and approval in principle has been given for guarantees of further loans which will bring the aggregate above the £5 million level.  Amending legislation is therefore necessary to increase the limit.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the 1952 Act provided for the giving of guarantees during a period of five years, i.e. up to 1957. This limit has been successively extended&mdash;by five years at a time&mdash;by the Tourist Traffic Acts of 1957, 1961 and 1966 and the present limit will expire in 1972.</P>
    <P>The guaranteed loan scheme has proved to be a valuable instrument for promoters of tourist development projects and it is considered essential to retain it.  I am accordingly proposing that the limit of £5 million imposed in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1961 be raised to £8 million and that the time limit imposed by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966 be extended by five years to 1977.</P>
    <P>The third element in the Bill arises from the development of a new type of holiday accommodation, that is, the holiday cottage, of which the Shannon Free Airport Development Company have been the pioneers.  This company in association with local interests in the Shannon region have promoted a &ldquo;rent-a-cottage&rdquo; scheme under which 12 cottages were provided at Ballyvaughan, County Clare, last year and a further eight will be available at Corofin this year.  Cottages are also being provided at other locations in the region.  In 1969 there was a heavy demand for the cottages and bookings for 1970 show that there is a strong <Col N="1425" /> demand for this type of accomodation.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in section 64 (2) of the Finance Act, 1969, to enable the initial and annual tax allowances applicable to capital expenditure on hotels and holiday camps to be claimed in respect of holiday cottages.  It is a condition of this provision that the cottages must be registered with Bord Fáilte and it is therefore necessary to authorise the Board to set up a register of approved holiday cottages similar to the existing registers of hotels, guesthouses, <i>et cetera</i>.  To secure registration, accommodation must comply with standards, which will be prescribed by Bord Fáilte in regulations made with my consent, and proprietors will have to file with the board a statement of maximum prices.  However, the use of the titles &ldquo;approved holiday cottages&rdquo;, &ldquo;approved holiday house&rdquo; and similar descriptions will be confined to registered premises.  This is in line with the present registration schemes for hotels, guest-houses, caravan parks, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>The rent-a-cottage scheme promoted in the Shannon region is designed to bring visitors to villages and rural areas which have so far been unable to share fully in the benefits of tourism because of the lack of suitable tourist accommodation.  It is an imaginative scheme which has proved very popular with visitors and I hope that it will be followed by projects on similar lines in other parts of the country.  The development of this type of accommodation is in line with my concern that tourism should be used as an instrument of economic and social development in rural areas, particularly in the western counties.  The setting up of a register and the publication of registration standards at this juncture will guide promoters or local groups who wish to embark on development of lettable accommodation of this kind and should ensure that development takes place on the right lines.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of comment and speculation for some time about the prospects for tourism in 1970.  In view of the importance of the matter, I feel I should say something on the subject on this occasion.  As relevant statistics and returns become <Col N="1426" /> available, Bord Fáilte make assessments in relation to the season.  These assessments or estimates are revised as more up-to-date information becomes available.  The most recent figures showed June as a disappointing month with declines in all our main markets. Despite the drop in June, however, the overall situation for the first six months showed an increase of 4.8 per cent in tourist numbers for all markets except Northern Ireland, for which it is not possible to make an estimate at this stage.  Traffic from Northern Ireland is, however, likely to be down on last year for obvious reasons, and Bord Fáilte have increased their promotional activities in that area in an effort to alleviate the trend.  It is impossible at this stage to be more specific about likely tourism returns for 1970.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Government have provided funds for the development of tourism on an ever-increasing scale.  In 1960, £500,000 was provided for Bord Fáilte, whereas in the current year the board will receive more than ten times that amount, i.e. £5.55 million, an increase of £300,000 over last year.  In recent months a number of people advocated that special additional funds for marketing be made available to deal with the unusual situation which had developed.  Senators, however, no doubt also recognise the need for realistic marketing and that any substantial diversion of funds to counteract short-term adverse factors at the expense of long-term plans for the permanent building of our tourism industry might not represent the best use of tourism funds or be in the best interests of tourism.</P>
    <P>I met the board of Bord Fáilte on 8th July last, and asked them to carry out a full appraisal of their activities in the light of the problems facing the industry with a view to making any changes which appear necessary to ensure the continued expansion of our tourist income.  On 10th July, I met a deputation from the Irish Hotels Federation to discuss the planning and proper organisation of tourist development for the coming years.  At both meetings, we had a constructive exchange of views, as a result of which, <Col N="1427" /> the board and the federation undertook to submit to me, as soon as possible, reports in relation to the development of tourism, not only for next year but for the next five years.  I shall be reviewing the outlook for tourism in the coming years in the light of these reports.</P>
    <P>In the course of my discussions, both organisations were agreed that it would be unrealistic, at this period of the year, to embark on a special marketing campaign for the 1970 season. Bord Fáilte, however, are now making a special effort to encourage Irish people to holiday in their own country this year.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the Irish tourist industry has gradually become more difficult as our tourist interests have to compete for business on an international basis, and the competition has become keener.  In an exceptional year, such as the present one, with an unprecedented combination of adverse factors, the industry is working under exceptionally difficult conditions.  It is, accordingly, essential that tourist interests gear themselves not only to recover any ground that may be lost, but to secure an increase in tourism income in the years ahead.  Having considered the matter.  I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to increase the membership of the board of Bord Fáilte in order to enrich the expertise and experience available at board level.  The existing board has done a magnificent job, but I am convinced that it would benefit from an expanded membership in preparation for the challenges of the future.  I, accordingly, propose to increase the maximum membership of the board from seven to nine.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that our policy on tourism has been to encourage the development of the facilities and services at home and to prepare marketing strategies abroad which will ensure a continuing and increasing tourist traffic to Ireland.  Tourism is sensitive to many events over which neither the Government nor the industry can exercise very much control.  Each year brings its own crop of problems and I believe that the continued pursuit of <Col N="1428" /> steady development represents the best use of our resources and is in the best long-term interests of tourism.  This Bill is designed to assist in maintaining the tourist industry in the important position it now occupies in our economy, and I, therefore, confidently recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on the Bill and particularly on the Minister's statement.  As the Minister said, the purpose of this Bill, which is a comparatively short Bill, is basically to provide extra money for the giving of grants for the development of holiday accommodation; secondly to raise the statutory limit on the aggregate amount of loans which may be guaranteed for the development of tourist projects; thirdly to provide for the registration of approved holiday cottages and, finally, to increase the number of members who may be appointed to the board of Bord Fáilte Éireann.</P>
      <P>I do not think any Member of this House would refuse to give the Minister the extra sums he requires to secure the continued expansion of the tourist industry but the House is entitled to be critical of the current position of the tourist industry and to avail of the opportunity for a fairly wide-ranging discussion on the current situation and to offer, I hope, some constructive suggestions for the future of what is a very important industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism is basically an export business and, for this reason, does require very active and continuing support from the Exchequer and from the various bodies charged with promoting tourism to this country.  It deals specifically with the consumer.  Its revenues depend on the personal desires and anticipations of individuals and groups, and if the reality is disappointing our visitors will not come again.  It is the end product of a number of other industries, whose fortunes and fluctuations can affect it profoundly, and questions such as the prices in the local shops, the cost of entertainment in local centres, the cost of transport, all leave an impact on the tourist for good or for ill.  The personal attitudes of the people they come in contact with&mdash; friendliness, courtesy, co-operation&mdash;<Col N="1429" /> have possibly a more important influence on the tourist than our wonderful scenery and our magnificent new roads.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out in his introductory statement, tourism has developed very substantially particularly in the past decade, but I think, it might be helpful if we were to throw our minds back just a little beyond the '60s in order to appreciate the basic reasons for the development of tourism since the war, and also to have a good hard look at the current situation and to see first of all if we are adopting the right methods of promoting tourism in future years.</P>
    <P>During the war years, as certainly some of us in this House well remember, tourism was a pushover.  People, mostly English, came to Ireland and enjoyed the abundance of food and drink which was available at very reasonable cost, and enjoyed the absence from the strain and continuous anxiety in which families in Great Britain lived.  Somebody at that time made the witty remark in describing the British tourists coming over here as &ldquo;marching through darkest Éire with a knife and fork&rdquo;.  This favourable situation changed following the end of the war, but fortunately a new set of circumstances arose to assist the Irish tourist industry&mdash;a huge increase in the numbers of people, particularly British and American, who wanted and could afford to travel.  An additional factor in the case of Ireland was the number of Americans of Irish descent who wanted to visit the home of their ancestors and to fly there on an Irish airline.</P>
    <P>Those new tourists presented several serious problems, particularly in regard to accommodation, and frantic efforts were made to extend existing hotels and build new ones.  Unfortunately many of the new hotels, while offering efficient and up-to-date service, presented a functional image almost wholly out of character with the traditions of this country.  This tendency to be &ldquo;with it&rdquo; has not been confined to the hotel industry and there appears to be a fairly widespread view that the way to encourage the tourist <Col N="1430" /> to come to Ireland is to give him what he is seeing and getting in New York, Boston, London or Birmingham.  This in my view is a grave mistake which must be corrected if our tourist trade is not to suffer a considerable loss.  An all-out effort by Bord Fáilte and the regional tourist boards must be launched to convince all concerned with the tourist industry&mdash;the hotels, the transport companies, shopkeepers, local authorities, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;that the vast majority of tourists who come to Ireland do so because they want to see things Irish and not a pale reflection of what they live amongst for 50 weeks of the year.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding conflicting statements made by the Department and by organs of the tourist industry, the fact remains that this has been a disappointing season.  Several reasons have been advanced for the falling off in visitors this year&mdash;the crisis in the north, high prices, the increase in the amount of money which British citizens can now take abroad and a showing down in the British and United States economies.  All have contributed but the outstanding factor, in my view, appears to be the high cost of goods and services.  In other words, we are pricing ourselves out of the tourist market.</P>
    <P>Up to two years ago this country enjoyed the reputation of being one in which visitors could get value for their money in hotels, shops, gift houses and elsewhere.  The substantial increases that have taken place in the prices of food, drink and entertainment are basically the result of Government policy and it would be a mistake to allow a campaign to start, a witch hunt, blaming hoteliers and shopkeepers for the substantial increases in prices of goods and services.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that if we are to recover our reputation for giving good value for good money, the Government must take the initial step.  I should like to join with the Minister in paying a tribute to the work of Bord Fáilte during the past decade and we should in fairness add words of praise to Aer Lingus for the promotional job they have been doing.  I should like <Col N="1431" /> personally to include the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in this.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the changing pattern of the tourist industry calls for new ideas and new impetus and new personnel in the body charged with the task of promoting tourism in this country.  In this respect the Minister is apparently of the opinion that by increasing the membership of Bord Fáilte Éireann from seven to nine he will give the board the new image and the new impetus which that body require. With the greatest respect to the Minister, I think this is a gimmick that will not pay off.  I suggest to him that the time has arrived when the board, or the membership of the board, should be completely reconstituted and a new board with new personnel, possibly including some of the existing personnel but with better and wider representation, should be established.</P>
    <P>I should like to put the point to the Minister&mdash;it has been put before in regard to other boards&mdash;that when selecting personnel for a reconstituted Bord Fáilte, ability to do the job and competence for the work should take priority over political consideration.</P>

      <P>A point not mentioned in the Minister's speech but one which I think is very appropriate to the circumstances is that we should have much closer co-operation with the north in the promotion of the tourist industry. They have, as we have, a deep interest in tourism; their economy, as ours, benefits very substantially from it. Therefore, there must be common ground on which we could usefully co-operate. It may be too much to hope that a joint tourist board for the entire country could be established but it should be possible to establish a joint tourist council that would work together and advise the separate boards which look after tourism in the north and in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make some suggestions to the Minister in regard to what <Col N="1432" /> I consider to be a very important factor in the encouragement of tourism. As I said earlier, to some extent we have lost the image which makes tourists want to come to Ireland.  I think there have been too many gimmicks, too much pig in the parlour type promotion, and I think the time has come to reassess the inducements which will bring tourists to this country.</P>
    <P>For instance, quite a simple innovation would do much to help tourists to feel more at home here and it would give them the opportunity of mixing more closely in Irish life.  I refer to the provision of food in public houses throughout the country.  I understand at the moment that something prevents publicans from selling food&mdash;I speak of the country rather than Dublin.  If it requires legislation to provide licences to permit publicans to supply a simple menu in their establishments, every effort should be made to have this legislation introduced.  &ldquo;Pub grub&rdquo; is a common phrase in England.  In this country, with so many families coming over here from England on the ferry services, cheap meals supplied in local pubs would be a very welcome innovation.</P>
    <P>Evening entertainment is a matter on which I think we have fallen down very much.  The type of entertainment being provided is either wholly unIrish or it is of the type which falls very flat and once seen tourists do not want to see it again.  Overall, an effort should be made to provide entertainment especially evening entertainment, based on the traditions of the Irish people, their ability in drama, music and the arts.</P>
    <P>All over the country, as the Minister is aware, there are excellent drama festivals held.  These festivals should be integrated into the general tourist picture so that tourists coming to Ireland for a few weeks would feel that during their stay they would be inclucated into Irish life, becoming, as it were, to use a colloquialism, one of our own.  The cost would be comparatively small&mdash;it would not run into the millions of pounds we have provided for hotel accommodation.  It would establish a bond of friendship between our own people at home and tourists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> I think we all agree that the most lasting impression all of us retain after a trip abroad is the reception, or otherwise, we get from the natives of the country we visit.  We have a lot to offer in regard to entertainment based on our traditional way of life and it is a pity we do not make more of it.  The cost would be extremely modest, the effects would be immense and it would go a long way to cementing a lasting friendship with visitors from abroad, much more so than all the extravaganzas of new hotels and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have regard to the overlapping that undoubtedly exists among Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations.  The latter, from my personal knowledge of Shannonside and the mid-western tourist organisation, are doing an excellent job of promotion of the rent-a-cottage scheme.  This scheme is an excellent one and has been largely due to the enthusiasm shown by the Shannonside tourist organisation.  The Minister referred to the Shannon area but I presume this is specifically what he had in mind and that it was intended as a compliment to the organisation based in Limerick.</P>

      <P>This is a critical year for the Irish tourist industry.  I do not intend to be unfair to the Minister but neither do I think that we should swallow all of what was said on the record of achievement put before us in his speech.  It reads fine.  A lot of money is being put into the tourist industry; many millions of pounds have been put in during the past decade and the results have been considerable.  However, circumstances are now changing and if we are to expand the industry in the years ahead we must adopt new techniques and new ideas.  With all due respect to Bord Fáilte and their personnel, I do not consider the present board to be fit to undertake the challenge of the future.  The Minister is merely skimming the problem by increasing the personnel from seven to nine members.  From reading between the lines, my view is that the Minister <Col N="1434" /> is dissatisfied with the board but if I am incorrect in saying that perhaps he will correct me when he is replying. He has given the board generous praise for the work they have done in the past year and he now thinks that by adding two more members the board will suddenly become more active and more dynamic.  I do not share his view.</P>
      <P>If he wishes to bring a new impetus to the work of Bord Fáilte it is time to scrap the existing board completely and to reconstitute it on a wider and more representative basis.  It is a little late to be discussing a tourist Bill during the last days of July.  This is the sort of Bill that we should have been considering in April or May last.  I am sorry to say that I considered the Minister to be critical of Bord Fáilte and rightly so, especially when we have regard to their work during the past year.  However, the Minister himself cannot escape a good measure of criticism for allowing this situation to drag on.  It was obvious at an early date this year that the tourist industry was in for a rough season and the Minister should have taken positive steps to put things on a proper keel.</P>
      <P>Voting moneys at this time of the year, most of which I understand are required to pay grants to hoteliers who have incurred substantial expenses and to builders who are awaiting payment, is obviously very necessary but it shows a lack of foresight in planning not only on the part of Bord Fáilte but also on the part of the Minister and his Department. There is no point in criticising Bord Fáilte, the regional tourist groups or anybody else if the man directly responsible for the promotion and encouragement of tourism is not alive to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seldom criticise a Minister or his Department but in dealing with this industry which has such vast potential and which is of such great importance to the Irish economy, the Minister must accept a large measure of the responsibility for the failure of tourism in this country and for the very uncertain future of the industry.  This uncertainty is apparent at this juncture despite pious hopes expressed by the Minister at the conclusion of his address.  I have grave doubts as to whether these targets <Col N="1435" /> will be realised unless there is a thorough investigation into the whole position.  We should give full credit to Bord Fáilte, to Aer Lingus and to other bodies who have done so much during the past decade or two in this work but we cannot sleep on that.  As the Minister indicated, the future years will be ten times as competitive as the past. There will be a rat race from now on. So, we must provide services which are at least comparable to those in other countries.  If we do not endeavour to create a wider and different market of tourism we shall be in very dire straits indeed.  I accept this Bill and, of course, I support the provision of the moneys required for the various purposes.  At the same time, we must warn the Minister that we are far from satisfied with the current situation and that we have grave doubts as to the future of the industry.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, I had occasion to compliment the Minister for Education on the simplicity of the language used in the Vocational Education Bill.  It was comprehensible to everybody.  However, on reading this Bill the first thing that occurred to me was that if I were some small hotelier living down the country and if I were to send for this Bill, I would not understand a word of it.  For instance, to illustrate the point I am making, section 6 (a) reads:</P>
      <P>by the insertion after section 24 (1) (g) (inserted by section 2 (1) (b) of the Act of 1966) of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>and so on.  Perhaps the Parliamentary draftsmen were not able to put it in some other way but I do not believe that any ordinary person would understand what is meant by the phraseology of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general purpose of the Bill is to create more funds for Bord Fáilte to cover their many activities.  The board come in for their fair share of criticism. If one talks to the big hotelier he will, perhaps, say that they are a terrible crowd; the small hotelier might say they are worse, but to be fair, when Bord Fáilte came into being they were asked to organise the country for <Col N="1436" /> tourism.  They did not have any basis to work on; it was all completely new to them at that time.  Indeed, the country as a whole did not have the remotest idea what the tourism requirements would be.  This necessitated Bord Fáilte in taking on a great many problems simultaneously.  The provision of adequate hotel accommodation was essential.  This entailed Bord Fáilte carrying out a considerable number of surveys.  I wish they would stop surveying now because far too much time is being spent carrying out survey work at the moment.  They also had to consider how to entertain visitors. They came up with a latent undeveloped asset in the field of inland fisheries and sea angling.</P>
    <P>Taking it by and large, while there may be some aspects of Bord Fáilte's activities which I do not personally agree with it must be acknowledged that in the time they have had, and having regard to the fact that in the early stages money was not readily available to finance them, they have made remarkable progress.  It is not possible in such a complicated industry as tourism to say with any degree of certainty whether some of their decisions were right or wrong.  It was clear from the beginning that we were aiming at the American market.  Bord Fáilte promoted sales in America but once the Americans came here complaints were received about substandard hotel accommodation.  This brought Bord Fáilte into the field of high class hotel accommodation.  Both Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus directed their activities at the American market, but this did not materialise and it became necessary to shift their activities and offer a more moderate type of accommodation to British and Continental people.  We have arrived at the position now, where according to the Minister's statement, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The number of bedrooms and guesthouses has increased from 17,800 in 1960 to 27,890 in the present year, an increase of more than 56 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition to this as everyone will have observed when driving along a road there are many signs saying, &ldquo;Bed and Breakfast&rdquo;.  This type of accommodation <Col N="1437" /> is not registered with Bord Fáilte.  Indeed, when passing such houses in the morning one notices that it is not just the small cars which are parked outside those houses; there are big cars and obviously the owners of them could easily afford to pay for more opulent hotel accommodation.  I understand the reason people go to those places is that there are probably only two or three guests staying in the house, there is a nice homely atmosphere, and the people who own the house make a great fuss of their guests when they arrive.  There is none of the hotel regimentation we have nowadays where a person walking into a hotel is merely a number and when he goes to pay his bill they do not even know who he is.</P>
    <P>Those small guesthouses are not registered with Bord Fáilte, even though the people who stay in them are very satisfied with them, because the owners do not want Bord Fáilte pestering them with forms to be filled in. They feel that the moment the Bord Fáilte officials walk in the door if the layout of the house does not suit Bord Fáilte's requirements everything has to be changed around.  They are also subject to continuous inspections and the owners get fed up with this.  I do not think it is at all desirable to provide inferior accommodation.  On Shannonside we circulate a list of such places to the various tourist offices, so that if a person is unable to obtain hotel accommodation he can make a choice from this list.  Bord Fáilte are against the idea of advertising such places in foreign literature but the accommodation figures as stated in the Minister's speech would be greatly increased if the guesthouses I have mentioned were included.</P>
    <P>Certainly, there is a great deal to favour the small family hotel in which the family as a whole can employ themselves in the activities of the hotel and in the off season they can usefully and gainfully carry out improvements in readiness for the following high season.  The bigger hotels in strictly tourist areas which are dependent entirely on the tourist season have to recruit whatever staff they are able to get because trained staff will not hang around from the end of September <Col N="1438" /> until the season begins again on 1st May for such a limited season.  When one goes into an expensive hotel today one is dealing with completely untrained staff.  Complaints are made about the charges and about the lack of training which the staff have, but this is not the fault of the staff; they were never trained.  The resulting service is abominable and it is giving the hotel industry here a very bad name.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell mentioned the question of entertaining tourists.  We on Shannonside publish a monthly list of all the entertainments going on in that region during the month.  We circulate this list to all the hotels and registered accommodation houses.  This is of great assistance to tourists because they know from day to day what they can do.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell has said that the cottage scheme was initiated by Shannonside. An up and coming development association at Ballyvaughan carried out a survey in that area and succeeded in collecting about 30 per cent of the capital required for the promotion of the cottage scheme.  From memory I think that Clare County Council guaranteed a loan of another 30 per cent.  That gave us 60 per cent.  I think Shannonside, through the aegis of Bord Fáilte, provided another 30 per cent, and the Shannon Development Company who did most of the administrative work provided 10 per cent.  These were the four main groups involved. The people in the area were the people who took this effort off the ground. Without the local subscriptions I do not think the scheme would ever have succeeded.  There is now a registered company and the people who participated in the financing of it are shareholders in their own right.  It is not a problem of Bord Fáilte.  They just participated.  The main ingredient was the desire by the local people to have development in the area.  They were the people who put up their own money and promoted the scheme.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of tourism which perplexes me.  Much accommodation has been unoccupied in the country this year for various reasons.  Side by side with that I know that practically every travel agency at the moment is <Col N="1439" /> engaged in a most vigorous campaign to induce people to take their holidays outside the country from September onwards.  We have accommodation available here while these efforts are being made by the carriers, the travel agencies and others to mount the biggest campaign ever to get more people to leave the country on holidays and to spend their money abroad.  One hotel in Kilkee cut its charges.  It is the Atlantic Hotel.  It offered special rates to Irish people.  That is the only effort that I know of.  I have seen figures which I would not like to quote here because I doubt their veracity.  Undoubtedly, if the Irish hoteliers and Bord Fáilte had been alive to the situation and had offered cheaper accommodation there must have been £20 million easily available to be picked up.  Most people would prefer to spend their holidays here at reasonable rates. Unfortunately, no one seems to want Irish people in the hotels during the high season.</P>
    <P>Next September we will see charter planes leaving Shannon, Dublin and Cork and flying south while we are debating the state of the tourist industry.  No blame can be attached to Bord Fáilte or anyone else.  A number of the causes for the recession in tourism this year were not predictable. By the time it became known that the situation was deteriorating it had gone beyond the point of return and nothing could be done about it.  I am satisfied that the money which it is proposed to give to Bord Fáilte will provide the necessary growth element because one cannot have growth without finance.  It would be sad to think that because we had one reverse we would order the development of tourism to stand still. Everyone prognosticates that this is a growing industry.  It is anticipated by everyone who has knowledge of the problem that with the various changes in world conditions this is a growing industry and that we would be foolish because of one year of recession to order everything to stand still until we see what happens next year.  This could prove to be a very valuable year for the tourist industry.  When Bord Fáilte are considering the expenditure of money for accommodation they should <Col N="1440" /> keep in mind the necessity for providing accommodation within the means of reasonable people and should see that there will be accommodation with some little national touch where people could go and feel welcome and appreciated and could have their needs attended to.  From such accommodation people should be sent away feeling that they would like to come back again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In debating this Bill today we are in fact discussing the second most important industry that the country has, agriculture clearly being the first.  If my understanding of the figures is correct, our income in 1959 from tourism amounted to one-quarter of the total exports of merchandise or goods.  This is very significant.  The rate of growth of tourism between 1959 and 1969 proceeded faster than the rate of growth in the economy generally in real terms. In the current issue of <i>Management</i> there is an interesting article by a Mr. Tony Kelly on this subject.  Dr. O'Driscoll is quoted as saying that there has been in the past ten years a 70 per cent increase in the volume of tourism.  That indicates the importance of the theme we are discussing today. These figures must be reconsidered in the light of the very unhappy season which tourism is experiencing this year. While it may not be absolutely true to say that every hotel will show a fall in profits, it is true to say that every hotel which made a rational calculation of what its profits would be this year will show a downfall on the predictions of its returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of quite sophisticated calculations which were made this year, which are now being revised, and which show approximately a fall of one-third of the expectations.  We have come to the point where we must recognise that what really benefited us in the previous ten years was our relatively advantageous price level.  We have now got to live with the new situation.  I think it is right to say that, as I shall be making one or two criticisms of Bord Fáilte in my remarks, in fact I would accept essentially the statement by this writer in a very well informed article indeed on tourism that only reached me yesterday morning.  He says &ldquo;In <Col N="1441" /> the main the industry is satisfied that the work of Bord Fáilte in the field with very limited resources has made fantastic headway.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is elsewhere a reference to the very high success marketing-wise in America and in England, and also tribute is given to them for their work in relation to the car ferry services, the tidy towns competition and other recent developments.  I say this preliminary to making some criticisms which I think it is necessary to make and some of which appear from the Minister's own statement in introducing this measure. There has been a miscalculation as to the amount of money which should have been provided in relation to other monetary provision by Bord Fáilte for the expansion of hotel accommodation. I think that the mistake here was to provide hotel accommodation without regard to the necessity to see that side by side with the financing of the additional accommodation was a scheme for generating business to use that accommodation. In addition a most important part of that is the inadequate funds which have been provided in the matter of training management, in particular middle management.  This is the point at which the hotel discloses its efficiency or not: mid-management personnel.  I am thinking of the chief receptionist, the head waiter, the chef, the general supervisor.  It is the quality and training that these people possess which in fact determine the service given generally by the hotel, because if they are not trained adequately and are not up to the job they have to do they cannot train adequately, organise and discipline all the other workers in the hotel, and ensure that guests get the service they must get if they are to get value for the money they pay.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that there is evidence of an excessive provision of bed accommodation in the fact that bed occupancy has dropped, as this article says, by 5 per cent from 53 per cent in 1968, if this calculation is correct, and I read it as being a well informed article.  I know&mdash;I have been given this from a very informed source&mdash;that the bed occupancy figure in the United States of America would run to something of the order of 79 or 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1442" /> This of course is a very heavy burden for the industry to carry, which leads me to this next question of the prices they charge and the suggestion that they engage in profiteering. I am bound to say that I am sure there is an exception here and there&mdash;this is an inevitable feature of the human race, and I am not saying that there is not&mdash;but I think that a general charge of profiteering against hoteliers is not well justified.  In the last 12 months or less than 12 months the prices and costs of things that hotels have had to buy to provide the services they give have gone up in the order of 10 to 25 per cent over a whole range of goods and of course the hotel must have a heavy mark-up on those costs to make a reasonable return on its capital and skill and risk taken by the provider of that capital, and the order of 50 per cent is the normal figure.  The ordinary hotel has to carry heavy stocks, and the capital tied up in that way has to be remunerated also, and this must be reflected in the prices they charge out.</P>
    <P>I caused a short examination to be made of two public companies whose accounts are available to be looked at. They were the Gresham Hotel, which shows a return of 10 per cent on the capital employed according to their own published figure for the last year, and that is counting the grant; and Ryans, which reported 8½ per cent, which is equivalent to a return of 11 per cent if you ignore the grant.  In fact the comparative out-turn after tax if you compare the two shows a much more favourable position for Ryans because of the amount of money invested in new buildings by Ryans compared with the relatively small amount invested in new buildings by the Gresham, and the result of that is that the after-tax position is in fact much better in Ryans.  But just look at these figures.  I do not regard returns of this kind on taking risks as excessive.  If you can put your money down on deposit receipt and at certain periods of this year get 10 per cent if you take risks, and if at the end of a season's activity with your capital locked up you get 11 per cent, I do not think that this is really excessive, though there may be different views on it.</P>
    <P>Whether or not we have had this <Col N="1443" /> problem caused this year, and whether or not we should have had a better reaction to it&mdash;I think in retrospect that perhaps we can say that we should have&mdash;I do not think I could go as far as my colleague did in criticising the Minister and the board on this, because it is like being invited to a party and told that nobody is going.  It does not encourage you to go to the party if you hear this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that this would explain the reluctance to admit publicly that this was the situation, but I do not think this excuses the Minister or the board from activating at private level the Hotels Federation and the people involved in the industry to see what could be done about dealing with this problem which arose in this season.  That is just a comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points I want to make which perhaps are peculiar to the House but still I think that they have not been made so far and thus perhaps I should make them now.  First I think that in this whole tourist development the question of the cost of transportation should be kept constantly in mind.  If we are competing now for the British tourist, he can get a holiday including accommodation in Spain for eight days for 40 guineas, and if he wants to fly to Belfast for a holiday he will get there from London for £15.  I do not know that the distances are all that different between London to Belfast and London to Dublin, but if he wants to come to Dublin I think that the figure is £21.  I am aware of the cost of the short haul and the difficulty of Aer Lingus in balancing its own budget and its dependence to a degree on the feed-in of passengers from Aer Línte, but the question is worth considering whether in the context of the new difficulties which have arisen through price resistance by the tourist, this large charge for the London flight does not reflect some type of taxation on the man coming from London to cover losses that have been sustained on other <Col N="1444" /> routes, and whether such taxation of our exports and the tourist service is justifiable.  The question should be under constant examination.</P>
    <P>At the risk of my life in Limerick city, I say that the whole question of transatlantic overflying of Shannon should be kept under constant examination. Times change the effects of policies and there may come a time when it will be decided that the overriding interests of the tourist industry here and consequently of the economy would best be served by an overfly of Shannon.  It would be dishonest not to mention that as a point relevant to what we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>Once more, our licensing laws might be looked at to see whether any revision is necessary to facilitate the tourist industry.  I will give the House one example.  Take the case of a conference in a Dublin hotel&mdash;it could be anywhere in the country.  Only those who are residing in the hotel are, after a certain point of time, entitled to be served with a drink.  I am not an expert on the licensing laws but I understand that if you take a substantial meal you can get served with a drink up to 12.30 a.m. but even if you have a substantial meal you cannot be served after 12.30.  I suggest there should be a revision of the licensing laws to provide for this.</P>
    <P>Recently, a national tourist council was formed representative of all the different sectors and there ought to be an energising of that body so that we could achieve a cross-pollination of ideas between such bodies as Aer Lingus, Bord Fáilte, CIE and the Hotels Federation.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan described the situation that exists in the Shannon area but which to my knowledge does not exist elsewhere.  There, he said, there is a deliberate local policy of making visitors aware of the things to be done that day, that week, that month&mdash;the places to be visited, the antiquities to be enjoyed.  This is not true of the country generally.  I have known tourists living in hotels here, who are not of the passive kind, who wanted to get boats, who wanted to fish, but nobody could tell them what to do <Col N="1445" /> about it.  We should try here to build up an information service of this kind on a countrywide basis.</P>
    <P>If I am abroad I always welcome some information about the history of the locality in which I am living temporarily.  In some tourist regions one cannot find any sense of local history at all; it has been dissipated. Here we have got something which in the most popular tourist regions of the Continent they have not got.  We have a varied and unusual type of culture which is attractive and which could be exploited, if you like to use that word, for the material benefit of our people.</P>
    <P>Another provision in the Bill which I welcome is the reference to the registration of approved holiday cottages. My last point will be that the Minister should consider very carefully the idea of putting Bord Fáilte in funds sufficiently to improve the training programme and also that he should work out at departmental level with that body some understanding as to the long-term provisions that would be available to them, other things being equal, in the matter of marketing tourism throughout the world.</P>

      <P>Tourism is now our second greatest industry whose benefits penetrate into the remotest areas of the country, spread over many sections of the community. Therefore, I welcome this Bill which provides further capital for this great industry.  I wish also to compliment Bord Fáilte for the great job they have done and the very sensible way they have utilised the money they have been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their early days, Bord Fáilte had only one-tenth of the money they now get but they found it very difficult at that time to get owners of hotels and guesthouses to avail of the small amount then available.  However, they did such a good selling job that now we have not enough money to meet demands <Col N="1446" /> for the provision of extra accommodation, extra amenities, recreation centres and so on.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to say that we have gone far enough with the provision of the larger type hotel.  I think there should be a clamp down on the building of more large hotels or the extension of the bigger existing hotels, and that we should move to a consolidation period, if you like to put it that way, and follow up with the provision of more amenities and recreational facilities.  I know areas where big projects were started in the early days of Bord Fáilte promotions but they are not yet finished.  There are many of those &ldquo;unfinished symphonies&rdquo; all over the country and I should like to see a diversion from large hotel grants to the finishing of those projects.</P>
    <P>We all know that the pattern of tourism has changed greatly.  You have now the mobile tourist and, as Senator Honan said, many of our seaside bungalows and guesthouses are now reaping the benefits.  We also have more young people and more of the middleincome group taking holidays here and we should try to organise our facilities to cater more and more for such people.  Caravaning is become more popular and I do not know if Bord Fáilte are sufficiently generous in giving grants towards the provision of caravan sites.  In this context I should like to see those responsible for the caravan sites established before the grant period availing of grants to improve their sites.  There is a great danger that those sites will become new slum areas.  They need good supervision and Bord Fáilte should make an all-out effort to get all the early-established caravan park owners to provide better amenities, better lighting and supervision.</P>
    <P>The rent-a-cottage scheme has been welcomed by many Senators.  We all know this will bring tourists into areas which otherwise would not see a tourist at all.  Side by side with this scheme I hope to see facilities for entertainment and recreation being provided.  I know local people will be wise enough to organise them.  Another thing I welcome is the registration of summer houses.  For too long those summer <Col N="1447" /> houses have been neglected and there should be a certain standard and a register of those houses, especially in seaside areas.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned the training of staff for hotels and said that it has not gone hand in hand with the extra hotel accommodation.  I thoroughly agree. We know a certain amount of work is being done in this field but I am afraid it is not sufficient to keep pace with the expansion of hotel accommodation.  I urge a crash course in such training in tourist centres.  Perhaps we could have some courses on television.  The training of hotel staff has not kept pace with the expansion of the industry. That again is another consolidation area, as I have mentioned previously.</P>
    <P>At one time I asked Bord Fáilte to issue booklets with advice to hotels and guesthouses.  However, I have not seen any such booklets.  Another message we should get across is that everybody is involved in this industry to some extent even to the person on the side of the road who gives a direction to a tourist.  If that person makes an impression on the tourist by his friendly manner, that will be remembered long after the lakes of Killarney have been forgotten.  The personal aspect is of great importance in this industry.  There has been some moaning about the decrease in tourist traffic this year.  I must say that I have not noticed any falling off in my area.  Perhaps the reason for this is that we have geared our tourist business towards the Irish tourist.  Perhaps more effort in this direction should be made in other areas.</P>

      <P>These, then, are just some points I wished to make on this Bill but in conclusion I should like to refer to the family hotels.  These family hotels have the advantage of having personnel who, usually, do not change from year to year as is the case in hotels who may employ staff for about three months of the year usually at seaside resorts.  Many of the staff employed in these hotels are secondary school students who have had no training whatsoever in this type of work. Therefore, I would suggest that with those temporary staff in mind there might be arranged some type of crash course.  I welcome the Bill and I hope that each one of us will play his or her part in ensuring the continuing success of this major industry.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill as I welcome anything being done to improve this very important industry.  Tourism, like Telefís Éireann or the film industry is a subject about which everybody has something to say but I do not intend speaking for the sake of hearing my own voice.  Rather, I want simply to put before the House and the Minister a few obtruse reflections&mdash;by obtruse I mean in the sense that they might not ordinarily be discussed in a debate of this kind&mdash;to which we should pay some attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism and conservation, I need hardly remind the House, go hand in hand.  If we fail in our efforts at conservation in Ireland we shall fail also in our efforts in relation to tourism. People will not come from abroad, least of all from Germany, to see a country whose towns and villages are <Col N="1449" /> country deserts and whose countryside has been defiled.  I have no wish to labour this theme and least of all do I wish to give the impression that Bord Fáilte have not played their part in trying to make sure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>My own experience of Bord Fáilte is that they are concerned with conservation and with the preservation of the Irish countryside.  Their concern is noticeably greater in this regard than is the concern of Government Departments such as the Department of Local Government and the Office of Public Works whose power of control in these matters is much greater than is the power of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I remember an incident of about seven or eight years ago when details appeared in the newspapers of a plan that had been drawn up, apparently without asking anybody, between Bord Fáilte and the Irish Life Assurance Company whose building is across the canal from them.  The plans were to turn that strip of the canal into a concrete shapeless park.  There is no other way to describe it.  At the time I wrote a letter to the <i>Irish Times</i> complaining about this piece of vandalism and, to the very great credit of Bord Fáilte, I received a very polite letter from the director saying that what I had written made him view the thing in a different light.  He asked if I would give him a more detailed view of how I thought this strip should be handled.  That part of the canal was preserved and while I am not claiming all the credit for it, I think I must be entitled to at least some credit.  That particular part of the canal is now a very pleasant feature of this city.</P>
    <P>To me, that was an indication of Bord Fáilte's interest in conservation and in trying to maintain the attractions of our city and countryside. Another indication of the board's concern in this regard is their excellent publication <i>Ireland of the Welcomes.</i> This is a very fine publication indeed. It appeared first in 1952 or 1953 at a time when we were ignorant about such matters.  It has maintained a consistently high standard, editorially, photographically and typographically. Bord Fáilte deserve the greatest credit for that publication.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> To get back to the board's concern with the preservation of our amenities and their protection from spoliation&mdash; this is the reason why I believe Bord Fáilte should have more power and more money because when somebody is willing to do a job they should be allowed to get on with it.  The board should be given more power to prevent spoliation of the Irish towns and countryside and the Department of Local Government and the Office of Public Works should show themselves to be interested generally in this.</P>

      <P>Before the luncheon adjournment I said that tourism and conservation went hand in hand.  My objective in saying this was to give myself the opportunity to praise Bord Fáilte for the consistent interest it has shown in the whole subject of conservation, long before anyone knew what that word meant and certainly at a time when to recommend conserving things was neither popular nor profitable. I believe that a person or a body that shows an interest in a job should be given responsibility for doing that job; and Bord Fáilte ought to be given more powers than it has to protect our towns and countryside against decay and spoliation.  I have in mind both decay in the general sense and in the small and less easily perceived sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greater part of Dublin city which forms the material for tourist advertising is in a state of decay.  The one per cent of the built-up area of Dublin which An Taisce has recommended as deserving total protection, represents a stratum of building which is very old by Irish standards.  Much of it goes back to 1780 and beyond and <Col N="1451" /> most of it not later than 1820.  Wood decays, mortar crumbles, rafters get woodworm and deathwatch beetle in them, slates need renewal, gutters fall in, walls bulge.  All these things happen and nothing can stop them.  I want to know what plan Bord Fáilte or anyone else has for halting this progressive decay.  It is not anyone's fault that these old houses are decaying; it is the natural consequence of wind and weather.</P>
    <P>The issue of <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> for July and August of this year is a special Conservation Year issue. There is an article in it by Kevin Fox on the problems of town planning in Dublin. That article is illustrated by several attractive photographs.  One of these shows the vista of Upper Mount Street leading to the so-called pepper canister church.  It is a street, I know, which has noble associations for those on the other side of the House.  I would like to know if, when they walk up that street to fight with one another, they ever look at the first six or eight houses on the left-hand side.  These houses are in an advanced state of decay.  It is a sad thing that a Bord Fáilte publication of this excellent standard, issued in commemoration of Conservation Year, should print a photograph of this beautiful street which, if one could look at it a little bit closer, could be seen to be within a short distance of falling down.</P>
    <P>I know it costs money to maintain these old houses.  Many of the buildings in Upper Mount Street, as Members on the far side of the House who have more opportunities for observing than I have will know, are approaching tenement conditions.  They have all the indicia of tenements: the open hall door with children playing inside on the steps.  That street is not going to last much longer unless a great deal of money is spent on it.  The same can be said for many of the houses in Merrion Square, Fitzwilliam Square, Fitzwilliam Street, Merrion Street and other parts of this little fraction of 1 per cent.  Where is the money going to come from?  I do not pretend, and Fine Gael does not pretend, it can be conjured out of a hat, but it has got to come from somewhere, otherwise we <Col N="1452" /> can write off Dublin as a tourist centre. There is nothing else worth seeing in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We will not get people from London or Manchester, let alone Oslo or Florence, to come and look at the sprawl of suburbs we have built up around us over the last 30 or 40 years. They have suburbs like that themselves. There is nothing in Walkinstown to induce a man from Manchester to come and look at it.  He has suburbs like that himself.  The only thing in Dublin worth looking at is the small proportion of the total area covered by buildings of this kind, which unfortunately are old and expensive to maintain.  I am not trying to make a political point, because I know we all have the interests of this industry at heart; but the Government have not faced up to the problem, neither has the Department of Local Government. The kind of grants available for repairs are not enough to deal with repairs on very large houses.  A few days ago an architect published his view that the maintenance of this core of old Dublin would cost about £50 million for a start.  I am not qualified to say whether this figure is excessive, but, if it is correct, and if we are going to maintain Dublin as a tourist attraction, we are going to have to find that £50 million.  When Deputy Boland was confronted with the problem as Minister for Local Government he said that for him the needs of the people came first and the social priorities which he recognised involved putting ordinary housing for ordinary people at the top of the list.  I do not dissent from that priority at all and I respect a man who says that people come first and old houses and beautiful views second.  But I ask the House, how is it that in other countries, with limited resources, they seem to be able to do both?  They seem to be able both to house their people and to preserve their buildings which need preservation, without undue complaints that the taxpayer is being beggared?</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on this, although I have spoken on the matter before.  I urge the Government, in the person of the Minister, and the members of his party who are listening to me to face up to this problem.  Fine Gael will not <Col N="1453" /> complain if we are told that the Government will be looking for money to halt the decay of public amenities. We are not against the idea.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking about the Dublin area alone.  The decay in urban Dublin, and the threat to its tourist potential, of course needs publicity.  But I am not so much of a jackeen as not to know that there are urban amenities elsewhere in Ireland which are equally threatened.  There are houses in Limerick, Cork, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Waterford and in other places which deserve protection as much as Fitzwilliam Square or Merrion Street. I am looking for some overall plan for dealing with the progressive decay in these buildings.</P>
    <P>In the Netherlands, which of course is a richer country than Ireland, the cost of maintaining old buildings which are important to the tourist industry is split between the State, the city and the owner in roughly equal proportions.  Speaking from memory, I think that the State bears 40 per cent, the city 30 per cent and the owner 30 per cent of the cost involved.  I do not know whether a system of that kind would suit us; it would involve a heavy charge on rates and central taxation. But what other idea can we find? I am not trying to make political capital out of this; I admit that Fine Gael have not a policy for this either. But we urge the Government to consider this question, because every day that goes by means that the work will cost more eventually.  Every month that goes by will mean more expense in the end.  It will mean expense, or else the disappearance from the tourist map of the capital city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>One per cent of Dublin and the corresponding small proportion of other Irish towns which are tourist amenities represent strata of the late 18th century or early 19th century buildings.  We are looking at urban amenities through the eyes of a particular era.  Our children and grandchildren may think much of buildings we do not bother about now. There are many buildings in the older suburbs which are Victorian, that were built in the mid-or late- 19th century or perhaps early in the 20th century but to which we attach no importance. <Col N="1454" /> Our children may find these buildings of extreme interest.  The same applies to buildings of a similar type in Cork, Limerick and elsewhere.  While I am not suggesting that we should load the State with the job of maintaining every building in the country, we must bear in mind that the perspective of the people will change.  Buildings will become interesting and views will become precious which were not previously thought to be so.  Buildings and streets were broken up in the past which, if we still had the opportunities, we should probably take great care to preserve now.  I urge on the Government to consider the question of constant urban renewal and preservation, and not merely to provide houses for the people to live in, but for the purpose of preserving for posterity those aspects of our cities and towns, which we may expect will be enjoyed and by which our descendants' lives may be enriched.</P>
    <P>The decay I spoke about in the general sense in regard to the major buildings of Dublin and other Irish towns is a serious threat to the potential of these towns as tourist attractions.  It is not the only kind of decay which Bord Fáilte should examine carefully.  Side by side with the decay in the actual brick-work, <i>et cetera,</i> there is decay in something which a disinterested or inexpert eye may travel over without looking at, and that is decay in the detail of the street-scapes and town-scapes.</P>
    <P>Street furniture is a subject which is rarely spoken about.  Our street furniture is becoming as ugly as it is possible for street furniture to be.  Our bus stops and litter bins are unattractive; our parking meters are unattractive. Possibly this is unavoidable, but there are details of street furniture of periods gone by which are decaying very rapidly, although they are an integral part of the appearance of the street as originally designed.</P>
    <P>We Irish are a people greatly given to regarding ourselves as a more spiritually conditioned people than others, as a people with a better perception of eternal values and less enveloped by materialism.  I find this a repellent piece of hypocrisy.  It is undoubtedly <Col N="1455" /> an attitude which is less common nowadays than it used to be, but I think it is repellent because all the evidence of our eyes, if it is not entirely to the contrary, certainly does not bear out that contention.  You can go to a pagan city like Paris, and over there, without any of the spiritual advantages of the Irish, you will find that they are not ashamed or afraid to preserve details of an aesthetic kind and to spend money and forgo perhaps considerations of efficiency in maintaining them.  You can observe in the streets of Paris and Rome and other continental cities how much care is taken to preserve the street lamps in the condition in which they were when they were first put up in the 1860s, the 1870s or the 1880s.  No such care is taken in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is one kind of street lamp peculiar to Dublin which is shaped rather like a bishop's crook with a motif of shamrocks in the curve.  That is peculiar to Dublin.  I do not know when they were put up; I think it was at the beginning of this century.  These lamps are very graceful and certainly deserve preservation; but in many cases the old lamps are being ripped down and replaced with concrete monstrosities&mdash;I am sorry not to be able to think of a more forcible word.  Unsuitable modern lamps have been placed even on the top of the 19th century standards, where the shaft of the old lamp has been preserved. The old lamps have been replaced by modern ones entirely unsuited to the shape of the standards.  These are details which I am sorry to trouble the House with, but they do go to make up the kind of picture of the city that somebody seeking to maintain Dublin or any other Irish city as a tourist attraction must be concerned with.</P>
    <P>A member of this House who wishes to see for himself what I am talking about need only step out to Leinster Lawn, where he will find, on the way out to Merrion Street that the lamp you reach before the gates on the right hand side, clearly originally designed to carry a lantern of Victorian type, has been barbarised by the replacement of the old Victorian lamp, which <Col N="1456" /> no doubt had to be taken down, by a wretched little German lamp six inches tall with yellow glass in it, the kind of thing that you would find outside a bijou residence in Munich built in the '30s or '40s&mdash;an appalling demonstration of lack of taste by the Office of Public Works or whoever is responsible for the installations of this House. If you go as far as the gates to Merrion Street you will find that the lamps on top of them have been removed.  I do not know what they were like, and I have no information on what is going to replace them, but if it is going to be anything like the little yellow monstrosity on the way out to the gate, it would be far better to leave the pillars alone than to replace those lamps.</P>
    <P>Wherever you go in Dublin it is the same story with regard to lamps, regarded by many simple people as objects of a certain romantic and aesthetic interest and as an amenity. Heuston Station, Kingsbridge, is an example of a beautiful building, dating from about the middle 1840s, which was surrounded by a railing on which at intervals there were a very fine series of Victorian lamps, but one by one they are disappearing.  I know that iron has a limited lifetime, that it rusts away and it must be removed, but when I see these iron lamps being replaced by apologies for lamps I cannot see why they cannot be replaced by something which will look like the original.</P>
    <P>Ballsbridge is another example. Travel towards the Royal Dublin Society showgrounds or towards Dún Laoghaire, and beside the Bank of Ireland there are on each side of the bridge four very unusual globular lamps, every single one of which is in an advanced stage of decay.  I have written to Bord Fáilte about this, and I know that they are interested, though I do not know what they can do about it.  The shafts of those lamps are rusted and broken, they are leaning, bits of the little spikes on top of them have been broken and are missing.  Sooner or later we will find that that little amenity which has given perhaps unconscious pleasure to thousands and thousands of people throughout their lives will go.  I know that we will then be told that they were in such a state <Col N="1457" /> that the decay was too far advanced to be worth repairing or that it was impossible anyway to replace them.  I realise that this problem exists.  You cannot just order a Victorian lamp like you can order a pound of butter, but let us face this thing squarely just like the problem of large-scale conservation. If we are prepared to let our old street furniture go let us be done with it and let us clear away the whole lot of it, but if we decide not to let this happen then Bord Fáilte or any other Government agency that may be interested in the matter will have no alternative but to do what they do in other countries, namely to set up its own iron foundry or workshops to produce proper replicas.</P>
    <P>I will not hold up the House by going through the various items of street furniture in the city which are in a state of decay and need renewal, but before I leave this there are one or two other items that I want to mention. The railings surrounding Dublin houses of the 18th or early 19th century are now equally in a state of decay for the same reason.  There is a characteristic Dublin railing with an urn on top of it every ten or 12 feet, and these are now in many cases in a state of decay and are disappearing. Another point is the door furniture, in other words the knocker and the knob, which is a distinctive feature of the 18th or early 19th century, but in many houses these are now missing&mdash; again it is not only by any means from private houses, but from State-owned houses and houses owned by semi-State bodies, who in some respects are the worst offenders in this regard. Before the ESB pulled down the houses in Lower Merrion Street they had removed the door furniture from every one of these, presumably to stop people from going up and knocking on them.  This was a piece of small-scale barbarity&mdash;now replaced by a piece of large-scale barbarity&mdash;such as a State-owned body ought not to be guilty of.</P>
    <P>If you walk along Harcourt Street, which to my mind is one of the most beautiful streets in Dublin, it is hard to understand that it is not included in the 1 per cent scheduled for total preservation. It is something unique, with <Col N="1458" /> its long gentle curve and perfect slope. If you walk down that street you will find many instances of defects, decay and spoliation.  There are doorways being taken out and replaced by cheap modern doors of the mass produced form which were utilised in the '30s and the '40s.  That is not the only thing. Some of the original solid granite steps have been covered over by shiny bathroom tiles.  It seems to me to be hopeless to talk about Dublin as an attraction to our tourists when we are allowing so much of it fall into this kind of decay.  We have these lovely places like Warrington Place and Upper Mount Street, of which this issue of <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> contains these beautiful photographs which would appeal to anybody from any part of the world, and yet the whole thing is in an advanced state of decay and there is no effort being made, no plan, to prevent it from going further.</P>
    <P>In speaking about these things I am speaking mainly about Dublin because I have lived here all my life and I know more about it, but I know that the same applies to every other town in Ireland and many even of the small towns and villages.  This is something with which Bord Fáilte have been concerned for so long as they have been in existence.  They were concerned with it at the time when no one else was concerned.  I urge the Minister to consider whether the Bord Fáilte powers could not be so extended as to enable them to spot decay of this kind when it occurs and to see that it does not go any further.  Perhaps Bord Fáilte might not wish to be turned into a sort of cultural police body, but something must be done to ensure that we do not let this city or any Irish town run down.</P>
    <P>It is like the National Museum issue on which we had a debate here last month.  A crowd of Balubas in charge of the place would not have allowed it to deteriorate into such a state as we have done since securing independence 50 years ago.  Are we to do the same with the large-scale urban landscapes we have got?  If we are not, let us hear from the Government, who have the power to do something about it.  We cannot continue, for example, to have <Col N="1459" /> fine granite doorsteps covered over with shoddy tiles, and if the Government decide to do something to police this they will not receive any opposition from me or, I am sure, from anyone on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>There are other things Bord Fáilte should show an interest in which are not in a state of decay but which are threatened for commercial reasons of another kind.  One of the types of building most characteristic of Ireland was the elegant decor of our old publichouses. The reasons for their grandeur were probably social reasons, probably reflecting the poverty and the misery of the people during past ages when the publichouse was the only place in which a bit of relief and cheer could be found.  A lot of work and imagination went into the decor, external and internal, of Irish publichouses which were distinguishable from those in England and elsewhere by the striking, but by no means vulgar, decor which their owners applied to them.</P>
    <P>Members of the House may not have given this much thought, but it has struck me in recent years that the number of publichouses with the old-style facia boards bearing the name in gold on a red background is rapidly going down.  There was a time when most publichouses had this decor&mdash;a window made null and void by a mirror inside with the name of a distiller and, overhead, this facia board. That is becoming very rare.  I am not in favour of turning Bord Fáilte into a cultural police force, but some kind of formal power should be given to them to prevent people who occupy such buildings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect of publichouse decor which was characteristic of Ireland, which attracted interest and which was beautiful in itself, more in the country than in the city, was the gable wall.  At one time when the quality of drink varied from publichouse <Col N="1460" /> to publichouse, the gable bore legends such as &ldquo;Noted House For Best Drinks&rdquo;.  There was a system whereby the individual blocks of which the house was built&mdash;they might be plastered over&mdash;were painted in varying shades of grey; the blocks were divided obliquely into four and shaded so as to give the impression that the blocks were of dressed stone.  Of course it was a sham, a pious fraud but it had an effect which was peculiar to this country.  I have never seen it anywhere else.</P>
      <P>I agree that people who own publichouses must be allowed a fair degree of liberty in respect of their own property, but it is a pity to see these things going out without protest or interference.  I think, therefore, that Bord Fáilte ought to be given some power, even a power of inducement by paying for the restoration of old publichouse decor, in order to get people who own shops of that kind to maintain them as they were.  It is tragic to see streetscapes being ruined by importations from England, to see the way facia boards are covered over with laths and cheap plastic signs.  In Galway last week I saw a publichouse, an ordinary decent house of the kind common in Galway, covered over with a mock Tudor boarding of a kind of you would get in a pub in Twickenham.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I am not in favour of policing people or forcing them to do certain things with their own property but I am in favour of Bord Fáilte being given some powers of persuasion or inducement and thereby preserving some of the traditions we should be proud of.  This country is becoming less and less a country anybody would wish to come to see.  Nothing gives me greater personal pleasure than to see a person from abroad coming here and enjoying himself and liking what he sees.  But I see, unfortunately, every day, that the elements in this country which attract and amuse the native or the foreign eye disappearing, being literally plastered over by shoddy vulgarity and tawdry forms of building and decor, commercially inspired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been speaking about urban amenities.  There are two or three <Col N="1461" /> other topics I wish to deal with briefly. The first is the state of our foreshores at some of the tourist resorts near Dublin.  This has been well thrashed out and I will not waste the time of the House by going into it deeply.  I should like however to refer to the foreshore at Dún Laoghaire, in particular the Forty Foot.  On one occasion recently when I was at a meeting here in Leinster House lasting from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. during the heat-wave in June, I felt afterwards that I needed a swim at the Forty Foot.  I went there for a swim to find that you would need to be an animal of some kind to go in. There was nothing there but a sheet of pollution, and visitors were standing there looking at it in dismay.  That is what we are offering as seaside amenities. I urge the Minister to bring his influence to bear to make sure that this appalling disamenity will be cleaned up quickly.</P>
    <P>In regard to amenities in the country generally, I should like to pay a tribute to the small towns in the countryside. It must be said that the Tidy Towns competition has been a colossal success.  It is hard to believe that some of the towns in Ireland were once, twenty years ago, a succession of unrelieved grey concrete, limestone, grey concrete again varied only by the garish colours of a petrol filling station. Now they have pastel washes applied to them, there are trees everywhere and the town are most agreeable to the eye.  The people who have brought this about, and who have done it with no publicity, deserve our greatest admiration.  It is a joy to drive through a little place such as Tyrellspass or some other such attractive town or village.  However, it seems to me deplorable that when so much trouble has been taken in the efforts to make these towns and villages so attractive that these efforts should be frustrated by the sight of ESB poles and wires all over the place.</P>
    <P>To take the town of Athy for instance&mdash;this is a good-sized unpretentious and prosperous town and a town which I consider to be very attractive but, unfortunately, its attractiveness and potential attractiveness is diminished by elecric wires running <Col N="1462" /> from one end of the town to the other. I realise that it is more expensive to carry electricity underground rather than to carry it on poles but the poles system of carrying power is primitive. The sight of these things reminds me of the Abilene Junction or of Tombstone, Arizona.  It is the Wild West system of carrying electricity.  I know that the Minister is conscious of this and I hope that he will outline what he has in mind for the future.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the lack of proper rubbish collection facilities in towns and villages all over the country.  I have no wish to go into personal experiences in this debate but I shall give the House one example of what I have in mind.  I have only returned with my family from a holiday in Connemara where, with another family, we rented a house.  We were told by the landlord that the way to dispose of rubbish was to burn it.  The village where we stayed is a renowned tourist one.  We were to burn refuse in a incinerator which was a converted ashcan at the back of the house.  The landlord told us that people across the way had dumped rubbish into the sea as a result of which the foreshore was polluted as was plain to be seen.  We spent many man hours of that holiday in endeavouring to dispose of rubbish&mdash;probably more than any other family would have spent on such exercise.  We burned as much rubbish as we could but there were items such as cans and partly disposable nappies that would not burn. These we bundled together, put into the boots of the cars and drove some three or four miles out until we came to a bog.  There we dumped the rubbish in a bog hole but I cannot describe how foul the bog looked after we had done that.  However, we had no alternative. When I saw the bog I knew that it was a place where sportsmen would be likely to walk or any others but we had no other way out.  The nearest county council dump was 20 miles away in Clifden and I do not think anyone would suggest that the refuse of a house could be brought a distance of 20 miles in a private car.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Bord Fáilte are anxious to prevent dumping but this <Col N="1463" /> will not be possible until proper collection facilities are provided.  We depend to a large extent on tourism and a county council who do not provide these facilities are asking for trouble.  I need hardly go further than that.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for having detained the House.  As Senators are aware I seldom speak for more than 20 minutes but before concluding I must say a few words about the prices charged in hotels.  It is agreed that the high prices in Irish hotels and restaurants have been a contributory factor in the slow progress&mdash;perhaps even the decline this year in the tourist industry.  I do not quite know what the solution is but it is clear that many hotels are in financial difficulties.  I cannot understand why this should be so.  An Irish person can go on an all-in trip to Rome or Athens for about £70 but it will probably cost a Roman or an Athenian three times that amount to come to Ireland.  I do not know what is the reason for these high charges.  I heard Senator Alexis FitzGerald refer before lunch to the Ryan group here.  I do not suppose that there are many points on which Mr. Ryan and I would agree but if he can make a profit out of the way he runs his hotels, more power to him. During my trip around the country in an effort to gain a seat in this House, I stayed in different hotels where I paid £3 or £4 each night but one night when I stayed at one of the Ryan Hotels I was charged only £1 for a room with bath.  This was at the height of the season.  Perhaps I am giving a boost now to the Ryan group but if he can do that and still make a profit I cannot understand why others charge so much.  Why should he be the exception?</P>
    <P>The question of restaurants is a different one.  It is bad for the tourist industry that there should be virtually no restaurant in the city of Dublin where a tourist would wish to have lunch except hotel restaurants and these are geared to the profit expectation of the hotel itself and are out of reach of anything that the ordinary tourist can afford.</P>

      <P>I was invited to lunch recently by a friend and probably for the first time in my life I lunched at the Russell Hotel.  I had nothing to drink and my host had half a bottle of wine.  Despite his best efforts to avoid letting me see the bill, I noticed that it amounted to £8 6s.  It is pointless to expect people to come to this country unless they are millionaires, but, of course, millionaires have other facilities at their disposal and do not come here to be rained out and to have such prices exacted from them.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister and his Department might consider that the solution would lie in encouraging in Dublin and other towns the kind of family business restaurants that are common on the Continent.  Restaurants here tend to be an appendage to a hotel and are geared to maximum profits which result in these exorbitant prices because, of course, we realise that the hotel overheads are very high.  On the Continent most restaurants are run by families. All the human facilities of the family are put to use and great pride is taken in running the business.  The sons and daughters serve the meals while the grannies make the soups and so on.  They may work ten or 12 hours each day but they are prepared to do that.  In this regard perhaps we might give consideration to the fact that the licensing laws do not permit restaurants to have any licence other than a wine licence.  I do not know whether the Minister will agree but I think the kind of restaurants operating here with only a wine licence will not get the kind of custom I am talking about.  It will get people out for an evening which Irish people do not often do but it will not get a day-in day-out trade.  People want to be able to feel that if they want a bottle of beer or a short drink they can have one without paying an enormous price for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the whole question of licensing laws is very difficult and all sorts of interests have to be considered. I suggest that the Minister might consider carrying out an experiment and give a general licence to restaurants for a limited period in one town.  He can make what conditions he likes about <Col N="1465" /> there being no bar service independent of food.  Some attempt should be made to develop the kind of all purpose restaurant which exists on the Continent. This is one of the reasons why food there is relatively cheap and relatively good.  We hear that prices in France and Germany are inflated, but they are not inflated by Irish standards.  When I was a student in Germany 15 years ago I used to have my lunch in a restaurant&mdash;an ordinary restaurant, not a student canteen.  In this restaurant, as in many other restaurants, there was a system whereby if you were a standing guest and took what they gave you, you got it at a very reasonable price. During my years as a student in Germany I used to lunch every day off the fat of the land for less than 2s 6d.  I realise prices have gone up in Germany and one cannot now eat there for less than 10s or 12s, but one can scarcely eat in Dublin for less than 25s.  The first step necessary to promote family restaurant businesses is to change the licensing law and give restaurants a general licence instead of merely a wine licence.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are trying to encourage international congresses to this country This is an excellent initiative and a well chosen field for expansion.  The possibilities for expansion here are almost unlimited.  From my own quite large experience of international congresses the kind of person who goes to international congresses is somebody using the congress as an excuse for a few days holiday with his wife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was going to be accused of being naïve. When he comes for a few days he expects to have a good time.  His appetite for talking to his colleagues about his subject is not as great as he makes out when he is applying for his grant. Usually three-quarters of his colleagues are separated from him by a language barrier and do not know what he is talking about and do not greatly care. We have to admit that international congresses are simply jamborees and Bord Fáilte are right to recognise this. I justify my own reason for attending <Col N="1466" /> international congresses abroad by saying that I am keeping in touch with colleagues so that they will write articles for the journal I edit, and so on, but basically international congresses are social occasions.  Bord Fáilte should get help from the Government and the city of Dublin to entertain these guests.  I am in the situation of being able to contrast the kind of entertainment offered abroad and the kind of entertainment offered here.  The idea running through the minds of people organising congresses in Austria, Germany, France and Italy is that the delegate must never be left without an opportunity to freeload at two meals a day and late in the evening. This is very expensive but they seem to think it pays off.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte lays on a banquet for any congress that comes here under its aegis.  But I remember being at a congress in Vienna for four days in 1966 and I was not allowed to put my hand in my pocket the whole time.  I was barely able to struggle out and buy myself an occasional pint of beer or box of cigars.  It appeared to me that the intention was to prevent me from spending any money there.  I know this is not Bord Fáilte's intention in regard to delegates coming to this country.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear it.  I hope the Minister will invite both sides of the House.  They seem to find that it pays them to generate this goodwill even though it might not appear to do so on the surface.  The result is that more international congresses are held in Vienna than in any other city in Europe as far as I know.  Literally hundreds take place there every year. Now Continentals do not expect the same kind of entertainment as Irish people expect.  They are quite happy with a thimble-full of vermouth.  They do not need lavish hospitality but they do need constant attention.  The important thing is not to let them wander around feeling neglected.  I do not believe in preaching its own business to Bord Fáilte, but I make these points because this is an important field, with great potential.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which deals with our most important industry.  I want to pay tribute to the Minister's late father Mr. P.J. Lenihan for all the work he did in promoting Athlone and Westmeath.  I heard Senator Kelly talk about needing an extra £50 million.  I hope the Minister will remember his own home town of Athlone if he ever gets his hands on such a sum.  Great efforts have been made to promote tourism in the midlands. Tyrellspass won the Tidy Towns competition and four other villages were high on the list.  Various vocational groups have been associated with tourism and every effort should be made to assist them.</P>
      <P>Something which we all should have regard to is hotel charges.  There is a great danger that very many of our major hotels will price themselves out of the tourist market.  I have here a bill which a tourist paid for a small meal.  The meal consisted of cold roast beef and salad.  The man was charged 14s 9d plus 3s service charge which is a service charge of over 20 per cent. If our hotels continue to pursue that policy there will be many empty diningrooms and bedrooms.  I know of five people who stayed in a hotel in the south this year.  They stayed overnight and had bed, breakfast and dinner and the bill was £46.  These charges are appalling.  The results of such charging will be that the tourist will have to look for some other type of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is encouraging to note that the Irish Countrywomen's Association, together with Bord Fáilte, have done so much to promote farm holidays.  Farm <Col N="1468" /> holidays can be enjoyable for tourists and they can be provided at a reasonable rate.  If we have a thriving tourist industry other sections of our economy will benefit also.  Agriculture is closely related to tourism.  If a farmer can dispose of his produce for the benefit of tourists he will reap rich reward from his efforts and receive good prices for his produce.  The Irish Countrywomen's Association have done a great deal to promote these farmhouse holiday schemes.  The Minister should do anything he can to help these people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the cottage holiday scheme.  It will be very helpful in my county and in the Minister's own particular area.  I ask the Minister to make the scheme a flexible one so as to include grants for schemes of two to five cottages instead of for schemes of ten cottages.</P>
    <P>The souvenir industry is important Many traders sell souvenirs from Ireland with &ldquo;Gift from Killarney,&rdquo;&ldquo;Gift from Mullingar,&rdquo; or similar captions on them, but on the bottom of the souvenirs one would see &ldquo;Made in Hong Kong&rdquo; or &ldquo;Made in China.&rdquo;  Bord Fáilte should examine this.  There are small industries in this country which can produce first-quality goods at a competitive price.  There are people who want to reap a handsome profit from such industries.</P>
    <P>There is a great falling-off in tourist traffic this year.  This had to come sooner or later.  Life has its ups and downs for us all.  It is natural to expect that the tourist industry would have ups and downs.  Even if there has been a slight falling off in the early part of this summer it is noticeable that particularly in Dublin there are many tourists. I believe that by the time the tourist season has ended we may not have done as badly as now seems possible. We should redouble our efforts for next year and try to lure more people to this country so that our second greatest industry may continue to thrive as we would all wish.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that a Bill giving an opportunity for discussion on the tourist trade should come at such a rushed season of the year when everything seems to be piling <Col N="1469" /> in on the Seanad and the happenings elsewhere crowd out any worthwhile reference to Seanad proceedings in the national press.  It is deplorable and disgraceful the way the proceedings of Seanad Éireann are treated by our national press.  The position is deteriorating daily.  I found that the Finance Bill discussions in the Seanad yesterday rated no reference at all in one paper calling itself the national paper.  I refer to the <i>Irish Independent.</i> There was no reference to the contributions made here in the <i>Irish Press.</i> Seanad Éireann should try to do something about this.  Serious contributions are made here.  If Seanad Éireann is endeavouring to make some contribution to formulating public opinion it is only right that the Seanad should be given its fair share of publicity in the national press.  The proceedings of Dáil Éireann get 40 times as much coverage in the papers as do the proceedings of Seanad Éireann.  Stormont and happenings in other places&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We can discuss tourism even if it gets only five lines in tomorrow's papers.  We can discuss it in the hope that what we say may have some influence with the Minister's Department and with Bord Fáilte.  The Bill itself is a short Bill but it involves the spending of very considerable sums of money.  We are authorising grants to be doubled and to go up from £5.5 million to a ceiling of £11 million, before we are asked to comment on the state of the tourist trade again in three or four years time.  That is too big a jump.  We should have an opportunity of commenting on it at more frequent intervals than that.  The guaranteed loans go from £5 million to a total of £8 million.  That is a very substantial step forward.  We have all got the feeling that all is not well with the tourist business.  The examples of <Col N="1470" /> overcharging are too numerous and frequent to be pushed aside.  It is wrong that the taxpayers' money is spent in providing substantial help towards building new hotels and that these hotels should be allowed to charge what they like.  There should be a type of ombudsman service attached to Bord Fáilte and penalties should be imposed for transgression.  There should be heavy fines which would take back from the hotels concerned part of the subsidy they have got from the tax-payers. I think that some of the examples are deplorable.  On the other hand we have some excellent value for money, especially in our bed-and-breakfast establishments, particularly in the country regions where there is a great element of personal service and where the people concerned take a pride in doing a good job and enjoy meeting different people, conversing with them and seeing to their needs in every way possible.  That is the type of tourism that brings the Irish spirit into action.  That is what we should be proud to label as Irish tourism, the type of tourism that deserves to have Fáilte Uí Ceallaigh associated with it.  If we can develop that then I think we will see a proper expansion of our tourist trade into the 70s.</P>
    <P>At the moment the figures given by the Minister show that hotel rooms have increased from 17,800 to 27,890 in ten years.  This looks a substantial increase yet it is only 4 per cent per annum.  Despite that, however, I would suggest that we have sufficient hotel rooms at present and that we should continue the existing moratorium on these for the present because in that regard while we may be a little short of rooms at peak times, there is a very poor yearly utilisation of the places available. We cannot afford more provision for peak figures, so I think that the money in the future should be concentrated first on extending the utilisation of the resources we have got. That means extending the holiday season by every means possible.  There is not nearly enough recognition of the necessity for this, and this begins at home, because it is little comfort to the Irish economy to read the figure of plus £98 million contribution credited to tourism incoming and to find that <Col N="1471" /> probably the outgoing figures are at least £70 million to £75 million&mdash;in other words that there are far too many facilities for holidays abroad by our people and too much snobbery in concentrating on holidays abroad when the holiday facilities at home have not been explored.  I do not know what can be done on that.</P>

      <P>Even if we bring in £100 million a lot of that is in business and a great deal of it is people coming home, with emigrants returning. This is not in the strict sense what you would regard as tourism produced by our efforts to attract tourists in full competition.  We should realise the benefit we have with so many brought here simply by their blood ties.  It would seem that we should have an aggressive campaign first of all to encourage our own people as a patriotic duty to spend most of their holidays at home, and secondly to extending the season.  To extend the season there are two obvious things which require to be done.  First of all is the question of the school year.  It is all wrong with regard to the holiday season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be tackled, so that June rather than July and August becomes the accepted holiday month for schoolchildren and their parents.  Indeed I cannot think of a more pleasant month for holidays or a month with a better record of sunshine or of long days and general facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>But of course you must have a <i>quid pro quo</i>, and that is that the exams and all that should move forward at least two weeks so as to ensure that the certificate <Col N="1472" /> exams are finished by the 1st June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, of course the national schools are even more at fault because they continue until the first week of July whereas they should finish on 1st June.  It is necessary for both to close because schoolchildren, especially at the post-primary level, provide the great source of helpers for the casual work in the holiday season and they need to start that much earlier than they are available at present.  Secondly, to encourage this June type of holiday we will have to ensure that all schools are closed by then.  Of course that means opening up towards the end or the middle of August.  Opening by mid-August could be quite acceptable provided we recognise the fact that opening up by mid-August and going to Christmas is much too long a spell, and therefore the mid-term break in October should become a feature of our school year-a week's break at that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no problem in that.  I agree with the Senator, and I happen to know something about it because I was in Education before here, and the problems lie elsewhere, with the particular bodies concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be tackled.  It could make a greater contribution to extending the season than anything else I know.  With the school break in the Fall which is a feature of the systems in many countries it means that this in turn would come in to reinforce the holiday season at this end, and the parents and the children would tend to take some days at probably relatively cheap rates in our resorts at that period.  There is no reason why that mid-term break should not be a staggered one and be a week some time from the first week in September to the first week in October, arranging the break in such a way that it is spread over the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second real source of help is in factory holidays.  It seems absolutely <Col N="1473" /> crazy that these should be concentrated in the first two weeks of August, the very height of the holiday season.  You can change the pattern there provided it is coupled with some inducement, and the inducement I would see there is that we recognise the fact that we are going to have increased leisure in the future, and that means longer holidays.  Therefore with the increase from two weeks to three in the standard holiday pattern that could well be used as a means of rationalising the time at which it occurs.  I would suggest that it should be two weeks and one week.  The one week should occur some time in the early or late spring or early summer, which may probably be followed by two weeks in the September period.  That would ensure that our facilities are available in July and August for out-of-State tourists largely, and would achieve the spread of the season and the better utilisation of our resources.</P>
    <P>There are the keys to the successful development of our system.  Of course, if we can get a longer season established it would mean that hotel staffs would become much more permanent and we would have far fewer fly-by-nights who through no fault of their own, after four or five months work, clear off to England leaving the unfortunate hotelier to try to train a new batch in the following season. Rather than concentrating the taxpayers' money on the building of large-scale hotels we should be spending it in the way I have been suggesting.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the scheme for holiday cottages, but like the last speaker I suggest it is totally wrong to put a minimum number on it.  By putting a minimum number of ten on it we are moving into the factory class again. An operator with ten cottages will not be able to give any real element of personal service whereas an owner down the country with just one cottage, like the owner of a bed and breakfast establishment, can give all his attention to it.  Our demand simply should be that minimum standards would be maintained and that as long as the owners remain registered they would be liable to inspection.  Complaints could be investigated and if anything is wrong they could be knocked out.  I <Col N="1474" /> therefore appeal to the Minister to remove the lower limit in this respect. I cannot see the difference between ten holiday cottages and a motel.  I think the development of the motel system here is good.  The charges are much more reasonable being of the order of £2 a night or less.</P>
    <P>The figures given in a recent survey were anything but flattering to us.  In the newspapers today we read that there was an average increase in 1969 of 12 per cent of tourists from EEC regions.  Out of that number we got only 3 per cent compared with an average of 12 per cent for the countries concerned in the survey and 23 per cent for England.  That points to the fact that the boom we had in the 'sixties will not continue into the 'seventies unless we take real positive steps.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry has been cited as our second largest one, bringing in £98 million last year, a substantial sum.  I understood the Minister to say that there is an outlay of £40 million. That leaves us with a figure of £60 million.  Despite the fact that there has been a fall, the net income is still between £40 and £50 million.  We can look at agriculture, which is worth a net £180 million which means that tourism brings in about quarter of the amount.</P>
    <P>The one thing we are certain about in the future is that there will be more leisure time available.  Machinery, automation, mean that the working week will continue to decrease and this means that catering for leisure will become more and more important. Therefore, the Government are right to put resources at the disposal of this industry, but I think they should be doing it more aggressively.  I should like bigger sums put into the development of tourist facilities that are unique to this country the ones where the personal touch is involved.</P>
    <P>For instance, family farm holidays express everything of the best we can offer from the point of view of the unique experience for visitors of being on a natural farm, not a phoney one, of being able to share in farm activities and of being able to use the facilities of the farm, such as horse riding and kindred activities.  It is on these things we should be concentrating. <Col N="1475" /> There are also caravan holidays and pony trekking which is unique to us and which we should develop much more.</P>
    <P>We should do more by way of package holidays.  Aer Lingus could possibly have closer ties with coach holidays in the country and some effort should be made to tie in tourism with sales of Irish produce.  In other words, when we are pushing the marketing of Irish produce in England and elsewhere, whether dairy produce or meat, we should tie in some type of raffle or lottery, the prizes being holidays in Ireland and the transport to and from being by Irish airlines.  I have suggested this many times and I do not see why such an imaginative approach should not be adopted and introduced.</P>
    <P>I also suggest the development of local exhibits in local museums and so on.  We want something to act as focal points for visitors.  Therefore I ask the Minister to see to it that the grandiose scheme for the development of Kilmainham as a national museum is not allowed to proceed.  Instead, we could have a transport museum and various farm museums decentralised so that they would act as focal attractions in various parts of the country for tourists who could not be expected to enjoy themselves spending a complete day scampering around the 22 acres at Kilmainham.  I ask the Minister to engage his moderating influence in this respect.</P>
    <P>On the question of increasing the membership of Bord Fáilte, provided the increased membership is used to insist on the unique Irish character of tourism rather than helping the hotel industry I am in agreement with it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I commend Bord Fáilte on what they have done but I ask them now to take stock of the various genuine Irish tourist amenities that have been developed, to ensure that these are developed and the phoney ones which are replicas of what can be got in Brighton or elsewhere will be allowed quietly to fold up and go to Brighton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the many warm and sincere tributes that have been paid to Bord Fáilte for their imaginative <Col N="1476" /> approach, enthusiasm and for the constant help, advice and co-operation that they have given to everyone engaged in the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I do not wish to appear to be introducing any discordant or critical note if I make some suggestions which may possibly be of assistance or, at least, worthy of consideration. This Bill deals primarily with the giving of money for grants and the guaranteeing of loans from the bank to enable people either to improve and expand existing businesses or to create new businesses.  I would suggest that when grants are to be given for the expansion of existing businesses, the conduct of that business for at least three years past be investigated critically by the board and certain factors should be considered by them.  For example, they should consider such factors as what imagination or enthusiasm has the person running the business displayed during that period or if he has made any effort to expand the holiday period in the occupation of his hotel.</P>
      <P>In commercial business this factor is borne in mind by the Department of Industry and Commerce as to what efforts a businessman has made towards selling abroad and so on.  A very important factor in the tourist business is the ascertaining of what efforts are being made to expand the tourist season by the person who is seeking the grant. This is important from two points of view.  Anybody, regardless of whether he is competent or not, can fill his hotel during the peak period when people cannot get rooms elsewhere but only the man who runs his place well and who gives value for money can continue his business outside the normal holiday period.  That man is introducing into the country an income that we would not otherwise receive.  Furthermore, he is taking the first step towards good labour relations because it does not make for good labour relations to have men and women employed for only a short period each year and then to dismiss them so that they must draw unemployment insurance.  Neither does this lead towards getting the best staff or towards providing the best possible service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> Therefore, one of the most important factors to be considered are the steps that have been taken by the person seeking the grant during the past two years towards expanding the holiday period and how successful those steps have been.  His accounts should be open to inspection for that period and if he is seeking grants for a new hotel his background should be examined as regards his experience of the business and his administrative ability.  As grants are given here, there is too much temptation for a person who is seeking easy money because he may decide to sell when he has the hotel built and after he has got the grant of approximately one-third of the cost, thereby making a profit.</P>
    <P>I find it necessary to say, although I very much regret having to say so, that a considerable amount of fraud is practised in obtaining hotel grants. This is an open secret.  I have known auditors to refuse to certify or sign accounts that were to be forwarded to Bord Fáilte by persons applying for grants because they could not do so within their conscience and the accounts were sent to other auditors who were less scrupulous in that regard.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason whatever why a person looking for a grant to build a new hotel should not be confined by certain conditions, one of which would ensure that his accounts for the work he had done would be certified and audited and vouched for and which would impose on him very severe penalties if he should be fraudulent and, furthermore, that more severe penalties should be imposed on the professional men who certify such fraudulent accounts?  There could be a further protection by taking specific standards in addition to those but those certainly should be provided.  In so far as I know in relation to the giving of those grants at the present time they are simply estimates.  It is utterly impossible to make out an estimate of what would be the proper cost for a building because so much inferior work can be covered up by paint or plaster.  Accounts should be properly audited and properly certified and there should be very severe <Col N="1478" /> penalties for any person taking advantage of the situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the holiday period of factories and suggested that these be spread out.  It is common knowledge that at the present time all the factories in the country take two weeks holidays during the first fortnight in August.  That is essential in the ordinary way because some factories are dependent on others; some supply others and some require goods from others.  The third week is left wide and the workers and management decide between themselves in each factory when that week should be taken.</P>
    <P>However, even if all the holidays were to be taken at different times I do not think it would have very much effect on the tourist industry because wherever young people spend their money, provided they spend it at home and not abroad, it is redistributed, but what we want is money from foreign tourists.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the high charges in some of our bigger hotels.  It may be popular to criticise everything that appears to be wealthy and everything that appears to cater for wealthy people but tourists who visit this country, especially Americans, expect a certain standard of service and they are prepared to pay well for it.  What many people appear to overlook is the standard of service they require necessitates a very large number of personnel.  What many people do not realise is that in very expensive hotels the staff must approximate the number of guests in a ratio of one to one.  In some of the really expensive hotels they go much further than that and the number of staff exceeds the number of guests.  I do not think we have any such hotels in this country but there are some in Britain.  Provided guests are prepared to pay for this service there is no reason why we should not cater for them.</P>
    <P>The development of our tourist industry will also require a growing and expanding number of competent staff. I do not feel we are paying enough attention to the training of staff.  The average country hotel depends on boys and girls home on holiday from school to take on jobs as waiters.  These <Col N="1479" /> youngsters are paid a miserable pittance and the hotels are cashing in on them.  There are certain schools which provide hotel training here. Something could be done to encourage those schools.  I realise in this day and age that we have to depend on financial encouragement but some of the schools are run at a very severe loss.  I know of one or two which will ultimately reach the stage where they cannot continue to bear the loss and they will not be able to continue this training. Good hotel staff in Denmark, Holland or Belgium speak at least three modern languages and sometimes four.  In Holland they speak four different languages and although they may not be very expert they are able to carry on a normal conversation.  One or two of the hotel training schools in this country teach their students a couple of modern languages.</P>
    <P>The matters to which I have referred are no fault of Bord Fáilte.  Perhaps they do not appreciate the grasping and greed of certain people.  One thing we must remember is that the hotelier who will be dishonest with Bord Fáilte will be dishonest in the treatment of his guests and in the handling of his guests' bills.  Above all, he is a person who should not be allowed to continue in the hotel business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one point to make.  I spent all my holidays in the Thirty-two Counties and loved every moment of them.  When discussing with friends what is wrong and what is right about the tourist industry one of the most common complaints I hear is the lack of river fishing facilities.  The reason for this is that the stretches of river are used by large hotels and prosperous people.  We have a five-mile stretch of river running through the town of Cahir which is up for sale. One of the large hotels in the town of Cashel has offered £6,000 for it.  The local anglers are very anxious to get an option to purchase this stretch of the River Suir but, as yet, no option has been given to them.  Bord Fáilte should interest themselves in our rivers and see to it that when they are for sale they are offered to ordinary people so <Col N="1480" /> that we can do something for the ordinary tourists.</P>
      <P>I realise we must have facilities for the millionaire type tourist but I am interested in the ordinary hard working man who spends the rest of the year working in a factory in England and comes here for his holidays.  I believe in the private ownership of property but I believe everyone should get an option to purchase a stretch of river when it comes up for sale.  I suggest Bord Fáilte give grants so that these stretches of river can be purchased for the ordinary people.  This is the only point I want to make.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill because it provides a means for expansion in the grant system up to 1972. We need to introduce fresh thinking in relation to the system of grants.  I think it will be acknowledged by everyone that the grants and loans initiated some years ago have resulted in the growth of tourism which we have experienced.  We should now be taking a second look at the policy of giving grants to what I would describe as high priced hotels.  One does not wish to be over-critical but we have as many as we need, if not, perhaps, a little more than we need, of this type of accommodation.</P>
      <P>One of the effects which this type of accommodation has on the tourist industry here is to encourage others to charge higher than they need.  This bad habit may be affecting us.  I would discourage an increase in this type of accommodation.  Any further expansion of the tourist industry should come in the middle or lower priced accommodation.  Competition for tourism is becoming vital.  The people from abroad are price-conscious with regard to their holidays.  We are beginning to price ourselves out, even in ordinary meal prices.  Unless one is familiar with Dublin it is difficult to get a reasonable meal here at a reasonable price.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider publicising the amounts of grants given. I do not see anything wrong with such publication.  It might clear up misunderstanding. One hears exaggerated rumours of grants paid.  I should like to see the details.</P>

      <P>Prices of drink are affected by the all-over cost structure. One cannot altogether blame the hoteliers and public houses.  The entire structure is getting out of control and affecting our tourist earnings.  There are other factors in relation to drink prices.  We are relying much more than the British economy do on taxation from drink.  I am speaking of the proportion involved.  The British economy has other sources of revenue. One of our main sources of revenue is the taxation on drink.  I am more concerned about our visitors than about ourselves in this regard.  There is also a difference in the gravity of the beer, and our beer is costing more.  I understand that a pint of mild beer can be bought in Britain at less than the cost of a pint of beer here.  Perhaps the Minister could persuade the brewers here to produce a low-gravity beer.</P>

      <P>In the Dublin tourist region we have recommended to the brewers that they should examine the question of whether it is economic to produce a beer for visitors.  The Englishman can get a pint of beer for 2s 3d.  Here he must pay 3s 4d and he can pay as much as 4s 6d in certain types of premises.  This affects our tourist market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been referring to the need to be able to compete.  If the grants system is to continue after the expiration of the existing scheme, I would encourage the Minister to concentrate on the lower-priced, more competitive type of unit. The private-house accommodation and the farm-house accommodation should be encouraged.  There are good reasons for having this guesthouse accommodation <Col N="1482" /> and farmhouse accommodation where the increases in rates are the only increases likely to be faced.  There are not large increases in labour costs in these homes so their prices remain competitive.  In Scotland one can stay in a house in almost any town for 18s 9d for bed and breakfast.  Apart from the reasonable prices one benefits by meeting the Scottish people and not staying in high-priced hotels meeting people from one's own country.  I should like to see this type of tourism encouraged here.  There may be an odd case of someone applying for a grant for farmhouse accommodation and not intending to take visitors.  The majority of people who receive grants are giving a return to the economy for the money spent.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to overcharging and high prices.  I read of a lady in west Kerry charging 6s for two cups of tea and four slices of bread.  I visited this area often and one was accustomed to being invited in for a cup of tea without payment.  I hope this custom of overcharging is not developing. It may have something to do with the fact that a few million pounds have been spent by a film group in that area in the past few years.  There are bound to be a certain number of people in every community whose outlook is entirely selfish.  They are not conscious of the damage they do to the country, to the community or to the decent, ordinary, hardworking people who are working so hard for the tourist industry throughout the country.  I think that every effort should be made through whatever vehicles the board has to expose people who do this sort of thing. I am thinking very much of discouragement in the schools and through the radio, television and the press because there have just been too many instances of a small minority who tend to overcharge and to take advantage.  That is an unfortunate position.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other matters I should like to mention.  Some of them were raised before.  This city here is suffering in an outrageous way from public begging.  Representations have been made to the Garda by the tourist regional board of which I am chairman, and, so far, we have not seen anything <Col N="1483" /> like the results that one would hope for.  I am not being critical of the gardaí.  I think that this arises to some extent out of the fact that we do not seem to have enough gardaí for this sort of work.  Also I think&mdash;and I am speaking now from about four or five years experience of this&mdash;that the cure is not by way of prosecution and this is what the Garda are concentrating on.  Let us take the central tourist areas&mdash;Grafton Street, College Green, O'Connell Street and St. Stephen's Green.  Having a man on duty in uniform in these areas will keep the public beggars off those streets.  The difficulty about prosecution is that you have to catch somebody doing it, and you cannot do that if you are in uniform because it is not going to be done if you are there.  There should be a witness and it is very embarrassing to start arresting people.  They will start screaming and frequently pedestrians will tend to back up the culprit rather than the garda.  I think that we are getting to a stage in this city apart from, I am sure, Mr. Chairman, your own city, where this sort of thing is causing very great damage to an industry employing more than 160,000 people directly and indirectly.</P>
    <P>The other evil I should like to refer to and which has been brought to the notice of the authorities is the persistent commercialised selling of raffle tickets in our streets.  I have nothing against the charity whether it is the reverend mother or the parish priest who gets a licence which the superintendent cannot refuse for a legitimate charity, but there is, as far as I understand it, a commercialised system of raffle ticket-selling.  Advertisements have appeared in the papers here inviting young people to apply to sell tickets in the streets on a commission basis.  I have seen these myself where I work in O'Connell Street.  I have seen them being changed every few hours. I have seen cars delivering these people to the areas where they are to collect and I have seen visitors in this city who cannot stop at a shop window because if they do they are going to be pestered.  The gardaí are apparently helpless in dealing with this because <Col N="1484" /> once you have a licence there is no law against it.  There is not even as far as I can see a charge under which one would be entitled to prosecute these people even though they are damaging business, irritating visitors and making us out to be a nation of beggars.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about regional tourism, because I notice that in the Dáil there has been some criticism of it, although mild.  I think the regional tourist system set up by Bord Fáilte so far is justifying itself.  There are now eight voluntary boards with between 16 and 25 members on each board with a voluntary chairman looking after the interests of the different regions.  What has happened here is that the actual function of tourism locally has been decentralised.  It has been taken from Bord Fáilte and handed over to voluntary boards who know or should know what is needed in their areas, who can deal with local problems and who can generate interest and enthusiasm locally.  There was some suggestion in the Dáil debates that there was overlapping in these areas and, perhaps, overspending in promotion.  As far as I know, with one exception no tourist area has tried to get involved in the overseas market. I think there was one case of this some years ago but it has not occurred since.</P>
    <P>The policy of the eight regions is not to get involved in overseas promotions other than through groups and organisations here by way of introducing market material if a private association or its members are going abroad, when they are supplied with material. That is what is being done in Dublin, and it is similar in other parts of the country.  Nor as far as I know have any regions sent any of their people abroad as far as I understand it.  Certainly, in the past six years that I have been connected with Dublin tourism the director or the chairman has not been sent anywhere at tourist expense. The tourist manager for Dublin was sent abroad once by my committee to examine and report on what is known as the <i>son et lumiere</i> system of providing a tourist attraction and his report was a useful one which has been circulated to some Government Departments <Col N="1485" /> and may result in some useful ideas here.  On another occasion we sent a conference executive who deals with international conferences here abroad to The Hague, but he went for nothing.  It was a free trip, and the Dutch people looked after him for a couple of days, and he was able to bring back a very good report to us.</P>
    <P>There is some data in relation to regional tourism which Senators may find interesting.  Regional tourism is supported by Bord Fáilte, by the local authorities, and by national and local business interests who give subscriptions. The total amount being subscribed six years ago by local authorities was something in the region of a little over £20,000 over the Twenty-six Counties.  That was to the old Irish Tourist Association.  The total amount being provided by local authorities throughout the Republic today is something over £78,000 per annum.  In the case of the Dublin region, for instance, the amount being put up by Dublin Corporation to the Dublin region is now £17,500.  In the case of business subscriptions, national and local, the total amount which six years ago was about £20,000, is now £130,000 per annum. In Dublin there is a membership of approximately 450&mdash;3½ years ago there was no member&mdash;and in amounts of between £10 and £1,000 the total subscribed was £19,000.  I am giving the Senators and idea that many business people appreciate the value of tourism to the economy.  So do local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have been giving a picture of what is ment by regional tourism.  Six years ago there were tourist offices in only two centres, O'Connell Street in Dublin and Patrick Street in Cork.  Now during the summer there are more than 1,000 offices operating in various centres.  You can go into any of these offices and book a room in Dublin for 18s 6d per night upwards.  Of course if you are anxious to go into a penthouse that is your business.  For the price of a telex wire, which takes ten minutes, you can book a room in a private house or guesthouse.  That is what is needed rather than have people wandering into hotels paying far more than they wanted to and going away complaining about Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> There are many other facilities.  For instance any Member of the Seanad who wants any information can go into the offices down the street, below the Hibernian Hotel.  If he calls in there the young ladies will be very glad to give him any information he wants. One of the things Members of the House might enjoy during lunch hour is the concert of Irish music and dancing in Stephen's Green.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have been exposed to a certain amount of criticism.  Of course, every board should be criticised but I think that during the years Bord Fáilte have done an imaginative and industrious job of work.  Of course there are people in Ireland who are always ready to attack anything that is attempted but most of us are sensible enough to realise that if nothing were attempted we would stagnate.  We should therefore acknowledge that the work done by Bord Fáilte has been a great contribution to our economy. There are in the region of 160,000 people, about one-sixth of our working population, employed as a result of tourist earnings.  I do not mean they are employed in tourism.  This is very significant and some of the dedicated officials of the board are to be commended.  They have contributed towards making Ireland a tourist conscious country on the one hand and towards publicising Ireland abroad on the other.  Although we are quick to criticise, we are not always ready to acknowledge the worthwhile things that have been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister said both here and in the Dáil that he has asked for an analysis of progress in tourism.  I agree that we should analyse, criticise and examine but on the other hand I do not wish to be associated with the explosive remarks made by my colleague, the Chairman of the Eastern Region Tourist Board as published in yesterday's newspapers.  One can be over-critical, one can talk too much at times.  I should like to revert to the voluntary tourist regional boards.  It is a very good thing to have on those boards men who as directors have to travel to meetings and possibly stay overnight at their own expense.  They are doing it for the sake of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> I have read in some newspapers of efforts to discourage people from damaging visitors cars.  I am going only on what I have read in the newspapers. I condemn this sort of misguided nationalism which could bring about disemployment and emigration.  At all times we should be ready to stand up and condemn this sort of thing.  Nothing whatsoever can justify it.</P>
    <P>I agree with the idea in the Bill of holiday cottages.  Senator Kelly made an interesting contribution but I do not think he brought us anywhere in regard to the problem of the preservation of buildings.  We also want to build houses for our people and we are not in such a happy position as the United States, France and other countries who can set aside £5 million, £10 million or £20 million towards proposals of this kind.  We have very pressing problems that have got to be solved and, as was made clear here yesterday, we have the problem of inflation and the need to reduce expenditure.</P>
    <P>I wish again to pay a tribute to Bord Fáilte.  I was a member of the committee on national heritage.  They have a genuine interest in the preservation of amenities, but I do not see how, unless one were to take over people's property and treat it as public, we could preserve buildings on any kind of economic basis.  If Dublin Corporation tells somebody to preserve a building that ratepayer must pay for it.  I do not see how we could acquire powers to force people to do anything with their property other than to keep it in reasonable order.  It may be possible for the Government to set aside a reasonable amount per annum to buy buildings.  In some American cities the city authorities have bought property they wish preserved and relet it on condition that it be kept in a reasonable state.  There are some very fine buildings here in Dublin&mdash;some are public buildings&mdash;but their condition is to say the least frightening.  One would be afraid to walk along some of the corridors.  However, if the position is that we must do without 5,000 or 10,000 houses in order to preserve <Col N="1488" /> these buildings we must decide on which course we want to take.  Certainly, I would be in favour of providing houses rather than preserving buildings.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinlan when he said that the newspapers do not pay much attention to what is said in this House.  However, Senator Quinlan knows as well as I that if we behaved in this House as some people behave in the other House we would get plenty of publicity but it is my opinion that this House is at a better level than the other one.  In saying that I am not trying to be critical of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>As other speakers have done, I should like to express my appreciation of all Bord Fáilte have done and to congratulate them on what has been a fine piece of work during the 1960s for the Irish tourist industry.  I agree with the last speaker that because there is perhaps a light setback now, it is not good or constructive to be too critical of them.  Perhaps this is a trait that is peculiar to the Irish character. I should include in this tribute the excellent staff of Bord Fáilte whom I have always found to be both efficient and courteous.  Indeed, any tourist to whom I have spoken has had the highest praise for them.  I would like to commend them also on the publication of their excellent magazine, <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> which is sent to us as a gift.  This magazine is distributed on Aer Lingus flights and has many times come in for favourable comment from visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To look back on the build-up of the tourist industry within the last decade, we have examined here today how the money has been spent.  The Government have made a very big investment in the industry.  By and large this <Col N="1489" /> money has been wisely spent but most of us would agree that we may have too much accommodation of the luxury hotel type and that perhaps it would be better if we had more of the middle range accommodation.  One aspect of the operations of Bord Fáilte on which I might be critical in this regard is that somebody should ensure that hotels which are described as being Grade A, B or C are such.  Somebody might say that the grade depended on the number of bathrooms in hotels but I presume this is only one of the aspects.  I would hate to think it was the only one because sometimes hotel bathrooms are not always what one would wish them to be.  This may not be the fault of Bord Fáilte but of the management.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if the board's inspectors and inspection system were stepped up a little we would arrive at a more consistent form of grading.  The tourist industry seems to have run into some trouble this year although it may be a little early at this stage to be definitive as to what exactly the position is in 1970.  There are outside factors as well as internal ones and it is only fair that we should examine in an objective way the internal factors about which we can do something.  We must consider what we have to offer <i>vis-á-vis</i> other countries because tourism is now a highly competitive business and will be even more competitive in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>We must consider first what we have to offer.  Ours is a particularly beautiful country with a distinctive way of life especially outside the city and this relaxed way of life is a tourist attraction. We have excellent beaches.  Perhaps some of our amenities are not as developed as they should be, but it is not easy to know whether we should go on developing or endeavour to keep our amenities in their natural state.  To counteract these amenities we have high prices and an inclement climate. I do not for one moment suggest that anybody can do anything about the weather and I am not too sure whether we can do anything about high prices if we are to judge from the debate on the Finance Bill yesterday, but we must find some way of continuing the impetus of the industry.  I give full <Col N="1490" /> marks to the person who first thought of introducing the holiday village.  We should have a lot more of those but again the high price factor will militate somewhat against them.  I am glad that they are being registered under this Bill.  Package tours are also a good idea.  These are in operation on a wide scale in every European country.  We must do more to cater for family holidays. In this sphare we are very much in the high price bracket.  For the average family of a husband, wife and four or five children, the cost of staying at an Irish hotel is prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The idea of a farmhouse holiday has met this need to some extent but of course not everybody wishes to spend his holiday on a farm.  People may have other tastes.  We must consider also the provision of more camping and caravan sites.  Camping sites are only a recent addition to Irish accommodation but they are very worthwhile. They are ideal for those who enjoy an outdoor holiday.  I must mention also An Óige who have done tremendous work in this field.  I should like to see more help being given to them by Bord Fáilte so that they might establish more hostels abroad.</P>
    <P>Another area of tourism we have not developed but which I am personally convinced there is a great market for in England is our waterways. Coming from the town of Athlone the Minister must be well aware of the tourist potential in our waterways.  We are very much aware that motoring in Britain is becoming almost a nightmare and the lakes and canals are also getting very overcrowded.</P>
    <P>We must examine whether we are directing our publicity at the right markets.  We are geared very much to the British market and here we are faced with a great deal of competition, especially since the £50 travel limit was removed, from countries like France, Italy, Spain and many Eastern European countries who have entered the market at very competitive rates.  We have also geared ourselves to the American market, especially the Irish-American market, but we shall have to get into Europe and attract French, Spanish and Italian tourists to spend <Col N="1491" /> their holidays here.  By encouraging student tourists to spend a holiday here we will achieve much more than all the publicity booklets which Bord Fáilte can publish because if a student likes this country he will go home and tell all this friends about it.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the growth of the tourist industry in the &ldquo;Seventies and I should like to wish the Minister, his Department and Bord Fáilte and everyone else engaged in the industry success.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill because more money is being provided for the tourist industry.  I would have given an even heartier welcome to the Bill if the amount of money sought in it was trebled.  The general opinion is that our agricultural industry is the most important industry we have but I think agriculture should take second place to tourism.</P>
      <P>Senator Brugha mentioned the contributions made by local authorities to this industry.  I think we should make a comparison between the contributions made by local authorities and the State to both tourism and agriculture. Local authorities have a maximum limit of 1d in the £ when contributing to the tourist industry and a maximum limit of 2s in the £ when contributing to agriculture.  This year the Government are spending almost £100 million on agriculture and while I am not certain of the return I understand it is in the region of £200 million.  On the other hand the Government are spending £5 million on tourism for a return of £100 million.  We are investing 10s in the £ in agriculture and 1s in the £ in tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to read the suggestion made by the Fine Gael Party a few weeks ago calling for a Minister of Tourism.  This is not an original proposal. On 28th March, 1963, when speaking on this subject in this House <Col N="1492" /> at column 609 of the Official Report, I said:</P>
    <P>I hope that the day is not too far distant when it will become necessary to establish a special Department of tourism, with a special Minister, and statutory bodies in the tourist counties to provide the advisory services which are so necessary today.</P>
    <P>While the Government and the Taoiseach have said it is not proposed to establish such a Department I hope some day it will become necessary. Every Minister makes an impact in one direction or another on his Department. The Minister with us today is responsible for a large number of sections and even with his enthusiasm and initiative he cannot possibly make an impact on every section of his Department. I believe tourism is so important that it should be the direct interest of the Minister.  In saying that I am not by any means criticising Bord Fáilte. They have done tremendous work with the limited money at their disposal.</P>
    <P>When the Minister seeks extra money from the Government for Transport and Power, Aer Lingus and CIE&mdash;he finds it very difficult to persuade his colleagues to give him the money he wants.  I should like to see statutory bodies in charge of tourism instead of the regional bodies as we all know them, set up on the western seaboard. Those regional bodies are voluntary organisations and the members of them have to leave their businesses for possibly two days at a time but they are not given any money for travel or other expenses.  The only contribution the local authority can make is equivalent to 1d in the £.  While the Minister has said that this will be increased I think it should be on a par with that paid to members of agricultural committees. The western seaboard, particularly Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Mayo, Parts of Galway, Clare and even Kerry, are still in need of tremendous development. We must realise that in many of these areas industrial development will never succeed.</P>
    <P>The only hope for the west of Ireland is to have bigger investment in the tourist industry.  Much more money <Col N="1493" /> should be provided and it need not necessarily be spent on the erection of hotels and holiday villages.  The money could be spent by way of tourist investment. I was a director of the North-Western Region Tourism Organisation. When we were discussing the advertising programme for the three counties one year we were talking about spending £7,000 in England and Scotland advertising Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal. I am satisfied that there are many small industries in this country who spend more than £7,000 in any one year on advertising but in three counties which are completely underdeveloped touristwise the figure made available by Bord Fáilte was £7,000.  I cannot speak for Sligo and Leitrim but I can speak for Donegal.  It can be said that on the warmest day in summer one could pick a dozen beaches in that county, with miles of golden sands, and find them deserted or almost deserted.  The reason for this is that the county is completely underdeveloped.</P>
    <P>If enough money were provided in tourist areas the provision of water and sewerage facilities could be proceeded with.  The provision of these facilities should be the responsibility of the tourist organisations.  I feel that until these very necessary facilities are provided tourism cannot develop as it should.  We have, in Donegal County Council, priority lists of water and sewerage schemes.  If the work were carried out in one year this would cost £5 million.  We receive £250,000 from the Department of Local Government per year.  So, at present day prices, it will take 20 years to complete this programme.  Only when the programme is completed can proper tourist development really begin.  I am certain that a similar situation obtains right down the western seaboard as far as Kerry. At present prices it will take 20 years to provide facilities necessary for the proper development of tourism.  Prices will rise as the years go on and it may take 30 years to complete the work. Much more money must be made available for these facilities in tourist counties if we are to tackle the tourist industry properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give this matter consideration.  One cannot build a holiday <Col N="1494" /> village beside a six-mile beach unless there is a piped water supply in the locality.  A study of the western seaboard will show that there are many possibilities if only these very necessary water and sewerage facilities were made available.  We are living a short distance from a great tourist market in England and Scotland where there are 50 million people.  Scottish visitors should be able to come here.  They should be attracted to this country. Facilities which were available in the past are no longer available.  At one time boats took thousands of people from Scotland to Donegal, Derry and Sligo.  The tourist industry is so important that the country should pay subsidies in order to enable more people to travel to Ireland by boat.  A reply was given in the Dáil to a question, stating that it would be uneconomic to provide such a boat.  The service itself might not be economic but it would be of benefit to the national Exchequer if more people had facilities to travel to Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the regional tourism organisation which I wish to criticise.  There is a tendency among large hotel groups to invite the girls working in the tourist information offices to one of their hotels, bring them together for a week-end at the expense of the hotel, and to wine them and dine them, with the obvious view of persuading them to send as many people as possible to that hotel chain. I myself witnessed this in a hotel, and I think that it is a practice that Bord Fáilte should take steps to discourage and that the regional tourist organisations should prohibit, because here we have a hotel group who feel that money talks and who believe that with the money that they have at their disposal they can bribe and intimidate the staffs of the regional tourism organisations to encourage visitors to go to their hotels, and that smaller hotels who are not in a position to do this will naturally suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister tell Senator Brugha that he has given an assurance in the Dáil that the grants payable to hotels would be published. Not alone is this a protection for the taxpayer who provides the money but <Col N="1495" /> in many cases it is a protection for the hotelier himself.  Very few people realise that the grant payable to these hotels is something in the region of one-third of the entire cost of the hotel. All of us have been told many times about the hotels in Ireland who have their hotels provided free of charge by Bord Fáilte.  But this is also a protection for people who are not getting grants at all.  In my own position in the business that I have it has been suggested to me on many occasions that I received from Bord Fáilte substantial grants.  Some people, generally political opponents, of course, would like to suggest that because a person is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party he can get grants that other people do not get, and it so happens that in the nature of my business I do not qualify for any grants, that I did not seek any grants from Bord Fáilte, nor have I received them, yet no later than a few days ago I received an anonymous letter telling me about all the money Bord Fáilte have given me.  I am only one of many who are in this position. I think that if the Minister were to publish these grants he is not alone protecting himself, protecting Bord Fáilte, protecting the people who pay the grants, protecting the people who get the grants but, more important, protecting the people who do not qualify for grants and who did not get them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like sincerely to join in the tributes paid to Bord Fáilte for the work it has done ever since it was established.  It has contributed in a very large way to the growth of the tourist industry in this country.  Members of the Oireachtas and the public generally are grateful to the members of the board for their efforts and for the success that has attended their efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want to refer briefly to a few points on which I would be glad to hear the Minister when he replies to the debate.  On page 9 of the Minister's statement he has said that he had consultations with Bord Fáilte on 8th July and with the Hotels Federation on 10th July, and I gather these consultations were held with a <Col N="1496" /> view to further improving the tourist development of the country in the years immediately ahead.  He proposes to assess what are the causes of the decline that appears to have taken place during the current year.  To my way of thinking some at least of the causes that contributed to the lack of growth and the actual decline of tourism this year are the removal of the £50 ban on travel from Britain, and whether we like to say it or not we must agree that excessive costs in some hotels are another contributory factor.  The recession in the United States may be another one, and the trouble in Northern Ireland is undoubtedly another one.  Most, if not all, of these could have been foreseen by the Minister or Bord Fáilte 12 months ago, and the conferences the Minister held in July this year should have been held in the autumn of last year, and perhaps instead of making a rather belated effort to get things going better in the remaining months of the tourist season this year, that effort should have been made late last year or very early this year and so have avoided the stagnation or decline that set in for the reasons I have given.  Perhaps the Minister has a valid answer to that argument, and I look forward to hearing it when he comes to the end of the debate.</P>
    <P>Another specific matter I would like to raise would be for the purpose of getting information regarding the Minister's statement about funds being provided for the development of holiday accommodation.  He said that Bord Fáilte operate a scheme of grants with the approval of the Ministers for Transport and Power and Finance.  The scheme provides for the payment of up to 35 per cent of the total construction costs of new hotels in the western counties and up to 25 per cent in other areas.  I should like to know if counties Cavan and Monaghan are included in the western counties for this purpose. In other spheres they are included but I am not quite sure whether they are included in the western counties in this regard.  I take it that Donegal, a western seaboard area, is counted in.</P>
    <P>I am greatly in favour of the development of the guesthouse type of accommodation. Perhaps we have reached <Col N="1497" /> saturation point with regard to the luxury hotel.  The guesthouse type of accommodation will provide simple and wholesome fare, clean accommodation and will attract a big number of visitors especially the type who come to the areas that I represent in Cavan, Leitrim and the Midland Tourist Region.  Greater development of the guesthouse type of accommodation is important, and I welcome it very warmly and hope that it continues.</P>
    <P>Cavan is one of the counties in the midland region to which I have referred and there we have complaints about lack of co-operation between the county and the Midland Regional Council.  I was present at a meeting of the Cavan County Council when a representative of the Midland Regional Council attended to ask the council for a contribution.  I do not wish to be unfair to the gentleman, but neither I nor any other member has seen him since. Co-operation between the regional council and the counties participating is not as close or as effective as it should be.  I agree with Senator McGlinchey that local authority contributions should be bigger but I see no hope of this unless there is closer liaison between the counties concerned and the regional board.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into great detail in the matter of local endeavour but I should like to refer to the great amount of development work that has been done at Lough Sheelin.  Some time ago there was a plan for a seven-year development of that lake and district.  We got off the ground with a contribution of £4,000 in the first year.  It dwindled to £2,000 the following year and since then the contribution has been very little.</P>
    <P>At Belturbet, on the banks of the Erne, a big local effort got under way; the local contribution was paid; the contract for the development work was arranged, but when the former secretary of Cavan County Council, a man who took a lifelong interest in tourism, went to check up he was told the work was being left over.  There may have been a good reason for that; there may have been lack of finance at headquarters; but when a small town makes <Col N="1498" /> a big effort and raises £700 to get the work started, it is most frustrating that nothing is being done.</P>
    <P>This, again, indicates the necessity for closer co-operation between local communities and regional boards. There has been a sincere local desire to have Lough Oughter, again on the Erne, developed but no progress has been recorded.  I hope some positive steps will be taken soon to develop that district which has wonderful potential, perhaps the greatest of any inland area in the country.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the development of the River Erne, through Cavan and Fermanagh to South Donegal, calls for immediate attention.  It is an area in respect of which we might hope for co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities.  It is the lake district of this country, especially that part in Cavan and Fermanagh and to a degree in Monaghan and Leitrim.  There are numerous lakes on the Erne all of which have great potential for development. I hope the Minister will use his good offices to see that some worthwhile work is undertaken there.</P>
    <P>Not least among the great achievements of Bord Fáilte is the Tidy Towns competition.  Speaking as a Cavan man I am proud to say that two towns in the county, Ballyjamesduff and Virginia, have won the overall competition and that the county won the trophy as the tidiest county in the first year of the competition.  Bord Fáilte should be given great credit for that.  They demonstrated how magnificently local effort can produce results without all the time depending solely on the Government for help.  This has shown the effect of local leadership when it gets encouragement from outside.</P>
    <P>It was local leadership that played such a great part in developing the two towns I have mentioned, and Ballyconnell and others.  The people of those towns have given a good example to the country of the achievement of local leadership.  One of the greatest achievements of Bord Fáilte has been their effort to show that local people have the ability and the desire to get on with the job without help or guidance from the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> In his statement the Minister drew attention to the rent-a-cottage scheme which has been developed in the Shannon area in County Clare and which will be extended to other parts of the west.  I commend that type of undertaking which I am sure will have beneficial effects on the economy in the future.  It is a good idea not to concentrate all our efforts on luxury hotels which attract only the millionaires and the Indian princes, of whom there are so few.  Most people who come here are of Irish extraction. Many of these people come to stay among relatives.  In this regard the Minister and his Department should endeavour to ensure that amenities such as rural electrification, water and sewerage facilities are provided in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Many people such as factory workers from the north of England come here also.  In the main, these people spend most of their time along the banks of our lakes and rivers and they usually seek relatively cheap accommodation. They like simple fare.  These are the type of people who stop in guesthouses. There is great potential for development of this type of tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much that I should like to say on this important Bill but in view of the limitation as to time I shall not detain the House.  Perhaps my plea could be described as a local one.  It is to ask the Minister to use his good office and his influence with Bord Fáilte in an effort to develop what can be regarded as one of the finest tourist attractions in Ireland.  I refer to the Hill of Tara which is within a 20 mile distance of our capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that approximately 20,000 people visit Tara each year. They come in organised groups and individually but I regret to say that there are no facilities such as shelters or toilets on the Hill of Tara.  While I am aware that there are certain difficulties, perhaps the Minister could help. Meath County Council are anxious to play their part in the provision of facilities on Tara but we are inhibited from doing so to some extent because <Col N="1500" /> of difficulty between the Office of Public Works and the owner of land which the board are anxious to acquire. However, I am sure this is not an insurmountable difficulty and I would ask that the Office of Public Works would make every effort to acquire that land and I would ask the Minister to use his good offices in endeavouring to bring about a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>My second plea is in relation to Saint John's Castle.  There have been promises to the effect that this would be developed as a Bunratty style castle but no provision has been made in the Budget for such development.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that money for this purpose would be provided in the next Budget so that the Office of Public Works and Bord Fáilte could go ahead with the development of this beautiful castle in Trim.  Trim is a historical area.  The area is very interesting from an archaeological point of view.  It could be one of the finest tourist areas in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FarrellMcElgunn" hpid="Mr. McElgunn Mr. McElgunn">

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focail a rá ar an mBille seo.  Is léir dom, mar is léir do gach Seanadóir, chó tábhachtach is atá an déantús so don náisún.  Ba cheart go gcabhródh gach uile dhuine leis an déantús a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
      <P>The benefits of the tourist industry to the Irish economy are now recognised by all not only in relation to our balance of payments but in the increasing circulation of money especially in areas which have had no great industrial expansion.  These benefits accrue in some way or other to all sections of the community and the time has long passed when we had to convince the public of the value of investment in tourism.  It is obvious from this Bill that there is great need at present for stepping up the rate of investment.</P>
      <P>When mention is made of Bord Fáilte spending money one thinks only in terms of grants towards the building of hotels and the other activities of the board are often forgotten.  In the Dáil recently many questions were asked in connection with these grants to hotels but how often do we have inquiries in regard to the other activities of the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> In my own area of south-Leitrim&mdash; north-Roscommon, much has been done by Bord Fáilte in developing the River Shannon for boating.  We welcome this and we hope it will continue so that the great potential of the Shannon and the other inland waterways will be generated.</P>
    <P>Another activity of Bord Fáilte that merits commendation is their help towards angling tourism.  This activity is particularly welcome and we must commend the provision of facilities and amenities for anglers.  These are of tremendous benefit.  With the increasing pollution of rivers and lakes in Great Britain and on the Continent our fishing waters are becoming more and more valuable.  The purchase of rights of way to angling waters is a vital necessity if we are to be able to offer free fishing in the future.  This has been going on in my area with the co-operation of Bord Fáilte and the local angling clubs and it is something that I would strongly recommend should be extended throughout the country.  If this is not done we will find that within a few years access to these waters will be impossible.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about recreational facilities for visitors.  It is my sincere hope that in spite of calls for investment elsewhere, these facilities will be expanded and that swimming pools and other amenities will be provided. These are especially needed in areas of angling tourism because an angler's family may not wish to spend the day with him while he is fishing and will seek some other form of activity.</P>
    <P>Another side of this is the provision of entertainment for visitors.  This need is met partly by the various festivals which are organised throughout the country and for which grants are given from the local regional tourism organisations. However, these usually run for about a week or a fortnight so that the rest of the time is blank.  I was very impressed recently by the efforts of <i>Fáilte Dhublainn</i> in their concerts at St. Stephen's Green.  These are worthy of the highest commendation and they give a very good picture of our Irish culture, to use that often misused word.  I would recommend that this idea be adopted in other areas. <Col N="1502" /> There should not be any great difficulty in organising them.  With the expenditure of a small sum of money, step dancing, music and so on could be provided on a regular basis in towns and villages.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to call for panic measures to deal with the difficulties which the tourist industry is experiencing at the present time but experience has proved that panic measures cause more panic.  I am only a layman about such things but there is confusion in many people's minds between advertising and marketing.  This occurred to me when I was looking at the report of Córas Tráchtála yesterday.  It is becoming more and more clear that all businesses whether they be hotels, guesthouses or boat-hiring firms, must go out and sell their wares, so to speak, during the winter.  I know that a particular boat-hiring firm in my own locality who advertised its facilities last winter is doing well in spite of all the talk we hear about adverse factors affecting our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the rent-a-cottage scheme.  I would like the scheme extended to all rural areas.  I can see the benefits which tourism has brought in my own area.  I want to congratulate the Irish Countrywomen's Association on their co-operation in the farmhouse holidays scheme.</P>
    <P>I would refer to the desirability of Irish people spending their holiday at home this year.  Does anyone claim to have seen every part of the Thirty-two Counties?  &ldquo;Snobbery&rdquo; was a word that was bandied about this House yesterday in another context and perhaps &ldquo;snobbery&rdquo; is too strong a word to use here, but many people go to the Continent just so that they can boast about it.  I think the motto this year should be: &ldquo;See Ireland first&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally agreed that tourism is one of the most competitive businesses.  One of the most important aspects of tourism in regard to our economy is that it has multiple effects.  The direct revenue resulting from what tourists spend in the country does not represent the real benefit of the tourist business.  Tourism generates employment and an extra amount of spending indulged in by employees <Col N="1503" /> connected with the industry.  It also generates increased revenue in all the trades ancillary to the tourist industry itself.  For these reasons the tourist industry is a particularly successful one.</P>
      <P>The remarkable drop in tourist earnings has affected all sections of the economy.  It is for this reason we see the obvious concern of Members on all sides of the House.  I do not think any Member of the House would be able to single out one main reason for the fall in our tourist trade.  It is fair to suggest as many people have done that it can be attributed to the fantastic rise in prices.  It might also be attributed to the political explosions on either side of the Border.  To my mind nobody is able to say: &ldquo;That is the reason why business has dropped this year&rdquo;.  We simply cannot put a finger on the cause. It is fair to say that the unsettled state of affairs in a different part of the country has produced some strange reactions. When I was on the Continent recently I met some American tourists. I would be loth to place on the record of this House their version of the political events on either side of the Border here.  Suffice it to say they were totally convinced that the whole of this country was engaged in a bloody civil and religious war.  That is how distorted the press reports of the situation here had become by the time they percolated down to some little state of the United States.  These people were convinced that march and counter-march were proceeding in this country.  There must be more people in the United States who have this completely mistaken impression about what is happening here.  It is a public relations matter. Bord Fáilte should endeavour to correct this impression quickly.</P>

      <P>Section 12 of the Bill made it a criminal offence for persons to enter a local authority house without their being the legal tenants of that house.  The amendment which I brought in in the Seanad excluded persons who would normally be resident in the house from the provisions of that section.  It was felt by some persons that situations could arise where people would have taken up legal <Col N="1506" /> occupation and would be visited by persons who could be deemed to be committing a criminal offence through their entry into this house.  I did not accept at the time that such a prosecution would ever be brought forward. I have agreed to this further amendment for the purpose of tightening up the section and thereby excluding the possibility of any person paying a visit to the house and making entry for the purpose of trade or profession being considered to commit a criminal offence.  Cases were quoted in the Dáil of a Deputy making a visit, the milkman calling or even somebody coming after his straying cat.  I have agreed to the tightening up as was suggested by Senator Alexis FitzGerald and by Deputy Garret FitzGerald in the Dáil.  A situation could arise where there were two people in the house, one being the tenant and father and the other occupant his son. If the father died the tenancy of the house would die with him.  The son could then be deemed to be in occupation of the house.  My section excluded a person because of his being normally resident in the house.  It would not be a criminal offence to remain in the house even though he was not the legal local authority tenant at the time.  There are ways of having such a person evicted.  Situations were suggested where a daughter could have come home to attend the funeral of her father and have been invited to stay in the house by her brother and thereby she could become a person who is committing a criminal offence against the local authority.  This might never have arisen.  There might never have been a prosecution.  We are agreeing to the amendment.  It is as water tight as my legal advisers can make it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was referring to the fact that there is tremendous ignorance on the part of United States and other visitors of affairs in this country and I was suggesting that there is a special need for some Government agency, whether Bord Fáilte or some other organisation, to conduct a tactful campaign, apart from their promotional activities, to bring home to people in other countries the fact that in 90 per cent of the area of Ireland there is peace and that visitors are not in any danger when they come here.  A large proportion of the Americans I have met do not seem to realise this.</P>
      <P>In relation to our tourist situation this year, it is obvious at this stage that the targets set will not be reached. There was some indication of this even last year because the target set by the Third Programme for 1969 was not achieved.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to an article in an <i>Irish Independent</i> supplement for 10th March last:</P>
      <P>At this time we are on the Third Programme for Economic Expansion which has an annual target&mdash;in terms of 1968 money&mdash;of a 6 per cent increase: 1969 was below that level and a 9 per cent per annum increase is necessary to achieve the 1972 target.</P>
      <P>Fairly obviously, there will not be a 9 per cent increase this year&mdash;all the indications are to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, to come anywhere near the ideals of the Third Programme there is great need for re-assessment of tourist strategy in this most delicate of seasons.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, some of the figures I have being from sources engaged in the tourist industry, which may not be so accurate, but I understand that the growth rate dropped last year in a manner which was considered by many people in the trade to be significant. In this respect it is interesting to study the actual revenue figures produced in the Bord Fáilte report.  Bord Fáilte have the admirable distinction among State bodies of reconciling the annual earnings to a constant figure.  It is a pity other semi-State bodies do not do <Col N="1508" /> it.  Taking 1953 as a base year, the revenue then was shown at £28.4 million. Three years later, the figure was £57.1 million, or, in constant figures £45 million.  Last year the figure was £93 million, the constant figure being £57.58 million.  That figure is nearly exactly twice the 1953 figure.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we can say that our direct earnings from tourism doubled over that 15-year period.  It is no harm to study the figures in the Minister's statement. In 1960, Bord Fáilte were allocated £500,000 and they produced earnings for that of £44.2 million.  In 1970 Bord Fáilte will be allocated £5½ million, in other words 11 times what they were given ten years ago. Obviously, if we take £93 million as the earnings for 1969&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  Make it £100 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it would be two and one-fifth times the earnings for 1950.  We have increased the allocation to the tourist board by 11 times and have built up the earnings from tourism by, let us say, 2½ times. Obviously there had to be a fall in the amount of money put into development and promotional programmes but may I suggest to the House and the Minister that there is significance in the fact that Bord Fáilte are getting 11 times what they got and are producing only 2½ times the revenue they produced ten years ago?  The point is so obvious that I will not go into it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the immediate post-war period, many tourists came to our country without our having to use any promotional drive.  Somebody in Britain described our country then as a land flowing with milk and honey. Following the post-war period it would have been natural to expect a much greater increase during the 1950s and 1960s.  The arguments has been made&mdash; I do not know with how much validity &mdash;that figures in relation to tourist revenue show that the revenue derived from emigrants returning for holidays is less than it should be.  However, the increase in tourism and the spending of money by emigrants returning for holidays would have occurred anyway <Col N="1509" /> without any promotion drive.  Therefore, it would appear that the board has not been as great a success as it might have been.  This concern is shared by many people in the industry so it might be as well if the Minister would give the House his views on these points.</P>
    <P>From talking to people in the industry I am aware there were many indicators last year as the tourist season progressed that many difficulties were being experienced and many people engaged in the industry reckoned that they were in for a rough year in 1970. We must remember that those indicators were apparent before the real disturbances in the six north-eastern counties last year.  These people realised that special promotional work was needed then to offset these difficulties. From the grant in aid given to Bord Fáilte for the current year one would have thought they would have spent at least as much money in promotional and marketing work this year as hitherto.  However, instead of that, Bord Fáilte decided to spend £130,000 less in this way this year than they had spent previously.  I must emphasise that this was a decision of the board and not of the Minister.  Taking this in conjunction with the difficulties in the business that were self-evident last year it would seem an amazing decision on the part of the board.  Obviously the Minister is aware of this also and perhaps when he is replying he will enlighten the House as to the reason for the decision.  I know there is more of an answer to be given than the simple one of there being an increased allocation of money to the resort development fund.</P>
    <P>Some of the contributions to this debate had a parochial ring about them.  I do not believe this is the best way of talking about the tourist industry which is a national one.  There is the belief among those engaged in the tourist business in the eastern part of the country that Bord Fáilte overemphasise the western counties and, in particular, the counties along the western seaboard.  I can see heads shaking but the fact remains that people in the eastern area share this belief.  In this regard it is interesting to remember <Col N="1510" /> that the eight regional tourist boards were given an annual subvention of £30,000 each but apart from that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister said in his opening speech that tourism should be used as an instrument of economic and social development in rural areas. I agree with this.  He went on to say particularly the western counties.  I cannot subscribe quite as fully to that part of his statement as I can to the first part of his statement.  It is only proper to have a balanced tourist industry. In order to give it a chance of succeeding in a continuously competitive world market we should develop the industry all over the country.  The natural amenities which exist in the country should also be developed but a large concentration on one particular area should not be embarked upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time Bord Fáilte is the parent body of eight regional boards operating the resort development fund.  Whatever development is to be carried out in any holiday resort is carried out by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with the local authority concerned. The eight regional tourist boards, which, I think, are set up under the aegis of Bord Fáilte, work autonomously. Obviously these regional boards would have a greater day-to-day knowledge of the resorts in their area. I suggest consideration should be given to the idea of allowing regional tourist boards to administer the resort development fund.  This would enable them to work out development schemes in the various resorts in their own <Col N="1513" /> area.  Because of their local knowledge and local interest they would obviously get much more co-operation.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister outlined very fully the amount of money which Bord Fáilte has given by way of hotel grants over the past few years, and the amount of money given by way of guaranteed loan interest for hotel development.  It is no harm to realise that over the past ten years private investment in hotels has been in the region of £33 million.  This figure has been increasing by an amount in the region of £3 million. per annum.  Obviously this contribution is not coming from the board.  A very substantial amount of capital has been invested by private enterprise, some from this country and some from abroad.  The number of hotels operated by foreign interests is of the order of 70.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty-five is a small number but this small number contains some of the largest hotels in the country. Only 35 per cent of the people arriving at all ports of entry seek hotel bed-night accommodation.  I do not know the comparative figures for other countries but 35 per cent seeking hotel bed-night accommodation is a relatively low figure.  I understand this figure decreased last year.  This is not guesthouse accommodation but hotel bed-nights.  They were down by 3 per cent.  The argument was that the bednights in the Dublin hotels were hardly down at all.  They were engaged in all-the-year-round trade.  That represents a sizeable percentage drop in the bednight occupancy of the hotels outside Dublin.  More people came into the country but they stayed in guesthouses or with friends or brought caravans. Why did they do this?  Senator Honan gave us the answer when he pointed out that Bord Fáilte had induced hotels to modernise their premises.  That is very acceptable.  Bord Fáilte by their increased concentration on getting the US visitors to come had discovered that these visitors did not consider our hotels acceptable.  Bord Fáilte went a step ahead and got hotels to provide <Col N="1514" /> luxurious bedrooms accommodation, including rooms with private baths and luxury fittings.  They left the hotels with no option but to increase their prices in order to cover capital outlay and increased running costs.  The great majority of tourists still come from Great Britain.  They are not interested in staying in luxurious accommodation. They will not accept the prices charged for such accommodation.  They stay in guesthouses or bring their own caravans. I do not object to caravans.  I would imagine that tourists coming here and staying in caravans are probably the least productive of all tourists. They purchase their food and live in the country but there is no income from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the bed-occupancy factor, that worked out at 40 per cent here last year as compared with 50 per cent in Britain. Hotels in Britain are different.  They operate on a year-round basis.  A large percentage of hotels here rely on tourist traffic in the summer.  Efforts are being made to build up special off-season <Col N="1515" /> promotions and attractive prices are being offered.  We rely on the high-season traffic, and on traffic each side of that season.  This is a sensitive area and we should attempt to spread the load all over the year.</P>
      <P>Tourism is part of our exports.  There are many concessions in the tax field for exporters by way of remissions in income tax and by way of wholesale and turnover taxes not applying.  Senators will know the special concessions which exporters get.  No concessions are available to those engaged in the tourist industry.  All the very heavy taxation burden which is being borne by people selling internally here is expected from the operators in the tourist trade also, although they are producing revenue which is actually exports earnings.  They are not receiving equivalent help to the help being given to people who materially exports goods.</P>
      <P>Rather than have a complete reliance on the grant system, it should be possible to devise a scheme whereby incentives would be given to tourist promoters to bring in so many visitors and if they brought in such visitors for a given length of time a <i>per capita</i> figure should be given to them.  Most people would be prepared to pay the price.  Those three concessions, while laudable and commendable, are highly unlikely.  The tourist operatives are not getting the tax concessions the exporter is getting and there should be an incentive scheme which would help to compensate them for that loss.</P>

      <P>One of the difficulties there might be in that regard would be the matter presumably of a special air travel rate having to be devised and there might be difficulty over that with IATA.  Perhaps the Minister will touch on that in his reply also?  The Minister mentioned that Bord Fáilte and the Hotels Federation had agreed that it was not realistic in their marketing campaign to expect other than a drop in their potential earnings as compared with last year.  That <Col N="1516" /> would be generally accepted particularly for the last month or two, but on the other hand also I think it would be generally accepted that the need exists now for a special look to be taken at the 1971 marketing campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We may have been very wrong to have Bord Fáilte drop their marketing allocation this year to £130,000 and instead of trying to bring back their marketing allocation to that figure next year it may be necessary to bring it back much more, and this should be taken up at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed at the totally false picture that I found existed in the minds of many foreigners about the state of this country.  There is also a feeling that the money now spent in selling to the American market is growing, and I think that the Bord Fáilte projection on the American market is growing faster than the expenditure on the British market.  The United States is a very large country and Ireland is a very small one, and any marketing allocation from a very small country spread across a very large country will have very little national impact.  We are a small fish in a very big sea.  But in relation to the British market we have in close proximity to us a country which is thickly populated, in which there are many people with Irish connections, and throughout which it is relatively easy to advertise and promote on a national basis.  There is also the reduced costs for lifting the tourists from Britain and placing them in Ireland, which is what the whole job is about. The suggestion is that even though there is a potential in the United States market it is a dreadfully expensive market to develop and to service when the tourists come here, because they expect the standard of a continent in a small country, whereas the British market is one that is in close proximity to us, is one with which we have many ties and which will not be more expensive to service than our native market because they will expect about the same standard as we would of goods and services.  Because of this there should not be any falling off in the <Col N="1517" /> push to develop the British market. They are the nearest people to us, with most sea ports and most air lifts to Ireland, and again with ties of family connections not going back to the father who was a Fenian link which still continues in the United States.</P>
    <P>Might I just mention in regard to some changes which the Minister mentioned that Bord Fáilte have set out to bring about in regard to grants for hotel development?  The point was made to me recently&mdash;I am not advocating very large grants to foreign offices on a large scale&mdash;that apparently some Irish Embassies abroad are carrying Bord Fáilte literature which gives quite a false picture of the marketing system because of the fact that some of the literature which reached the Embassies and Consulates about the Bord Fáilte grants carried information of approximately the year before.  It would be important that this information would be up to date because of potential investors who would want to build hotels here, and sufficient promotional literature should be available in every office in every continental and foreign country which has connections with this country.  I suggest that while Bord Fáilte may feel very happy with their display of promotional literature this is not the whole picture.  It is a fact, as I have very good reason to know, that in their offices in large cities on the continent Bord Fáilte literature is difficult to obtain, and in one case which I came across they had one piece of literature and the only reason that they had it was that the Aer Lingus office had left to the Irish Consulate a dozen or so leaflets which they had.  These consulates are often anxious to see tourist traffic to Ireland develop and would be only too pleased to distribute literature but in one office which I was in quite recently there was considerable difficulty in getting literature from the board.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator who referred to the training of staff.  Again this is a problem that we have.  So many of our hotels have to concentrate on the seasonal tourist business that they cannot provide all-the-year-round employment. <Col N="1518" /> Also because of this as each season begins they commence with a relatively new and untrained staff.  This presents headaches for the hotels at the commencement of each tourist season.  Any training done by CERT or any such organisation is urgently needed in this field, and I would urge the Minister to encourage this as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Might I just mention a personal crib?  I feel that we in Ireland, when we cotton on to something, are inclined to go overboard about it, and I suggest to the Minister that we are gone absolutely overboard in thinking of festivals. Every little village and crossroads in the country has now at least a national festival, and some of the bigger crossroads are venturing into the international field.  There comes a stage when everybody becomes terribly tired of festivals and comes to the conclusion and the realisation that a festival does not consist very often of much more than extended licensing laws in the publichouses and hotels in the nearest town.  There ought to be an attempt on the part of the board to control this type of promotion so that the festivals that are run are real festivals and worth being promoted and worth visiting.</P>
    <P>I agree very much with Senator Honan when he suggested that during the seasons when Irish hotels were enjoying a good business the Irish customer generally was not as welcome as his foreign counterpart.  Let us face the reality that it is very difficult indeed to ask Irish people to be patriotic enough to fill Irish hotels when they know that those hotels last year and the year before were not interested in having them, and in many cases even at the present time the Irish people cannot get there approximately as cheap a holiday as in some continental countries.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would answer two questions?  If the present set of directors of Bord Fáilte are running into difficulties will the addition of two more really change the situation?  The other question is this&mdash;the rent-a-cottage scheme is a very good one, but perhaps the Minister would give to the House the approximate weekly or <Col N="1519" /> monthly rental charges per person or family?  This would be of interest especially when we are talking about prices.</P>
    <P>In general I think that it would be accepted that the board has over the years done quite a remarkable job in boosting Ireland in the international tourist field.  However, I feel that at this stage there is need for the Oireachtas, the Minister and his Department, together with Bord Fáilte, to review the whole grant system and to concentrate on grants as between resorts, hotels and promotional work and then to assess what is the most effective way of continuing the upward trend in tourism.  It is perhaps fair to say that the standards of the system in the 1960's may turn out to be outmoded in the '70's, and that the time is ripe to have not just a stop-gap situation to try to shore up the breaches that are showing up this year. The thing to do would be to have a complete overhaul of Bord Fáilte's tourist promotion work and of the industry in general.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that this country has something to offer to foreign tourists and I hope we will continue to offer it successfully and at prices which do not move in the way they have done during the past 18 months.  We need a modernised approach by Bord Fáilte.  If this Bill will help Bord Fáilte to do that it will be doing a good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make only three or four points in as many minutes.  As a director of the Midland Tourist Board, I consider the most important point to be that of financing. It has been said here already that the investment campaign during the past few years in tourist regional organisations has been a complete failure. Throughout the eight regions not more than £80,000 was collected and invested. If the Minister is tied to such a system of financing he should allow the tourist organisations investing in this development to claim tax free allowances on the amounts invested. This would be a small but nevertheless important incentive and it would be far preferable if the Government would <Col N="1520" /> allocate to Bord Fáilte £100,000 extra for allocation in the eight regions.</P>
      <P>We are told the tourist industry is worth £100 million a year.  Yet to service the work of Bord Fáilte last year only £2.8 million was allocated. This figure can be and should be increased. Some people and some boards have said that county councils should be empowered to give more than the proceeds of 1d in the £.  I do not agree because the people who pay the rates have been bled white already and a further burden should not be placed on them.</P>
      <P>Senator McGlinchey said that the Fine Gael Party had advocated the appointment of a Minister for Tourism. In order to straighten the record, I should like to point out that two Fine Gael Deputies made that suggestion and that this cannot be attributed to the party.  As a farmer, I listened with interest to the Senators who spoke of unreasonably high prices for produce. They have only to go to their own restaurant to see the extra being charged for mock cream.  This is deplorable in an agricultural country.  They can also notice the prices being charged for inexpensive produce such as eggs and chicken.  These dishes cost too much in proportion to the cost to the producer.</P>
      <P>I should like Bord Fáilte to co-operate with the Forestry Division to make more forest walks and drives available to the public.  This has not been exploited.  I hope that CIE, when they open their new offices in America, will not have duplication of services, that it will be possible to co-ordinate the services with those of other semi-State bodies so that we will not have in the same street in New York separate offices for Aer Lingus, Aerlínte, Bord Fáilte and CIE.  All those bodies should be able to work in close harmony because all have affinity with the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Senator McDonald's last point first.  We have got a co-ordinating committee of the various State-sponsored bodies who work in the United States.  They co-operate <Col N="1521" /> in regard to office accommodation and in regard to promotion.  This relates to Aerlínte, CIE, Coras Tráchtála, Bord Fáilte and the others.  This is functioning in a positive way already.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank the Seanad for the constructive debate on this very important industry, one which is running into problems at the present time by reason of the fact that Bord Fáilte have created a situation where expansion has taken place in a very substantial way in a business in which problems are arising.</P>
      <P>Now is the time to have a good, hard look at the current situation, to use Senator Russell's phrase at the beginning of the debate, at a very successful situation which Bord Fáilte initiated in the 'sixties, and to decide in the 'seventies what adjustments may have to be made and in which way our approach to tourist expansion should be recast, and generally in which way we as a nation should organise our tourist business in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>For this reason, I met in recent weeks the members of Bord Fáilte, the trade unions interested and the Irish Hotels Federation.  I have had meetings with the three bodies and there has been a very frank and constructive sharing of views with the idea of preparing plans now not only for next year but for five years ahead.  Bord Fáilte and the Irish Hotels Federation will report back to me by the middle of September and in the meantime I have decided to introduce what one might call an interim way of dealing with the problem by appointing two additional directors to Bord Fáilte to ensure that expertise, experience and marketing ability will be brought to bear on the preparation of the plans for the coming season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This in no way will militate against any fundamental proposals which I may bring in, and which may require legislation, to deal with the whole future development of tourism here.  A commercial approach is necessary now in this competitive age.  It is necessary also that emphasis should be laid on marketing, selling and on what you might call specific product selling.  In that, Bord Fáilte have done an excellent <Col N="1522" /> job in selling the general image of Ireland to the world.  They have done an excellent job in getting our people more tourist conscious and in getting them more involved in practical development work.  What needs to be done now is to encourage people who are endeavouring to get specific business such as hoteliers, coach tour operators, self-drive car operators and travel agencies who may wish to sell Ireland as part of a European package.  All of these people must be brought in more actively to the tourist industry and to the whole tourist marketing programme. At the moment, I am giving serious consideration to the question of having the scheme of marketing grants introduced for the industry on the same lines as the Córas Tráchtála scheme in respect of manufacturing for export.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to make public acknowledgement of what has been done by Bord Fáilte between the years 1960 to 1970 in their development programme of that decade.  The value of their work cannot be overemphasised. Some people in the Dáil saw fit to decry Bord Fáilte.  This was not so in this House and I want to put on record that the debate here was more constructive than was the debate in the Dáil.  There is no point in decrying Bord Fáilte because of the difficulties being encountered this year. These difficulties are specific ones and they must be isolated and itemised. They relate only to the month of June and can be attributed to the very sad publicity which our country, all 32 counties, was given by reason of the difficulties in the northern part of the country.  My view is that these difficulties were the main contributors to the problem that arose and I am basing that view on the fact that business was up by 4.8 per cent for the first six months of the year.  We have not yet seen any figures for the northern part of the country but I am of the opinion that at the moment business is up on the corresponding month, July, last year.  Bookings are up for August, September and October on the corresponding months of last year.</P>
    <P>The pattern emerging now is that for every month of this year until the end of October&mdash;we can only tell the full <Col N="1523" /> story at the end of November&mdash;other than the month of June the figures are up on the corresponding business of last year.  The message, therefore, is clear as to what has happened in that respect and Bord Fáilte can share no part of the blame for that particular problem.</P>
    <P>Investment from the State has been well worth while.  In 1960 the Oireachtas voted £500,000 to Bord Fáilte. Now in 1970 we are increasing to £11 million the limit for holiday accommodation grants.  That has resulted in very practical benefit in that the £5.5 million voted towards holiday accommodation in that ten year period out of what was heretofore allowed, a total of £36 million, was invested so that 14 per cent of public investment primed 86 per cent of private investment in the expansion of accommodation. From the national point of view the net effect of that was that a tourist income of £44 million in 1960 will become this year an income from the national point of view of more than £100 million.  I say that with complete confidence.  In 1960 there was hotel bedroom accommodation of 15,465 beds.  In 1970 the figure is 23,300 and what is even more important hotel and guesthouse accommodation has increased from 17,800 beds to 27,800 this year which is a substantial increase.</P>
    <P>An important feature is that there was practically no supplementary accommodation in the form of farmhouse accommodation and so on available in 1960 but now the number of beds available in this sort of accommodation stands at 9,700.  This is supplementary accommodation, mainly farmhouse, approved by Bord Fáilte. That adds up to a substantial record of progress and all that is needed now is to have a clear look at the situation to realise that we are in a more competitive age.  Also, countries that did not heretofore specialise in tourism have now proceeded to follow our example and Bord Fáilte have been admired by many other countries including Great Britain who did not specialise in the tourist business at all but who are now doing so.  With this increasing awareness the competitive <Col N="1524" /> aspect of the tourist business is becoming more difficult so that we must have a look at the whole situation in a commercial and hard-headed way.  That is the sort of exercise that I have discussed with Bord Fáilte and with the interests involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell referred to the fact that on the reconstituted board there should be people of the highest ability. I can give the House the assurance that I gave to the Dáil to the effect that people of that character will be appointed in the form of the two new directors of Bord Fáilte.  I shall be appointing these within the next two or three weeks.  They will be people who can make a positive contribution as members of the board.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise a point that was raised by both Senators Russell and Boland that in so far as our friends in the northern part of the country are concerned there is the maximum co-operation between the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte.  I have had discussions with Mr. Bradford in connection with this and the two organisations co-operate in regard to publicity and every aspect of selling Ireland as one island.  This is good business both for us and for them.  It is in the interest of administration, too, that there would be co-operation.  Indeed one would wish that that approach would apply in every sense as well as in the tourist sense.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell spoke about the necessity for proper entertainment facilities and for facilities of a traditional flavour.  This again is an aspect that I am considering at the present time.  I agree that it is not sufficient to provide hotel or bedroom accommodation only.  There is much more to the business than that.  It is a comprehensive business in which entertainment and national cultural festivals as well as the many ancillary facilities play a large part because it is all important for the business that when visitors come, apart from having a bed on which to sleep, they can share in the atmosphere of our country.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned the regional tourism organisations and the overlapping between Bord Fáilte and these organisations.  We do have a Bord <Col N="1525" /> Fáilte representative on each of these organisations with a view to dealing with this particular problem but at the same time I agree with much that has been said.  This is something which must be tackled more vigorously.  There must be a greater unity of effort between the regional bodies and Bord Fáilte itself.  I want to emphasise that one important contribution which Bord Fáilte has made to the whole morale of our community is the encouragement it has given to local and civic interest.  The Tidy Towns competition is an obvious example, this helps to benefit our tourist effort. It is precisely the promotion of that sort of civic and voluntary effort which makes a community aware and conscious of tourism and makes the people interested in tourists in their own area.  There is a two-way operation here: it is good sound business and it is good socially.  I want to pay tribute to the voluntary organisations particularly the Irish Countrywomen's Association who have helped to make such competitions as the Tidy Towns competition an outstanding success. This merging of effort between State-sponsored bodies like Bord Fáilte and voluntary organisations has proved practical.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view expressed that the smaller type hotels should be encouraged.  The development of guesthouses and supplementary accommodation has been a main achievement of Bord Fáilte's activities over the past ten years but this does not mean to say that we can rule out the Grade A type hotel.  Tourism is like education; it is a business that everybody has a view on.  It is easy to be facile about it.  We get a lot of laymen's opinions about it, but it is a highly complex and sensitive business.  The notion that we can rule out a certain type of hotel and rule in other types of accommodations is wrong.  There are about five or six different types of accommodation and in my view there is room for expansion in every one of them.  It is too facile to say that we should have no luxury hotels and that we should only have a certain type of guesthouse or supplementary accommodation.  We should have all types of accommodation. We are catering for a wide range <Col N="1526" /> of customers in this business.  We have not priced ourselves out in any one of these fields.  The sort of value given by some of the chains of hotels which specialise in package tour operations is very good for a certain type of customer. The traditional luxury Grade A type hotel is good value for other customers. But we must have guesthouse accommodation, farmhouse accommodation and modest type hotel accommodation to facilitate other people.  We must have the whole range of options open to all visitors to this country as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The rent-a-cottage scheme was referred to.  This is a new development which is being pioneered in the Shannon region.  It is working very well.  We intend to extend it throughout the country to all regions.  That is part of the purpose here of applying standards and drawing up a register of approved cottages of this kind.  The point has been made that perhaps ten units is too large.  I agree with this point and when the regulations are being made I propose to have the number of cottages which apply for such registration and approval reduced from ten.</P>
    <P>Training of staff was mentioned and this is both important and fundamental. In the current year £120,000 has been allotted to CERT for recruitment and training in the hotel industry. We have over 900 young people, including management students, being trained under the auspices of CERT.  I regard this as fundamental and Senator Alexis FitzGerald also referred to it as well.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also made an important point that when people talk about expensive hotels the actual investment return is not all that excessive. He also referred as did Senator Boland to the question of marketing tourism.  The assessment I have made in the past month as to the pros and cons of the problems facing the industry has borne out one important fact that any hotelier or person interested in tourism in any of its facets who went out and sold his product last autumn and winter has done well.  I found this both at the top of the scale and at the bottom.  This is a salutary example to <Col N="1527" /> people who did not go out and sell of precisely what must be done.  Tourism like everything else must be sold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they done relatively well or well in comparison with the others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have done all the business that they had hoped to do. I want to emphasise the importance of selling this industry because in many cases in the past people were inclined to sit back and take tourist business for granted.  This will no longer be the case and in this industry as in every other industry the people concerned will have to go out and sell hard.</P>
      <P>Senator Ní Eachthéirn mentioned the importance of the personality of the people who are selling tourism and this is certainly very true.  Senator Kelly placed a lot of emphasis on conservation and preservation aspects in regard to tourism.  I agree with much of what he said.  As I mentioned earlier, the Tidy Towns competition is an example of Bord Fáilte's activity in this field. I am working with the Minister for Local Government at the moment to try to involve local authorities to a greater degree in the tourist industry. Under existing legislation, which has been in operation in this respect for the past 40 years, local authorities are limited to a rate of 1d in the £ in the case of county councils and in the case of Dublin, Cork and Limerick county boroughs they are limited to 3d in the £ in the amount they can contribute to tourism.  I regard this an antiquated because I feel it is very important that local authorities and people in the area through their contributions by way of rates should get involved in the tourist industry instead of looking always to Bord Fáilte as if it was a bottomless pit.  If the limit of 1d and 3d were raised to a much higher figure the local authorities in areas like Galway, Killarney, Tramore and Bundoran would be able to make a more positive contribution and get better involved. We are looking into this matter at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of restaurants and &ldquo;pub grub&rdquo; establishments.  This <Col N="1528" /> is a matter I have discussed with Bord Fáilte.  I agree with many of the views that assistance should be given particularly with the development of mobile motorist tourist which is becoming an increasingly important factor in the tourist business.</P>
    <P>School holidays were mentioned by Senator Quinlan.  I agree with him. We tried this out with the various teaching organisations in 1962 and we are trying again to arrange staggered school holidays and a readjustment of the examination programme to enable holidays to be taken at a time which would be more advantagious in so far as the tourist season is concerned.  The concentration of holidays in July and August does not make good business sense.</P>
    <P>Senator Nash mentioned the point about hoteliers getting grants without any particular check in regard to their business efficiency or hotel management efficiency.  I would like to say that in so far as hotel grants are concerned there have been no failures.  Any hotelier who got a grant and got out of business sold his hotel and the business proceeded as before.  There has been no problem in regard to defaults in the hotel grants.  There have been literally no defaults.  I would like to say as I said in the Dáil that I have suggested to Bord Fáilte that in order to clear the air in the matter that information in relation to grants should be published.  These grants should be published as is done in the case of An Foras Tionscal.  This will be done. These grants will be published in the next report of the board.  I must emphasise that the percentage grant should be displayed as well.  The great majority of cases assisted by Bord Fáilte are small hoteliers with small grants.  There are some large hoteliers helped as well.  Larger hoteliers and firms have got the lowest percentage grant.  The figures should be shown percentages so as to indicate fully what has been given.  This should be done to clear the air so that nobody is under any misconception about people being assisted or not being assisted.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha referred to a point mentioned about the new competitive element in tourism.  I agree with the <Col N="1529" /> Senator totally on this.  The Senator also raised the point to which I have referred about grant details.  The Senator mentioned cheaper beer.  I will take up this question with the brewers.</P>
    <P>A lower gravity beer would be an attraction, but there is nothing much I can do about that apart from taking up the question with the brewers. Senator Brugha mentioned another point with which I agree.  It comes back to a matter I referred to earlier and that is the question of the involvement of the local authorities and business people in Bord Fáilte by reason of the establishment of regional tourism organisations.  The figures the Senator mentioned are right.  In 1964 the contribution to the old Irish Tourist Association was £20,000.  The figure is now £78,000.  Business subscriptions are running in the region of £130,000.  This is the money which has been generated by way of contribution from local authorities through the regional tourist organisations. Senator Brugha also referred to the question of what the economists call the multiplier effect on tourism.  The experts have worked out that we have an equivalent of 160,000 jobs from tourism.  It is a multiplier matter which cannot be itemised in precisely so many jobs.  That is the gist of it.  This is quite a substantial achievement.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else of great importance.  I hope I have covered most of what was mentioned. Many Senators came back on the same type of questions to which I had already referred.  Senator Boland mentioned the fact of the regional boards being given funds themselves for regional development investment.  I will have that point looked into.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that there is one other matter which has often come up for discussion and that is the actual real contribution from tourist income.  Going back to 1968 figures, where a breakdown was done about this, the indication was that there was a total income from tourism of £93 million.  Tourists in general contributed £55.6 million.  Tourists visiting relatives contributed £12.9 million <Col N="1530" /> Tourists on business contributed £2 million.  There was £2 million miscellaneous; and fares paid to Irish transport companies amounted to £17.3 million. So far as the 1968 figures were concerned more than half the tourist income came directly from tourists as such attracted here.</P>
    <P>I would like to say in conclusion that we have here a measure that expresses confidence in the future of this industry, the importance of which cannot be gainsaid.  I said in the Dáil and I want to say again here that the difficulties and problems that have been encountered in June of this year are not so fundamental as to indicate any real malaise in the industry.  It is just a question of having a good hard look at the situation and adjusting the approach of Bord Fáilte, as I said in my opening remarks, to a more marketing hard commercial approach.  More money will have to be spent on specific promotion and to assist the interests concerned in the industry to go out and get more people to come in here. It is as simple and straightforward as that.  I feel that with this type of orientation we can make progress in the years ahead, but what is important is to tackle it now, and for that reason I am expanding membership of the board of Bord Fáilte with a view to tackling it straight away.  I do not think that there is anything fundamentally wrong in our whole approach, and when we come to the end of the year I think that it will prove my point, and I also think that we will see a revenue of over £100 millions by the new year.  There will be increased tourist income from this season.  It may not be as much of an increase as we anticipated but it will be increased tourist income, and the basic upward curve that we saw during the sixties can be accelerated and improved and followed on by a more thorough marketing and commercial approach to the situation.  This is a situation that I intend to apply my mind to, and Bord Fáilte are well aware of that particular aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is evidence of our confidence in the future of tourism. It guarantees this increased investment by the community in grants and loans <Col N="1531" /> for hotel accommodation, increased encouragement towards cottage type development, an expansion of the board itself to apply the business-like material I have mentioned, and therefore to ensure that so far as the 'seventies are concerned we can prime this very useful economic pump which is the tourist industry and which has become in the 'sixties our second major industry and can achieve that status more positively before the end of the 'seventies.  I would like to be here in 1980, when I see £200 million income from tourism.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated for the information of Senators.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm two Orders made during 1969, under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, and the Finance Act, 1962.  It is a statutory requirement that such orders must be confirmed not later than the end of the calendar year following that in which they are made, if they are not to cease to have statutory effect at the expiration of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Order No. 178 was necessary because of a decision by the Customs Co-Operation Council regarding the classification of certain trailers in the <Col N="1533" /> Brussels Tariff.  As you know, this country's Customs and Excise tariff is based on the internationally accepted Brussels nomenclature form of Customs classification.  The effect of the council's decision was that some trailers, which were already liable to duty, were being re-classified at a tariff heading where duty was not payable. The order ensured that the trailers in question remained liable to duty on reclassification.</P>
    <P>Order No. 180, which was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance, provided for the fourth tariff reduction on goods of United Kingdom origin, in accordance with the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  In addition, it provided for the maintenance of the special tariff concessions in favour of certain goods of Northern Ireland origin and implemented the remaining tariff concessions, at 55 headings, arising out of the Government's accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  The order also transferred the licensing powers in respect of a number of duties on wheaten products from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and made a number of minor changes in the Customs tariff.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad to give any further information required in connection with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only one or two points I should like to make on this Bill.  One thing that puzzles me in connection with these orders is that very frequently they take considerable time before they are introduced.  I understand the position is as the Minister stated that they are allowed a period up to the end of the year following their making before they have to be enacted.  Would there not be more reality about it if it were possible for the Minister and the Department to bring these before the Houses of the Oireachtas within a reasonably short time after their making?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the two orders we are concerned with here, the first of them is due to reclassification in respect of certain matters in relation to the Brussels tariff.  I understand the position to be that these were in one category to <Col N="1534" /> which a particular rate was applicable and that by reason of an alteration of definition or nomenclature they were put into another category which was free and that what the Minister is doing now in making this order is to ensure that the duty will continue as it was before the reclassification.  As far as I am concerned, I am not objecting to that.</P>
    <P>As regards Order No. 180, as the Minister pointed out, this now constitutes the fourth 10 per cent reduction under the Anglo Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  There is only one point I want to make in this connection.  It is that an order of this sort&mdash;the wording would not be &ldquo;10 per cent of the tariff&rdquo;&mdash;is of general application.  I do not know whether it is possible under the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement to deal with this on some more selective basis rather than by an order of general application.</P>
    <P>I think all of us would probably be able to think of examples as between different industries where a 10 per cent reduction might be comparatively easy, but there might be one industry which would find it extremely hard to meet it. That aspect was dealt with by the Minister in the Dáil and I do not intend to labour it here.  However, I would be interested to know if in respect of future such orders and future reductions it might not be possible for the Minister, within the framework of the Free Trade Area Agreement, to deal with the matter more selectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator raised the question of why it was not possible to have introduced this Bill at an earlier stage in the year and at a time which would have followed more closely on the making of the order.  I must say that I was anxious to get this particular Bill to the House during the present session and, possibly, one of the reasons why it is being discussed at this late stage in the session's that the last occasion when my predecessor was dealing with the Bill confirming the imposition of duties, it was late in the calendar year following the actual making of the orders and he promised the House then that he would endeavour to bring the confirmation Bill at an earlier stage next time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" /> Normally, the Bill is introduced during the Christmas session but on this occasion it has been brought forward. As far as I am concerned I will endeavour to keep it more close to the actual making of the orders.  One should endeavour to bring in a Bill to cover all of the orders made in a given calendar year rather than to bring in a multitude of Bills to the House covering each individual order.  From that point of view, I can assure the House that there will be no avoidable delay in introducing a Bill of this nature, say, next year to confirm the orders that have been made during the present calendar year.  At the same time, it is always possible that I, as Minister, may find it necessary to make an order late in a calendar year and it is not very easy to follow that through in the beginning of the following calendar year by way of confirmation.</P>
    <P>Concerning the second point as to the question of selectivity in regard to the 10 per cent&mdash;it is not possible to be more selective in arranging the reduction but there are provisions under the Anglo Irish Free Trade Area Agreement whereby special arrangements may be made for a particular section of an industry which may be badly hit by the further reduction in the 10 per cent duty following discussions concerning those industries.  In fact, in this particular year we are at the stage where a general overall review is deemed necessary and is laid down in the arrangements made in connection with the Anglo Irish Free Trade Agreement.  This matter will be the subject of discussion between both sides during the coming year and the particular industries which were hit by the withdrawal of all those duties will get special attention and consideration at these discussions.</P>

    <Title>Horse Industry Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill we are dealing with those recommendations of the survey team on the horse breeding industry that relate to the setting up of a horse board; the licensing of horse riding establishments; the provision of national training centres and the miscellaneous problems associated with improving the Irish horse industry both at home and abroad.  The Bill does not involve the thoroughbred industry but it is of particular concern to farmers who breed non-thoroughbred horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In present day circumstances the best market is for the pleasure horse&mdash; the hunter, the showjumper, the three-day-eventer, the riding pony.  This country is very favourably circumstanced to produce such horses.  My Department is encouraging farmers, through nominations and foaling premiums, to keep brood mares of the <Col N="1537" /> right kind and to breed from them. It is also supplementing the efforts of stallion owners by locating Irish draught and thoroughbred stallions in areas where there is need for them.  In addition it subsidises the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society in their work of fostering our native breed of ponies. All these are efforts to expand production of horses of the right kinds and since the number of nominations awarded in 1970&mdash;over 6,000&mdash;was more than double the number awarded three years ago we may hope that we are succeeding.</P>
    <P>Production is of course only half the story.  The other half concerns everything that needs to be done to promote the Irish horse.  This is where the horse board comes in.</P>
    <P>The survey team drew up a list of functions for the board which are reflected in section 7 of the Bill.  It will be seen that they are very far ranging and amount in fact, when coupled with my Department's horse breeding schemes, to a programme of development for the non-thoroughbred horse industry of this country.  Not only will the board co-ordinate activities and run a national training centre but it will help national teams to compete at equestrian events, will see to the training of riding instructors, do publicity on horses, help the trade in non-thoroughbred horses in various ways and provide for an apprenticeship scheme in farriery.  In addition to these executive functions the board will act as my advisers on horse breeding generally.  Moreover, provision is made for giving the Board extra functions if experience shows that this is desirable.</P>
    <P>There are two functions which I want to dwell on.  Of the board's executive functions I think it fair to say that none will be more important than the establishment and running of a national training centre.  It is my hope and conviction that this will become the focus for progress in horse riding. As a sport, as a means of publicising our horses, and even as a matter of national prestige, horsemanship is something we do well to foster.  We should not feel aggrieved if we do not always dominate international jumping events.  What we should aim at is <Col N="1538" /> to enable the talent we have in horses and riders to find full development. Many wonderful successes have been achieved in the past by both our Army and civilian riders and I am confident that the national training centre will be the means by which we can be sure of maintaining the traditions and standards that have been handed down.</P>
    <P>The second function is that which will make the board my advisers on horse breeding.  It would be hard to exaggerate the importance of sound advice on this subject.  Many people have strong and divergent views on it and I will look to the board for co-ordinated recommendations which will not merely be right but will be accepted as right by breeders.  Change, where change is needed, can only come about slowly given the span of years it takes to produce a mature horse and so continuity of advice and advisers will be vital.</P>
    <P>It will be evident that the board will have a very onerous job to do.  Only men with outstanding qualities could hope to do it.  Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill deal with the appointment of members and of the chairman.  The board is to have not more than eleven members; they will be appointed by me and where appropriate I shall be consulting the horse organisations about the selection of people to serve on it.  Some interests may not necessarily be represented by any organisation but I would propose that all interested parties should have a voice on the board.  As it is important not to make the board unwieldy I have come to the conclusion that a maximum of 11 members is a fair assessment of the size needed for the board.</P>
    <P>Much of the rest of Part II is made up of routine provisions necessary for a statutory body.  The board will be a body corporate, it will have a seal, and members must disclose any interest they have in proposed contracts.  The procedure at meetings of the board is detailed in section 12; it must furnish audited accounts and an annual report and it may employ staff who may be delegated to carry out its functions. Other powers of the board related to acquiring premises, buying and selling horses, borrowing, the making of grants <Col N="1539" /> or loans, investment of funds, acquisition and disposal of land and the acceptance of gifts.</P>
    <P>I would draw particular attention to section 25 of the Bill.  This enables the board to appoint such committees as it thinks fit to help it in executing its functions and these committees may include persons who are not members of the board itself.  This is in line with a recommendation by the survey team. Allied to this is a recommendation by the team that the board should itself have an advisory consultative council. Since most of the value to be derived from outside opinion could be available to the board through its committees and since the addition of a consultative council would tend towards undue complexity of structure, it has been decided not to provide for a consultative council.</P>
    <P>I come now to Part 3 of the Bill, which deals with the licensing of horse riding establishments.  The board will have the function of advising on the conditions to be attached to licences.</P>
    <P>A licence will be required under section 28 for any establishment as defined at section 27.  In order to avoid disruption of operations various periods of grace are allowed under section 28 to existing operators and to those who buy establishments and to the personal representatives of deceased licensees.</P>
    <P>Section 29 outlines the objectives against which applications for licensing will be assessed.  Broadly speaking they may be summed up as concerning the welfare of the horses and the safety of the riders.  The section also outlines the procedure to be followed when licences are refused or revoked.  Powers of inspection are provided for at section 30. Section 31 deals with miscellaneous offences which again are concerned with the welfare of horses and the safety of riders.</P>
    <P>Section 26 gives power to exempt particular classes of business from licensing.  Experience may show that it is unnecessary to control small-scale operators on the one hand or on the other operators engaged solely in hiring out hunters.  I have no views on these subjects at present but it seems wiser <Col N="1540" /> to allow for the possibility of exemption.</P>
    <P>Part III will not come into operation automatically.  An order under section 34 will be necessary for the purpose.  I shall seek the advice of the board on when to make this order.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House. In doing so I should like to pay tribute to that body of men who as the survey team on the horse breeding industry produced the report on which the Bill is based.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope the Minister does not expect us to take all Stages of this Bill in 20 minutes because I feel this is one of the most important Bills relating to Irish agriculture which have come before the House for quite a while.  The position of the horse industry in this country has been declining.  This Bill is needed.  I welcome it to the House.  The work of the survey team has been most painstaking. Criticism of the report has been minimal. The great pity has been the fact that it has taken the Department of Agriculture and the Minister four years to bring this Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The Horse Industry Bill, 1970, follows the recommendations of the survey team closely.  I find the scope of the Bill and its clauses excellent.  It is implemented by a well-chosen board. Its effects could be far-reaching and gainful in terms of prestige to Ireland. I specially like sections 25 (2), 31 (c) and 31 (d) and in section 7 paragraphs (f), (g) and (k).  In sections 7 (1) (b) and 7 (1) (d) the words &ldquo;with the consent of the organisations or groups affected&rdquo; were requested by them.  This clearly shows the desire for and the need for progressive harmony.  The Minister has stressed this in his opening speech.  I hope we will have on this new board the best possible personnel appointed. If one of the board should be strong enough to express a view or hold a point of view that perhaps might not be in line with the Establishment he should be encouraged and should not get short shrift as has happened in similar situations on other boards in the not too distant past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 (i) provides for money to meet the cost of horses used by the <Col N="1541" /> teams.  This is a real need in order to face increased competition and keep up the prestige of Ireland and the Irish horse.  This is an important section.  I should like to see the new horse board being able to spend rather lavishly under this section.  I would like to ask the Minister if it would be possible for the new board to allow expenses to riders who may be representing this country in interational competitions overseas.  The position is that when an Irish rider in past years had a big run of successes in international shows in places like South America or Britain or throughout Europe the onus of &ldquo;filling the cup&rdquo; fell very heavily on such young riders, especially when we had an all-Army team competing.  This was an unnecessary burden on these people.  I hope in the future when the board have responsibility in this matter and when Irish riders riding for Ireland win trophies there will be a fund available which will enable our riders to be as generous as the representatives of other national teams and to be able to partake in the expected celebrations.  This is important.  Some of these young officers in the Army got an increase of only £4 a year.  These people must be able to stand abreast with the best in the world especially when they win important competitions.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is the kernel of the success of the board.  Without sufficient funds it would become only a target for criticism.  Sections 14, 15, 16, 17, 24 and 25 are first-class.  In Part III, section 28 implies that riding establishments either existing, purchased or inherited within three months, do not require a licence.  I am not clear on this particular point.  I know the Minister mentioned it in the Second Reading speech but I should like him to clarify the position.  Are these people exempt completely from the licence? Will they get a period of grace in order to get administration in order? Has the Minister in mind three months in order to take out administration?  I think he is out of touch with the Land Registry, because any change in administration, in my limited experience of this type of thing, has taken more than a year.  If this is the case the Minister should make reasonable provision for this.  It is unheard of that anybody <Col N="1542" /> can have probate proceedings dealt with in three months.  It is certainly not the general rule.</P>
    <P>Parts I and II of the Bill are designed to encourage and promote the profitable production of non-thoroughbred horses and children's ponies and donkeys for export, tourism and home use and to maintain the prestige of the Irish horse.</P>
    <P>The ideal end product is of course the thoroughbred colt, the successful showjumper, the show horse and the three day competitor.  By-products are the three-quarter bred or half-bred hunter and the yearling and the draught gelding for pulling caravans and farm work.  The demand in Continental armies for horses is of course a less significant outlet in these latter years.  The second-rate horse that there was a market for certainly does not pay at the present time, and it will not pay the Irish farmer to produce a second-rate horse, especially in the Irish draught class.  This is where this Bill comes in.  It seems to me that if we have stallions which are not up to the mark these should be either sent to the slaughter house&mdash;and I regret to have to say that quite plainly&mdash;or exported to our competitors.  These are the only alternatives that I can suggest.</P>
    <P>Clearly it is quality rather than quantity of production with which we should be concerned, and the farmers of Ireland should not be encouraged to produce a growing number of animals for a decreasing demand which must surely lose them money.  The first essential is to preserve and improve our diminishing stock of quality clean draught hunter mares, because breeding from draught mares is one step further from the more profitable end product that is obtained from breeding from half-bred mares, which is what the farmers must be encouraged to do. The new board that is envisaged under this Bill must give the greatest possible incentives to the breeders of purebred Irish draught mares, because as the Minister and everyone in the industry know this is the foundation stock of our so successful Irish hunter and Irish half-bred.</P>
    <P>The main thing that the board will have to do is to open an effective registering <Col N="1543" /> scheme and stock book, and there will be an outlet of course for serviceable fillies for export.  A small stud should be kept or the State should own or lease a farm for demonstration purposes for farmers, tourists, or even foreign buyers.  At present breeders experience great hardship and difficulties in having to travel long distances to see stallions and to see if they are suitable for their particular mares or not.  Over the past this has been the experience, and in view of the fact that the fertility rate is so low the Department will have to provide proper off-season quarters for the stallions.  Just before the beginning of the season, then, they could very usefully bring them to one or two centres so that farmers could see and select horses that in their opinion would be the most suitable for their particular mares.  It has been known for men who went to see horses in different parts of the country to find these animals on rather rough grazing in the winter without being housed.  With animals maintained in this fashion it is not surprising that the fertility rate is so deplorably low.</P>
    <P>The Minister now has a great opportunity, and a badly needed one, to improve the conditions under which horses are maintained.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Bill can be used to co-ordinate the efforts of the Department's nomination and registration schemes, the RDS premium scheme and the Irish Horse Breeders' Association registration of mares scheme.  I should like to pay tribute to the Wicklow County Council.  In each year they have a special valuable class prize for registered Irish draught mares at the show in Blessington.  This is a very wonderful thing, and it certainly encourages the Irish draught mare in the Leinster counties.</P>
    <P>The second essential is to improve the quality of the stallions available to the small farmer breeder.  The Department's stallions could well be gathered together in a winter centre which could be housed in some of the institute farms.  We must have more co-operation in every aspect of agriculture.  The Director of the Agricultural Institute <Col N="1544" /> spoke some time ago under the auspices of the Kane lectures and advocated greater co-operation amongst all those who are doing excellent work in the agricultural sphere.  I would strongly urge and recommend that where suitable housing on the farm is available either under the care of the Agricultural Institute or the Department or the universities or indeed the National Stud these centres should be selected to provide winter quarters for some of these horses.  They are all owned by the taxpayers, and red tape should be cut to the very minimum so that the most economical quarters possible for the Department's stock can be provided.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the desirability of stallions being brought to suitable centres so that they can be fed.  Otherwise we will have the position of the unfortunate farmer having to take his mare to the nearest and possibly most unsuitable horse that there might be in his own county. The Department, I must agree, have done their best over the years with the limited funds available to them, but of course limited funds have produced what I would call not a great standard of Irish draught and half-breds. We certainly require a sound quality class of proven jumping and staying strains, and we just have to get them if the place of the Irish horse is to be maintained in the world.</P>
    <P>I have not got to remind the Minister and the Department that the Continentals very much dislike the white-legged stock, and I think that this should also be remembered when our Department inspectors go out to buy stallions.  I also feel that the stock could be improved by making stallion keeping more profitable and by insisting on higher feeding and management standards.  We could greatly overcome the difficulties in this regard if the Department were to take these horses to the National Stud or some of the State farms for the off season.  In addition these stallions should be changed around each year and should not be sent to the same farmer each year, so that farmers in the different counties will have an opportunity of availing of the services of the better class stallions at some stage or other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> The Department stallion owners should keep a fair share of thoroughbred mares.  This would tend to increase the incomes of the stallion keeper.  This increased income is needed to bring about the desirable and obviously necessary improvement in management standards.  Of course a 50 per cent live foal rate for nominated mares is pitifully low.  I have taken this figure from one of the Minister's speeches in the Dáil, I think his Second Reading speech.  I was rather taken aback by the low rate.  It is indicated in the report, and I feel we should adopt the suggestion, that the survey team have strongly recommended measures to deal with this low figure. I sincerely hope the board will be instructed to endeavour to improve the situation as much as possible.</P>

      <P>Definitely not.  I do not know what arrangement has been made between Senators O'Higgins and Ó Maoláin, but if we are to arrange another date for the Committee Stage it must be next week.  No Senator going on holidays would wish to come back here in September.  I feel I am speaking for the general majority on all sides of the House.  We are prepared to sit next week to get to the end of this business.  I think it is correct to say that the majority of Senators want to get to the end of this Bill but they do not wish to be rushed in any way and they very definitely do not wish to be brought back here in September.  With the Dáil not reassembling until the end of October, that would be downright wrong, in my view.</P>

I said at the start of business today that my aim was that this House would rise, <i>sine die,</i> tonight, simultaneously with the Dáil and the whole operation up to now has been aimed in that direction.  There is no question of rushing or pressing anybody. The House sat until quarter past midnight this morning.  We have still nearly 2½ hours to go to that time.  It will not kill anybody to go on and discuss <Col N="1547" /> this Bill thoroughly.  There are a lot of strong young men over on that side of the House.</P>

The Leader of the House said there was agreement today but since the time is now so late and the Seanad has sat for such long hours, it is suppressing the scope of the House to insist on continuing discussion of such an important measure. Nobody thought this morning that we would still be here at 10 p.m. and only beginning discussion of this Bill, which is so long overdue.  A survey team was set up in 1965, a report was issued, and five years elapsed before the Government thought of taking action on it.</P>

      <P>The idea of a national centre to co-ordinate non-thoroughbred equinistic activities is very welcome.  Perhaps this centre could be used also to provide courses for children as well as adults because there will be many people who will wish to learn the basic elements of horse riding.  Very often people&mdash; farmers in particular&mdash;buy horses for their children and these animals may be entirely unsuitable, so much so that the children would be put off horse riding for life.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It can happen when young children are put on an animal that is not very quiet.  These courses would encourage the formation of pony clubs in rural Ireland.  This is an important feature.  Throughout the country there are vast tracts of forests and other places that would be ideal for pony riding and pony trekking where <Col N="1549" /> people could jog along in peace and quiet hearing nothing but the singing of the birds.  Trekking activities should be encouraged as much as possible.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (1) (k) enables the board to aid the dying skill of the farrier or the old blacksmith.  Most rural Senators will know that it is very difficult for a boy to become a competent farrier today. If he is apprenticed to the trade he will probably be put to electric welding and after some short time when he is deemed to be competent at this work he will be left at it.  Blacksmiths should be given some incentive to train boys to the trade.  I hope the board will be in a position to give some help such as a grant-in-aid towards the training of suitable apprentices.  If some such scheme were announced I have no doubt there would be sufficient blacksmiths or master farriers willing to train boys and that there would be sufficient apprentices interested in the trade.</P>
      <P>A publicity and information centre would, I am sure, encourage many people to come to Ireland in the hope of buying a genuine young horse from an Irish farm.  Customers from abroad should be encouraged to do so.  I intended dealing with this aspect on the Tourist Traffic Bill but I did not do so.  We should encourage the proprietors of farm guesthouses to provide ponies for trekking during the holiday season.  This is the sort of thing on which there could be co-operation between Bord na gCapall and Bord Fáilte.  It would not be unreasonable to expect such co-operation between two semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister when he is replying will be able to tell us why is his Department have decided to reduce from £4,000 to £1,000 the grant-in-aid to the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society this year.  I am taking the figure from the Estimates for Public Services for the current year.  Perhaps one explanation might be that this excellent organisation received some special grant in aid last year but I do not know if that is so.  If this organisation have no premises of their own it would be in the interests of the industry that the board would provide them with headquarters on the lines of <Col N="1550" /> a farm.  It has been left to a few individuals to preserve what is perhaps one of the only pure Irish breeds of pony&mdash;the Connemara pony.  In my own county Lady de Vesci has done wonderful work in bringing out the pure strain of the Connemara pony. These ponies fetch very profitable prices on the foreign market.  They can provide a wonderful source of revenue but the danger is that too many of the better type of animals are finding homes abroad.  Certainly, this cannot be in the best interest of the industry. Bord na gCapall will have a responsibility to ensure that an adequate share of the best prize winning Connemara ponies will be kept in this country for stud purposes.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention also children's ponies and donkeys.  The production of children's ponies is simply a non-paying proposition for the average farmer.  With stud fees ranging from £10 to £20 and the top prices at about £50 for a weaning colt and £100 for a filly I cannot see how this would do much more than cover the cost involved in producing this kind of stock.  Usually, also, a five- or six-year old trained pony will not fetch much more than that and a coloured donkey foal will command in the region of £100.  These, of course, are scarce also but unfortunately too many are exported. There is great danger that the Irish stock of these animals will dwindle away.  Publicity and sales promotion are required to make donkey breeding profitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The demand for trained and quiet walking horses for hauling caravans is far from satisfied at the present time.  These horses usually fetch £150 or more.  This is a useful outlet for the by-product of the purebred Irish draught breeder. Last year I saw many of these horse-drawn caravans being used by tourists on country roads.  Quite obviously most of these people did not have any instruction on the handling, care or maintenance of the animals.  It is a pitiful sight to see a horse obviously ill-fed and in bad-condition walking along the road.  I do not want to decry this type of holiday, in fact it is a lovely way to spend a holiday but the people who hire out these horses have an obligation in the humane sense to the stock they own to instruct the hirers how to look after them.  I hope the Minister will take appropriate powers to ensure that regulations are drawn up whereby an urbanite who hires a horse and caravan will find a list in the caravan telling him what he should and should not do.  I have been told of an incident where a horse hired out for a week was not taken out of its shafts because the hirer was worried in case he could not get him back in.  This is a terrible way to treat an animal who has been described as man's best friend.  This must be controlled if we are to keep our tradition of being a horse-loving nation.</P>
      <P>There is one point in the report to which I cannot fully subscribe.  It is recommendation No. 17 at page 12 of the Report on the Horse-breeding Industry, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> The Team are of the opinion that the Scheme operated by the County Committees of Agriculture is inadequate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I certainly agree with that.  It continues:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that it should be replaced by a national scheme to be operated directly by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  In the Team's view, it is essential that the selection of mares should be based on a higher standard and that the standard should be uniform throughout the whole country.</P>
    <P>This is possibly true but breeders have expressed dissatisfaction at the change-over since the Department started operating the scheme which was heretofore operated by the county committees. The entire situation has moved further from the breeders and there is a greater time lag.  I read somewhere else in the report that it was suggested there should be only three teams of judges for inspecting mares for nomination. I agree with this because the standard varies greatly from county to county.</P>
    <P>Again I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the great need for having a meaningful stock book or stud book for the Irish draught breed and the half-bred as well.  I whole-heartedly support the suggestion made in recommendation No. 19 that the problem could be solved by tattooing mares selected for nomination and subsequently tatooing the progeny.  I understand the system of tattooing on the upper lip has been successfully operated in the USA.  I hope this system can be brought in here so that we can have a stud book for the Irish draught horse, the half-bred and the Connemara pony.  I have already mentioned that the Minister has cut back the grant-in-aid to the Connemara Pony Breeders' Association. I sincerely hope these people will get adequate funds because the task they perform is a sizeable one.  It is imperative that the board should be given adequate and sufficient funds to do this work.  I hope when the Minister comes to make regulations there will be a certain degree of flexibility in them so that Bord na gCapall will be <Col N="1553" /> able to follow the varying trends in the prices of horses.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the position of the Irish Draught Horse Board.  I understand they have been in the Department of Agriculture since the book started in 1927 or 1928.  I understand from breeders that it is impossible for an ordinary breeder to trace an animal or the progeny of an animal through the Department's system.  It is just not available to the public or breeders without a tremendous amount of red tape.  The new Irish draught book should be on a par with the cattle breeding herd books.  This should not be impossible to do.  In the summary of recommendations recommendation No. 11 states:</P>
    <P>The Irish Draught Horse Scheme should be recast to provide for (a) a three man inspection team (b) payment to stallion owners of £5 service fee and £5 premium on production of a live foal and (c) payment of a premium of £25 to mare owners on production of a live foal.</P>
    <P>These figures are too low.  I am sure the Minister agrees that the ordinary farmer invariably has to pay between £7 and £10 nomination for a service. As there is a great scarcity of Irish draught a definite financial inducement must be given to Irish farmers to keep this breed of horse on Irish farms.  I would ask that recommendation No. 11 on page 34 be brought up to date. These recommendations are already four years old and the value of the £ has fallen to such an extent that the figure of £5 should be increased. Recommendation No. 15 deals with the problem of identification of half-bred stock.  This recommendation must be adopted if the board is to be meaningful in any way at all.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 deal with the board and the personnel.  The present situation calls for a very strong board.  I hope that the Minister will select people engaged in the industry and ancillary to it who have, by their own prowess, proved themselves to be masters in association with the Irish horse and horse industry.  The personnel of the board should be the best people available in the country.  The <Col N="1554" /> number of members of the board is restricted to 11.  Perhaps this is a pity. There are 12 or 13 horse bodies interested in the industry.  They are: All Ireland Polo Club; Bloodstock Breeders' and Horse Owners' Association of Ireland; Connemara Pony Breeders' Association; The Hunters Improvement and National Light Horse Breeding Society; Irish Masters of Fox Hounds' Association; Irish Olympic Horse Society; Irish Pony Club Advisory Board; Irish Show Pony Society; National Farmers' Association; R.D.S.; The Show Jumping Association of Southern Ireland; Stallion Owners' Association of Southern Ireland.  These bodies offered recommendations and reports to the survey team.  They represent different areas of the industry.  They would have something to add which would make the work of the board more worthwhile. These bodies are all voluntary organisations and are doing a good job in their own speheres.  I would not like to start bulking them together. From these organisations the Minister will have great scope in picking a sound and interesting team.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (1) (c) reads:</P>
    <P>(c) to establish, equip and operate or cause to be operated on its behalf a national centre or national centres for training in equitation.</P>
    <P>I hope this would mean national centres.  We normally expect when anything like this is established that it will come to Dublin.  The city of Dublin should not be the centre for this.  I would like to see the centre somewhere in Kildare, which would be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>Speaking of hunting, I regard it as perhaps the only free sport left in this country.  It has attracted many people who are not members of any hunt. Some of these people have no regard for the free ranges they ride over.  It is scandalous that people should treat farmers' property so carelessly.  This will not help hunting in this country. There have been instances where people cut wires, let cattle out and left gates open.  It is up to the hunts to see that their members respect private property.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> Section 7 (1) (i) relates to the export trade.  The board will advise the Minister as to how to promote and develop the export trade of horses other than thoroughbred horses.  I am not happy about this.  The board's primary function should be to build up the stock of the Irish breeding horse to ensure that we will have something to export.  If the present trend continues we will be left with nothing but second-rate horses.  The Minister should ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>Section 9 relates to the chairman of the board.  Why does the Minister find it necessary to appoint every chairman to the board?  The Minister for Health was quite agreeable when dealing with the Health Bill to appoint the first chairman only of the Health Board. The health boards are doing a very important job.  Some people might consider the job of the health boards much more important than that of the Horse Board.  Could the Minister give any reason for appointing every chairman to this board or say why the chairman cannot resign, if he wants to, without first informing the Minister? Perhaps this is normal procedure and it may be laid down in the articles of association in all semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (7) deals with the quorum of the board for a meeting.  Could the Minister visualise a situation where after some disagreement all the members of the board walk out, except three?  Can these three men ring the Minister and ask him to make a regulation that the quorum be three?  This could conceivably happen.  Why does the Minister want power to fix a quorum by direction or by order?  Is it not sufficient to say that the quorum of the board meeting shall be five?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>If I skip from section 12 to section 23 I am not dealing with the Bill section by section.  I would like to ask the Minister to clarify the position.  Unless I get these clarifications I will not have an opportunity of putting down amendments. I insist on my right to mention these points.  Section 23 (1) (a) contains a line I am interested in, which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>if it should sooner happen, upon his resignation or retirement...</P>
      <P>It is usual that when employees of either local authorities or semi-State organisations are elected to either House of the Oireachtas they are automatically seconded from their employment. The position is that if they pay their superannuation contributions they can keep their pension rights alive.  Is this different from other legislation where it is suggested that the board may terminate the employment of an employee who becomes a Member of this House?  It is an interesting point. Again, it may be in other legislation. I do not know.  I should like to have the matter clarified.  Section 29 (2) states:</P>
      <P>A licence may be granted with or without limitation on its validity. Subsection (3) (a) states:</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister proposes to refuse to grant a licence, he shall, before doing so, notify the applicant for the licence of his intention and the reasons therefor...</P>
      <P>I agree the period of 14 days has been increased from a period of seven days, but I think it is a rather short period. For instance, when the Minister gives notice he takes 30 days.  I do not think, therefore, it is unreasonable to ask for 30 days all round.  If the Minister wants that period, surely the ordinary citizen is entitled to it also?  Very often there may be correspondence from a Department. It could be dated 10th of the month, but it may not be in the post for several days afterwards.  I ask that the period of 30 days be substituted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> Section 29 (2) (b) (ii) states that if a person makes a request to the Minister, within seven days after the date of the giving of the notification for the holding of an inquiry in relation to the matter, the Minister shall cause an inquiry to be held.  Seven days is a very short time.  An applicant for a licence can be ill, or at a show, and he may overlook the matter for two or three days.  Then, a bank holiday might intervene. Therefore, the limit is inadequate. It is not a matter of tremendous importance to the Minister and I see no reason why the time should not be extended to 30 days.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister referred to section 31 and said it looked after the welfare of horses and their riders.  I cannot find this provision in that section.  Perhaps I have misread it but I should be obliged if the Minister pointed out to me where he safeguards the riders, bearing in mind that some of them may be children of tender years.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters I wish to refer to but I can deal with them on Committee Stage.  All in all, I think this industry has great development scope and that it can be built into a business which will be of tremendous benefit to the entire farming community, both economically and socially.  I sincerely hope the Minister will give us an opportunity of tabling some minor amendments to the Bill, which in general is welcomed.  It is a good Bill, though there are some small sections about which I have doubts.  With a bit of give-and-take, I think we can make it into a Bill that will be of great help in building up the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to welcome the Bill.  I look forward to the benefits which I feel sure will flow from it.  Everybody will agree that the horse industry has great potential in this country but in recent years this potential has not been fully realised.  This Bill will go a long way towards ensuring that this potential will be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill places great emphasis on the organisation of schools of equitation and it gives wide powers to the board and to the Minister in various <Col N="1558" /> spheres of the horse industry.  I hope the board will not only ensure that these schools of equitation will be efficiently organised but that when it comes to the selection of horses for riders to use at international and National competitions, the horses will be well selected.  The successes which our jumping teams had before the war were due very largely to the flare and the skill used in the selection of horses.</P>
    <P>The comparative lack of success in recent years was due to some lack of skill in the selection of horses.  There is no doubt that on many occasions our teams had the experience of being beaten by Irish horses at competitions abroad, horses which could have been selected for and ridden by our teams.  This was due to some extent to the fact that funds were no provided for the Army jumping team or for the provision of horses for others riding in those competitions.  Indeed, it was not merely a lack of funds but a lack of skill, or flare, in the selection of horses. These are things that cannot be provided for in legislation and the new board being set up should do their utmost to ensure that the horses which are provided for those trained in equitation schools are the best possible, having regard to the funds available.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of the board will be to co-ordinate and to undertake publicity on horses.  This, of course, could take many forms but one aspect which could, perhaps, be reconsidered is the Presidential escort which was allowed to lapse many years ago.  The discontinuance of this escort was deplored by many people.  In this country where so much importance attaches to the horse industry, it is an inconsistency that there should be a motorbike escort instead of a horse escort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This escort could be the showpiece of the horse industry. People coming to visit this country would be very impressed by such an escort and, also, our finest horses would be on show.  Therefore, not only from the point of view of the industry <Col N="1559" /> itself but from the point of view of tourism, this could be a great attraction indeed.  In this context I need hardly remind the House of the play made by the British Tourist Associations of such pageantry as the Changing of the Guard and so on.  Tourists to Great Britain take great pleasure in this.  This is one of the many aspects of the industry to which the board might give attention.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the horse industry which is not at the moment under the direct control of the Minister but one on which he should use his influence is in relation to the recent policy of the Racing Board concerning some of the smaller race courses.  I understand that they are withdrawing grants and subsidies to some of these smaller courses and that, as a result, some may have to close or at least limit the number of meetings.  This decision could have a very damaging effect on the industry. Having race courses in as many areas as possible is an incentive to the breeding and keeping of horses and helps the industry generally.  I hope, therefore, that the new board and the Minister will use their influence in this matter. I do not propose to deal with any other points at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of this board and I appreciate the interest which has been taken in the horse breeding industry both by the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and by his predecessor. As the details of the establishment of the board have already been dealt with since the introduction of the Bill to Dáil Éireann, I shall not deal further with that aspect of it.  However, I must advert to the fact that the board to be set up meets only very few of the recommendations of the survey team set up by the former Minister for Agriculture in 1965.  For instance, one significant factor to be noted is in relation to liaison between the Minister and the county committees of agriculture with regard to the horse breeding industry since this report was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to not so very long ago the county committees of agriculture administered the scheme of premium mares.  This was done with the approval <Col N="1560" /> of the Department who sent representatives to select these mares. Many of them were selected because the number of mares was diminishing each year in some rural areas.  The Meath County Committee of Agriculture considered that it would be a tragedy if the supply of horses, say, half-bred horses or Irish draughts should diminish and that there would be no foundation stock for the breeding of the heavy-weight type of animal. We were perturbed about this and asked the Department to send a representative to discuss the problem with us.  The Department complied with our request and, as a result of the discussions we had with the officer, certain recommendations were drawn up and given to him to take back to his superiors.  Among those recommendations was a request for the location of two Irish draught sires in County Meath.</P>
    <P>Our intention at that time was to upgrade the standard of mare in the county by breeding from good Irish draught stallions.  After about two years and a lot of correspondence with the Department we never received any notice as to whether the two people we had nominated to be supplied with the sires had been so supplied.  Eventually, however, we did hear from one man in south Meath that he had been supplied with an Irish draught sire.  The second sire was to be located in north Meath but we heard nothing from the Department about that&mdash;no explanation of any kind.  There should be greater liaison between the Department and the county committees of agriculture.  The breeding of inferior type animals is of no use to the industry because these animals are fit only for selling as carcase meat.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister now when this board is being set up to keep in mind the county committees of agriculture and their advisers who, when the board has been established, can be of great help to them in their efforts to upgrade foundation stock.</P>
    <P>I come back now to the Irish draught horse.  We had more than enough of the heavy horse of the Clydesdale type.  They served their purpose in the old days.  Their days were <Col N="1561" /> numbered and people started to get rid of them.  The farmer who was fond of horses usually kept a mare to do a bit of work and he bred a foal.  We felt that the money spent by the Department was wasted, and that something would have to be done about it. Even though this legislation is belated we welcome it.  I hope the Minister will take note of what I said about co-operation and liaison with the committees of agriculture, especially in the counties where the people are interested in horses.  It is a very valuable industry.  It would be a great pity if the foundation stock were to be lost and we had to go to foreign countries for others.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of a reduction in the grant for Connemara ponies.  The Connemara Pony Breeders' Society have been in existence for a long number of years.  They have justified their existence.  They have found markets for ponies all over the world, practically.  Connemara ponies are now being shown throughout the world.  Most of the credit for that is due to the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society and to the help they got from the Department.  I hope they will continue to do that good work.</P>
    <P>The Minister is interested in horses. He comes from a county where good horses were bred and I know this matter is in very good hands.  I hope that when he comes to select the members of Bord na gCapall men who have an interest in and experience of the horse breeding industry will be included on it.  It would be a pity if the members were all to be selected from one section of the horse breeding industry.  It would be a pity if somebody was not selected from the grass-roots section, somebody with a small farm who breeds a foal each year and keeps him until he is a two year old and is then broken as a hunter.  All the representation on a board like that should not be given to the bigger type of farmer because that type of person has different interests.  As I said, I know the matter is in good hands, in the hands of the Minister.</P>

Tá an-cheangal idir &ldquo;caballus&rdquo; na Laidne, &ldquo;caballo&rdquo; sa Spáinnis agus &ldquo;capall&rdquo; sa Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>The passage of the Horse Industry Bill through the Dáil could probably be taken as a tribute to the stamina rather than the speed of the Irish horse. From the way things are shaping at the moment, it looks as if the passage of that Bill through the Seanad will be a like tribute.  After that short bilingual canter I will now speak briefly on horses and the horse industry in general.  I will do my best to move as expenditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>The breeding of good horses is one of Ireland's outstanding accomplishments. As we know, that applies to all categories of thoroughbreds, steeplechasers, point-to-pointers, hunters, showjumpers, dressage performers, three-day eventers and last, but by no means least, Connemara ponies.  To show the connection between what we call an English horse and what we call a pony I will go back to our own language.  In our own language we call a horse &ldquo;capall&rdquo; and a pony is called &ldquo;capaillín&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish horses have distinguished themselves on every racecourse in the world.  Since the inception of the Aintree Grand National in 1839 they have more or less monopolised that race.  There comes to mind this strange and rather annoying fact that, very often in racing circles, a horse bred in Ireland, bought by an English buyer and taken across to Britain, is subsequently referred to as being British bred.  It is British owned certainly.  We <Col N="1563" /> have no objection to the horse being described as British owned but, if it was bred in Ireland, we would like that fact to be made known.  Our British friends have a habit of doing that kind of thing not alone in horse racing circles but in other sports.</P>
    <P>We have made our mark in the world show grounds.  The leading equestrian authority Fédération Esquestre Internationale has stated that between 1918 and 1949 the world's three best showjumpers were Blarney Castle, Limerick Lace and Red Hugh.  Everyone should be extremely proud of this.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the draught mare and the hunter.  A first class Irish hunter is probably unrivalled as a cross-country conveyance.  No matter how exotic the sites may be or the strain from which they come I believe that it is the good, clean-legged, placid-tempered sturdy Irish farm mare that gives the bone and stamina to get them over fences in the hunt and that enables the animal to show a clean pair of heels at Beecher's Brook.</P>
    <P>Of course we have many advantages, possibly all the advantages, as a horse breeding country.  We have a mild climate allowing young stock to be out-of-doors nearly all year round, giving them a hardy constitution from foal-hood. Then we have the limestone soil supplying calcium for the making of bones.  We have all the advantages but I believe that great as has been our horse industry we could be on the verge of a major breakthrough as far as the world market is concerned.  Later I shall give some up-to-date figures on the export of horses both to Britain and EEC countries.</P>
    <P>In this day and age we are inclined to go in for business in a big way and while stud farms are excellent in their own way, when this Bill passes through both Houses and things get under way I am sure things will be done on most efficient lines in all these stud farms. But I would again plead for help in every possible way for the small horse breeder, the man who is born with horses, whose parents had a special interest in horses, a tradition of horses in the family, and the man whose life is devoted to horses and horse breeding, <Col N="1564" /> a man who has a love for horses as most people have.</P>
    <P>We now come to the Connemara pony.  Many speakers have already referred to this wonderful little animal, probably the only breed that we can claim to be entirely native, or as native as any animal can be.  Connemara ponies have been sent to India, California, Sweden, British Columbia, Denmark, Britain and France at all times of the year.  Look at their record. The Connemara pony, Marconi, won the stallion championship of the USA in 1963.  At Washington International Horse Show El Grotto a son of that animal, won the hunter championships against full-sized American showjumpers, and little Dundrum, that wonderful animal which one always associates with Tommy Wade, won the King George Gold Cup in London and on two occasions was instrumental in Ireland's winning the Aga Khan Cup here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Connemara Little Model competed all over Europe and won the British Championship nine times in 11 years.  These are a few instances but I think nobody can deny the excellence of the Connemara pony which is so peculiarly our own.</P>
    <P>In a recent issue of <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> there is an excellent article dealing with horses and especially with the Connemara pony.  Perhaps it is pertinent to the discussion to give a short quotation from it.  One of the names of the original small horse was the &ldquo;jinete&rdquo; or &ldquo;jaca&rdquo; and in the Spanish of Latin America &ldquo;galiceno&rdquo; or &ldquo;caballo de paso&rdquo;.  You had two kinds of horses there originally, as far as I know.  You had the big war horse ridden by senior officers in the Roman Army and then you had the lighter horses for chariot racing and for general purposes.  In fact it was the virtues of the Irish light horse which first attracted the attention of the English. They called it a &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; and in the continental campaigns of the 15th century employed large numbers of Irish mercenary light horsemen particularly at the Siege of Rouen.  But the other forte of this Ibero-Irish pony was its performance at the amble and the pace, those &ldquo;easy gaits&rdquo; which were so <Col N="1565" /> much desired in the palfrey, the better-class travelling horse of western Europe, throughout the period between the ruin of the Roman imperial road system and the slow reconstruction which made the coach possible more than a thousand years later.</P>
    <P>It was part of the conservatism of the Irish equestrian class that they not only retained the chariot&mdash; alone in Europe&mdash;until the days of St. Patrick, but they declined to take up that oriental gadget, the stirrup, until well after 1600, whereas other western nations had adopted it by about 900. They were, therefore, at pains to breed and train a horse that would give a comfortable ride all day without stirrups.  That is very important when we come to think of the revolution as far as the horse is concerned, the almost total disappearance of the working horse on the farm, and the coming in a big way of the pleasure horse.  We all regret the passing of the good old farm horse because everybody loves the horse or the mare.  How children enjoyed, when they were small, their first ride on the horse when he came in from the fields!</P>

      <P>In general, I am afraid the day is gone and it is only, I suppose, a matter of time before it is completely gone.  I suppose it is the price we must pay for progress.  In any case, in comes the pleasure horse in a big way.  I think this Bill has, among other things, the machinery necessary for the improvement of that pleasure horse whether hunter, showjumper, three-day eventer or riding pony.</P>
      <P>I have gone through this Bill very carefully but, to my mind, there is very little more that could be put into it.  I think everything has been thought of.  There is mention on page 2 of a very important item of information and guidance.  It says that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;horse&rdquo; includes any mare, gelding, pony, foal, colt, filly or stallion and also&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>here I shall not look at anybody on one side of the House or the other&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill is a mature document and great credit is certainly due to those who sat down and made all the necessary preparations for the framing of it.</P>
      <P>All day long we were discussing the Tourist Bill.  I think when this board is established and things get under way, I strongly recommend the closest liaison between that board and Bord Fáilte.  They could learn a lot from each other because during the summer months and at other times of the year visitors from our towns and cities and from Britain and the Continent will be glad to take advantage of hunting, pony trekking and so on in this country.  They can get it at a price for which they could not get it abroad.  A French visitor in my own home recently was discussing racing in France.  She indicated that as far as she and her people were concerned it was absolutely prohibitive.  She was amazed that things were very different here.  The promotion of the pleasure horse and the work of Bord Fáilte in making pleasure horses available at a reasonable price will have a very beneficial effect on our economy.</P>
      <P>I have the utmost praise for this Bill.  It is fine to say that such a Bill is long overdue.  We all know it is and the Minister knows it too but all these things cannot be done at the one time.  Thank God it is with us now and I look forward to great results from it.</P>
      <P>The number of bloodstock horses we export is increasing every year.  I notice from the latest report of Córas Tráchtála that the total number of horses exported in 1959 was 2,099; in 1968, 2,638; in 1969, 2,862.  As far as the EEC countries are concerned the figures are very low but the increase in the numbers is remarkable.  In 1959, it was only 95; in 1968, it was double that&mdash;194, and last year it was 247. The trend there is in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total exports of horses last year rose by £1.2 million to £6.4 million, bloodstock accounting for approximately £5.4 million of the total and £1.1 million of the increase.  Bloodstock <Col N="1567" /> also increased by £1.1 million in 1968.  Bloodstock exports to Britain were up from £3.6 million to £4.4 million and sales to other markets included the USA, France, Japan, Canada, Spain and the Philippines.  Exports of other horses&mdash;hunters, <i>et cetera</i> were something just under a million pounds&mdash;£973,000 and they were up by £80,000.  The principal markets again were Britain and Northern Ireland, Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Western Germany. As things are we have profitable sales in these countries in Europe. I feel we can look forward to increased and far more profitable sales in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I shall not go through this Bill section by section but at pages 3 and 4 the function of Bord na gCapall are indicated. About everything that could be thought of is included there&mdash;the training of persons in giving instruction in equitation, co-ordination and undertaking of publicity in horses, sales organisation of horses other than thoroughbred horses, to promote and develop the export trade of horses other than thoroughbred horses, to establish an administrative scheme of apprenticeship in farriery.  I was delighted to see that.  We have sentimental memories of the forge on our way home from school.  We all remember the little poem about &ldquo;The Smith a Mighty Man is He&rdquo;.  With the exit of the horse, forges are few and far between. It is very difficult to get a good blacksmith now.  He has transferred his skills to repairing farm machinery and so on.  I am very glad to see that clause.</P>
    <P>In connection with the riding establishments there is every conceivable precaution there to see that the work will be done properly and that there will be no question of cruelty to any animal by way of unsuitable accommodation, want of food, ventilation or drainage.  I am glad about that because stories of ill-treatment of animals hurt one very much especially about the animals one sees going through the country pulling caravans along the roads at 1½ miles an hour or thereabouts. I suppose these stories are exaggerated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> This Bill is a tribute to those who framed it and to all those who did the preliminary work.  I feel there is a great future for the horse industry.  It was always good but I feel we are on the verge of a big breakthrough.  This Bill will contribute in no small way to the realization of a bigger and better horse industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all under a debt of gratitude to the survey team who produced the report on which to a large measure this Bill was based. The report is an excellent one and the Bill itself is highly acceptable to most people also.</P>
      <P>In case we are accused of rushing things, it says in the report of the survey team that the team was appointed in January, 1965 and the report of this team was signed on 11th May, 1966. Therefore four years elapsed before we got as far as implementing the report or putting it before the Oireachtas in the form of a Bill.</P>
      <P>It is I suppose to be regretted that we must deal with the Bill at such speed on the last day of the session.  I should like to quote from a speech delivered to the survey team by a former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Haughey, in January, 1966.  He said:</P>
      <P>In your work I should like you to have access to the widest possible range of views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the desire of the Minister who set up the team.  I feel it would be wise to carry that a step further by providing every facility for having access to the widest possible range of view not only among people directly connected with the horse industry but of every member of the Senate.  It would be worthwhile to hear the views of many more Senators than we hear from, many of whom would have a much more profound knowledge of the industry than I have.  I am happy to welcome the Bill and I want to draw attention to one or two points which convince me that there was a need to set up this survey team as well as a need to introduce this Bill setting up Bord na gCapall.  One thing which strikes one reading the survey team's report is that not all of the committees of agriculture submitted their views on <Col N="1569" /> the horse breeding industry to the team. Indeed, only 18 or 19 of the committees submitted their views, which indicates that all of the committees did not take the interest in this industry which one would have expected.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill proposes to set up a central national agency to deal with this matter it is very welcome. Another set of figures which are interesting are those relating to nominations and there is the statement of the team that different standards operate in different parts of the country.  They recommended that three groups of three judges be appointed and in this regard, in order to ensure a standard of something like 100 per cent throughout the country, I suggest that one judge from each group should alternate with the other groups.</P>
    <P>I also note that a number of people did not avail of the nominations which were offered.  In some cases the numbers who did not avail are relatively small while in others they are very high.  In one particular county 75 or 80 per cent of those who were offered nominations did not avail of them which must indicate that the owners of mares did not consider this worthwhile. In that regard the suggestion by the survey team about the amount to be paid to the owners of a stallion and mare which produce a light foal will do a great deal to help the industry.</P>
    <P>I join with others who have paid tribute to the Connemara Pony Association which is doing magnificent work.  In conclusion I should like to refer to one or two points in the address made by Deputy Haughey when he was speaking to the survey team at the beginning of their operations.  He said that he wanted the team to have regard to the development of the industry from the point of view of its export potential. Senator Cranitch read out other points with regard to the export potential which I find it hard to reconcile with another statement of the then Minister that we must not feel aggrieved if we do not always succeed in showjumping competitions.  Every good sportsman is prepared to suffer some defeats but if we do not reach the standard of horsemanship and do not produce the <Col N="1570" /> type of horse which can achieve success in important events, such as the Army jumping team have done, then our possibilities for developing the export trade will suffer.  While we must be good sports and accept defeat when it comes we must also endeavour to achieve the highest standards in horses and in riders so that we will achieve more successes than we have been achieving recently in international jumping events and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey in that address to the survey team said that it was the intention to appoint a consultative council but in the brown book which has been published the present Minister has given reasons for not appointing such a council.  I should like to think that the Minister might compromise by ensuring that the bodies recommended by the survey team who should have representation on the consultative council would as far as possible be represented on the board.  Some 20 bodies were recommended by the team to be represented on the consultative council.  I appreciate that the Minister has decided that his board will have 11 members but it would be a good thing if the Minister kept in his mind, when appointing the 11 members, the names of those bodies which the survey team recommended for inclusion on the council.  In conclusion, I wish to renew my congratulations to the survey team for the work they have done and the magnificent document they have produced. I hope when the board are established they will take for their guidelines the suggestions made by the survey team.</P>

      <P>I want to pay a well deserved tribute to those who took part in the survey and whose proposals have been very well received throughout the country.  I should also like to pay tribute to those who down through the years succeeded in keeping this industry in a viable state.  In the last few years the profit incentive was practically non-existent and during that period the industry was kept alive by those people and indeed the quality of the horses they were producing improved. This is a tribute to this small group, and they are a small group, interested in horse breeding.  Our best <Col N="1571" /> thanks are due to them and also to the farmers who allow hunts to pass over their lands.  Reference was made to this here tonight.  In the part of the country I come from there is no trouble of the kind mentioned here. Everybody knows that the hunt is the lifeblood of the half-bred horse industry. Without hunting it would not be easy to bring the young horse to full maturity in a reasonable time.  In these days of schemes for the eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis in cattle huntsmen must be careful to observe hunting etiquette when passing from one farm to another.  That will help to maintain the good relations established down through the years.  We all hope these good relations will continue.</P>
      <P>The proposals in this Bill are excellent, in my opinion, and I believe they will be well received by all connected with the industry, but there are a few points I should like to mention. They are probably covered under section 33 but, at the same time, I should like to mention them.  The first is the establishment of some kind of stud book or record book for the half-bred horse industry.  This would ensure that blood lines worth preserving will be preserved and also easily identified.  It will also ensure that blood lines not worth preserving are eliminated.  Our imminent entry into the EEC should make us consider this very seriously indeed because in France, I understand, and I know something about it, records of half-bred horses are considered most valuable and it is, in fact, difficult to sell a horse there unless you have some sort of record.  At least one Dáil Deputy referred to the fact that two very famous horses, Stroller and Mr. Softee, were bred in County Clare.  There is no record of who their sires and dams were, or of any other relatives they may have had, and so the blood line has been lost completely.  The Italian team which won the 1954 Olympics had four Irish-bred horses in the team.  Not half enough use is made of this kind of advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then the matter of research. This industry has gone on for years in a more or less traditional way from <Col N="1572" /> father to son and there has never been any real research as far as I know. The breed and feed and management of horses is something which should be researched into.  Possibly the board will do something about this.  Infertility was mentioned.  It was also mentioned in the Dáil.  It is a very serious aspect of the industry.  The figures mentioned would be enough to put the industry out of commission.  Whether this infertility is related to a management factor, or a food factor, or a disease factor, or a combination of all three, is something which can only be decided by research.  It is something the board could examine into in due process of time.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a school is a must irrespective of whether or not we enter the EEC.  There is keener competition all the time in the international sphere and, if we are to keep abreast, we must establish these schools.  They will help us in the jumping arenas in keeping abreast and will also create a kind of shop window for the industry.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the tourist industry.  Co-operation between the tourist industry and the horse industry would be a good idea.  Committees are to be set up.  I trust they will not be set up all over the country because that would defeat the whole purpose of the exercise but these committees could be useful in promoting tourism in co-operation with Bord na gCapall.</P>
    <P>The RDS is the greatest shop window we have.  By way of a small plug for my own county, the Munster Agricultural Society runs a three-day show each year.  This is a well-established show.  These shows could be made tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>The three-day event world competitions will take place at Punchestown later this year.  I understand the cost will be in the region of £20,000. This will be met mainly by way of voluntary subscriptions; there is also some sponsoring by some private companies. Bord Fáilte will come to the rescue if there is any deficit but it is anticipated that expenses will be met out of private subscriptions.  This sort of venture reflects great credit on the voluntary organisations connected with the horse industry throughout the <Col N="1573" /> country.  It creates the kind of shop windows we need.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to set up the board to promote and encourage the industry and to have regard to earnings and export earnings in particular. Financial aid will be available for this purpose and advice will be sought from those competent to give advice.  I am abundantly aware that these proposals will be welcomed by all connected with the industry.  I can reassure the Minister about that.  Up to now there has been little support for some aspects of the industry, certainly not as much as there should have been.  The people connected with the industry have worked hard down through the years to keep the industry alive and for very meagre profits.  Their tenacity and dedication will, I hope, be rewarded as a result of this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Senators for their contributions to this debate.  It has been indeed very helpful.  I do not wish to delay unduly and so I shall run briefly over the main points.  Senator McDonald inquired whether it would be possible for the board to assist financially in the sending of teams abroad to compete in international equestrian events.  In the current year a sum of £40,000 is provided for Bord na gCapall.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald and others spoke of the desirability of establishing a stud book for the Irish draught breed. My advice is that there is not an Irish draught breed, that this is a type of horse that must be found by selection. Its value and its basis as the foundation stock of the Irish pleasure horse is well recognised and it is one of the objectives of Bord na gCapall to help to develop this aspect of the industry. Senators mentioned the matter of infertility in mares.  I had some inquiries made into this matter and it was found that there was no intrinsic physiological reason for infertility.  It is the practice of animal husbandry that is at fault and it is up to the people in this business to see if something can be done about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator McDonald when he said that the pony business&mdash;especially ponies for children <Col N="1574" />&mdash;is not a paying proposition.  There is a tremendous growth of interest in the matter of providing ponies for children and it is useful training for them to become proficient horsemen and horsewomen.  This is a profitable sideline for many farmers.</P>
    <P>Senators mentioned the vital part the small producer has to play in this industry.  I am conscious of the fact that this Bill deals particularly with the man who perhaps keeps one mare and breeds from her.  It is important to realise that this kind of farming background is the source from which we get the famous Irish hunters, jumpers and three-day eventers.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald made reference to horses used with caravans.  This matter does not come within the scope of this Bill but I accept the validity of the point he raised.  Horses that have not been found satisfactory for breeding purposes might be used in this connection. I agree that the treatment to which such animals may unwittingly be subjected by inexperienced people may be quite severe.  It is not within the ambit of this Bill to deal with this matter; there is legislation to deal with ill-treatment of animals, whether deliberate or not.  I have a feeling that perhaps the horses used in the caravan business may be quite used to dealing with inexperienced humans and are quite intelligent about it.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred to the question of safety of riders.  This would be dealt with in the section of the Bill that refers to riding establishments. Horse riding carries an element of risk and if people do not want to take this risk they should play croquet instead. Avoidable risk can be met by the provision of proper equipment for animals available at riding establishments.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan mentioned the desirability of the revival of the corps known as the Marc Sluagh.  This would be a matter for the Department of Defence but in any event it could be considered by the board.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald expressed unease about the intention of the Minister to retain the right to nominate the chairman of Bord na gCapall.  I mentioned in my Second Reading speech that in this business of horse breeding there is <Col N="1575" /> one essential requirement.  Continuity is required in order to produce competent show jumpers and hunters because it is a process that continues over several years and it is also essential that there should be continuity in the matter of advice.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to various matters about the Racing Board but this is a matter for the Department of Finance and does not come within the ambit of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald and others referred to the matter of tatooing of horses in order to trace their identity. The Department is considering a scheme for the identification of mares and their foals by other means, by the taking of the most detailed descriptions of animals and all identification marks and the advice of the Horse Board will be of value.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald mentioned the payments made to the Connemara Pony Society.  A special payment of £1,000 was made this year to the society for the International Conference of Connemara Societies and another sum of £2,000 was made for the development of showgrounds.  There is no change in the usual annual grant of £1,000.</P>
    <P>Some Senators mentioned that stallions are badly kept and that it might be desirable in the off-season to stable them in a central place.  I do not agree with this idea.  I am sure Senator McDonald and others are aware that the kind of person who keeps stallions usually has great skill in the handling of horses and I do not accept that there is widespread mismanagement of these horses.  If that was the case it would be a matter for the board to see this was put right.  All establishments where stallions are kept are periodically inspected.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly mentioned something about the location of Irish draught sires.  My note about this is that one was located and subsequently an offer was made to a second man who was recommended by the Meath County Committee of Agriculture.  The committee asked for a subsidy to cover travelling expenses for the stallion <Col N="1576" /> owner.  This was not given because it is normal for stallions of that type to travel.  I do not want to delay the House any longer as the time is going on, and I understand we are going to finish the Bill to night.</P>

I feel that as an arm of the Legislature which we are it is impossible to deal with the Committee Stage of this Bill at this hour and to give opinions on amendments.

      <P>I have sat here all day expecting to finish this business. I am damned if I am going to give way at this hour whether I have to sit here until 6 o'clock or not.  I have kept Members on this side here all day. There are certain rights and privileges which Members of this House have and certain rights and privileges which the staff of the Oireachtas have.  I want to tell Senators who are new to this House that for many years we have been faced with the same dilemma. Every time August comes around we are thrown a load of Bills by the Dáil. We are supposed to get rid of those Bills by sitting here during the month of August.  This year we on this side of the House made up our minds that we are getting out of here before the 1st August.  We are going to make every effort we can to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say something about the remarks being made by Senator Ó Maoláin.  I hope on reflection he will agree with me that very great tribute is due to the work which Senator McDonald has put into this Bill.  The excellence of his preparation and the work he has done in connection with this Bill is evidenced in his Second Reading speech.  I want to make it quite clear as Senator McDonald himself will do that he was speaking on this Bill as the Fine Gael spokesman on agriculture in this House.  In what he said he was representing the views of Fine Gael Senators. He was representing those views partly as a result of the work done by other Fine Gael Senators and other members of the Fine Gael Party at Fine Gael agricultural committee meetings.  I <Col N="1578" /> would like Senator Ó Maoláin to withdraw the suggestion that other Members of the Fine Gael Party are not taking an interest in the Bill.  Quite apart from the very excellent and comprehensive contribution made by Senator McDonald there were, I think the Minister was good enough to acknowledge, a series of worthwhile contributions made by Senator Denis Farrelly and Senator Andy O'Brien. Were it not for the desire to try to facilitate matters and allow in particular Senator McDonald who has done such tremendous work on the Bill and wants to move amendments, it is quite certain that many other Senators on this side of the House whether they are city or country Senators would have contributed to the debate.  I would strongly resent any suggestion that there was any lack of attention or lack of concern with regard to this matter by Fine Gael Senators.</P>

If there is something he can do to prevent a avalanche of work coming from the Dáil at the end of July I am quite sure the Leader of the House will have the co-operation of all Senators.  The Leader of the House made a suggestion which he may not have intended to be interpreted in the way I interpreted it.  He said we were held up here by the contributions made during the day.  I do not think there was anything said about the Tourist Bill that could have been left unsaid.  I have been in attendance all day with a few exceptions when I had appointments outside and I have contributed to the best of my ability on the discussion about the proposed setting up of a Horse Industry Board.  As Senator O'Higgins pointed out a good deal of the work was done by Senator McDonald but it is also true to say that the Senator got some assistance from those of us who formed a committee on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my regret to Senator O'Brien and to Senator Farrelly.  They made worthwhile contributions, as did Senator McDonald.  When the House began its labours the day before yesterday I <Col N="1579" /> indicated that it was the intention to finish all the business on the Order Paper so that the House could rise this week.  I see no reason why Senators should be surprised at this.  This is not the first time we have had a late sitting in this House.  We had many late sittings particularly at this time of the year.  In an effort to facilitate Members with holiday arrangements, we have had late sittings in order to finish the job.  I have not made arrangements which would take me away even if I had to sit here until next week.  There are Members who have spent the whole day here in the belief that we were going to finish this Bill and they could then leave late tonight or first thing in the morning.  I do not think it is fair to alter the arrangements.  In view of the fact that Senator McDonald and other Senators admitted that there were only a few points in the Bill on which they had any questions I cannot see why we could not finish this Bill in an hour and go home.</P>

I cannot see why we cannot leave the Committee Stage of this Bill until October or November.  It will not make that much difference.  There are 34 sections and, being optimistic, they could not be dealt with at the rate of one a minute.  We feel we can improve this legislation.  This type of legislation will not be before the Oireachtas again for many years.  It is important that if we are going to help this industry we should do a good job.  Why rush the business along?

      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that in the report of the body set up to inquire into the horse breeding industry, Recommendation No. 38 suggested the establishment of a consultative council. I find a similar recommendation in the famous Brown Book published by the Department two years previously. Therefore, there are two sources which recommended the appointment of a consultative council.  Perhaps the Minister might like to elaborate as to why he has at this stage decided against having a consultative council, particularly in view of the fact that the Department's Brown Book recommended the establishment of such a body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of arriving at the most efficient method of improving the pleasure horse and the pleasure horse trade.  The establishment of a consultative council, in my view, would be unduly cumbersome and <Col N="1583" /> might impede rather than exploit the objectives of the Bill.  For that reason the establishment of the board acting as an executive and an advisory board would be the most direct and expeditious way of dealing with it.  That is the main reason why I think the consultative council would clutter the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the survey team which was statutorily established and which did a wonderful job, recommended strongly this course and it is also in the Department's Brown Book.  These are two authoritative sources and I would not expect either source to have made the recommendation lightly.  I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>Section 6 provides that the board shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and power to sue and be sued in the corporate name.  I know that in section 14 there is power for the board to maintain and equip offices.  I think I am correct in saying that there is no obligation on the board under the Bill to maintain a registered office as such and I am wondering (1) if that is necessary and (2) if it is not necessary, what is the appropriate precedent for the serving of notices on the board if that should arise?  The Minister will be aware that normally the procedure is that where a registered office is maintained, notices are usually served at that registered office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the validity of the reply but where a company <Col N="1584" /> is not a company registered under the Companies Act, would it not seem to be the position that the legislation establishing it should cover such matters as where notices should be served? The Minister is correct in what he said.  If a registered office is maintained by virtue of the incorporation of the company under the Companies Act of 1963, there would, by reason of its incorporation, be automatic provision for the serving of documents at their registered office.  As the Minister pointed out, the Companies Act is not applicable here.  In those circumstances should not there be provision in the legislation for some place where the board can be served?</P>

      <P>There is no essential difference between this provision and the similar provisions for other boards under the aegis of my Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied, and I want to quote paragraph 44.  It states:</P>
      <P>The Team envisage that the Irish Horse Board would have a number of sub-committees dealing with various aspects of the board's work, e.g., breeding, training, rules, fixtures, publicity and marketing.  Membership of these sub-committees would not be confined to the board members but would be open to all those with an interest in the industry or with expertise in a particular field. The Team consider it desirable that members of these sub-committees should be unpaid voluntary workers.</P>
      <P>The point is that such a council would be representative of all interested sections.  That would be an excellent way of recruiting members of the board.  If we are to have full co-operation we must have everybody in the industry feeling that they have some direct link with and some part to play in the work of the board.  There are people who think there are rings in the present Racing Board and I should hate to hear of the same thing being thought of this board.  Could the Minister look at this between now and Report Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern of Senator McDonald and I should like to acknowledge the genuineness of his concern but I feel that under section 25 of this Bill adequate provision is made in this regard where the board is empowered to set up sub-committees consisting of people with possibly a specialised knowledge of one particular aspect of the horse industry.  It may be felt that the availing of specialised skill may be necessary and it can be called in under section 25.  I would draw the Senator's attention to the recommendation in the <Col N="1586" /> report though it is somewhat vaguely worded in that it says it might be a good idea; it did not positively state that it ought to be done.  It is my feeling that the provisions made under section 25 would adequately deal with this.  It is of course the function of the board, as the House knows, to ensure that the horse industry as a whole progresses as rapidly and as favourably as possible and it is their business to procure this result by the best means possible.  This is one of the means they have at their disposal.  They can if they want to set up sub-committees to deal with special problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that the setting up of a number of sub-committees would add to rather than take away from the complexity of the set-up?  If the House would read down the list of the various organisations which this survey team recommended should be represented on this consultative council it would be seen that they include the Bloodstock Breeders, the Horse Owners' Association, Bord Fáilte, Connemara Pony Breeders' Society, Córas Trachtála, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defence, An Foras Talúntais and so on.  It is a very admirable and comprehensive list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very long but for that reason it is not admirable.  The equipment provided by this Bill is a better means by which the board and the Minister can avail of the best advice in the matter of horse breeding and so on than the large and long-ranging suggestion of the Senator.  He will probably agree with me when I say that if there is a large consultative council, representative of pretty well everybody in the business they will be so numerous they will be practically ineffective.  For the purposes of the Horse Bill expedition will be quite important and it will be equally important for Bord na gCapall to act quickly and to establish quickly such sub-committees as they may feel most competent to deal with a particular matter they want dealt with.  I feel the consultative council is a cumbersome method that we can readily dispense with.  It could give rise to unnecessary <Col N="1587" /> delays in the expansion of the board's business.</P>

      <P>Section 33 gives the Minister power by order to assign to the board or transfer to the board any powers conferred on the Minister under Part III of the Bill.  I should like to find out if it is intended to transfer to the board the functions conferred by Part III on the Minister in sections 26 and 30.  Section 26 is the one which authorises the Minister to make regulations with regard to certain matters and section 30 is the one which authorises officers to make inspection of premises and so on.

What we are aiming at is a hard-hitting task force which will organise and direct the breeding of the <Col N="1591" /> Irish pleasure horse.  After great cogitation and after consulting with the expert and dedicated people in the Department of Agriculture, who have dealt with this over a number of years, I think the figure proposed is the best one.</P>

      <P>The business of horse breeding is, as I mentioned earlier, a long-term business.  The board, having been established and having, as it were, knit together, should be left together as a team for at least that period.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to put the team together and it is his responsibility likewise to ensure that the best possible people are appointed to the board.  Having done that, I do not think five years an excessive period remembering that horse breeding is a long-term business.  It would be a shame to disperse the team, change it, or alter it before any concrete work was done.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister on that.  In subsection (9) we say a member of the board or of any committee established by the board shall be paid such allowances or expenses as the Minister considers reasonable.  That would militate, I think, against good young men serving on the board because they could not, perhaps, afford the time.  I suggest these people should be paid some kind of salary.  I know excellent people who could not afford the time to serve on the board just for expenses.</P>

The matter was also discussed at some length in the Dáil and, in the end, it was agreed to accept the recommendation of the survey team that no emolument as such should be paid to the members of the board.  I hope the people serving on this board will represent&mdash;let us be honest about it&mdash;the poor producer, the producer who is quite likely to be a man of very modest means.  It might be a big sacrifice for such a man to serve on the board, but <Col N="1592" /> I think we can get him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I think I am right in saying there is no penalty provided in the Bill for a member who does not act in accordance with what is required under this section. Section 11 states:</P>
      <P>A member of the board who has&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any interest in any company with which the Board proposes to make any contract, or</P>
      <P>(b)  any interest in any contract which the Board proposes to make, shall disclose to the Board the fact of the interest and the nature thereof and shall take no part in any deliberation or decision of the Board relating to the contract, and the disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the type of persons the Minister will propose to appoint to this board will act in a way <i>mala fide</i> in relation to a contract but it appears to me to be rather beating the air solemnly to provide in legislation that people will do certain things&mdash;in this case to declare an interest if they have one&mdash;without at the same time providing some form of sanction should the people be in breach of what is required.  I appreciate that under section 8 the Minister has the remedy of removing a member from office and, no doubt, if he were to find out a member had an interest which he had not declared he would remove him.  That is not enough to make section 11 solid or to give it teeth.  If a member of the board has an interest in a company with which the board proposes to make a contract, or has an interest in a contract the board proposes to make, if he does not declare that interest and consequently makes a substantial profit out of the transaction, there is nothing in this Bill to safeguard the board or the public interest by requiring or authorising <Col N="1597" /> the Minister or the board to obtain a recoupment of any profit made in that way.  Under the terms of section 11 the intention is that no such undisclosed profit should be made.  It is abundantly clear that the whole purpose of section 11 is to provide for that.  Obviously, if a member of a board declares an interest it may be that the board, and this is implicit in the section, will decide that the nature of the interest or even the nature of the contract is not of sufficient consequences and is not going to result in gain or profit to the member. The board may very well come to the decision that all they need to do is to record the fact that the declaration of interest has been made and take no further step in the matter.  The section does require that once the declaration of interest has been made the member will not play any further part in the deliberations.  I am concerned here about the case where a member of the board has an interest, refuses to declare it and by reason of not declaring it he obtains considerable gain or profit.  What is going to be done about that?</P>

I sympathise with the <Col N="1598" /> Minister because he is going to find it hard to get 11 members who are either not interested in horse breeding or horse dealers.  The difficulty is that some of these people may be in a position to make a profit from a contract entered into with some firm.  The Minister should safeguard himself by saying that if there is a breach of contract the person concerned will be fined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The action that would be taken is that the board would have to remove that particular member from office.  If such a contract were being contemplated by the board and a member of the board did not declare his interest in the company concerned that fact would probably be known by other members of the board.  As the board is voluntary and unpaid it would be rather contradictory for the Minister to say that he wanted to avail of their services but if they did anything wrong they would be penalised or fined. There is an element of human risk here but I think it is better to take that risk rather than threaten the person whose services are being given for nothing.</P>

      <P>Is it not generally accepted that it is bad law to enact a law which is not going to be enforceable? I appreciate the argument the Minister has made.  The point is that other members of the board may not know of a particular member's interest in a particular company.  I recognise fully the Minister's reluctance to have a situation where he is seeking voluntary assistance but at the same time letting the people giving this voluntary assistance know that if they put a foot wrong he will penalise them.  I do not think it would be unreasonable to make provision in case non-disclosure results in a member making a profit.  Provision should be made in the Bill that such profit would be recoverable from the member, or something of that sort leaving out entirely any question of penalties by way of fine or imprisonment. If the Minister is reluctant to put teeth into the section it would be better to drop the section completely or change the wording.</P>

      <P>In subsection (7), lines 5 and 6, to delete &ldquo;unless the Minister otherwise directs,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have put down this amendment because in all committees and organisations a quorum is either a quorum or it is not.  I cannot visualise in what circumstances the Minister would find himself making an order or giving a direction that the quorum would be more or less than five.  The only situation that I can think of that might arise is if there was a walk-out and eight out of the eleven members of the board walked out leaving only three.  I am sure the Minister has good reason for this subsection but I do not know of any other case in which a Minister has sought powers to give a direction such as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accepted an amendment on this particular subsection in the Dáil.  The Bill originally suggested that the quorum be three. Obviously, there must be a quorum in any group.  It is readily conceivable in <Col N="1600" /> certain circumstances where business must be transacted with great expediency in order to purchase a valuable horse and due to bad weather conditions or in the case of an epidemic it may be impossible for certain members of the board to travel in order to make a decision.  With some reluctance I accepted an amendment from the Dáil that the quorum be five unless otherwise stated by the Minister.  The Minister will have to have valid reasons for changing the number of the quorum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister realises all sorts of difficulties may arise if this particular subsection is left as it stands?  Senator McDonald is trying to obtain a degree of certainty in relation to the meetings of the board by providing a definite fixed number for the quorum.  This is one way of approaching it and certainly to my mind it would be preferable rather than leaving the subsection in the uncertain state in which it stands.  If the Minister is not prepared to go along with Senator McDonald I would ask him to consider providing by way of amendment himself that in any event the quorum should not be less than a certain number.  It is not the Minister's intention or Senator McDonald's intention that counts; it is what is written into the subsection that counts.  The Minister is proposing that the subsection should provide that a quorum for a meeting of the board shall, unless the Minister otherwise directs, be five. That means the quorum need not be five, four, three or two.  If the Minister will not go the whole way with Senator McDonald's amendment he should add to the subsection by saying the quorum for a meeting of the board shall, unless the Minister otherwise directs, be five and shall not in any event be less than three, which is the Minister's figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point about Ministerial direction was covered by the Minister in his reply to Senator McDonald.  As I understand the Minister's argument this is designed to meet an emergency situation where a quick decision has to be made and it might not be possible to get five members together.  The Minister did seem tacitly to accept Senator McDonald's argument that the <Col N="1601" /> Minister's direction may be given in a casual way over the telephone. I do not think that is desirable.  If the Minister is going to give a direction which will have the effect of reducing the quorum it should not be given in any casual off-the-cuff way.  In this subsection the Minister should at least provide that a direction be given by him in writing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's attitude to the original section and his attitude to this amendment. As I understand it a quorum is usually one-quarter of the total number. The Minister has said that the quorum shall be five unless he directs otherwise.  I do not think there is any precedent for the idea that the Minister should direct what a quorum under a particular Act of Parliament should be.  It is both wrong and regrettable that in a relatively unimportant section of this Bill a precedent should be set for allowing the Minister to alter the figure involved in the quorum for any board set up by legislation. If this section is passed it will set a precedent.</P>

      <P>The function of the board is to advise the Minister.  It strikes me that the only reason why the Minister wants this peculiar subsection is that we have had a record <Col N="1602" /> of semi-militant farming organisations causing a certain amount of trouble. It is regrettable that the Minister should have to create a precedent.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that either House of the Oireachtas has expressed doubts as to the Minister's intention in this regard.  I am quite sure the Minister for Agriculture will not try to vary the quorum of the board to propagate his own ideas.  Senator McDonald however has made a good point.  I am sure the Minister whose hands are so clean in this regard would never think of doing a thing like that.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt for a moment?  I am informed that the staff are physically unable to continue because of the long and arduous day. We shall therefore have to suspend the sitting.  I move that we suspend the sitting of this Committee Stage until 5 p.m. today.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the staff and assure them that it was not my wish.  I think they have been treated disgracefully.</P>
