      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes the Report on Full Employment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that in beginning our discussion of public affairs this morning we should begin with what might be regarded as the most important concern of all of us, that is the provision of full employment in this country within the least possible time. It is the birthright of our people that suitable employment should be provided for them.  I am sure that all parties subscribe to this.</P>
      <P>We may all utter platitudes about the provision of full employment but more than platitudes are required to achieve that goal.  We welcome this belated discussion on the very valuable Report on Full Employment which was issued by NIEC about three years ago. It is a sad reflection on the seriousness with which we are tackling the problem of creating new jobs when not only the Oireachtas but other bodies in the country have not had active discussion on this report during the past three years.  Therefore, I hope that here today we may rekindle interest in this topic and I urge all voluntary bodies with any concern for the national interest to devote considerable time during the next six months to studying the problem of the provision of reasonably full employment as a matter of urgency.  We should at least aim at the target set for 1980&mdash;the middle target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, many people would be forgiven if they were somewhat frightened by the report as it is written <Col N="346" /> because, basically, it is a report of economists and it deals with figures from beginning to end.  Therefore, it makes difficult reading for anyone not accustomed to dealing with economics. However, we shall consider the broad objectives of the report.  They are that our present level of unemployment, which is running at 5 or 6 per cent, should be reduced to a figure of about 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>We will always have some unemployment because of people changing their jobs and people being unemployable and so on, but if we could reduce the unemployment level to 2 per cent we would, in modern terms, be providing the equivalent of full employment. We must also take in the present level of emigration which is running at about 15,000 or 20,000 each year.  This should be reduced to an acceptable figure of voluntary emigration which would be somewhere in the order of a few thousand persons.  The figure suggested here is about 5,000.  If these targets were achieved, all those who wished to work here could do so.</P>
    <P>The report then goes on to lay down the conditions in which the planning should be done.  The first observation is that because we are in competition with the British labour market and with the intense mobility between the two countries it is regarded as essential that our level of wages should progress more or less in line with Britain and the continent.  That suggests that a figure of 4 per cent is necessary under that heading.  As well as that, we must be able to compete effectively on the export market.  Therefore, we must endeavour to improve the 1967 position.  Since the publication of the report at that time, the position has deteriorated.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are faced with the vast task of creating new jobs and of making available the capital that will be required for new industries and it is suggested here that 1 per cent per annum of the increased productivity should go towards that purpose.  If we are to attain the middle course here of increasing productivity at a rate of 5½ per cent per annum we are faced with a big task.  We have not reached this level before and few countries have <Col N="347" /> ever reached it; those who have, only reached it for a very short period. Post-war Germany, of course, was an exception but then she was under exceptional conditions as well.</P>
    <P>The best we did here was around 4 per cent.  At any rate, that is the target we are told we have got to aim at so that our people under this would have to work harder and more efficiently than they have done in the past.  In other words, the balance of payments would have to be kept in reasonable check and with increasing standards of living that is a difficult thing to do with a tendency to buy more imports, more luxury goods from abroad, and at the same time having less power to control those due to the development of free trade in the coming decade.</P>
    <P>As well as that, the question of the stability of prices and of real incomes goes on.  Again our experience of the last couple of years shows that is a very difficult thing to do.  We have to do very much better than we have done during the last couple of years in that regard.  In other words, we could have inflation in this country progressing at a greater rate than it is progressing with our competitors otherwise we would get into real difficulties.  There would also be much greater need for savings than there has been in the past.  We would have to attract in more foreign capital than we have done up to now.</P>
    <P>That is not a very rosy prescription for getting into this era of full employment. It means we have got to do everything better than in the past and therefore the whole thing will depend on the will of the people to face up to those tasks.  If we were at war we certainly would face tasks that would be infinitely greater than asked for here. Can we get the same effort in peace time when we are committed to the welfare of the country?  When we all subscribe to this it is something which should be taken away from party politics completely.  It should be recognised as one of our major national aims.  As well as the question of the reunification of the country the question of full employment in this portion of the country prior to that must obviously be our <Col N="348" /> main national aim.  That in broad outline is the picture presented to us.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into all the figures in any great detail because what is here is largely a mathematical exercise. You take a set of assumptions, you work from that, you get out results but by and large whatever set of assumptions are taken to start with the end broad conclusions will be the same.  We have got to do better under every one of those major headings than we have done in the past.  We cannot simply accept the complacency of those who are all right, Jack, who are in reasonably comfortable jobs here and are prepared to close their eyes to the fact that other people's children have to emigrate or other people's husbands have to go.  Those people go merrily on closing their eyes to what is happening around them, buy Scotch or buy breakfast foods produced outside the country, in other words, have no allegiance whatsoever to the fundamental condition for the creation of new jobs here, that is, the buying of the products of the jobs we have got.  Yesterday I stressed the way we have fallen down in that campaign over the years.  When we begin to get sophisticated on a Buy Irish campaign we sophisticate ourselves out of existence and the Buy Irish campaign is only a joke at the moment.</P>
    <P>We have got to come back and see if we can get those new jobs.  The authors here freely admit that this is only a blueprint, it is only setting out the magnitude of the task involved.  It is trying to jolt us into a realisation of the task.  The second stage will call for much more detailed planning and a critical look at all the sectors of our economy to know where the jobs are to come from.  At that stage I would find myself very much at variance with the authors of this report because I think nothing more than this report shows us the deficiency of the National Industrial and Economic Council as constituted at present.</P>
    <P>You can read through the list of distinguished signatories of this report, 20 in all, and not one of them has any close connection in any way with agriculture or its problems.  They would be the first to admit it themselves because for ten years we have persisted in the <Col N="349" /> ridiculous approach that agriculture is not included in our National Economic Council.  Trade unions and employers are included but not our major industry, agriculture.  I appeal to the Government as a matter of urgency to right that situation.  We have appealed in the past.  Where are the road blocks? I do not know.  They probably lie in the over-possessive attitude of the Department of Agriculture to wanting to create a miniature Republic of their own who say everything relating to agriculture is their problem and the rest of us should keep out.  The agricultural organisations who are far more progressive in their approach to this than the official Department policy have been calling again and again to have agriculture adequately represented in this.  If agriculture were properly represented in this you would not have in this document the defeatist approach to agriculture which ruins it.</P>
    <P>At this stage we have got to change our assumptions drastically because in the years since the war all our Governments have been trying very hard to get in more industry here.  They have succeeded in that, as you can see from the increased output in industry which exists and from the new factories which have been established. Nationally, we have lost ground because the loss from agriculture has been too heavy to be taken up by the new factories.  We have had 10,000 to 12,000 people leaving agriculture each year.  The best the State ever has been able to do has been to create that number of new jobs.</P>
    <P>Compared with 20 years ago, we have fewer people in employment today. That is a frightening thought. While we have evident prosperity, and we all know we are better off, surely the situation smacks of selfishness.  We have succeeded by pushing out some people from the nest and sending them away.  We should examine the cause of our failure.  The drain from Irish agriculture has to be stopped.  It has been forecast that Irish agriculture will continue to lose 10,000 people per year and that during the next ten years another 80,000 to 100,000 people will leave agriculture.  This is national suicide.  I suggest to anyone connected with the Government that no one who <Col N="350" /> knows anything about agriculture can subscribe to that policy.</P>
    <P>I ask that the help of the Agricultural Institute be enlisted that they be asked to prepare a blueprint for what agriculture should do during the next ten years.  The establishment of the Agricultural Institute has been the greatest single happening in this country during the past 20 years.  They have pioneered the way into scientific agriculture and have shown that we are only scratching the surface on the potential of Irish agriculture.  Anybody from the country will remember that 15 years ago the accepted standard was a cow to 2½ or three acres.  The Agricultural Institute today are having a cow reared on 0.9 of an acre.  Progressive farmers&mdash;I know many&mdash;are rapidly getting close to this figure.  A cow to an acre is quite a reasonable standard.  Our present net output from agriculture is only about £15 per acre. The doubling of that figure in the next ten years is a target which the Agricultural Institute considered much too low.  That is ahead of the target proposed here which only takes a liberal 3 per cent increase in the target per year.</P>
    <P>Let us hear the authoritative voice of agriculture on this problem.  Let agriculture take its rightful share in creating full employment by stemming the drain from the land.  Anyone who is worried about figures can be comforted by the fact that we have fewer people employed per 1,000 acres than are employed on a similar area in Denmark, Holland and such countries. We have less capital and our knowhow is less than theirs.  We are catching up rapidly, but we must have increased manpower properly organised on a system different from that in the past. This is badly needed.  We are calling for the 1970 version of co-operation in this country.  The co-operative centres must provide services, relief and otherwise, to enable the various localities to be developed.</P>
    <P>I must now speak on another facet. We feel we must be better off in ten years than we are today and we must have new jobs.  It is suggested that we must be 50 per cent better off in real terms than we are today.  That is a rather selfish approach to national development. <Col N="351" /> No sacrifice is called for from the individual.  If that extra wealth were in the people's pockets in the morning, an undue proportion of it would be spent on imported goods, holidays abroad and other things which create major balance of payments upheavals because the people feel called on to spend the major portion of their extra earnings.</P>
    <P>I suggest that though on the one hand we appear to have more money for many sections of our people, life is far more difficult than it was 20 years ago when more personal services were available.  The housewife with a young family or the person getting on in age was then able to get help with the household tasks.  If sick, such people were able to get help.  Those services have disappeared.  They are now the real luxuries in life.  If people have more money to spend, I suggest that they would be happier spending a great deal of that extra money on personal services.  Spending it in this manner would not create balance of payments difficulties.</P>
    <P>Those personal services would have to be organised in a more egalitarian manner than in the past.  No longer is the old masterslave relationship acceptable.  Such an attitude is not very conducive to the modern spirit.  There is no need for full time personal services.  What is called for is the organisation of such services on an agency basis where one can ring up for someone to come out to do a specialist cleaning job or some home nursing or any one of the other personal tasks such as skilled gardening or skilled work around the house. There are many personal services which people would be anxious and willing to pay for.  Such services would be the greatest security the State could have against balance of payments difficulties. When one looks at the number of households with this increasing affluence and calculates that if each one of those over one year used the services of one person for even the equivalent of one half-day per week such employment would provide openings for approximately 10,000 workers.</P>
    <P>In agriculture the amount needed for co-operative centres would certainly <Col N="352" /> more than stem the drain from the land.  These are some areas where we should look for real help.</P>
    <P>When we talk about increased productivity we should set targets on a local basis so that the workers in each industry and in each locality can take pride in the fact that they are doing their share to create jobs there.  A productivity increase of 1 per cent would mean only half an hour's extra work a week.  If the machinery were run for an additional half an hour and the products were sold at no profit either to the shareholders or the workers that industry would make more than its contribution to full employment.  I am sure other industries would follow this example.</P>
    <P>When we look at what has been done we can easily see what still requires to be done and we should set about remedying the situation in a practical way.  The Government should take the initiative and employ people such as Fr. McDyer or Mr. Con Murphy fulltime to deal with this urgent national task because simply playing around with figures will get us nowhere, we want action.</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in seconding the motion proposed by Senator Quinlan.  I agree that the report of the NIEC which is the subject of this motion is one of vital importance. I join with him in regretting that it has not been the subject of debate either in this House or in public to the extent which its importance calls for.  We seem to have a set phenomena with regard to this report and others: a white paper is issued by the Government, with newspaper comment the next day, and in the following few days we have an excellent TV programme on it.  In some cases after a due and decorous lapse of time, we have a debate in the Seanad but in most cases the rest is silence.  With regard to something as important as the subject matter of this report, we are facing a situation of utter failure if in fact those reports are merely commented on in the newspapers and spoken to briefly in either House of the Oireachtas, instead of being the subject of thorough public debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report we are discussing this <Col N="353" /> morning we have an outline of the magnitude of the problem that faces us if we wish to get full employment by 1980.  No decision of the Government, no resolution passed by the Oireachtas is going to bring us next or near the objectives and the targets laid out in the report.  Only a massive act of will on the part of the community, and on the part of major sectors of the community, will give us even a chance of achieving what is set out in this particular report.</P>
    <P>At this time we find ourselves with an excellent report, an excellent working paper on which we could, as a community, base our discussion of this very important topic.  As I say, there is a grave danger, after the customary procedures have been gone through, that this report will fade from the public gaze and be forgotten.  When I first took an interest in political matters some 20 years ago the question of full employment had come into debate for the first time.  At that time too we had the advantage of a most excellent report on which to base our discussion.  In the year 1944 William Beveridge, that great Liberal, produced his book on full employment in a free society.  In this country in 1945 a book on full employment in Ireland was published.  We should glance back in this debate and pay tribute to Arnold Marsh who wrote that book.  If we read that book now we can say that he was wrong about many things but we cannot fail to say that 25 years ago he was right about many things with regard to the problem of full employment in Ireland.  His emphasis was on the fact that structural unemployment rather than cyclical unemployment was the major problem.  His emphasis on the many particular factors that made our problem different from the problems of a developed country like the United Kingdom made that book an excellent supplement for our purposes to the Beveridge Report.</P>
    <P>Twenty-five years ago we had the documents on which we could have mounted a public debate on this issue but we had the same sort of firework display that we have been having ever since: the same sudden emergence, a brief discussion and then the matter is forgotten.  I remember at that time <Col N="354" /> somebody asking me what my opinion was about the relative merits of the various economic objectives of public policy.  I said then that I would put full employment ahead of anything else and nothing in the past 20 years has made me change this particular view. We could not discuss anything which is of more significance for the long-term economic advantage of our country and therefore nothing that is more important from the point of view of putting us in the position of being able to make the social changes we all wish to make in our various ways in this country.</P>
    <P>What we must face is not the desirability of full employment on which we all agree but what we must discuss and what must be discussed by others are the problems of the implications of full employment.  What, indeed, are the basic barriers to full employment.  What are the attitudes that must be changed &mdash;and many of them changed completely&mdash;before full employment can be achieved.  This is not something to be laid down in an NIEC report, it is not something to be spoken of dogmatically here in the Seanad.  It is, I suggest, something to be discussed, something which should be the subject of the interplay of ideas between groups throughout our community.  No small group can solve this problem.  This problem epitomises the challenge that we face as a community.  If we wish to make a better society in Ireland we will not be able to make it without solving this problem, and we cannot solve this problem unless all of us in our various individualities, in our various connections, can come together, exchange opinions, identify the road blocks, and decide how to get them out of the way.</P>
    <P>I have not talked of the Beveridge Report merely as a matter of history, because we can if we like start the debate, we should start it indeed, not on the basis of the NIEC Report but we can go right back to Beveridge and we can find there that the key problems which have to be discussed, the key obstacles to full employment, were identified there for us over 25 years ago.  Maybe we did make a real effort in the past 25 years, but we only went part of the way.  If we look back to <Col N="355" /> the Beveridge Report, in part 4 of that Report Beveridge talks of the importance of the three conditions for full employment.  He gives us the first condition as an adequate total of outlay, the second condition the control of the location of industry, and the third condition organised mobility of labour.  If we look back to what Beveridge gives as the three conditions we may see how partial has been our attempt to solve this problem during the past 25 years.  We realise that in fact what we have done here has met the first condition only.  The deficiency of total demand which did give rise here and in other countries to serious unemployment has been remedied.  Here we can see the reason for the success of the first economic programme, because the first economic programme managed to take up the slack in our productive capacity; but then we went on to the second economic programme and after that the third, trying to apply to the further problem, trying to apply to the complete problem, the solution which had enabled us to take the first step, because it is not sufficient merely to have an adequate demand in the economy.  Indeed we now find ourselves in the position that we have carried this too far and that at the present moment the demand in the economy for goods and services is greater than is good for the health of that particular economy.  But what we have not done is to solve the problems of the misdirection of that demand, and this is the problem which should be properly faced by us in all our economic planning from now on.</P>
    <P>The aim of full employment has been quantified in the NIEC Report&mdash; the reduction of emigration to 5,000 a year, the reduction of unemployment to two per cent of the labour force.  We look back over what has happened to our economy over the past 25 years or so and we can notice a peculiar phenomenon.  We can notice that the various times when the economy was making strides and everything was going well unemployment might come down, but there seemed to be a sticking point, there seemed to be a barrier round about the 5 per cent mark and we could never seem to get <Col N="356" /> through that barrier.  There seemed to be something to do with the structure of the Irish economy, something to do with the way in which the various forces in the economy were acting on one another.  Look at the graph picture of employment and we see unemployment decreasing rapidly and if it only went on it would only be a few years until we were down to 2 per cent, but we were then up against a sudden stop, a sudden barrier like walking into a glass door&mdash;nothing to indicate that the process of the reduction of unemployment should come to an end.</P>
    <P>This is an indication that in fact we were taking an unsophisticated approach in our economic planning, and neither can we assume that there will be a simple solution to this particular problem.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look back again to read what Beveridge had to say about this particular problem.  He talked about the mis-direction of demand, and he talked in his report about the comments which had been made in forgotten reports of Government Commissions such as the Barlow Report on the allocation of population and the allocation of industry in Britain, saying many things that were later to be said by Buchanan firstly in his report on traffic in towns which underlies so much that had been said in the early 1940s about the problems of increasing congestion and increasing concentration of population, and things that were said also in the Buchanan Report on regional development in this country.</P>
    <P>This problem of the allocation of industry must be faced.  Goodness knows we dithered on this particular problem; we have dithered in the past ten years about the problem of the allocating of industry.  We have changed our minds about the relative advantages of complete dispersal of industry and the development of growth centres. In a way this was probably the worst thing of all to do.  If we had made up our minds years ago we would have been able to take that as an assumption to go on with our economic planning, but to make no decision was probably the worst of all.  In economics as in war the dictum of Napoleon may well <Col N="357" /> be true, that it is better to do the wrong thing decisively than the right thing indecisively.  Here I think that we must put behind us all such indecision. As I have said at the beginning, this does not mean that we must take decisions rapidly.  They can only be taken after adequate consultation.</P>
    <P>The third condition which Beveridge gave more than 25 years ago as being necessary for full employment was the condition that we must remedy, the failure which has existed properly to organise the labour market.  This of course was obvious at that time.  During the war years, due to the direction of labour, unemployment in Britain had fallen to a half of 1 per cent.  Beveridge faced the problem reflected in the title of his book of how can we achieve something of the same order using the organs of a free society.  I have no wish to go into details on this point.</P>
    <P>Senators who have been Members of this House for some years have heard me speak a good many times on what I believe to be the key role of manpower policy in all its aspects as an essential tool in our economic development.  We have in the NIEC Report before us views which supplement those general views of the Beveridge Report of 25 years ago.  The emphasis is on education and on training; the emphasis is on the need for a settled and effective manpower policy; the emphasis is on the need for the development of industries which will not necessarily be capital intensive but must be skill intensive.</P>
    <P>All are an essential part but they are not the whole story.  There is need also for the conscious development of natural resources.  There is need for adequate finance which can only be met at the level which is needed by continued capital inflow.  We must recognise that we get an extremely high level of capital inflow from sources outside the country.  This level can only be maintained if conditions in this country continue to be such that it remains attractive for investment from abroad.</P>
    <P>In what we have been doing in relation to our economic policy, we have shown a lack of sophistication in our economic planning.  We have been content merely with the creation of <Col N="358" /> adequate demands.  We have been content merely with investment in a project which seems to be a worthwhile project.  We have not developed in our public planning and we have not developed as much as we should in our private planning methods of choosing in a hard fashion between the alternative investment opportunities.  Unless this is done the target laid down in this particular report will not be reached.  It does not matter whether we are aiming for the target suggested in the report or whether we are aiming for an alternative target such as that suggested by Senator Quinlan.</P>
    <P>Those targets will not be realised unless our decision makers use techniques which will enable them to distinguish in a hard fashion between the various alternatives presented but, above all, we shall not achieve what we set out to achieve unless this is made a community effort.  This is stressed in the NIEC report.  The report speaks of questions of motivation and of aspirations.  It speaks of the need for restraint and sacrifice.  We must have a conscious public commitment to changing many things in our present society if the objective is to be achieved.  It may well be that we must make conscious decisions to commit much of our resources to the very element of public discussion.</P>
    <P>If we wish to create in this country an open pluralist participative society we will not bring this about by merely making a push here and a pull there. If we wish to have such a society we must now commit some of our resources to public discussion.  What we say here for four hours this morning is a small contribution.  If nothing follows on the discussion it will have been a waste of time.</P>

      <P>Aontaoím leis an mbeirt Seanadóirí a mhol an tairiscint Sé seo ceann de na tuaraisgí is tábhac tach a tháinig os ár gcóir.  As I have said, I agree with the Senators on the other side of the House that this is one of the most important reports that not alone has come before this House but before the community.  One could say <Col N="359" /> that it is what we are about and what we are supposed to be about in this country.  It is not an easy report for anybody to read.  I am sure that if it were presented in a school it would make difficult matter for the classes, at least, up to the senior classes.  Nevertheless, it is a report that anybody who is interested in the present or future welfare of our nation should study.</P>
      <P>The report gives us an outline of the sort of objectives that we should have and to a great extent that we have before us.  It sets out ideas on the development of the economy for full employment.  As I see it and having studied it in depth my conclusion is that this objective can only be achieved in the main by industrial expansion and by improved agricultural development to which Senator Quinlan referred. The essential requirements are capital infrastructure in management and in industrial and selling techniques.</P>
      <P>In tackling a major problem such as this we must bear in mind the need for capital.  I say that in the sense that one can borrow a lot of money and one can put many millions of pounds into an economy but if the community habits are such that expenditure exceeds the norm, too much capital can upset the entire situation.  In that sense, what is needed is the necessity to curtail our expenditure.  In other words that there must be savings.  It may be said of some among all sections of our community that it is those who continue to be selfish, lazy and self-indulgent and those who lack self-confidence and initiative who restrict our growth and our growth prospects.  Nothing can be achieved in any community if the people of that community are not prepared to tackle the job with vigour and enthusiasm.</P>
      <P>I would refer to some of the remarks made by Senators on the opposite side.  When Senator Quinlan refers to a figure of 15,000 to 20,000 for emigration I presume he is talking about the report and the period covered by it.  However, the level has been nothing like that in the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the question of free trade.  I have taken the <Col N="360" /> view for a number of years that no industry will be competitive&mdash;I think this is something which is accepted by all sections&mdash;if it is to have indefinite protection.  It is a well-known fact that we had a situation where industry which did not have protection in the 1930's but when it got protection within a reasonably short period it lost its export market.  This is a factor which applies to both sections, management and workers.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the question of buying Scotch whisky.  I do not hold it against the public that they do not buy Irish goods: the problem is not that simple.  I know from my own experience that possibly one in 20 ask for Irish goods.  This is a very difficult question which I see in two areas.  You can raise the level of enthusiasm of people&mdash;Senator Dooge referred to this&mdash;for a time but it ebbs away.  You have the difficulty in Ireland with selling techniques and so on, particularly with the modern supermarkets, what I would describe as the non-Irish owned, that the goods are conveniently there that it takes a fair amount of moral courage to continually ask if the goods are Irish.</P>
    <P>I also see this in the reverse aspect, which is to sell Irish.  I see it on the home front as being something which I know has been referred to before, something to do with those who are doing the buying for retail stores and those who are doing the selling.  Again it is management and it is labour.  The second aspect of this matter also has to do with those who are sent abroad to sell for us or those whom we employ abroad to sell goods on behalf of Irish industry.  I do not know how far research has gone into this.  I understand there is considerable improvement in this regard but judging by the results which other countries are getting, particularly the Japanese, the Americans and the British, there may be considerable room for improvement with regard to the efforts being put in not alone by Irish industrialists but also by the State in what might be described as the exploitation of foreign markets.</P>
    <P>One of the strange things about human beings is that you can get people <Col N="361" /> to buy a thing here because it is foreign, not because it is Irish, but the opposite also applies.  People will buy something which is foreign to them, but which is Irish to us, because it is not produced in their own country.  This is an aspect of things which should be looked at and should be pushed right to the end.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to a loss of employment and said that employment was at a lower level than it was 20 years ago.  We agree with this but it is in agriculture not in industry.  We know that with modern methods agricultural employment will continue.  This is a pattern which applies to all developing countries.  I am not saying we should not endeavour to create a structure in which one achieves the ideal of having as many people as possible within the context of a standard of living on the land but one has to face the reality that a considerable number of those in agricultural employment must be absorbed in industry.</P>
    <P>I agree with the references to the Agricultural Institute&mdash;that they may have a greater part to play.  I believe there is plenty of room for further development here but I must insist that people are only willing to live at acceptable standards and we are unfortunate enough to be side by side with a country which has a relatively high standard.  We are competing against this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge referred to the question of newspaper comment, television and radio and I agree with him in this. We talk about this a lot and we also talk about full employment.  NIEC, which have done a very good job, produce this report, the press commented on it and then it is almost forgotten. There are good signs, particularly in the past five to six years, that their reports are not forgotten.  I agree with what Senator Dooge was referring to when he said there should be a thorough public debate.  I feel there is a greater need to direct education and stimulation into youth in regard to this type of problem, to generate enthusiasm in young people, to bring about the objectives this report is really covering, that is to make all of this country a better place to live in.  This is a generation of community spirit <Col N="362" /> and I feel this can really start off in our educational institutions.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Dooge when he said that no small group can really achieve this.  No committee or government can influence things in other than a marginal sense.  It is a community question.  It is a question for the entire community and really becomes a communications question in order to get to a position where people understand what is involved and where people understand in a conscientious sense that those who have not employment, or those for whom employment is not available, have their right to it. Whether they want employment is another question but they have the right to it.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge referred to the question of the location of industries in growth centres.  This touches on the Buchanan Report which I hope we will be discussing in the future.  This question must be more fully examined but it has not reached the concluding stages yet.  I cannot see any deadlines in this report.  It was completed about 1966. Looking back over the past ten years, I feel that apart from this city, Cork and other cities, our small towns show evidence of new life.</P>

      <P>Limerick is a city.  As one who may visit a town one year and then perhaps five years later I notice a change.  I traced this change in a number of places to the establishment of two or three small industries in the past five to ten years.  This is something which indicates a recovery of confidence among the people of that town.  There are other aspects, such as tourism, which indicate an improvement in our situation.  Tourism provides much ancillary employment.  As a result of the generation of energy in this direction tourism now employs approximately 165,000 people.  This is no small number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can look forward to increasing employment substantially in the afforestation section.  We are reaching the stage where plantations which were undertaken earlier are now reaching maturity.  This will lead to increased employment in afforestation.  There has <Col N="363" /> been an increase in such employment in the past 12 months from 300 to about 500 people.  Taking the long view during the next 25 to 30 years this figure should rise to something like 15,000 to 16,000 people.</P>
    <P>The report refers to the question of educational opportunities.  The whole question of attempting to achieve the aims involved in this report means giving our young people better and improved techniques so that they will be able to take up employment when it becomes available.  The report refers to the striving for equal opportunity by ensuring the availability of equal education for all.</P>

      <P>This is the type of report which one could discuss for a long time.  I will conclude by referring very briefly to something I came across ten or 12 years ago.  A visiting economist covering the world was in this country and his comment on it was, having looked at it at the end of the 1950s: &ldquo;This country will be a rock in the Atlantic in 25 years&rdquo;.  He thought it would be just like the Blasket Islands.  The answer he got was: &ldquo;50 years ago Switzerland was virtually a rock&rdquo;.  Nobody can foretell the future.  The question of what is going to happen to this country is a question for the people of the country and what they believe in.  The experience of the last ten years refutes the prophecy of people who think that only economic theory counts.  To me the thing that counts is the belief the community has in itself.  Our community have shown self confidence and belief in themselves.  I have great confidence in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>A discussion like this probably shows the Seanad in the best light.  Every Senator would agree it is something we can talk about generally with informed opinions and on which we can bring to bear any individual knowledge we may have of the various factors which make up the problem of unemployment.  The achievement of full employment is not a problem.  It <Col N="364" /> never will be a problem.  It never has been a problem provided society are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices. I am certain that if we were to agree to appoint the present Minister as a dictator and to give him full powers he would solve the problem of unemployment in a short space of time. To do this the Minister would need to be in a position to tell each of us virtually what we should eat, drink or wear, and what we should earn and what jobs we should occupy, and what we should import and export.  Conditions would be so severe that nobody in this country&mdash;knowing the Irish people as they are&mdash;would be prepared to make these sacrifices.  When we talk about achieving full employment we should appreciate the fact that full employment can be achieved provided the community are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices.  They can make the sacrifices by handing over their fortunes to an individual or a group and accepting the strictures and limitations placed on their freedom of expression, freedom of movement and freedom of choice to achieve this aim.</P>
      <P>The alternative to that, and the one to which this report lends itself, is the question of achieving full employment in a free society.  The difference between a dictatorship policy and the policy we follow of freedom allows us to do virtually what we like, to buy what we want, to go where we want, to take the type of job we are best suited for and to spend our money in our own way.  At the same time the achievement of full employment is the test which falls on every government in a modern democracy.  The report points out very clearly that we have to make sacrifices before we can achieve full employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For historical reasons the question of obtaining full employment is a more difficult task for this country than for most other countries of a comparable size and population.  The historical pull which Great Britain has for the people of this country and has had during the centuries makes the task of achieving full employment in an independent sovereign state all the more difficult.  I do not want to go back over the past but from the days <Col N="365" /> of the Famine there has been tremendous emigration from this country first of all to the United States and then during the first and second world wars to Great Britain.  This exodus has had a marked effect not only on the economy of the country but on the outlook of our people.</P>
    <P>We have, unconsciously perhaps, accepted emigration as part of the solution to our unemployment problem. This makes it all the more difficult for us to tackle the problem in a positive way because emigration has been considered the safety valve solution to our unemployment problem for many decades.  We want to achieve full employment by being in a position to offer anyone able and willing to work a job not only with an adequate salary but with a sense of fulfilment.  If everyone was prepared to accept £5 a week and do a menial job, our unemployment problem would be solved overnight, but to provide a man with a job which gives him a sense of fulfilment and an adequate salary is a very difficult thing to achieve.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge referred to the psychological approach.  I put this as pre-eminent in the conditions required to achieve full employment.  The need for more capital investment becomes greater as time goes by.  The cost of providing one man with a job in industry is getting greater every year.  An estimate of £10,000 which a few years ago would have seemed outrageous is now accepted as a reasonable cost.  We must be prepared to discipline ourselves and accumulate the necessary capital by investment to achieve the desired full employment so that if and when the necessary opportunities arrive massive capital investment will be available and we will not have to go cap-in-hand to the gnomes of Zurich or some other country to get capital.</P>
    <P>Capital in the first instance should be accumulated in one's own country. We should be prepared to make the necessary sacrifices ourselves or else the Government should take the necessary powers to acquire capital for investment. As time goes by the cost of providing jobs for men and women is going to become more and more expensive and if our accumulation of <Col N="366" /> capital cannot keep pace with this we are going to fall behind in the race and instead of our people being employed in this country they are going to be employed in Great Britain, France or Germany as the era of free trade and the Common Market grows nearer.</P>
    <P>Education must be bracketed among the prerequisites of any policy that has the objective of achieving full employment. <i>Report of Full Employment</i> sums up to my mind what our attitude towards education should be.  It states:</P>
    <P>The aim should be a society which strives after equal opportunity by ensuring access to the highest level of education for all with the ability to benefit which permits no restrictions on the entry to any field other than those imposed by merit and capacity to serve; and which fixes a floor below which none irrespective of their ability will be allowed to fall.</P>
    <P>I do not think a better case could be made for education and technical training than that.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have referred to the agricultural industry.  I sometimes wonder why this council was named the National Industrial Economic Council and not the National Economic Council with representatives from agriculture on it.  By naming it the National Industrial Economic Council we are in a sense cutting it off from the agricultural industry which must for many years to come provide a substantial amount of employment.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why we have had unemployment for so many years is the problem of the land which over generations has been a thorn not only in the sides of republican governments but in the sides of British Governments. For many years people accepted a low standard of living and worked on the land.  Young men and women were prepared to help on the family farm for a few shillings a week, quite happy to go to a céili at night and play hurling or football.</P>
    <P>It was a very pleasant society that went on until the last war, but the young people of today are not prepared to accept that type of society. They want to live a full life with an <Col N="367" /> adequate income and with opportunities, as I said a few minutes ago, to have access to the highest level of education, and if they are not able to get it in their own country they will look outside for it.  They discovered after the war years that England or even America were now only a few hours away and that it cost only a few pounds to get there, and if we cannot provide opportunities for them here they will get them elsewhere.  I do not wish to be a prophet in this regard, but that condition of affairs will continue to accelerate as we go into the European community, and if we cannot match the opportunities which will be offered in France, Germany, Sweden or elsewhere, we will lose our people at an even greater rate than we do today.</P>
    <P>This is why it is so important that the Government, which must be the guiding light in all these matters, must take the people into their confidence and come out with a far-sighted policy. They must have the courage if necessary to admit past failures and mistakes because there is no use nowadays in having short-term policies to solve unemployment by putting up a factory or giving grants or handouts or loans, however useful it may be as a short-term measure, if in three, five or ten years time those industries will not be viable.  It will only be putting off the evil day, and it is far better&mdash;indeed the Government must decide now that in planning for full employment they must take into consideration what the factors will be that will affect this country in the next three, five or ten years, what our accession to the European community will mean in terms of employment, what the impact will be on our existing industries, what types of industries we should be concentrating on, and what types of training and skills we should be giving our young people the opportunity to acquire now for the future.</P>
    <P>Too many of our employment opportunities in past years have been dictated not by economic but by political considerations.  It is easy to be cynical and to say that if you want to get a factory in your constituency you should <Col N="368" /> wait for the next by-election, but people feel that way about it, and that is why I think that however important those reports are and however important the establishment of factories is, that in the long-term the future success of our efforts to achieve full employment will be dependent on the role that this country will play in the years ahead as a member of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>We have also, of course, the difficult factor to contend with that we are in a very open economy.  The proportion of our manufactured exports as a proportion of the gross national product is far higher than in most of the other European countries.  This is something that will be a continual challenge to us. That is why I wholeheartedly support the point made by Senator Quinlan and Senator Brugha in regard to buying Irish, but I think that the question of buying Irish should not become just a fetish to buy Irish.  We want to buy Irish goods because they are as good as imported goods, not because it is a purely patriotic thing to do, which we all know.  We should be in a position to say that the Irish goods are at least as good as the imported articles.  That places an obligation on our manufacturers to ensure that no shoddy articles of any kind are produced in their factories, because sooner or later the time will come when the products of our industries will have to compete against the products imported, and if we cannot stand up now against that we will certainly not be able to do it in a few years time.</P>
    <P>I think that Senator Brugha, and certainly Senator Dooge, referred to the question of community participation, and here is a field in which leaders of the organised forces of capital and labour have a tremendous part to play.  As we continue into the 70s we will not achieve success in our aim of full employment, and worthwhile employment, for our people unless we can encourage capital and labour to participate together in that effort.  If they do participate together then we certainly will achieve it.  This will call for tremendous tact, leadership, courage and self-sacrifice on the part of both sides, but I certainly am optimistic <Col N="369" /> enough to believe that most of the leaders of labour and capital and industry are big enough to realise what is at stake and are prepared to come together in the desire to achieve prosperity and full employment for all our people.  If we do not get that sense of community participation it is almost certain that our efforts will founder.</P>
    <P>Finally I should just like to say that whatever we say as public representatives&mdash;as Senators or TDs, as city councillors or county councillors&mdash;although it is useful, obviously, as in a sense an indication of community participation, in the final analysis it comes back to the Government, and once again in concluding my contribution I do so emphasising the part that the Government must play in all this.  The Government must give the lead by laying down honestly and fearlessly the policy which will enable the country to meet the challenge it will face in the years ahead, the sacrifices which will have to be made, and show that the community will fairly share those sacrifices in proportion to each individual's capacity to contribute by his inherited skills or accumulated wealth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, while I say what I am correctly quoted in the newspapers as saying, that we might consider the experiment of having debates in the Seanad without the benefit of a Government Minister being present, may I say how much I welcome the Minister for Labour here today, because the point which I was keen to make is that I consider that general debates of this kind are extremely important in the life of the Seanad and the life of the community and it can be unfortunate, in my view, if from time to time important debates which can be held in a non-partisan atmosphere may be delayed because of the difficulty in obtaining Ministers to sit in on the debates, and we appreciate the demands made on the time of Ministers, which makes it difficult for them to get here.  That was the point I was making, and I think that it is very relevant to the report which we are discussing today, which is a report published in 1967.  We are discussing it now and I think that this <Col N="370" /> is the first full debate on the report in either House of Parliament, and we are discussing it three years after its initial appearance.</P>
      <P>Like many Senators I regret that so much apathy and silence has greeted the report, because I think that this is certainly one of the most important documents which has been placed before Parliament.  It is a document which can shape the future of our country, and certainly I was extremely pleased with the way in which the document was received and is being dealt with by the Government.  For example, I think that it was unprecedented that shortly after the report appeared the Government published a short summary of the report, &ldquo;Work for All&rdquo;, which they made freely available to the public and circulated through various influential bodies in the community.  This was a sign of how much the Government appreciated the wisdom in the report and how much they saw the basic message of the report, which was the importance of the attitudes of the community and of getting a response from the community in advancing towards full employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting, too, that it is conceded in the <i>Third Programme for Economic and Social Development.</i> This programme was drawn up against the background of the <i>Report on Full Employment</i>.  It is a step towards the fulfilment of the objectives of the report. This report is shaping the whole pattern of government and although I may be critical about certain matters, as the NIEC have been critical of us, it is only fair to place on record that there has been a good measure of achievement in so far as employment is concerned and that some of the figures recorded in the <i>Review of 1969 and Outlook for 1970</i> which was published recently show that in the year 1968-69 there was a total increase of 4,000 jobs in overall employment.  This 4,000 was over and above the 12,000 fall in agricultural employment.  It will be seen, therefore, that there has been a good measure of achievement in the year 1969.  In 1969, too, unemployment fell by 1¾ per cent as compared with 1968.  We are certainly on the right road although it is a hard road and I do not wish in any way <Col N="371" /> to underestimate the challenge before us.</P>
    <P>Some idea of the severity of the challenge facing us may be had from Paper No. 52 published in February of this year by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  In this paper R. C. Geary and J. G. Hughes had a look at some of the projections of <i>Report on Full Employment</i> and they had this to say:</P>
    <P>With the advantage of an additional few years hindsight not vouchsafed to NIEC we regard the attainment of full employment (i.e. 2 per cent unemployment) by 1980 or even 1991 (the furthest time horizon contemplated by NIEC), as NIEC suggests, as not realistically attainable.  The target is, it is true, physically possible in the conditions postulated (including &ldquo;increasing economic efficiency&rdquo; and &ldquo;the evolution of competitive costs and prices&rdquo;).  We cannot, however, regard an annual rate of increase in real GNP of 5.5 per cent as sustainable on average for 15 years, having regard to probable demand at home and abroad for Irish goods and service and the probability of recessions every few years (e.g. as in 1965).  This is only an opinion and we hope we will be proved wrong in the event.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Messrs. Geary and Hughes have inserted a footnote which roads:</P>
    <P>If, to achieve full employment the Irish people would be prepared to sacrifice a part of the increase in their standard of living otherwise attainable, full employment might transpire at a much lower rate than 5.5 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the message is one of sacrifice by the community.  It may be an unpopular message for politicians to use but it is the responsibility of all sections of the community to adopt the right attitude towards the development of our economic and social resources.</P>
    <P>It is extremely interesting that all Senators who spoke this morning have focussed their attention on matters of attitude rather than, as tends to be the pattern, on the statistical figures and <Col N="372" /> projections of the report.  I should like to say a few words about the shaping of attitudes.  One of the problems in this regard is that in trying to shape attitudes one cannot bring about a dramatic change in the community overnight.  This process is a long-term one.</P>
    <P>We shall look at problems concerning matters of attitudes&mdash;increased saving, increased productivity and so on and we must look also at the attitudes of various important sections, for example, the employers.  The Irish Management Institute held an interesting conference lately.  At that conference the debate centred around the entrepreneur attitude and the instincts of the effective entrepreneur in society. This is fair enough.  We need entrepreneur attitudes and instincts but the entrepreneur in our society and particularly in a small community like ours with limited natural material resources must also be a patriot.  The entrepreneur must recognise that not only is his business existing to make a profit for himself by the most efficient employment of his resources but that he has a role to play in contributing to the betterment of the community generally.  This should be reflected in his attitude towards profit making and in his attitude towards his employees. This is not too much to ask in a society like ours which is a small community with a Christian tradition.</P>
    <P>We must realise that our future one with another must be intricately brought together and we should all pull together in the face of future competition.  It is difficult to put this attitude across to employers.  It is not popular to put forward such an attitude.  Too often these things are said only from the pulpit where they may not be accorded the best reception but, nevertheless, in my view it is something that is worth saying and that should be said.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the attitudes of employees.  I do not blame the trade unions and the employees in an inflationary situation and in a society in which prices have been rising greatly for becoming preoccupied with the next wage round.  I accept the problem facing lower-paid workers in particular but I would urge the trade unions to <Col N="373" /> realise that they are in a position to give a lead in these matters.  I would urge them to realise that their duties to their members involve more than the next wage round.</P>
    <P>Trade unions can play a part in the welfare of their members.  For example, they could play a part by using their funds for co-operative housing for their members.  They could do much to create a better understanding among individuals of the role which even those in the most menial jobs can play in the community.  We are reaching the stage where, for instance, it is considered undignified to work in a hotel or in a bar.  People would view these positions differently if they had a better understanding of the whole matter and it is in this regard that trade unions can do a lot to help their members to realise that even in the most menial jobs they are all working together in the long term for the community good and that our individual prosperity is linked inseparably with the community good.  In this way, employees and trade unions could play a part in bringing about the aim of the NIEC report.  In the same way, too, our academic and intellectual leaders can help.</P>
    <P>Again, in present circumstances I quite agree that it is easy for academics to get worried about their status, to get worried about the demands on space in the universities, the size of their classes and so on.  It is easy for them to get worried about how the changing relationships in educational institutions will affect their future.  The academics and intellectual leaders in the community have a responsibility to realise that their voice plays a crucial part in the shaping of the future, that higher education and particularly technical education is of vital importance to the community.</P>
    <P>Even working in conditions which are not as good as they might be in the long run, the academics, who are teaching our technicians of the future, are playing a part which is the only way in which wealth can be created, which in the long run can lead to the investment which will bring about an improvement in the educational facilities about which they complain.</P>
    <P>Those are the attitudes of various <Col N="374" /> sections of the community.  The crucial thing, of course, is the attitude and leadership of Government and of politicians. I am satisfied that at least in documents like the Third Programme we have the correct attitudes put before the people but the Government have a responsibility at every opportunity to keep talking the message of the Third Programme and to keep trying to get it across to the community.  This is largely a matter of public relations if you like and there is little way in which the Government can intervene directly in matters of attitudes.  Some of the ways in which the Government can intervene directly have been referred to today, particularly the Buy Irish Campaign which has been criticised. Certainly at the moment it is totally inadequate.  I would suggest part of its inadequency may be that it is misconceived and that its message should be sell Irish rather than buy Irish.</P>
    <P>I would suggest if an opportunity arises that the work of the National Development Association should be reviewed. If it was given more funds and resources it might be orientated in the direction of sell Irish rather than buy Irish because it is decisions regarding imports and sales to wholesalers and retailers which are at the heart of the matter.  In the same way as a member of the National Savings Committee.  I am proud of the work they are doing on a small scale to encourage the proper attitude towards saving in the community.  Again in my view on the resources available to the National Savings Committee it cannot do as much as it would like to do.  I would suggest, if we are serious about trying to pursue the savings targets laid down in the NIEC Report and successive Government documents that a hard look needs to be taken at the work of the National Savings Committee.</P>
    <P>I welcomed last year the start of a national productivity year and I welcomed the MOVE campaign but it got defeated by the cynics of the country who dismissed this type of attitude and even sneered at this little slogan as the target for the campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point.  I did not refer to it because I think it partly misses the point and I think the Minister may deal with this when he is speaking and tell us that the Government are conscious of the need for agriculture to be represented on the NIEC.  However, the establishment of it as an industrial and economic council was fully justified because looking towards the future our initial need is first and foremost for increased industrial employment.  This is our major target and the emphasis was quite understandable and acceptable at that time.  In the same way I believe MOVE stood a better chance by focussing on the industrial field without moving on to agriculture.</P>
      <P>I should like, in conclusion, to reiterate my basic point.  I realise it may be a rather naive and an idealistic point but it is what we have to stand up here and say and what politicians should be saying at every branch meeting throughout the country, whatever their party, at whatever chance they get because in my view <i>Report on Full Employment</i> is political dynamite if properly used.  I should like to see it and the Third Programme having much the same role in every Irish community as Chairman Mao's little red book has played for revolutionaries in so many parts of the world.  I should like to get on the record two quotations from the NIEC report which underline the point I was making. First of all, the report states:</P>
      <P>Full employment with rising standards of living, reasonable stability in prices and equilibrium in the balance of payments, can be achieved in Ireland only if there is the will to achieve it, and the willingness to give it precedence over subordinate and sectional objectives.</P>
      <P>This is certainly the job of politicians to keep preaching this type of message in the community and not allow ourselves to be diverted by small interests in constituency problems at the cost of the overall national objectives.  The report concluded:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last resort, then, the questions raised in this report concern the will and conscience of the whole community.  To harden the will and <Col N="376" /> arouse the conscience of the community will require dynamic leadership and sustained backing from political and religious leaders, from trade unions, from employers' associations, and from all the other organisations and institutions which influence and form public opinion and public attitudes.  Without such leadership, particularly in the political field, the policies which will raise living standards and expand employment will not be chosen and implemented.</P>
    <P>This is a message for us all.  It is up to us in my view, whichever party we are in, to get across this message to the community.  The responsibility particularly lies on the Government and the Members supporting the Government of the day to push home this message and build up an attitude in which the community will be prepared under this leadership to help themselves.</P>

      <P>The theme for this debate was set in the opening remarks of Senator Brugha.  He said this was what it was all about.  It is apt, if accidental, that this motion should come before this House at this particular time and our thanks are due to the Senators who have put this motion down for debate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a situation in this country where there is a debate on what should be the national objectives and priorities.  It is my view that the priorities laid down 3½ years ago by the National Industrial Economic Council are, in fact, the right priorities and are priorities which were in the minds of those who signed the 1916 Proclamation and also of those who fought and helped to achieve our national independence.  They may not have spelled out their subconscious objectives in the same language as is contained in the NIEC <i>Report on Full Employment</i>.  There can be little doubt that all of them at some time or other, whether in field or factory, in parliament or cell, saw their hopes as an Ireland in which it would be possible for all Irishmen and all Irishwomen to secure employment and fair, adequate wages so that they could, if they so desired, stay at home and prosper in this land. <Col N="377" /> There are other legitimate national objectives such as the restoration of the Irish language, and the reunification of our country, but I should imagine that these should be seen as it were against the background of the priority on which we are speaking here today.  Let there be no mistake about it. So far as the Irish trade union movement is concerned, it remains true that that which was said by James Connolly &mdash;that Ireland as distinct from her people meant very little to him&mdash;applies also to us.  It is for these reasons that our colleagues in the NIEC put their signatures to the document which we are considering this morning so that the Irish trade union movement is committed to the <i>Report on Full Employment,</i> the principles therein contained and the paths to the objectives which are suggested.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that this document is a non-political document in the sense that it does not owe its origin or its contents to any one political party or to a combination of political parties.  The NIEC as at present constituted is representative of trade unions and employers, the universities and the Government.  I should imagine therein is represented many streams of political party thought.  I make that point because I think.  we should welcome the opportunity to discuss a document of this nature in the absence of political party differences.</P>
    <P>Too often, I feel, problems affecting our country are if not actually be-devilled certainly not helped because people feel that their attitudes must be in accordance with their political party thinking.  I have no time personally for this particular thinking which seems to indicate that if one is a member of one political party then whatever any other political party does is per se wrong.  I have always believed that we must be prepared to give credit where credit is due and equally to lay blame where we believe blame should be allotted.  If at times we get a bit jaded or tired, or if we meet the cynicism to which Senator Keery has referred, we must nevertheless remind ourselves that despite many difficulties there has been a fair amount of progress in this country over the last decade.  In the quarterly <Col N="378" /> economic commentary issued by the Economic and Social Research Institute in December, 1969, there is an article under the names of T.J. Baker and J. Durkan, it is stated:</P>
    <P>With very little doubt the 1960s have been the most successful decade in the recorded economic history of Ireland.  The population decline has been reversed and living standards raised.  Also there has been an impressive transformation from a basically agricultural economy, with industry serving a relatively static, protected local market towards an internationally competitive industrial economy.</P>
    <P>This article went on to spell out the improvements which are referred to in this quotation, the increase in the population in the decade referred to, the decrease&mdash;and a very sharp and welcome decrease it was&mdash;in emigration, the increase in the gross national product, the improvement in employment and many other improvements under similar headings.  In that record of that last ten years we should, all of us, take hope that though the targets set in the NIEC report are almost frightening yet together we may tackle them.  As an instance of the task suggested for us in the NIEC report&mdash; again I quote Senator Keery quoting from an examination of 1969 and the possibilities for 1970:</P>
    <P>The increase in employment from April, 1968, to April, 1969, is 4,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Report on Full Employment</i> sets us the task of providing a quarter of a million new jobs in ten to 15 years. We have a very formidable task before us.  We must accept that the document is based on very many assumptions. Assumptions were made that if we were to reach certain stages in the 1980s we would have had to have secured certain increases in certain areas at certain dates coming up to the 1980s. The document is perhaps not noted for its mathematical accuracy or economic forecasting but it remains a document of hope and commitment for the whole community.  It is noticeable that Senators have desisted from the temptation of quoting from this document. It is to be assumed that all of us have <Col N="379" /> read it.  If this debate does nothing more than revive interest in the report it will be serving a worthwhile objective. There are some comments which I should like to make, not necessarily in any particular order but that might be considered somewhat relevant to this document.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the NIEC have always drawn attention to the disability that the council suffered from by reason of the non-representation of agricultural interests.  In answer to a Parliamentary Question the Taoiseach has said that the Government have decided to broaden the representation of the NIEC so that it will deal with both industrial and agricultural interests.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the tasks which the trade unions might undertake in the attainment of the objectives set out in this document. I should like to think that our movement possessed resources which would allow us to encourage and co-operate with housing.  If anyone took the trouble to look at the financial resources of the Irish trade union movement they would see that we are the poorest trade union movement in the world. For every trade unionist in this country there is a fund of £5 or £6.  I assure the House that much as we might like to embark on activities of this kind our financial resources do not allow us to do so.</P>
    <P>The first priority on the moneys we receive from our members is for the payment of dispute benefit.  It will be a very happy day when we can say that this contingency is no longer necessary to be guarded against.  Unfortunately the first priority must still be given to the establishment and preservation of a strike fund.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest tasks suggested in this document is the improvement of industrial relations and the lessening of the incidence of trade disputes. However depressed we may get at the figures so often quoted against us we must remind ourselves that strikes of the nature we have in this country are only possible in a free society.  It has been stated in another context in another <Col N="380" /> country that when all is said and done they are a relatively small price to pay for the privilege of living in a free community.  There are no strikes in jails and there are many countries where there are no strikes at all.  If we want to avoid strikes completely we can make our country a jail-like community.  However, strikes do cause hardship to the workers directly involved as well as to the local and national community.  They should be reduced as much as possible, but as Senator Russell has said, there are no totalitarian powers vested in our Ministers or our Government and any suggestion that there should be would be strongly objected to by trade unions, and, no doubt, by employers when they were rationally considering such control.</P>
    <P>It is always very hard to change attitudes.  It must be emphasised again and again that wrong attitudes are the root of our industrial troubles.  To change the wrong attitudes on the part of the management and the wrong attitudes on the part of the workers requires co-operation between trade union executives and management, with the exchange of ideas and the development of new formula to help to avoid trade disputes.  It is for that reason we welcome the recent formation of the Employment Labour Conference and although it was formed for a completely different purpose&mdash;it was formed to consider the possible application of a prices and incomes policy&mdash; because of the close relationships between the two concepts it is obvious that the attainment of good industrial relations must figure very largely in their deliberations.  Even at that level we must warn ourselves that there are some people who feel that co-operation between labour and management is wrong. I have no time for that type of thought, our country is small and we cannot afford the class divisions which exist in other countries.  If we are to survive we must get together as a nation.</P>
    <P>I and my colleagues on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions welcome the formation of the Employment Labour Conference.  We hope it will be a step towards the betterment of our industrial relations.  Our industrial relations are wrong because of our attitudes which <Col N="381" /> in too many cases are dictated by traditions outside this country.  There are certain centres of our industry which are capitalist orientated and because of this they must promote and generate frictions particularly on the part of the workers.  It is for this reason that there rests upon the Government an obligation to keep under constant review all manifestations of industrial life.</P>
    <P>We have heard of what has been described as a mixed economy.  We have public and private ownership.  We have justified public ownership on the ground that there are tasks too great to be performed by private individuals and yet these tasks ate necessary for the sake of the community and they must therefore be tackled by the State.  I would presume to remind the Government also that it has also been stated that there are sectors of a nation's economy which are too great to be left in the hands of private enterprise because they place on the people concerned too great a power to be enjoyed in a modern community.  I am not sure whether I would be in order in referring to the present trade dispute in Cement Limited.</P>

      <P>I welcome the intervention of the Minister in that dispute and I hope that his efforts and the efforts of the person he nominates to end that dispute will be successful, but I would suggest that a dispute of that nature which has lasted so long, which has cost so much hardship to the workers directly concerned, which has caused such great losses to our national economy and stopped our building programme completely, should not, even when the dispute is settled, be let go into the limbo of the past, but should be examined by the Government to see what went wrong and what might be put right, bearing in mind what I have said, that there are sections of industry too great to be left in the hands of private enterprise, and the particular project of Cement Limited might well be said to be the life blood of our building industry which means so much <Col N="382" /> to our people in the way of hospitals, homes and schools.  I would respectfully suggest that there above all there should be an examination as to whether there is justification of Government control of that particular industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelGallanagh" hpid="Mr. Gallanagh Mr. Gallanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with Senator Russell that if we are to discuss employment we must only consider it in a free society and I accept that it is natural that we have unemployment and emigration.  We have those figures frequently in the papers regarding unemployment, but what can we put into the figures?  The figures include men who cannot work for some reason or other, people who do not want to work, married ladies who have given birth to children, people in temporary employment in rural areas, people in part-time employment in farming and industry who are entitled to unemployment benefit, so that we do not really get anything from those figures.  We have seen recently a photograph in the papers of a retired chief of police in the Six Counties going to draw his unemployment benefit although he had got a good handshake.  If you register in the local employment exchange that your mode of employment is chief of police there would be very few vacancies for that type of job so that it is nearly certain that you can assume to be unemployed for a good while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other thing is emigration, and emigration from Ireland is peculiar in this respect, that people will not travel to another part of Ireland to work, except that some will come to the capital.  Very few will go to work from the rural areas of the south or the rural areas in the west to the north or <i>vice versa</i>.  They go to England instead. This is one of the greatest tragedies, particularly when you get married people going from rural areas to England and leaving their families behind, even going to get married and after a few years leaving their parents at home and the parents either die or one of them dies and the other is taken away to die in another country.  Those are tragedies which must be considered in considering unemployment.  The real problem of unemployment here is in <Col N="383" /> our rural areas, the problem of people who are going from the farms.  I think, therefore, that the real answer to this is local leadership.  There should be more encouragement of local leadership.</P>
    <P>We must agree that we have come a long way by way of providing employment opportunities in rural Ireland.  We must agree that the figures for emigration and unemployment have decreased a terrible lot and we must agree that our people have shown a lot more energy towards this than they did in the past and that they are not as dependent as they were in years gone by in the rural areas.  If we can get local leaders in those areas, not agitators, who can inculcate into the people inspiration, giving them the virtues of hard work and its rewards and also giving them the patriotism that can get people to realise that the real wealth of the country lies in our people, then I think that we could get the Government to orientate itself in the way of local industries through those people.  There are too many people coming along with projects to do this, put up this industry here or there, too many chancers in fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly welcome the opportunity of discussing this report in the House, and I feel that the Senators who tabled this motion are to be congratulated.  I should like to confine my remarks solely to employment and full employment as it affects agriculture and rural Ireland. Unfortunately, in the past, when one spoke of employment one tended not even to think about agriculture.  Looking at the figures in Appendix V of this report we see a long list of countries and see that there is certainly a world wide decline in the number of people engaged in agriculture.  In Ireland and the United States and other countries, the figure is somewhere <Col N="384" /> around 25 per cent and in Great Britain there was a 20 per cent decline between 1954 and 1964.  But it is not fair to include our country with those other highly industrialised countries, because our economy is so dependent upon agriculture and on the agricultural sector, and for that reason I certainly was disappointed when the Third Programme for Economic Expansion more or less conceded that we must have a declining population, a declining labour force, on the land.</P>
      <P>I think that this was bad because it would have been indeed preferable if very drastic measures had been taken to ensure that the labour force would not drop any further on the land in rural Ireland.  I think that even the present aids to agriculture show little imagination.  There are what are locally referred to as farm doles for some categories of small farmers.  This has certainly served a purpose, but I should like to see them being a little more justly distributed.  It is difficult to follow the reasoning why one farmer on one side of the road can qualify for those doles and perhaps his neighbour cannot qualify.  Again it is quite common to see a farmer with a worker employed driving up to collect the dole while you see another farmer in what would appear to be poorer circumstances not qualified.  Also, the position of widows and spinster farmers should be considered, irrespective of their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people believe that the survival of agriculture must be through the co-operative movement.  However, there has been a co-operative movement in this country since the start of the century and while they do excellent work it cannot be said that the answer to our problems lies in co-operation. Some effort must be made to ensure that the wages of farm workers are brought at least to a par with the wages of other manual workers.  Nowadays, the work of the farm labourer is much more responsible than ever before because of the expensive machinery which he must handle.  His job has become quite technical.  He deserves a higher wage but the returns from agriculture do not allow the farmer to pay him this higher wage.  Perhaps some Government <Col N="385" /> agency could contribute to the wages of farm workers.  Some years ago a £17 rate abatement per farm worker was introduced but if this sum were to be increased to £50 it would still be meaningless in the present situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was £20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still £17.  That amount is paid to the farmer but it should go towards supplementing the worker's wage.  If it were possible for farmers to pay a realistic wage to their workers in line with the increases in the cost of living we would have more people working on the land.  There are many spheres of agricultural husbandry which require more manpower. The Government have a responsibility to ensure that these people will be retained on the land.  They should ensure that available moneys are channelled directly to the people who are doing the work so that their lot might be made a little easier.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Government on the income tax concessions for farm workers.  This is a step in the right direction but in itself it is not sufficient.  It is my opinion that another matter which is discriminating against employment in rural Ireland is that practically all Government Departments would appear to be biased against rural Ireland.  For instance, it is now difficult to have an isolated cottage erected anywhere in a rural area.  Local government policy would appear to be that all new houses must be built in villages or towns.</P>
      <P>Then, there is the closing of national schools.  Those happenings will have an effect of perhaps orientating the children of the coming generation, of bringing them away from the rural or parish setting.  It may give them an urban outlook.  It is difficult to expect people who are reared with all the amenities of an urban area to settle down in later life in a backward part of the country in which there might not be any running water or rural electrification.  I must say that great efforts are being made to extend both of these services but there are still many areas to which they have not been extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> It should be possible for this country to support more people working on the land.  One has only to drive through the countryside to see the unkept state of many farm holdings.  As a farmer, I know that so many matters which could be attended to in former years cannot now be reached.  Hedges grow wild because it is not possible to get people to cut them and also because the income from agriculture during the past few years has not kept pace with increasing prices.  Therefore, there is less money available to the farmer to enable him to keep his holding neat and tidy.</P>
    <P>With those few remarks, I hope that the Government will, at an early date, help to bridge the incomes gap between the people working on the land and other workers in comparable employment in rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time at my disposal, I can hardly be expected to cover everything that I should like to cover in relation to the problems attached to attaining full employment.  However, I should like to make some comments on the position as I know it and on the debate in general as it has progressed. I do not think that as a result of the standard of the debate and of the ground it has covered, I am called upon to defend the Government's attitude with regard to <i>Report on Full Employment.</i></P>
      <P>This problem has been dealt with well by each speaker.  It has been dealt with with a degree of responsibility and with a degree of acknowledgment of the problems that exist with regard to this whole question.</P>
      <P>The NIEC were set up by the Government for a specific purpose.  One of these purposes is, and I quote from the terms of reference:</P>
      <P>...to prepare general reports expressing the views of the Council on the principles which ought to be applied for the development of the national economy and the realisation and maintenance of full employment at adequate wages with reasonable price stability and reasonable long-term equilibrium in the balance of external payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" />
      <i>Report on Full Employment</i> is not the only one that we have had.  We had <i>Review for 1969 and Outlook for 1970</i> before the Budget.  As Senator Keery said, the Government produced an abridged edition of <i>Report on Full Employment</i> in simple terms for the public shortly after it was produced. This is all part of an exercise to make known to the public the importance of <i>Report on Full Employment</i> and the necessity, as part of achieving that aim, that the public should know as much as possible about it, talk as much as possible about it and aim towards it. That is part of the exercise which we are experiencing here in the Seanad today.  So far as it is part of the exercise it is I admit performing a useful function.  Senator Quinlan admitted that when he rose to speak at the start of the debate.  The only thing I would comment on is that none of the speakers so far have really produced any additional suggestions with regard to what more could be done in the matter of leadership apart from the suggestions about community effort and getting the community informed, which is clearly pointed out in the report.</P>
    <P>One thing which the debate clearly emphasised and what is set out in this report is that it is not a plan for full employment.  Many people regard it as a complete blue print or a plan.  The report acknowledges that and sets out in fairly clear terms what it is about. Paragraph 6 of the report states:</P>
    <P>In the sections which follow, therefore, we do not attempt to formulate a plan for full employment.  We are more concerned to state the problems, assess their dimensions, suggest some of the main elements of a broad strategy by which full employment might be pursued, examine some of the main obstacles which now lie in the way of its achievement and generally pose the choices which the community, if it wants full employment, must face and make.  It is our hope that this report, by enlivening interest in full employment and by contributing to informed discussion of the costs and benefits which would attend its achievement, will help to lay the foundations on which a <Col N="388" /> perspective plan for full employment could later be based.</P>
    <P>That paragraph clearly sets out what the report is.  It is an academic exercise setting out some of the obstacles to full employment and many of the requirements but it does not quite set out the role which should be followed. It leaves it for somebody else to formulate the plan to be followed.</P>
    <P>We have been fairly well served in this country in the last half century, and particularly in the last decade, with reports and with people&mdash;I was about to say who set themselves up as specialists&mdash;who are experts in the matter of predicting and formulating plans in matters which attain to our economy.  If we look back with hindsight on past predictions they very seldom work out accurately.  This is one of the things which are recognised by all economic experts that accurate forecasting is never very much on.  Accurate forecasting is not in fact possible because the economy is susceptible to so many sensitive winds of change, export markets and various other unpredictable things that the economist is very seldom found in retrospect to be correct in the forecast he has made. Nevertheless he can be very useful in giving some forecast for the future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Report on Full Employment</i> is one of the things which are just doing that. If it succeeded in stimulating&mdash;I do not think it succeeded in doing enough &mdash;a lot of discussion and thinking on the importance of full employment it would have in itself have done a very good thing.  If this debate can assist in the matter of that stimulation, being a little provocative towards that end, it too will have done some good.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery and some of the other Senators who spoke acknowledge practically all of the things which I had in my brief with regard to the efforts of the past decade and the progress made in that respect, so I do not think I need to cover the ground again. Everybody must admit that we have made very significant progress and when you mention a figure of 4,000 about 1969&mdash;somebody said in terms of what the report aims at that this is a fairly insignificant advancement for 1969&mdash;when you take into account <Col N="389" /> what has to be achieved by 1980 or 1982 this figure of 4,000 for employment in the year is not very significant. However, when you analyse the 4,000 you find the actual increase in employment outside of agricultural employment in 1969, was 16,000, of which 11,000 was in the manufacturing industry. The fallout from agriculture was around 12,000 and this is the means by which you arrive at the figure of 4,000.  One cannot anticipate that the fall-out from agricultural employment will be progressively 12,000 for each year although we must, in spite of what some of the Senators have said, accept the inevitable and be prepared for a continuing outfall from agricultural employment as the years go on.</P>
    <P>Some people say it is not inevitable. We may say more can be done for agriculture but while you have production on the land increasing and the numbers employed decreasing one faces the inevitable where mechanisation is taking over and the trend is towards other types of employment. We have to face the inevitable fact which many other countries are facing up to at the moment.  The numbers employed in those countries in agriculture is decreasing.  We would be foolish not to base our future guideline in moving towards full employment on the possibility of this continual outfall from agricultural employment.  However much success in the matter of full employment may be complementary in the whole general field of employment because nothing succeeds like success and if we can move more rapidly towards full employment we will automatically improve the home market and give to our agricultural producers a better home market which would be a very essential thing towards stabilising or arresting employment on the land.</P>
    <P>Every Senator who spoke has pointed out that the Government alone cannot successfully reach the goal or target set out in any of the report, particularly in the economic and social development Third Programme without the proper attitudes, co-operation and assistance of the entire community.  It is a community effort and it is something <Col N="390" /> which we have got to realise and in our seeking to obtain that co-operation we have to face very many obstacles not the least of which is the problem of emigration.  The last ten years showed remarkable progress, particularly in that the population graph was shown to have been upward tilted for the first time perhaps since the famine years.  We were not satisfied that the west coast of Ireland shared any worthwhile degree in progress because while the east coast mainly benefited from improvement in the population figures, some of our western seaboards showed a further decline, though not at the same rate as in the previous inter-census period, but it declined just the same.</P>
    <P>This particularly applied to places like Leitrim.  When Senator Gallanagh pointed out that the mobility of labour within the country is not as satisfactory as one would desire he was quite right. Our people in the west are as prepared to go to Birmingham, London or Liverpool as they are to go to Shannon Free Airport Development Company where plenty of work is available at most times, particularly for females.</P>
    <P>We have over-full employment in some areas: there is a shortage of female labour.  This shortage of female labour is mainly attributable to the fact that within the country our people are not prepared to move from one area to another to the same extent as they are prepared to emigrate abroad.  In my Department we have been concerned about this in the matter of manpower development which has been organised and has got well under way. It is difficult to understand what can be done.  We operate a resettlement scheme whereby a person becoming redundant and moving from one place to another is paid his expenses and many of the incidental expenses involved in the move.  The number of people availing of that scheme makes it obvious that people are not prepared to move within the country to pockets where employment is available.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the importance of bringing industry to where there is unemployment. I hope the efforts which the Government are now making to <Col N="391" /> lay greater emphasis on regional development in the matter of incentives for the setting up of industry will be successfully pursued with all possible speed and order so that areas of unemployment will be provided with industry instead of having industry set up in the larger towns and cities where housing problems exist.  The labour pool is in the west of Ireland.  In Dublin any further industry established must depend for its labour force on people from counties along the western seaboard.  This would bring further people to live in Dublin, leaving homes vacant in the west and creating housing problems in the city where many people require homes.  I am in favour of a regional industrial development plan which could not be pursued too rapidly in order to set off the imbalance of population on the eastern seaboard and which would give an opportunity to those on the western seaboard to remain in the areas where they were brought up and in that way to arrest the emigration drain, which has left these counties so short of population.</P>
    <P>Our rapid movement towards full employment in the last decade is most heartening except that it is not hitting home in the proper parts of the country. The fact that we found the labour force was not prepared to move within the country tends to accentuate the problem because it is necessary to bring to those areas the industry required rather than to expect the people to move within the country to other areas.  As I said people are more readily prepared to move to England or abroad than to move from Donegal to Cork or to Shannon or elsewhere where employment might be available.  In so far as Government leadership is concerned in the matter of full employment our Government are doing their part well. The incentives which are available to attract industries to this country are as attractive as can be found anywhere in the world.  Many industries are getting 60 per cent free grant against site development, necessary equipment and factory erection.  This is a gift which can be excelled nowhere in the world.  We are not the only country offering these incentives.  We compare favourably with incentives offered anywhere <Col N="392" /> else.  The tax-free exports scheme for a ten-year period is also a further great incentive.  The adaptable labour force available here is a thing which will tend to attract more industries.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Report on Full Employment</i> sets out some of the obstacles to our development in this direction.  One of the basic causes highlighted was the need for greater education in preparing people for industrial development on a large scale.  When we started out to give a stimulus to industrial development in the early 1930s we appreciated the long way we had to come.  We appreciate now the long way we have yet to go.  One of the things which was deficient was education and training requirements for an industrial background because we had not got, nor have we yet got, a traditional industrial background.  The one thing which people have not mentioned here in speaking is that we have done much to improve that situation and to provide better educational facilities particularly in the matter of technical training.  Our technical schools have become more numerous and more comprehensive in the scope of their teaching.</P>
    <P>We have established the ANCO training authority which is under my Department.  They are doing an excellent job in the matter of providing the proper type of training for industrial development and preparing people for the type of work for which they may be suited in industry.  The Irish Management Institute are playing an important role in providing management training which is one of the most essential elements to Irish industrial development.  The Institute have geared themselves in their five-year programme to a comprehensive scheme which will provide managers for industry in the future.</P>
    <P>This should contribute to a large extent to an accelerated drive towards full employment.  The manpower service and the career guidance service are services which are geared towards what <i>Report on Full Employment</i> set out to suggest as the lines on which we would need to develop.  Our progress in this direction is significant because these are fundamental things <Col N="393" /> from which must ultimately spring the necessary trained personnel which is so essential and desirable to industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of comment about the fact that the NIEC have not agricultural representation.</P>
    <P>That situation, as Senator Keery has pointed out, has been rectified.  I am not sure that it was all that important because when the NIEC was inaugurated it had a specific task to perform in the matter of industry generally.  It was faced with the problem of a definite decline in agricultural employment and something had to be done rapidly to absorb the people in alternative employment.  That was the background in which the NIEC was formed.  It can be argued that the Agricultural Institute fill the gap so far as agricultural employment is concerned and we have sufficient liaison between all the communities, commissions and departments to ensure that there is proper dovetailing so far as industrial development is concerned. However, the anomaly has been corrected and the Industrial Development Council are to have representatives from the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Senator Dunne referred to another obstacle in our move towards full employment. I do not want to go into the whole field of industrial relations now.  Suffice it to say that if we had not had so much industrial strife in the last ten years our advance towards the full employment which everyone desires would have been much more spectacular than it has been.  It has been said that the last ten years was the most spectacular that we have ever experienced in that direction.  I hope I am not too presumptuous in saying that I hope the next ten years will see an improvement in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the price we have to pay for living in a free community and being able to make our own choice about many things if not about all things.  The free collective bargaining has been the basis of our industrial relations unrest.  The different criteria used in arriving at agreements industry are purely on a voluntary basis, there is no enforceable legislation <Col N="394" /> as such to compel workers to accept or employers to do particular things.  We depend entirely on the voluntary free negotiating system which can only apply in a country with freedom such as we have here.</P>
    <P>These sometimes undergo very severe strain.  Sometimes people who are not familiar with the immediate working of the system approach me and ask why we do not use the iron fist and introduce legislation to enforce law and order in the matter of industrial relations.  If we did this it would lead to a system which would be much worse than that which we experienced even in the worst time of strife.</P>
    <P>One does not have to stretch one's imagination too far to visualise what could happen in a country where enforceable legislation is introduced to bring about that situation.  One only has to read the British newspapers to see how much the question of industrial relations as between free collective bargaining, the voluntary system and the enforceable system are being kicked around like a political football during the election campaign there.  The arguments about what should be enforceable and what should not change from day to day.  Any system we have must be based on a voluntary basis.  If we do not succeed in getting the right attitudes from that system then our economy as a whole will suffer.  We must get this message across to employers and employees alike.  Every public representative should point this out at every possible opportunity instead of trying to make political capital out of the situation at one time or another.  We must make the people understand that they have free collective bargaining and that the system depends on their attitudes and acceptances.  The goal of full employment yearned and desired by everybody cannot be achieved unless we get some measure of ordered discipline into our industrial relations.</P>
    <P>In spite of bad industrial relations in the past we have made rapid progress during the last decade.  The 11½ per cent increase in industrial exports in 1969 is very significant but unfortunately the 13 per cent increase in <Col N="395" /> incomes at a time when the rate of increase in the growth of national production remained the same must inevitably leave a very big gap to be filled by rising prices and further inflation. This gap has been worrying everybody interested in the attainment of full employment.  One of the tasks facing us is to get this point translated into simple language for all to understand.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have pointed out that this report was produced three years ago but that is not a relevant point because the report is talking in terms of 1982.  We have had a follow up to it by the <i>Economic and Social Development Programme</i> and we shall have reviews time and again.  There is plenty of documentation available for anyone who wants to use it but we may not be getting the message properly across to the people to whom we should be getting it across.  To put it in plain language until we have community co-operation with everyone playing his part without making undue sacrifices but certainly without trying to pick the fruit before it is ripe, we can then and only then reach full employment within the short time outlined in the forecast made by the NIEC.</P>
    <P>The debate here has been of the high standard which one expects from this House and if the debate has tended towards a further stimulation of interests in the subject and the bringing to the notice of more people a further realisation of the part which every individual in the community has to play just as much as the Government has in this matter then the debate here on this subject will have accomplished something really worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion I have had to speak in front of the Minister for Labour in this Chamber though I have had occasions to speak in front of him on other, shall I term it, social occasions.  I do not infer by that that I am going to make this a non-social occasion because I do not think that this is the place for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anybody has adverted to the fact that this debate has been initiated here by Senator Quinlan and that we are not getting <Col N="396" /> sufficient use of this Chamber to initiate debates.  We had yesterday a Bill introduced in this Chamber but I feel that not sufficient use is being made of this Chamber to initiate debates. We have also, I am afraid, not got an opportunity of showing off like the members of the other House because of the fact that they can ask Questions and get their names in the papers. The only time we do is when we are sitting in the Seanad and the Dáil is not sitting and then they have nothing to do but to report what the Seanad says.</P>
    <P>However, to come back to Senator Quinlan's motion, <i>Report on Full Employment</i> by the NIEC is a very important document.  Unemployment costs us money.  It costs us a lot more money than the actual amount of cash expended, and its real tragedy is the fact that people become unaccustomed to work and then become unemployable. This is the great tragedy, that it is not so much the money we expend on giving them the necessities of life but the fact that they become unemployable and then remain a charge on the country for nearly all their lives.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to co-operative movements here.  I was at a lecture, I think in the Royal Marine Hotel, given by Lieutenant General Costello on the co-operative movement at the turn of the century.  From memory I think that it started somewhere outside Ennis, County Clare, and the name of the co-operative movement was taken from that townland. Perhaps the Minister will recall the name.  This of course was one of the finest exercises that this country has seen.  After that or about the same time another co-operative movement occurred.  I do not think any reference has been made to it, but that co-operative movement, which we see existing still today, is the creamery system of this country.  These are efforts which should exist in a sensible community trying to give full employment.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to Glencolumbcille and Father McDyer. I wonder how successful this is.  I am not detracting from Father McDyer in any way, and the present Minister <Col N="397" /> I presume knows him intimately and knows the country, but it is an extraordinary thing that when I went down the other day to Castlepark Road near Dalkey to Mackeys the nursery people a bank clerk who is not now employed as a bank clerk was there taking 500 celery plants down there. That is an extraordinary situation.</P>
    <P>The question of full employment is associated with the economy.  It must of necessity be bound up with the type of economy we have.  We had recently a budget which in actual fact was a hybrid.  The Minister knows that if we were in private I would use another word about it, but it was a hybrid.  It was neither a budget to further the economy nor a budget to deflate the economy.  It was nothing, unless a budget designed to produce the type of tax that would be in operation in the European Economic Community.  It may be that that was what was behind it.</P>
    <P>I would go some distance with the Minister in his statement on the agricultural community at the moment.  Senator Quinlan and Senator McDonald said that there was a general trend all over the world of migration away from the land, and the Minister made that statement.  It is a fact. We cannot be ostriches and bury our heads in the sands.  It is a fact, an unwholesome fact but a true one.  Nobody wants it.  How it is going to be stopped I do not know.  The Minister also slightly adverted in his statement to the point which Senator Gallanagh first made, about internal migration within the country, a kind of migration which we do not have here.  I do not know whether we have a snobbish streak in us in this country that we do not do manual jobs in front of our friends or neighbours but we do them in front of people we do not know at all.  That may be at the back of it, but how one regulates this is another problem.  I thought that the Minister was going to touch on it. He was very near touching on it in his concluding remarks.  He mentioned the selective employment tax in Britain, which has not been a success to any great extent there and would not be a success here, but he did not say that <Col N="398" /> he was contemplating something of that nature when he was speaking, I think.</P>
    <P>He referred to industries.  The industrial situation at the present time, or even at any time, only warranted nursing for a number of years.  It did not warrant perennial nursing, and if we are going to enter the EEC those industries that were not worth nursing will inevitably fall to the ground.  I do not know whether that is good or bad.  My personal view is that industries that have to be continuously subsidised and nursed are not worth having unless we have some industry from which we can provide money to pay for that subsidisation.  We are supporting agriculture, we are supporting the tourist trade and supporting every other type of industry, and I do not know whether the bookkeeping is correct in this at all.  Surely there should be some money coming from somewhere to give all these subsidies, otherwise we are going to become bankrupt.</P>
    <P>About strikes, some Senators did advert to the cement strike and the bank strike.  The cement strike may be in some way deflationary but it is offset by the inflationary bank strike, people spending so much money that they probably have not got in the banks.</P>
    <P>The Minister has heard me speaking on a certain matter before and I am sure he will forgive me if I refer to it again.  A certain Taoiseach at a certain time usurped the functions of the trade unions when he decided to give a 12 or 12½ per cent increase across the board to employees.  I am not endeavouring to be political in my criticism but, in my view, this was a destructive move on the part of that Taoiseach.  The authority of the competent trade union leaders was undermined. I believe they would have settled for less but, if they had not, they should have been given the credit for negotiating whatever arrangement might have been made.  This act on the part of the Taoiseach has led to unofficial or, if you like, wildcat strikes because members of trade unions are of the opinion that they can obtain increases without the help of their leaders.  We now see the effect of that act today in the inflationary trend in <Col N="399" /> our economy.  I do not wish to delay the House any further.  I did not intend to be critical and I hope the Minister will accept what I said in the knowledge that I am sincere in my criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealCranitch" hpid="Mícheál Cranitch Mícheál Cranitch">
      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is dócha go bhfuil cead agam cupla focal a rá ar an dtairiscint seo.  It need hardly be said that full employment is the national objective.  No two Irishmen would hold diverse views on that point. Full employment is the hallmark of the progress of a nation.  I should like to pay tribute to the various governments, government officials, employers and industrialists who have contributed so much to bringing us within reasonable distance of full employment in this country.</P>
      <P>These aims are not achieved overnight. They take time to achieve.  They require mature planning and judgment. In a special way, I should like to pay tribute to the present Minister for Labour who has played more than one man's part in this direction.  The business of employment and unemployment is, in itself, big business.  There was a time when that was not so but in passing I must point out that in the business of studying unemployment and its causes and in the business of promoting employment we have an organisation&mdash;the Ministry of Labour &mdash;which, itself, gives considerable employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour has a group of excellent civil servants behind him. The recent publications of the Department &mdash; I refer to the leaflets being sent out to schools and other places&mdash;are very commendable.  We receive them regularly and in my school they are eagerly sought by children on the point of leaving school as well as by their parents.  That is a step in the right direction and I trust the Department will bear in mind the necessity for bringing the leaflets up to date from time to time.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak on three points.  The first of these is industrial relations.  In the report, at page 102, we read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A disquieting feature of industrial relations during the last few years <Col N="400" /> has been the long duration of a number of major strikes: the building strike in 1964 lasted nine weeks; the printing strike in 1965 for 10 weeks; that in the deep-sea section of Dublin port early in 1966 for five weeks; and more recently the strikes in the paper industry and in banking for 19 weeks and 13 weeks respectively...</P>
    <P>When this was written a few years ago, the writers could hardly have visualised that bigger strikes were still to come. The next sentence is important and I quote:</P>
    <P>Different explanations have been advanced as to why these strikes lasted for such a long time.</P>
    <P>Various explanations are put forward from time to time in connection with these strikes.  I have a view which I expressed in other places recently and which, I think, points to the root cause of this industrial disquiet.</P>
    <P>We are only emerging as an industrial nation.  It is true that we have had industries here and there in Ireland through the centuries but it is clear to everybody that in this modern age more and more industries are necessary if we are to keep our people at home. Agriculture is not enough.  That is why I say we are only emerging in the field of industry.  That being so, we have no traditional norms or standards so far as industrial relations are concerned.</P>
    <P>Let us take agriculture.  There has been agriculture here since Ireland was Ireland.  There was the family farm with the father, the mother, the children and, perhaps, an unmarried brother or sister living in the house. The father was the factory manager as it were and when any disagreement arose the mother was always there to smooth things out.  She acted as a sort of ombudsman with the result that there was no serious interruption of the work.  The operations of the farm were carried out in a milieu of love and good fellowship.  However, in relation to the industrial revival here we cannot have such a spirit in many of our factories but until such time as management and, for use of a better word, employees get together and make up their minds that a Christian spirit <Col N="401" /> must permeate throughout the industry, all the legislation in the world will not prevent us from having these strikes.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that we are apt to look abroad for our norms in so far as industrial relations are concerned and the norms employed in, say, England or the United States are not always in keeping with the best Christian standards.  I appeal to all industrialists and to employees also to consider their problems in that light. This is something which possibly the churches, social organisations, the Department of Education and social service organisations could profitably look into.</P>
    <P>When we get the Christian spirit I am sure our strikes and our industrial unrest will be reduced to a minimum. A problem which will cause confusion, is already causing it, I imagine, is the amount of leisure time available as a result of the shortening of what is known as the working week. Unfortunately many people seem to regard leisure as being a time when they can go out and spend all their earnings on consumer goods and on the things they do not want at all. The result is you have more money in circulation and a hunger to earn or the chance to earn a higher wage when they get back to work on the Monday morning.  Unfortunately it is true in certain families a start is made on Monday morning often without a penny in the house despite big wages coming in from various members of the family.  The money is all spent on Saturday and Sunday and not indeed very profitably either.  This is a problem where the churches and educational authorities could possibly give a lead and give some good advice. There are so many profitable ways in which to spend leisure, improving people's minds, studying, music, arts, games, <i>et cetera</i> but unfortunately you have pagan influences at work and it is so easy to set a standard and to suggest the ideal way to spend one's leisure time is carousing, drinking, <i>et cetera</i>, much after the fashion of the Prodigal Son.</P>
    <P>There is one point more to which some Senators have already referred, that is the question of buying Irish <Col N="402" /> goods.  One of the best and most patriotic exercises we have is buying goods made in our own country.  A person who always insists on buying homemade goods is indeed doing a great service to his country and to his fellow Irishmen.  We have got to be realistic about this.  Very of ten we go into shops and when goods are presented to us, unless we are always on the watch, foreign goods will be presented for our approval and our purchase.  Eternal vigilance is the price we must pay for economic survival.  It behoves us as Members of the Oireachtas, as responsible people, to encourage the buying of Irish goods on every occasion. By and large the goods available in our shops which are made in Ireland are as good as if not better than the goods coming from abroad.</P>
    <P>Another important question is that of saving.  Wages and salaries have gone up and considerably more money is available.  Again, I put the question &ldquo;Is enough of this money being saved?&rdquo; Saving is indeed a patriotic exercise and a very sound one in so far as the individual is concerned.  It is far better to save because the money is being ploughed back into industry. It is far better to save for that reason and it is far better to save for the simple reason that the more money in circulation on consumer the greater danger there is of inflation.  I suppose it must be agreed that of all the enemies towards industrial progress inflation is surely one of the greatest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a most constructive and impartial debate on this motion.  I agree with the Minister that it has come timely. We hope it will again cause public bodies, societies and groups to get back to study what has been acknowledged here as our No. 1 national problem, the creation of full employment for our people.  In devoting this morning to a debate on this Seanad Éireann have fulfilled a function for which they are ideally suited and we hope the time ahead will see further development of this function into proper committees which should flow from such work. As I have only 15 minutes to speak I will briefly look at some of the points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main bone of contention seems <Col N="403" /> to be the question of the position of agriculture in our future development, in our plans for full employment.  Here I have to differ very sharply from the Minister and many others who spoke on the role of agriculture in future employment.  I believe it is a prescription for national suicide to follow what is in the NIEC Report where is says the numbers in agriculture can be reduced from 338,000 in 1965 to 231,000 in 1980, a further loss of over 100,000 people, the refrain being that it is happening everywhere else so automatically it should happen to us.  We should not take this complacent attitude to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister a simple question. In the past ten years in which the NIEC have been in existence, in which they have done good work they have at all times been glaringly deficient on the agricultural side and been wedded to the fatalistic idea that employment in agriculture had to go down to something like 8,000 to 10,000 per annum. The question I ask the Minister is in that period did any responsible agricultural organisation in this country agree to this policy of despair?  Did the Agricultural Institute, to which tribute has been paid for the great work they have done, by any pronouncement agree that they shared the same pessimistic view?  Of course not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator not agree that the Agricultural Institute's recent report on an area in Donegal showed that you cannot have proper incomes on small farms of that kind and you have to face up to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is snipe grass country.  That is not the case in the 12 million acres which is represented as arable land and that for agricultural potential is second to none in the world.  I have been pressing this here for a long time.  Many people outside this House have also been pressing this.  We must know the size of the problem we have got to face.  I ask the Minister to get the Government to ask the Agricultural Institute officials to let us have their forecast on the position of agriculture over the next ten <Col N="404" /> years, its employment potential, capital requirements and so on&mdash;in other words something corresponding to what NIEC have given here.  Personally, speaking from Seanad Éireann I asked the Agricultural Institute on behalf of the Senators here to let us have this as a matter of urgency.  If we look at all sides of the problem and realise that a loss of 100,000 jobs is forecast in 15 years do we think what will that cost the State?  At the present time the State is prepared to give grants of up to 45 per cent of the capital cost of new industries.</P>
      <P>Figures were quoted by Senator Russell and other who mentioned £10,000 per worker capital cost.  Even putting in the agricultural jobs at half that level or at £5,000 per worker, 45 per cent of that means the State would be prepared to invest in such an undertaking £2,000 per worker and for 100,000 workers that comes to the staggering figure of £200,000,000.  I ask if it would be possible to keep those jobs in agriculture?  Then, as a nation, would it not be our duty to invest that money to do that?  Our problem in the past has not been scarcity of capital but scarcity of enterprise and not knowing where the industries should be created which could absorb that capital and survive.  Industry on its own cannot make up for an increasing population and a decrease in emigration rate and at the same time carry the burden of the flight from the land.</P>
      <P>Many people were a bit surprised at seeing those figures last year when we had a very good record of providing 16,000 new jobs in the country but 12,000 people left agriculture.  What does that mean?  It means that 9,000 people left agriculture in their coffins. The number of people actually leaving agriculture was negligible.  It is only at the 16 to 20 year old level that they leave because some people probably who should never have come in to agriculture drift to something else.  The failure in agriculture is not one of people leaving.  It is a failure of recruitment. Those who die are not being replaced.  We must look at the problem in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Senator A Senator">
      <NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Senator formulates a scheme.  This is happening <Col N="405" /> all over western Europe.  We have more people in agriculture than any of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is paid to do that.  This is something on which we need expert advice and I hope we get it within the next few months.  We will all value it and when it comes we will go forward together towards our objectives.  It has been agreed that it is a gigantic task calling for a community effort on a scale which we have not had up to this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;an effort short only of a wartime effort.  It is necessary if we are to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should realise that the GNP never inspired anyone and never will and that has been the weakness of our selling in the past few years.  There have been too much economics and too little psychology in the approach. The fact that we must keep in close step with England does not place a proper value on our amenities here.  I would like to see greater effort in order to explain to our people that life here can offer what life in crowded cities in England cannot offer.  Telefís Éireann could render a valuable national service by seeking to highlight that.  They take it as their mission to highlight the social evils that exist in the country.  It would be equally important for them to highlight the real advantages of life in this relatively uncrowded country with no great extremes of climate compared with other countries and with life in England, western Europe or America.  In this country society is much less violent and in general much more conducive to family living.  I hope RTE will play its part in bringing these facts home to the people.  Those who have travelled know the facts.  That is why people come back here and are prepared to work at half the money they would get in other countries.  They value rightly the amenities here.  A worker can get a job at a higher rate in London, but he may have to travel 25 to 30 miles to his work.  In this country such a man would only travel a mile or two to his job.  Another <Col N="406" /> attraction here is the proximity of the beaches and the inexpensive outdoor games which are available to us.  We must take stock of these things and realise that we do not &ldquo;have to keep step with the Joneses&rdquo; in economic terms.</P>

      <P>In order to meet this problem of unemployment rapidly one must introduce some form of co-operative movement.  There must be rationalisation of creameries.  There have been reports on these matters but all the reports on such subjects have been gathering dust for 10 years.  It is time we had some action.</P>
      <P>The figure of £10,000 per worker in industry seems an alarming figure when looked at first.  If it is broken down what does it mean?  The worker in a modern industry today produces a net output of about £2,000 per annum of which the wages take about one-half and the rest is for the remuneration of capital, etc.  When one looks at the position of the idle machinery&mdash;most of our factories are on a one shift basis &mdash; one realises that if the workers spent just an additional two hours a week and if they made that contribution to the national effort the amount produced per worker would be about £100 per annum for investment in Irish industry.  By that means 100 workers could provide all the capital necessary to put one worker into employment each year.  Surely that is simple and elementary co-operation.  It shows that these astronomical figures when broken down can be brought within our reach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dunne in a very excellent speech showed the difficulties which lie ahead.  His optimism gives us all good reason to hope for the future.  I had hoped that a Seanad committee might be set up to look into this.  Would the Leader of the House refer the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to find out whether such a committee could be set up.  We have received the report and we have had this debate but I would like to know <Col N="407" /> what other contribution the Seanad can make in this regard.  Would the Leader of the House indicate whether he will refer this to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?</P>

      <P>We have looked for those committees in the past but we always come up against a stone wall.  In that case I should like to ask Senator Dunne to join with me to try to get an unofficial group organised in order to investigate the next stage. I should like to change the wording of the motion before the question is put.  I should like to substitute the word &ldquo;commends&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;notes&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Chair does not feel it would be in order to do that.  It might create difficulties. The motion has been proposed and spoken to.  The remarks have been commendatory and anyone who reads the debate will realise that.  It would create difficulties of procedure to accept an amendment, strictly speaking, after the debate has concluded.</P>
