    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to enable the vocational education committees to co-operate with other educational bodies and to empower me to permit of a vocational education committee which have been dissolved being reconstituted without waiting until after the next local authority elections have been held.</P>
      <P>Under the existing Vocational Education Acts, vocational education committees have power to pay only the cost of schools or school facilities which are owned and managed solely by themselves.  My Department, with a view to having comprehensive educational facilities provided in the most economical way without waste or overlapping, have been encouraging co-operation between secondary and vocational schools so that comprehensive educational facilities can be provided in each area of the country.</P>
      <P>In a number of centres in which co-operation between secondary schools and vocational schools is being developed, proposals have been made for the sharing of specialist facilities and ancillary accommodation, e.g. science laboratories, assembly halls, gymnasia, playing fields, <i>et cetera,</i> but, as I have indicated the vocational education committees are precluded from contributing towards the cost of such facilities unless the ownership and management reside solely in the committees. The type of co-operation now envisaged, however, could be fully achieved on the basis of joint ownership and joint management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of section 1 of this Bill would enable the vocational education committees, if they wish to do so, to contribute towards the cost of the facilities in question on the basis of their being jointly owned and managed by the committee and another educational authority.  This will facilitate the development of co-operation in many centres and help further to break down the barriers <Col N="1225" /> between the secondary and vocational systems.</P>
    <P>A large size school unit is now generally accepted as being a necessary prerequisite to the provision of comprehensive educational facilities at any kind of reasonable cost and to making the best possible use of scarce teaching skills.  Our post-primary schools tend for historical reasons to be relatively small in size.  In most of our towns, there are two or three such schools operating for the most part independently of one another.  There is already a fair measure of agreement, in a few such areas in which schools need to be rebuilt, that there should be an amalgamation of schools subject to an acceptable form of joint management on which the existing interests would be represented.  This form of joint management of a post-primary school would be new to this country and, as the House will appreciate, there are a number of practical difficulties which will need to be resolved in consultation with the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 1 would enable vocational education committees who wish to do so to contribute to the cost of such jointly managed schools.  I wish to emphasise that the section is merely an enabling one and that it would be a matter for each committee to consider the circumstances of each particular case and to decide for themselves whether they wished to participate or not.  In the same way, it would of course be a matter for each secondary school authority to decide their own attitude towards any proposal for a joint contribution to a proposed jointly managed post-primary school.  It will be the task of my Department to secure the maximum degree of co-operation so as to ensure that the resources at our disposal are used to the greatest possible benefit of the children of the nation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is both mandatory and enabling: it provides for the mandatory reconstitution of a dissolved committee and enables such reconstitution to be effected at any time up to the end of the second election year after it has been dissolved.  Under existing legislation, reconstitution of a dissolved committee could take place only after the <Col N="1226" /> next local authority election after its dissolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go gceapann chuile dhuine ar an taobh so gur Bille maith an Bille seo chun cabhrú le cúrsaí oideachais sa tír seo.  Tá ár mbuidheachas ag dul don Aire dá bharr.  We on this side welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction.  If I may start at the end rather than at the beginning, it is a very good innovation that vocational committees which have been dissolved can be reconstituted without having to wait for the next local government election.  That is a good spirit.</P>
      <P>To get back to the beginning, we all agree that with advances in education there is a need for having the closest possible co-operation in the use of facilities in vocational and secondary schools.  Up to the moment vocational education committees could not incur any expense in connection with a school not directly under their management. Without this Bill, a vocational education committee, no matter how they might like to do so, could not avail themselves of facilities provided at a neighbouring secondary school because the vocational education committee could not contribute to the provision of facilities in the secondary school.  This Bill will remedy that.  We realise that at the present time it is necessary in many cases to provide costly laboratories for the teaching of science.  It is also necessary to provide assembly halls, gymnasia and playgrounds. Now that there is to be a dovetailing of interests as between vocational and secondary schools these facilities can be provided and the costs shared.  All of that is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it is true that in order to provide proper teaching facilities, it is necessary to have the larger schools so that specialised teachers in the various categories could be made available. That cannot be done under existing circumstances in places where there are two or three relatively small schools situated in the same town or in some small area.  The dovetailing of activities between schools will enable that problem to be overcome.  In so far as this will help to bring closer co-operation <Col N="1227" /> between vocational and secondary schools it is good and it will also eliminate unnecessary expenditure, enabling better teaching facilities to be provided with the same amount of money.  It is also welcome in so far as it will help at some future stage to eliminate what we might call the rivalry that exists in education between secondary and vocational schools whereby vocational schools may be regarded as being inferior from a snobbish point of view.  If the Bill would help to eliminate that it would be doing something worthwhile.  Unfortunately, there is a tendency among people in this country to regard the only education worth having as that obtained in a secondary school and, if brought further, to university level, whereas really worthwhile education can be had at a technical school and, later, at a technological school.  We seem to have lost the desire to cater for people who are skilled with their hands and, in fact, sometimes such skill is looked down on by comparison with what we might call brain power.</P>
    <P>Our aim is to raise the general standard of education to the highest possible level.  Some years ago the primary certificate was regarded as a fundamental level of education but if intermediate certificate standard or, even, leaving certificate standard will in future be regarded as the fundamental level, we will have reached a high standard.  However, we must have the highest respect and esteem for skilled persons such as carpenters, joiners and so on unlike in the past when the greatest respect was retained for those who had reached professional status.  In so far as this Bill helps in that direction, it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I do not like to sound any discordant note in regard to the Bill but the only reservation I might have would arise from the fact that I am not very clear as to whether it will lead to a greater demand for money towards education from the local authorities.  There might be a tendency at central government level to transfer as much of the cost as possible of this joint education scheme to local authorities.  We all realise that, in the long run, the money will be paid <Col N="1228" /> by the taxpayer and the ratepayer but in certain areas, particularly in the poorer counties where rates are a burden, people might be pressed unduly hard if there was any tendency to transfer an unfair share of the burden of the joint effort to the local authorities. Such attempt might be resisted and might result in the provisions of this Bill not being adopted in some areas with the same enthusiasm as might otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>The reason for my raising that point was that recently the schools library scheme was introduced.  I attended a county council meeting last week and every member there was pleased that this scheme should be introduced so as to provide suitable reading matter for pupils in primary schools.  However, there was a certain reluctance to adopt the scheme because of the cost it would impose at local level.</P>
    <P>There are always some people on a local committee who do not see as clearly as others the need for first class education for our children.  They make the case that the cost of any new scheme will be prohibitive and a great burden on the ratepayers and for that reason the scheme, however desirable it migh be, is not adopted.  I hope there is no danger that the cost of implementing this scheme will become such a burden on the local authorities that there will be no desire to go ahead with it.  My fears may be entirely unjustified. I hope they are, because I would like this Bill to be received enthusiastically throughout the country. I hope people will see the good sense in providing pupils and teachers with the maximum facilities at the lowest possible cost to the community.  It will certainly do a great deal to take education out of the various water tight compartments it has been put in.</P>
    <P>Education should be broad and flexible and aimed at giving the greatest possible return for the money spent. This Bill is geared to do exactly that. It is aimed at permitting each student to reach the highest level of his ability whether it be manual, technical or academic.  Our education system is designed to bring every student to the highest level of his ability.  It is well recognised that in the past the person <Col N="1229" /> with great ability went to secondary school and the person not capable of secondary education went to a technical school.  From the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; the lad who went to the technical school was frowned on by those who regarded themselves as a superior class simply because they were better at Latin and able to do good translation in their exams.  They did not realise that the lad at the technical school was able to do a good piece of electrical work, engineering or plumbing.  It was always said if a fellow had brains he went to secondary school, if he had hands he went to the technical school and if he had neither hands nor brains he was kept on the land.  This Bill goes a long way to remove this attitude of mind.</P>
    <P>A committee of management may have to be set up when a vocational and a secondary school come together. I hope the greatest care will be taken about who is appointed to these management committees.  Teachers from secondary schools and vocational schools should be brought together on a common level.  If this Bill goes a step further, as it will in my opinion, it is likely that a vocational teacher will do either a day or half a day in the secondary school and a secondary teacher will do the same in a vocational school.  I very much want to see this interchange of teachers between schools.</P>
    <P>With regard to comprehensive schools it is generally admitted if they are to be a success there must be a sufficiently large number of pupils to enable a suitable staff to be appointed. If a comprehensive school has only 200 or 300 pupils it is most unlikely that the necessary teachers will be provided in each department of the school.  The coming together of vocational and secondary school units will provide larger numbers.</P>
    <P>There were historical reasons for small schools in the past but these have been eliminated almost entirely by the introduction of the school transport system.  We now have very big numbers brought together in a centre by means of the transport scheme introduced by the late Deputy O'Malley.  It is only right, having brought them into these centres at the expense of the taxpayers, <Col N="1230" /> that the maximum educational facilities should be provided for them there.</P>

      <P>The nature of the Bill is such that it does not require any great speech about it.  The purpose of the Bill is clearly stated and it is a tribute to the draftsmen that they were able to put this matter in such a simple form.  As a member of a vocational education committee I have no doubt the Bill will be received with acclamation by the committees.  The committees have always felt they were tied to the limits.  I do not foresee the developments as set out in this Bill coming to fruition very quickly.  There are bound to be problems with some schools who may be reluctant to participate in the scheme.  Provided they are given the authority by the Minister to look around and see what can be done to implement the Bill I am quite sure it will be tackled with vigour by the various committees and with the goodwill of the secondary schools so that the very desirable changes envisaged in the Bill can be brought to fruition. The Bill gives a certain amount of power and the main purpose of it is to give administrative authority, this will be welcomed by the various committees. The Minister should be congratulated on adding a new dimension to secondary and vocational education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all welcome what is in this Bill which sets the scene for a comprehensive district plan approach to the organisation of our post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the comprehensive schools were introduced six or eight years ago I spoke very strongly against the idea here and time has borne out the objections I raised, that what we required was not simply the superseding of the system we had got but the drawing of it together and the organising and co-ordinating of it in what I think I called a comprehensive district plan.  Many others shared that view and I am glad to see that in the period of a few years the practical merits of such a proposal have been recognised and that we have departed from an unfortunate spirit that was present at that time of almost sneering at the secondary schools and <Col N="1231" /> certainly being less than generous in acknowledging the tremendous debt that all Irish men and women owe to the people who founded and carried secondary education in this country with very little State help compared to what is given to other systems.</P>
    <P>That has changed and it is a change for the better.  I hope this spirit of co-operation will permeate our future educational organisation because nothing leads more to the down-grading of what the technical schools stand for, that is, the development especially of manual skills leading to the production of first-class technicians, than trying to force those same institutions into providing courses in the more academic subjects for which they have not got the necessary facilities.  This implants the idea in the school that the important part of the training is the academic part and that the skills are only a second best, whereas if the institutions in the local district can concentrate on what they are best at, then each has a pride in what is being done and the students share in that pride and can see in it their natural fulfilment.</P>
    <P>We have been snobbish in this country in looking down, to some extent, on technical training as opposed to the more academic type of training, but we should recognise that today there is great need for technical training, for the skilled electrician, the skilled mechanic and the skilled carpenter. They are the people who really make a major contribution to our industrial life especially if they have got, in addition to this development of their natural bent in technical skills, sufficient academic training and the ability to express themselves in writing.  These are the people who rise to very high and responsible positions in industry.  I have been worried and still am worried that with our system which places too much emphasis on the intermediate and leaving certificates we will become cert. mad.  This is inclined to down-grade the very type of training it is supposed to be promoting, training in the technical skills. Anyone connected with Irish industry or in any responsible position connected <Col N="1232" /> with it will say that if there is a scarcity in Irish industry today it is a scarcity of technicians.  The careers that are open to properly qualified technicians are quite comparable with and in many cases better than those open to those who go on and take certificates and even many of those with university degrees.</P>
    <P>I feel then that this comprehensive district approach is a very useful one. Down the country it succeeds in bringing the people together and in setting the scene for the development of adult education.  In the 1970s when we expect the community will have more leisure there must be a very positive effort to fill that leisure and one of the best ways of doing that is through a proper and organised system of adult education.  This can be profitable by conferring in adult life a training in the skills that people are actually employing at that time or it can be useful solely from the point of view of the development of the personality and of making the recipient more adjusted to his surrounding and a better citizen, giving him a broader view of life, a view that may succeed in making him a better citizen locally and also a happier citizen.</P>
    <P>In the development of adult education I would appeal to the Minister not to be penny-pinching on this most important facet of our work.  I share with many others the disquiet of some of the CEOs on the cuts that have been made in the numbers they require to carry through their schemes in the coming year.  I speak with first-hand knowledge of the value of some of those schemes because in UCC for years we have been operating a very successful adult education scheme in conjunction with the vocational schools and the vocational authorities.  I see that one CEO claims that the cut backs would endanger schemes of that nature.  I feel the time has come not to cut back but to expand very considerably.</P>
    <P>In the development of this co-operative approach I would appeal for much less Departmental guidance.  It may be very well intentioned but the Department seem to think that driving is guiding.  That just is not a policy which <Col N="1233" /> will bring our educational groups together. I would appeal in this case for the maximum utilisation of our post-primary resources.  The groups concerned, the vocational organisations and the secondary schools, both lay and clerical, should be encouraged to set up a small council of their own to promote these activities.  This might be well worth while.  It would be much easier for promotion to be done in that way rather than to feel that it can be imposed by some departmental unit simply by wielding the power of the purse-strings at local level.  In all those schemes, there is a contribution from the State and that contribution gives the State the right of veto.  I know there must be a type of veto but it is something which should not be used too often to the extent of making the district groupings feel that something was being imposed on them rather than that they were being led to develop.  That is our main problem in education today.  We need the central authority to lead rather than to drive, to encourage and suggest but not to drive.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate at present, and have been always, in the quality of people who are associated with vocational education schemes.  In every case the CEOs have emerged as natural leaders and the local technical school headmasters are doing a very fine job. It is a job comparable to what the secondary schools are doing, where both the religious schools and the lay secondary schools have done immense work.  If we can give them every assisance to pool their resources we will be setting the course properly for the 1970's.  We will be getting away from any suggestion that any group are to be superseded or slowly starved out from the scheme.  All have a contribution to make.  In that spirit I welcome this Bill. I hope there will be a strong development of the comprehensive district approach to the development of post-primary education.  I appeal to the Department to credit the local units with knowing their place.  Even if they are not doing things as well as one would think they should, the fact that they are showing initiative and doing things is something to be prized.  Very often there is a gulf of misunderstanding <Col N="1234" /> between the central authority view in the big city and what is seen to be feasible at local level.  I appeal for a much freer and more decentralised approach to all these developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the preceding speakers I very much welcome this Bill. It is very easy in talking about the need for co-operation in our educational system to sound as if we were interested in the most economic way of doing things and the best way of doing things without waste or overlapping. In my view, whatever the difficulties and temptations when faced with budget stringencies, any of us with interest in education and any of the authorities such as the Minister, the Department and the various teaching organisations must try to keep firmly in mind that the prime duty of educationalists and the prime rôle of our education system is to meet the educational requirements of our young people.  In quite a number of cases the best educational interests of our children can be met in an economical, efficient and effective way.  If on occasions there seems to be additional cost involved in meeting the needs of the children, it is the duty of the educational authorities to face up to this situation and to realise that the educational development of our young people is worth any money we can afford to invest in it.  That is the basic context in which we should discuss any developments in our educational system.  If I could express some scepticism about the developments which this Bill may promote, I hope it will be felt that I am not forecasting in any way what I think will happen.  It is desirable that I should sound some warning about what I see as possible snags ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If co-operation between vocational schools and other schools is in a genuine spirit of joint ownership and management, and that it is real co-operation which will break down the barriers between these schools, everything will be fine.  Co-operation sometimes means in our community, I feel, that we interpret it as a form of free power struggle or one-up-manship between the various bodies which normally act in a spirit of co-operation and co-ordination.  Speaking as a <Col N="1235" /> parent with a future interest in education and looking at the prime interest of the children from a parent's viewpoint it is true to say that most parents in the community are not interested in whether one branch of the teaching profession regards itself as superior to the other or not.  Basically, where education is concerned they are not interested in any anxiety by church authorities or particular teaching orders to maintain their position or in the local pride of particular school managers.  Above all the parents are concerned with getting the most effective co-operation from all parties involved in teaching.  When we have further co-operation and co-ordination under this Bill I hope that all parties involved will put aside matters of local pride and tradition, and any feelings of superiority, and get down to the task of providing the most effective service for the community.  It is important that co-operation between the vocational system and the secondary system should exist.  They have a tremendous part to play in the post-primary educational system and I hope that these parties, when coming together in a spirit of progressive development, will manage to step outside existing social and sectarian patterns.</P>
    <P>I should like to explain what I mean here.  For example, there has been a case where you have close to each other a vocational school and a girls' secondary school.  Co-operation between those schools&mdash;I am not sure if this has been decided yet&mdash;may mean that some people may say: &ldquo;We will transfer all the girls from the vocational school to the secondary school and let the vocational school develop as a boys' school.&rdquo;  I do not regard that as a progressive development of a spirit of co-operation because I think one of the great factors about the vocational system has been in many instances a splendid example of the effective working of co-education.  If co-operation between vocational schools and single-sex schools means any diminution of the existing pattern of co-education, it cannot truly be called co-operation.</P>
    <P>When it comes to co-operation one often gets the feeling that there is a <Col N="1236" /> sort of trading growing up between schools.  If a secondary school and a vocational school are co-operating, the vocational school will be fighting for the science laboratory and the secondary school for the language laboratory, and then when it comes to fighting for a new gymnasium there will be another ding-dong battle between them. This is not co-operation or co-ordination. We must see a preparedness on the part of education authorities to sit down and to look at the merits of each case particularly in fields like science and language.  It is regrettable that the financial resources we have should not be able to provide adequate teaching staffs immediately because there are not sufficient quality teachers available in fields like languages, including Irish, and in fields like the natural sciences, particularly developing fields like biology.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the prime consideration in every area should be to provide the best possible facilities for the maximum number of children in both languages and the sciences, and the pattern should be one of co-ordinating the best quality teachers in those areas, plus whatever investment is required in the new physical facilities like laboratories and so on.  If it is necessary to tie in some way the physical facilities to particularly expert teachers, that is what should be done even if it means that in that instance both the new language laboratory and the new science laboratory will be basically in the one position.  That is the sort of spirit in which people must look at every aspect of education.  They must forget about petty jealousy and differences.  We must have real co-operation and co-ordination.</P>
    <P>I have been giving an example of social factors.  I would hope that, in a situation in which vocational and secondary schools are co-operating, when parents are looking at the situation they will not automatically say: &ldquo;Those schools are now co-operating. I will make sure all my children go to the secondary department.&rdquo;  This again would be the completely wrong attitudo for parents to take.  Their attitude should be to get the best possible educational facilities suitable for their <Col N="1237" /> children.  That is the basis on which parents should make their choice, not on any snob value.</P>
    <P>There can be tragic cases where co-operation obtains.  Parents may well send their children to education not at all suited to them, solely for snob reasons.  Children may be much better suited if the system continues as before co-operation.  Parents must resist snob factors.  They must think only of getting for their children the best teachers and the best educational provisions.</P>
    <P>These are social factors.  People may think it strange if I refer to the sectarian factor.  I am conscious of the need to provide equal opportunities for free education to the Protestant community in this country.  There is a situation at the moment in rural areas where vocational schools might well be considered by members of the community outside the Protestant churches to be a perfect opportunity for post-primary education in a non-denominational way, and such people may well wonder why members of the Protestant communities in rural Ireland have not accepted this.  There have been a number of reasons for it.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that some Protestant church authorities and local Protestant communities have not felt that the system in each vocational school genuinely has been non-denominational in atmosphere.  I think that in some cases this has been a justified fear.  In the same way, members of Protestant communities have not appreciated the full range of education now available in rural vocational schools: they have felt that the local vocational school may not have been in a position to provide the type of education they have wished for their children.  In many cases, too, they have been justified in this.</P>
    <P>Education has been changing all the time, particularly now when we are providing for further development of co-operation and co-ordination between schools, and Protestants who have felt inconvenienced or at a disadvantage in rural Ireland should keep under constant review the development of vocational education in their areas. Now, many vocational schools in rural <Col N="1238" /> areas offer the full range of courses to be found in secondary schools, and Protestant parents who are concerned about providing a particular type of education for their children must constantly review the facilities available to them locally.</P>
    <P>Also, local vocational education authorities should keep under constant scrutiny this business of making sure that their school, as far as possible, particularly in areas where Protestants may wish to attend, is conducted in a genuinely non-denominational way.  If both these developments take place we may find that the problem of free education for Protestant pupils in rural areas will be eased somewhat.  I trust that, when vocational education authorities are considering matters of co-operation between schools in particular areas, they will think of all the secondary schools in those areas, whatever denomination may be the controlling body on the management board, because again the development of co-operation in education, as I have said, must have its main interest in the future of the pupils and must not be affected in any way by social or sectarian considerations.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is probably aware, his best allies in this country are the parents.  They have the same interest as the Minister in providing the best possible education for all.  Parents' associations are being developed satisfactorily in relation to our secondary schools.  This is a good idea because it gives parents a say in the management of the schools.  I would hope that in any joint co-operation between vocational and secondary schools this idea of parents' associations would develop on the lines of co-operation between the two bodies.  Parents can be a very useful factor in determining whether co-operation is genuine.  They are very quick to detect when any organisation, be it teachers or management, or any other group, are acting in a self-centred way rather than in the interests of all the children concerned.</P>
    <P>On this point I would say that, in making sure the idea of co-operation and co-ordination receives adequate notice in the community, I would request vocational education committees <Col N="1239" />&mdash;I am not sure where the power lies &mdash;to admit the Press to their meetings. This may horrify some people but I had personal experience of this while working in South Shields in the north of England.  All the committees of South Shields Corporation were open to the Press.  I covered many of these. The Press were excluded traditionally when items arose such as the appointing of an individual member to the staff and so on but this did not present any problems.  Pressmen attended the meetings as representatives of the community and were supplied with an agenda in the same way as were the members of the corporation.  They knew when they would be asked to leave the meeting and very often the agenda was arranged in such a way that matters of public interest were discussed first.  These were reported with the proviso that the minutes were subject to approval by the corporation. News of new developments in relation to curricula and so on was made available to the community.</P>
    <P>If we had the same type of Press coverage in Ireland it would help to create a community interest in all new developments in vocational education. The community would be glad to hear of any such developments and would give their support to any efforts towards genuine co-operation between the educational establishments in any particular area.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan tells me that the Press are admitted to vocational educational committee meetings here.  To my knowledge, this is not the practice throughout the country, but, if the Senator is correct, all I can say is that I hope we will see much more coverage of those meetings, particularly in the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask a question of the Minister.  He makes the point that it will be the task of his Department to secure the maximum degree of co-operation so that the resources at our disposal are used to the greatest possible benefit of the children of the nation.</P>
    <P>That is fine but I would ask him with regard to section 1, where the co-operation <Col N="1240" /> between schools will be subject to the consent of a Minister, if this literally means every item of co-operation between schools or will the Minister give a general consent to co-operation between schools in an area and the schools can then work out such terms as may be agreed between themselves and continued from there; or will the Minister and his Department be informed of this particular arrangement regarding every instance of co-operation once the general consent to this type of development in an area has been agreed?  I welcome the Bill.  I am sorry for having delayed the House with these observations but I thought they were worth making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in welcoming this uncomplicated measure.  It is a straightforward enabling Bill and displays considerable enlightenment and knowledge of what is taking place in the world around us.  Since I came to the Seanad in 1961 I have referred, year after year, to the untidiness of what we describe as our system of education.  I have always said that it could never be described as a system because in reality we had three branches and not the slightest co-operation or co-ordination between them. Yet, we went along merrily in the belief that we had a system of education but we have only now realised that the articulation which should have existed between the three branches in order to create a system of education has been long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure will have obvious educational advantages and I concur with Senator Keery when he suggests the main principle is the best possible educational benefit to our children. Common sense would indicate that, in the co-operation suggested between the vocational and secondary schools, there would be considerable saving for the taxpayer.  In the past there has been overlapping.  There has been waste of accommodation, waste of apparatus and waste of teaching skill.  Not so very long ago I saw three schools open in one small town.  There was a primary, a vocational and a new secondary school without any reference one to the other.  They arose as three independent <Col N="1241" /> units.  I consider such practice to be a considerable waste of public money as well as being a waste of educational effort and educational forces.  There was no guiding principle behind the establishment of these three schools.</P>
    <P>However, I am glad that we have reached the stage where we cannot think in isolation of the primary school, of the vocational school or of the secondary school.  I welcomed the establishment of the development branch in the Department of Education some years ago.  Considerable progress has been made within the Department as a result of the establishment of that branch.  I agree also with Senator Keery when he suggests that there should be more co-operation between the various teaching agencies.  Unfortunately, during the past few years and, in particular, the past couple of years, there has been the most unseemly quarrel going on between various branches of the teaching profession. I maintain there should be only one profession of teachers.  There should be only one common qualification for the art because there is only one art and that is the principle of the imparting of knowledge.  It is only a question of adopting the method to the age level.  For instance, different techniques have to be used for younger children then for those in a higher age group.  They must be stimulated by the use of various techniques.  This is done until the children are able to find out for themselves.</P>
    <P>The art of teaching is the same whether one is teaching infants or undergraduates.  The fundamental principles of imparting knowledge and acquiring knowledge are the same.  It is a waste of effort, money and accommodation to have various establishments engaged in training teachers to teach at different levels without having a co-ordinating course.  If this were done it might eliminate some of the bickering which goes on between the various teaching groups.  I agree with Senator Keery that there is an atmosphere of superiority in certain groups. It is tragic in negotiations involving conditions of service and conditions of work to find teachers not willing to sit down at the same table as other <Col N="1242" /> teachers.  This air of snobbery is deplorable and the sooner people are taught more sense the better for everyone.</P>
    <P>I maintain education is a basic service which must receive the greatest attention from the Government.  It lays the foundation for the efficient working of all our services.  We cannot afford to go along the same traditional lines as we did in the past where the emphasis was on the academic side of education.  We are about to enter into a fiercely competitive European community, and this measure is forward looking and in keeping with the trend which already exists in Europe.  The structure of society has changed considerably on the Continent.  It is only right that Senators should realise the type of community we are facing.  I shall quote from the UNESCO World Survey of Secondary Education which states:</P>
    <P>It is reported that in the last century 80 per cent of all Frenchmen were employed in agriculture, 10 per cent in industry and 10 per cent in the tertiary sector, while now 30 per cent are in agriculture, 35 per cent in industry and 35 per cent in tertiary occupations.</P>
    <P>There has been a complete change in the structure.  The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>... in the future an economically well-developed country will be likely to find more than half its working population in the tertiary services (commerce, administration, liberal professions, transport, health, and social services, newspapers, arts, leisure, etc.).</P>
    <P>There is a complete moving away from the land.  It is estimated that more than 50 per cent of the population of France will be engaged in the tertiary sector in a few years time.  Another comment I would like Senators to bear in mind when thinking about entry into the Common Market states:</P>
    <P>More and more workers who in the past needed only an elementary education are being employed in posts which require a longer period of general education, and this is an irreversible trend.  Similarly, technological progress is reducing the need <Col N="1243" /> for skilled labourers and greatly increasing the demand for highly qualified engineers and technicians.  The conclusion which emerged from this analysis was that, in view of the changes in industry that are likely to take place, France will have less need for narrowly specialised workers but an increasing need of people with a high general development who can adapt themselves to changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>One further quotation from the same survey about the USSR is very interesting because most people imagine that the general development of education there is not as enlightened as it is in western countries.  This quotation will, therefore, come as a surprise:</P>
    <P>Future technical and economic development will impose heavy demands on all workers in socialist society, and an all round education is of vital importance for them.  The labour of the present-day worker is not merely a matter of the use of muscle power: it is becoming increasingly filled with intellectual content.</P>
    <P>As a representative of a teaching group I welcome the measures before the House.  It will tend to create better opportunities for people to develop skills.  I appreciate the point made by the Minister when he said that the use of facilities in secondary and technical vocational schools will be brought about by discussion with the relevant authorities.  This is most important because there is grave suspicion among school managements that an effort is being made to take over control of the school.  Managers are slow to carry out changes which look like taking away their control of the schools.  As we all know schools have been used as an instrument to inject political opinions and indoctrinate people in accordance with political opinions.  A deplorable situation arose in Germany in 1933 under the Nazi régime when teachers in schools and universities who did not conform were thrown out.  The same happened in Italy and teachers who did not conform with Fascism were sacked. The Minister has taken a very good <Col N="1244" /> line by saying that co-operation will be sought through discussion.  He may be frustrated in his approach to certain bodies of management if there is any suggestion that the State are endeavouring to take over control of the schools. This is a delicate point.</P>
    <P>I welcome wholeheartedly this measure.  It can do nothing but good not only for the children but for the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other Senators I welcome this Bill and the ideas behind it.  We all appreciate that the Minister will have difficulties at the outset but given goodwill on all sides there will be a good foundation to start on.  I have listened with interest to Senators, who are all agreed about what should be done.  I wonder, however, if the people who are going to implement this scheme are as clear in their ideas and in what they would like to see done as we are.</P>
      <P>Sectional interests are bound to play a part here.  The word &ldquo;snob&rdquo; has been used on a number of occasions this morning, and the snobbery has been connected with secondary schools. I wonder if the parents&mdash;I include myself in this&mdash;are completely free from the snobbery that is attached to sending our children solely to secondary post-primary schools.  I wonder how many national or even vocational teachers send their children to a post-primary vocational school.  Most of us have not done this.  I am not a teacher. I must confess my children are not attending a post-primary vocational school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must hark back in the history of our country to examine the reasons for this.  Up to a short time ago, and indeed it is still so in secondary schools, the emphasis was completely on education for the university.  Our whole educational and examination system is geared to university education.  It is only now we are coming round to the idea that there is some other place to send our children besides the university. With the foundation of the regional technical colleges and the diplomas that will be given there I feel a change will come about&mdash;at least I hope so. We have for too long practically worshipped <Col N="1245" /> the academics of our country and have regarded our craftsmen as being not quite first-class citizens; and that, in this country, where in days of old craftsmen were the people of importance, is a sad thing to see.  But we inherited our later educational system from somewhere else and we are only now coming into our own.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Senator Quinlan in saying that we are too certificate-minded.  Children are under extreme pressure from the time they go into a post-primary school.  We are now reaching the stage where a number of our leaving certificate students are having nervous breakdowns over the results of the leaving certificate, or during the course, because of the pressures that are being exerted on them or which they are exerting on themselves. There should be some system of credits for their work during the year in various fields.  Something must be done about our examination system.  I wonder if we could perhaps see that the intermediate certificate is not such a thing of great merit and it might be recommended that in many cases it could be by-passed.</P>
    <P>I should like to see too, through post-primary education&mdash;and this might now be available with the amalgamation of schools&mdash;more interest in the crafts section of our education, and in handwork.  Even if the children take examinations they might at the end of the time have a handwork examination, be it metal work, engineering, or wood turning.  This could be a part of the leaving certificate curriculum. This would encourage people to think along lines other than mere academic subjects.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, too, with adult education.  We have looked for many years to the vocational education committees to provide classes throughout the winter for adults.  This they have done&mdash;and great credit is due to them &mdash;sometimes by employing teachers who were not, or will not now anyway, be regarded by a section of the teaching organisation as fully qualified to teach crafts.  I am speaking of traditional crafts rather than home crafts. I have always maintained that the <Col N="1246" /> domestic science instructresses or home economics teachers should be concerned only with the teaching of home economics and that the teaching of crafts, handcrafts and home crafts, should be the duty of a crafts teacher. We have no facilities in this country for the teaching of traditional crafts and, except for what is done in the College of Arts and the limited amount done in the various vocational and domestic training colleges, this field has been left completely to the ICA and their subsidiary, Country Markets, to do what they could to improve the teaching of crafts in the country.  I am referring now to the crafts the women do.</P>
    <P>Country Markets have over the years taught crafts at various centres and the ICA have done the same thing and have taught crafts at An Grianán, their adult education college.  They have brought out a proficiency test for this and the women must pass a fairly stiff examination before they get a proficiency certificate.  They have now gone a step further, realising that teachers are needed to teach home crafts, and they have set their own teachers' test.  They have based this on an English examination.  There are now a number of teachers so qualified.</P>
    <P>It would be a great thing if the Minister and his Department would take a look at this test and see whether it measures up to what they would expect craft teachers to have, and do something about recognising it.  Otherwise, this year through the country many thousands of women will be deprived of craft classes, because those about whom I speak are employed by vocational education committees.  After this session I wonder if they will be employed. Home crafts may be brushed aside as being insignificant.  But they give many women pin money at home and in one case they have been the foundation of a very successful hand craft co-operative where there are now 300 members with a turnover of practically £20,000 a year.  This, to an area where there was no money coming in before, is a great boost.  This has its foundations in people being taught hand crafts locally. I appeal to the Minister to examine the position regarding these teachers and if <Col N="1247" /> he can do something constructive about it we will be very glad.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister the best of luck with the implementation of this Bill but I suggest to him that without co-operation from the parents it will be very difficult to get this message across. The parents minds must be changed about the type of education available to their children.  If there is anything the ICA can do to help him, I know they will be only too pleased to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the other Senators in extending a welcome to the Minister's introduction of what has been described as a straightforward measure.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to section 2.  I am very glad the Minister has taken the necessary powers to reconstitute certain dissolved committees.  I am sure the Minister had in mind the City of Limerick Vocational Education Committee when he brought this provision into the Bill.  As is generally known, the vocational education committee in Limerick city were dissolved, following an inquiry held by the Minister's predecessor three years ago.  Many people in Limerick are still at a loss to understand what it was all about.  The inquiry was long and cost much money. The final analysis appeared to achieve very little.  I should like to ask the Minister if he would be good enough, when replying to this debate, to indicate when it is proposed to re-constitute that Limerick committee.  Will the membership of the committee be on the same lines as it was in the old committee?  Will they have the same powers, particularly in relation to staff appointments?  Will the method of financing be the same as it was prior to the committee's disbandment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to enlarge on the question of finance.  I agree with the proposals in this Bill to give the vocational committees powers to make financial assistance available to other educational committees or bodies.  I wonder how this is to be financed?  It will obviously mean a substantial increase from the local authorities, who contribute to the vocational education <Col N="1248" /> committees.  Has the Minister in mind the limit he proposes to place on the financing by the local authorities, and what proportion of the additional expenditure will be borne by central funds?  This is very important.  At this juncture it might be helpful to the Senators who are members of vocational education committees to know what the Minister is thinking about the future financing of this very desirable development.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been said by other Senators to be taking a very important step in the right direction towards achieving the maximum degree of co-operation so as to ensure that all the resources available to his Department are used to the greatest possible benefit of the children of the nation.  Everyone would subscribe to that philosophy unreservedly.  It is a principle which could very well be extended into other facets of our national life, including sporting and athletic organisations.  I hope I will live to see the day when one sporting field in a town or city will be utilised to play all games, irrespective of what association or organisation controls them.</P>
    <P>Several Senators have referred to what they described as a certain degree of &ldquo;snobocracy&rdquo; towards secondary education as compared with the vocational or technical education.  This is quite true, but we should have regard to the wonderful work which the religious orders, in particular, have done over the years to provide secondary education where no secondary education would have been available without their activities.  While we realise now that the division between academic education and technical education should be closed and that we should have one post-primary education, that development, however desirable and inevitable, could not possibly have come about if the earlier efforts of the religious, and in some cases the lay groups, had not provided the basis on which to build the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I do not think this House would wish it to be said that they were merely critical of the whole idea of secondary education because some of the children of the nation did not have an opportunity <Col N="1249" /> to avail of it.  Secondary education or academic education has existed over the years, but the real difficulty has been that it was not enjoyed equally by all the children of the nation. As many Senators have said, it is true that in the past, and currently, many well-meaning but foolish parents sent their children to secondary schools when in many cases the children's future might be better served by giving them an opportunity of technical or vocational education.  We all know cases of individual children with four or five honours in their leaving certificates who are stuck in dead end jobs for the rest of their lives, whereas if they had had a technical education they would now have the ability and opportunity to earn a better future for themselves.</P>
    <P>Our objective should be to combine the best of both systems so that every child in the State can be educated in the full sense and develop his natural talents for his own personal benefit in later life and for the benefit of the nation.  Education does not consist of producing only technocrats, any more than it means producing academic scholars divorced from the realities of everyday life.  We need both academic scholars and people skilled technically. We should not play off one against the other.  Our ambition should be to have every child begin life with the essential basis of a broad education and then to develop his natural skills, whether academic or technical.</P>
    <P>It is important for every child to have an opportunity of getting into a secondary, comprehensive or technical school.  It is even more important to ensure that the quality of education is as good as it can be.  I hope, in our desire to ensure that every child has an equal opportunity of post-primary education, that the quality of that education does not suffer.  Sufficient education teachers of the highest possible standard are available to give the right kind of education to all our children.</P>
    <P>I hope the day will come when the ordinary, humble, unskilled or semiskilled labourer will have an appreciation, due to the right type of education, <Col N="1250" /> of good literature, the arts, culture and music.</P>
    <P>In this era, when leisure hours are becoming extended every year, it is obvious that it is in the best interests of the children that they should be taught to appreciate the arts and culture, and that their ideas of recreation and amusement should not be confined to exercising on playing fields, however desirable that may be, or to taking a self-drive car for the day, or going to the pictures, or some other such form of amusement.  Certainly it cannot possibly fulfil their inherent desires to use their leisure time to the full.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a bias in every post primary school towards an appreciation of the arts and of culture so that the humblest working man there-after will have a real appreciation of those things.  I might say in passing&mdash; and Senators in every part of the country will have the same experience&mdash; that it is remarkable to see the number of people, from humble backgrounds, humble homes, humble avocations, who have taken a prominent part in organising cultural activities in their own towns, in their own areas. That is the type of thing which should be begun at primary school level and developed at post primary level.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to all of us that the development of comprehensive education, the joining together of academic and technical fields of education, will lead to co-education.  I am sure this is a development the Minister has in mind.  It is an inevitable development and I think it is a good thing.  I hope that in the future when the Minister is developing his ideas on education in general he will keep this inevitable development, as I regard it, in mind.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's reference to consultation and co-operation with the various education authorities.  This is vitally necessary. No progress can be true or satisfactory progress unless the Minister and his officials, and the education authorities generally, consult with the lay and religious bodies who have long and valuable experience in all fields of secondary education.</P>
    <P>I should like to join Senator Keery in his references to the Protestant <Col N="1251" /> community.  When we talk of comprehensive schools we should keep the 5 per cent religious minority always in mind.  It is not only a good thing in justice but I think it would also give a very valuable headline to our co-religious and the members of every church on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>The young people being educated nowadays will be the citizens of the future who will take their place in the new Europe.  We all accept that in a short period of years this country will be a member of the EEC.  That being so, the Minister is very wise in the steps he is taking now to ensure that the type and the quality of education our young people are getting and will be getting in the future will fit them not only to be worthy citizens of this little country but also worthy citizens in the wider European context.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan made reference to the question of restricting the scale of adult education or part-time education. I am sure the Minister has seen references to it in this morning's newspapers. I am sure also that every Senator feels it would negative the worthwhile developments in vocational education if there were any restriction in regard either to finance or the provision of adequate staff.  I hope the Minister, when he is replying, will reassure us on that point.  Again, I wish to congratulate the Minister for having brought in this simple, straightforward measure.  If we have been more loquacious than he anticipated, I am sure he will appreciate that it has been in the best constructive spirit.  I hope some of our views will be helpful to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealCranitch" hpid="Mícheál Cranitch Mícheál Cranitch">

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille agus déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire as ucht an mBille agaus freisin as ucht na hóráide a thug sé dúinn inniu.  Óráid an-mhaith a bhí ann ó thús go deireadh.</P>
      <P>I very sincerely welcome the Bill.  I welcome the thinking behind it.  This is an age when, as the Minister stated in his speech, barriers are being broken. I will quote the last sentence on the first page of the speech:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will facilitate the development <Col N="1252" /> of co-operation in many centres and help further to break down the barriers between the secondary and vocational systems.</P>
    <P>So far, so good.  In the fullness of time, we hope it will also break down the barriers that exist or seem to exist between the secondary, vocational and primary systems.</P>
    <P>Education is a continuing process and it would be very foolish for a person to believe or to attempt to believe that education can be put into water-tight compartments.  Unfortunately, this has been the tendency for far too long.  We have had what people like to think of as a primary system, a secondary system, a vocational system and a university system.  It is unfortunately true that the great majority of our people still look on education as being in one of these compartments.  Nothing could be further from the truth because from the day we are born until the day we die we are learning.  Unfortunately, too often we forget what we have learned.</P>
    <P>Education, then, cannot be divided up even into age groups.  At the various ages in a person's life, changes occur in the development of the mind.  Certain sections of the mind will develop at certain stages of a person's life and later other sections of the mind will develop.  Psychologists and we educationists in general are aware of this. We are also aware that those developments do not come in any particular individual at any fixed time, because, as individuals vary, individual minds vary.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is disastrous for anyone to believe that we will give a child primary education up to a certain age and then, when he reaches the age of 11 plus, 12 plus or 13 plus, that he will be transferred elsewhere.  For that reason, I commend Senator Brosnahan for saying that the ideal as far as teachers are concerned is one association of all teachers.</P>
    <P>However, so long as there are various teachers' organisations, that basic fact will not be recognised.  Primary teachers may be inclined to think that they should keep their own knowledge among themselves, secondary teachers <Col N="1253" /> may have the same idea in their respect and, possibly, vocational teachers might hold the same idea about themselves. The truth is, however, that we are all working towards one aim and that is the development of the human personality to its highest degree and the development of a sound mind in a sound body.</P>
    <P>While I am on the matter of a sound mind and a sound body, I should like to refer to the development of technical skills.  The day is gone when a person can be said to be educated if he can merely read, discuss, propose theories, do higher mathematics, become involved in scientific arguments or acquire a great volume of knowledge about different subjects if, having acquired all this, he is unable, for instance, to fix an electric plug.</P>
    <P>In my primary school I have always encouraged not only the boys, but the girls also, to learn as much as they can at home or at school or anywhere else about such things as attaching electrical fittings and the various other miscellaneous jobs that have to be done in a home.  I advise them to take an interest in carpentry, home decoration and so on, because if we wish to survive in this particular age, there must be all-round development of mind and body.  The Swedes, while they may have given us bad example in some respects, have given us good example in many ways.  In Sweden girls require many skills that were traditionally associated with boys, while boys, in addition to their traditional skills, are also taught such arts as sewing, knitting and crochet which were always associated with girls.</P>
    <P>Excellent sentiments are expressed in the Minister's address.  He said, for example:</P>
    <P>My Department with a view to having comprehensive educational facilities provided in the most economical way without waste or overlapping has been encouraging co-operation between secondary and vocational schools so that comprehensive educational facilities can be provided in each area of the country. In a number of centres in which co-operation between secondary <Col N="1254" /> schools and vocational schools is being developed proposals have been made for the sharing of specialist facilities and ancillary accommodation, e.g. science laboratories, assembly halls, gymnasia, playing fields, etc....</P>
    <P>Probably the Minister had in mind in that &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; such things as musical training, library facilities, art and swimming, because all of these are of vital importance in the age in which we live.  Some years ago the then musical director of the Radio Éireann String Quartet&mdash;an Englishman living in Cork &mdash;and I were discussing a certain secondary boys college.  This was indeed a very famous college and it so happened that at that particular time this college had two or three excellent musicians who happened to be students of this particular gentleman.  He was lamenting the fact that there was no orchestra whatever in the college.  In passing, I mentioned the name of a secondary school for girls across the road from this particular college where there was a small orchestra.  He suggested on hearing this that perhaps these two institutions might combine with a view to having a fine orchestra. I must admit that my reaction to this was something near to horror.  Of course, this was some years ago.  My idea then was that, no matter what might happen, such co-operation between a boys and a girls school was not possible.</P>
    <P>However, as we all know, there have been many changes in the past few years.  Barriers have been broken down. I have no knowledge as to whether these two particular institutions to which I referred ever combined in the musical sense but I am sure that, if the same situation prevailed today, there would be co-operation.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the question of co-education. This matter has been mentioned already by a number of Senators.  Apart altogether from the economic factors that would be involved by way of saving of money and in relation to specialist teachers and specialist facilities, co-education could have a salutary effect on the youth of today.  I teach in a mixed primary school and down through the years I <Col N="1255" /> have seen the advantages of boys and girls studying together.  They develop a normal relationship and they learn to treat each other with proper respect. I have often had visits by children from elsewhere&mdash;boys who were attending schools exclusively for boys and girls who were attending schools exclusively for girls&mdash;and I found that those children became very embarrassed when in the company of the opposite sex.  I remember a boy who came to us from Cork where he had been at an all-boys' school.  I found it necessary to take that boy aside and advise him because he became very upset in class by reason of his not being used to a co-ed school.</P>
    <P>The wind of change is blowing; so also is the wind of charity.  As a result of this Bill I can foresee large scale co-operation between secondary and vocational schools throughout the country. Of course, as the Minister is probably aware already, there will be some difficulty. Excellent as the Bill is, its implementation is another matter. There are bound to be petty jealousies in certain areas and people may read into the legislation things that are not there at all.</P>
    <P>A sentence in the Minister's speech is probably the finest statement in the whole speech:</P>
    <P>It will be the task of my Department to secure the maximum degree of co-operation so as to ensure that the resources at our disposal are used to the greatest possible benefit of the children of the nation.</P>
    <P>That is a splendid statement.  I know that the Minister has the very best intentions and that his heart is in this particular matter.  We wish him the greatest success.  I only hope his sentiments and our sentiments will be understood to be sincere and genuine.  I hope this anxiety to do the best we can for our children with what resources we have will bear fruit.  I hope the message will be understood by the various teachers' organisations so that they will come together for the good of the children and for the dignity of their own profession.  It is unfortunate that there is disagreement among them.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Finance Bill <Col N="1256" /> I made a major point about the dreadful dangers of the wrong use of leisure time.  A five-day week is generally accepted and sometimes even a four-and-a-half-day week.  The big question is: what are workers going to do during their free time?  I pointed out yesterday that unnecessary spending on consumer goods and on pleasure contribute in a large way to inflation.  On the other hand, the right use of leisure time could have a most ennobling effect on all concerned.</P>
    <P>The vocational school&mdash;the vocational cum secondary school when this Bill is implemented&mdash;could help a great deal if it could attract people to study such things as music, art, drawing, woodwork and so on.  There is no reason why a tradesman who uses his hands during the week could not learn a second or third language.  Likewise, there is no reason why a man in a sedentary occupation should not be given an opportunity of acquiring such skills as painting, woodwork and drawing. It will no doubt be said that this is already being done in major centres of population, but I would like to see people in rural areas being given the same opportunity to do this.  Many people in rural areas can travel in their cars to the local towns, but if national schools could be used as centres where people could study I believe this would have a tonic effect on the whole community. It would give life in rural Ireland a new dimension.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his speech.  I should like to pay a well deserved compliment to all the vocational committees throughout the country.  They are doing a great job and are taking a practical interest in education.  It is a fact that we who are very close to education often miss the point that can be seen by the man who observes from a distance.  I am a member of a vocational committee and I always listen to and read the speeches of the members of these committees very carefully.  They usually have something very sound to offer and they have no hesitation in offering it.  I commend the Bill and hope it will be given a speedy passage through the Seanad.  I wish the Minister and his Department every success in implementing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other speakers I, too, welcome this Bill.  I was a little surprised at Senator Keery's apparent lack of knowledge of conditions in this country.  He seemed to be more <i>au fait</i> with conditions in South Shields when he was making his plea for the Press to be present at vocational committee meetings. I do not know of any vocational committee, perhaps Senator Keery does, which has banned the Press or where the Press are not welcome.  I should like to pay tribute to the local Press, especially for the part they played in the early days of vocational education in making parents aware of the value of vocational education.  I have had the pleasant experience of being a member of a vocational committee during my time in public life. Vocational schools were described before the coming of free secondary education, as the poor man's university. From a rather small start vocational education snowballed and vocational schools now play a very valuable part in educating less fortunate children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old saying that good things come in small parcels and this Bill can be described in just that way. It is a small Bill but what is contained in it is very good.  In his introductory speech the Minister informed the House that facilities would be made available in secondary schools to students of vocational schools.  He also said that vocational committees would be permitted to share such facilities as playing fields, assembly halls and gymnasiums. This is excellent but it will apply only in more populated areas. We all know of small towns with only a primary school and a vocational school but no secondary school.  In these towns there are very few facilities available for the students.  The one slight criticism I have of the Bill is that this type of area appears to have been overlooked.  It is for this type of area that I want to plead.  I would therefore ask the Minister to make funds available as far as possible to provide facilities for the primary and vocational schools in small towns.  I am sure many Senators know of schools where there are no playing fields and during the lunch break the only thing for the children <Col N="1258" /> to do is wander around the village or town until it is time to reassemble again.  At the end of the school day they may have to wait three-quarters of an hour before the bus will pick them up and take them home.  All there is for the children to do until the bus comes is to walk around the streets.</P>
    <P>Playing facilities are vitally necessary in all our vocational schools.  I must pay tribute to the teachers in those schools.  They do a wonderful job in providing recreation for children by seeking the co-operation of the local club&mdash;the tennis, football or hurling club&mdash;and using their facilities.  There are inter-schools competitions within the counties and now it has gone further and there are inter-county competitions, provincial and all-Ireland. This is most desirable and should be encouraged.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us in his reply whether he can hold out any hope, now that money is being made available to sporting organisations, that money will be made available to vocational education committees to enable them to provide the sporting facilities that are needed in all educational institutions.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I am satisfied that it will have very satisfactory results where there are playing facilities or big secondary schools but I am a little worried about the other areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FarrellMcElgunn" hpid="Mr. McElgunn Mr. McElgunn">

      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht an mBille seo a thabhairt isteach.  Maraon leis na Seanadóirí eile cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille agus tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh fónta leis.</P>
      <P>Many of the points which I had hoped to raise here have been dealt with.  There is a temptation here&mdash; because we have not got the opportunity the people in the other House have, of debating matters on Estimates &mdash;to have an Estimates type debate here when a Bill comes before us.  We are tempted not to adhere closely to what is in the Bill.  I shall try, as far as I can, to deal with the Bill and not to go outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only a limited amount of money available to the Department to deal with post primary education.  I <Col N="1259" /> welcome the Bill in so far as it will avoid wasteful overlapping as between the vocational and the secondary branches.  The sharing of facilities will mean that, whereas in the past we had vocational schools and secondary schools all looking for expensive laboratories and gymnasia, now, especially in smaller towns, these will be shared.  This will be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>The second thing that is mentioned here is the question of sharing teachers. In some subjects it is becoming more and more difficult to get teachers of the standard required, particulary for subjects like science and mathematics. It is good that these will be shared between the various schools.</P>
    <P>Even with the best will in the world there will be difficulty and delay in achieving co-operation.  These difficulties should not be mistaken for reluctance or opposition.  It is better that we should work out a proper system of co-operation between the various schools than to rush in and try to impose a solution.  Nowadays everybody looks for instant results, whether it is in housing or anything else.  We would all like to move quickly but we must move slowly.  It is better that we should do that and work out a proper system rather than bungle it.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell referred to the desirability of introducing crafts to the post primary schools.  Senator Cranitch referred to music appreciation.  All these things are very desirable and we would all like to see them in our post primary schools but, speaking as a teacher in a day school, where we are limited in time, whereas the boarding schools are not limited to the same extent, we would find it very difficult to fit in these things.  Pressures of the school time-table and of the buses cut down the amount of time available for extra curricular activities such as games and debates.  It would be very difficult to find time to fit in all these other things that are being advocated.</P>
    <P>There is one subject on which I speak with reluctance as a secondary teacher.  The word &ldquo;snobbery&rdquo; has been tossed around in the House this morning a good deal.  I agree with <Col N="1260" /> Senator Farrell who said that snobbery arises very largely on the part of parents.  It is easy to attribute snobbery to one section of the system rather than another and to the teachers in that section but I believe the snobbery is on the part of the parents.  It is to them we must look to get rid of any idea of snobbery.  Like many of the difficulties in our educational system, all these things are relics of the past. We cannot change the past.  It was because parents very often hoped for security of employment for their children rather than for snobbish reasons that they sent them to certain types of schools.</P>
    <P>I hope that with an expanding economy and a widening range of opportunities for young people any idea of snobbery will go.  I have been teaching in secondary schools for 16 years and I have never found, among the secondary teaching profession, any snobbery or any idea of condescension towards any other branch of the profession. Perhaps this may exist among certain teachers but I have never found it and it is very annoying when the finger is pointed.</P>
    <P>I will go along with Senator Quinlan and Senator Russell in their tributes to the contribution made by the secondary education authorities, the secondary school managers and particularly the religious orders, people who devoted their whole lives to education and ploughed back their salaries into buildings and facilities which we now hope will become available for both sections of post primary education.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that nearly all of these orders are co-operating, or prepared to co-operate, in work either between schools for boys and girls or between secondary and vocational systems. I must express my disappointment with one order of teaching brothers which has a marvellous record in education and to which this State owes a great debt of gratitude for the way in which it inculcated nationalism and national traditions in many people and upheld national values in this city in particular.  I am referring to the Irish Christian Brothers.  I am disappointed that they have not seen their way to co-operate <Col N="1261" /> in co-educational experiments. The school in which I teach is run by another order of brothers which has a common co-founder with the Christian Brothers.  Last year we had an experiment in co-education in our school. The girls from the neighbouring convent school came in for mathematics classes.  I hope this development will expand in the coming year.  I can see nothing except benefit coming from this arrangement.  I hope the people I spoke of will give second thoughts to this development.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch mentioned the benefits which can come from co-education. I would be fully in agreement with the Senator on that.  There should be as much co-operation as possible between schools for boys and girls and between vocational and secondary schools.  I welcome the Bill and hope that it will have successful results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome this Bill for a number of reasons.  I have one small criticism of it which is probably unavoidable.  It tends in its terminology to perpetuate the idea and concept of vocational and technical education which was common at the time the original Act was passed.  This Act was a very good Act in its day but feelings on vocational education have changed considerably since that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons why I welcome this Bill, and why other Senators have done so as well, is that it gives an opportunity to us to discuss an aspect of the educational system.  We have all too few opportunities of discussing the educational system.  Nobody can say that the Estimates debates provide sufficient opportunities for such discussion. This is partly because of the extraordinary lack of educational legislation in this country.  We have, in fact, an educational system which is administered almost entirely by orders which are incapable of scrutiny in the Houses of the Oireachtas in the sense that ordinary legislation is.  I look forward to more educational legislation in the future.  It will become inevitable. People have gone on record with increasing frequency in the past few months as expressing their fear of State <Col N="1262" /> control in secondary education and more specifically in the academic type of secondary education which up to now has been run largely by the religious orders.  Looking at the history of the vocational education system we have the answer to these fears.  I am not suggesting that every vocational education committee has always behaved in anything but the best possible way, but people are human and institutions are composed of human beings.  No system is perfect.  When we look at the development of the vocational education system we have a good answer to the kind of fears which have been expressed by many people in the recent past.</P>
    <P>My reading of this Bill is that it constitutes an invitation to the academic-type of private secondary school to co-operate.  It is an invitation for co-operation as equal partners in the whole business of education.  I would agree with Senator Brosnahan that the national schools are also equal partners in the whole work.  Why has this Bill been found necessary?  Technically, this Bill has been introduced to remove certain disabilities which may be adduced to prevent co-operation between secondary and vocational schools.  The real reason is probably wider than that.  One of the reasons why it is necessary is that so many of our schools at the moment are too small to provide for the children attending them the right kind of education. On the second page of the Minister's speech it is stated:</P>
    <P>A large size school unit is now generally accepted as being a necessary prerequisite to the provision of comprehensive educational facilities at any kind of reasonabe cost and to making the best possible use of scarce teaching skills.</P>
    <P>I find this understressed in the Minister's speech.  I wondered whether this is so because the education in our national schools excites adverse reactions among so many people.  We must grasp this nettle boldly and assure people that large schools are in no way dangerous but are the only way in which we can provide adequate education for our children.  This will become increasingly obvious.  We must realise <Col N="1263" /> that educational reform is taking place at two levels&mdash;in terms of actual physical structures of the schools and administrative arrangements, and also within the curriculum and examination system.  If we are to be able to carry out the kind of educational reforms suggested by Professor McNamara and others, it would be impossible to do so without rationalisation of the schools system.  In order to help to do this, we must persuade people how necessary larger schools are for their children's benefit.</P>
    <P>I agreed with Senator Brosnahan when he spoke about our educational system and the division within it.  It is not only divided into primary, secondary, vocational and university education, but it is split between boys and girls, between Protestant and Catholic, and, I am afraid, even between rich and poor.  Whenever one looks at it it seems to split in another direction.</P>
    <P>I see this Bill as one of the first steps towards knitting the component parts of this rather ramshackle structure.  It is a small step and I think it will have to be followed by other steps.  It is the beginning of a long process which will lead inevitably, I think, to some sort of joint management in this area.  This is not within the scope of the Bill now before us but it is something we will have to face sooner or later.  When that times comes the Minister will be faced with very difficult, delicate political decisions.  As far as I am concerned he will have every understanding of the difficult job he will have to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I began my comments on the Finance Bill in the context of the Central Bank Report.  There is at least some hope now that all are agreed that the major threat of inflation must be handled and handled quickly.  If this calls for drastic Government action in the Fall such as the introduction of a supplementary budget, we must recognise the necessity for such action and realise that it is in the common interest that a firm stand should be made and that, if necessary, harsh measures must be taken to restore our position and to ensure that the development of the past ten years is not jeopardised by the very high demands for wage increases which are being conceded in most cases.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank Report while it presents a frightening picture on the one hand, charts equally the measures that are required to remedy the situation. Foremost among those measures is the fact that there must be pressure on three fronts&mdash;on incomes, on public finance and on restriction of credit.  In other words, they advocate the full use of fiscal and monetary measures to restore our competitiveness and so to get the economy back on a more even keel that will be more in keeping with what is happening in countries elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incomes is probably the most important aspect here.  It is obvious that the rates of increase that have been conceded to all sections are not matched by increases in productivity.  Consequently, our competitiveness is bound to deteriorate further in the present year.  When we consider the situation as it is, we cannot but be impressed by the appalling waste of national assets by way of the loss of man days due to strike action.  Last year the total loss was 900,000 man days.  This is equivalent to more than 5,000 men <Col N="1265" /> working for a year and it represents a loss in national productivity of the order of £35 million or £45 million.</P>
    <P>We must consider what the economy could have done with that amount of increase if it could have got it in any one year and ask ourselves the question as to whether we are progressing because at a time when the overwhelming majority of our people have come to realise that the gun is not the method of solving our problems or the means of re-uniting our country, so also must it be realised that the concept of the gun, as it were, in relation to strike action is not the correct or the Christian way of approaching the problem.  Strike action may have been very necessary in the past but surely this is not so in our developed society when we should all be concerned with the common good in so far as this can be achieved by the pooling of resources to develop a system of arbitration that will cut drastically the unnecessary national loss through strike action.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Government can use their fiscal policy very strongly in this regard.  First of all, we should study carefully whether we should not have a cooling-off period as is the case in America.  There, this system has worked satisfactorily under the Taft-Hardy law despite having had a stormy reception at the time by organised labour.  Now organised labour in the United States realise that this has been a valuable part of industrial relations there and that it has contributed to the advancement of the general welfare of the labour forces in the States.  Fiscal policy should be used because we have become sick and tired of these parlour games that are being indulged in by matadors on both sides.</P>
    <P>Professionals on both sides in the bank dispute believe the whole economy can stand still while they work out in an eighteenth-century fashion their own game of chess and see who is going to outwit the other.  I would call on the Government to see that the realities of the situation are brought home to both sides in disputes. We must get away from the idea that a strike will drag on for one, two or three months.  After a short period, I would suggest a couple of weeks, <Col N="1266" /> Government fiscal policy should begin to bite on both sides.  It should bite on the employers by drastically reducing their exemption from corporation and profits tax during the time the strike continues.  The workers should also be hit through their earned income allowances which should be drastically reduced for every day the strike continues over and above the short period I suggested of a couple of weeks.  This would enable the Government to put real pressure on the participants in a strike to get on with negotiations.  It would also make both sides realise that concessions have to be made.  Strikes cause disruption to fellow citizens and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have detected a note of horror in those I have spoken to about the recent statement made by the official side in the banks dispute.  Up to this point many people have had great sympathy with the officials and their claim but they have lost all claim to sympathy by their undemocratic action in refusing to put the generous proposals to their officials.  I call on the Government to take the strongest possible action and if a Bill is necessary we shall come back here any time in the summer to see that it gets a speedy passage through the Oireachtas.  We are all sick and tired of this dispute.  We have not seen any of the benefits of the rationalisation of our banking system that were supposed to take place with the amalgamation of certain banks. The only outcome has been that it is now much easier to have industrial disputes and to organise militant action.  Our banking system is overmanned for the present day and age when compared with the machine-type banking operations in existence in America.</P>
    <P>The recommendations made in the Central Bank report seem sensible and reasonable.  The Central Bank should have real teeth and be committed to the advancement of public good above all sectional interests.  This virtually means the nationalisation of banking in this country and while I am not over-enthusiastic about nationalisation I think our banking system is a case for examination.  We should ensure the chaos that the bank dispute has caused <Col N="1267" /> does not happen again at a time when the Government had moved to apply their control on inflation by laying down guidelines.  An effort was made to reduce credit last year and thereby contain inflation but because of the bank dispute we do not know what picture will emerge when we settle down again.</P>
    <P>While we spend all our time pressing for public expenditure and capital expenditure to be increased we must recognise that Government spending is the single most powerful inflationary influence within the community.  A good many highly desirable projects and expansions will have to be curtailed until we get back again on an even keel.  It is not popular or easy to say this.  I hope we shall face it in the same united way as we face our political problems.  I hope the Opposition will show the same sense of high concern for national welfare when it comes to tackling economic problems as they have shown when tackling national problems.  When it comes to this I would suggest that in many cases work could be carried out with a larger local contribution through either local help or local financial support.  We must cut out this foreign borrowing whether it is by Aer Lingus or by any others.  Borrowing at this time, with interest rates at 10 or 11 per cent, is absolute lunacy.  This is the equivalent of paying around 17 per cent at home. At least if one paid 17 per cent at home the money concerned would be subject to Irish tax laws and the income tax on it alone would bring back at least one-third apart from the fact that it would be circulating within our economy and would contribute to tax yields within.  Whether we like it or not the Government will have to reduce considerably its financing by means of bank overdraft and foreign borrowing and replace it by more attractive saving incentives and, unfortunately, increased taxation.</P>
    <P>When the present exorbitant wage round, which applies to all sections of the community, up to the highest, has worked itself out then I am afraid an autumn Budget will have to get back a certain amount of what has been given with one hand to try to keep both the current and the capital programmes <Col N="1268" /> of the Government going without having to resort to foreign borrowings.  We should equally look askance at foreign borrowings by some of our major semi-State groups because that too is sending the high interest out of the country and that at this stage is something we cannot afford.</P>
    <P>Above all, the estimates must be scrutinised very carefully so that for our spending at all levels we are certain we are getting value.  We have many big items.  One which comes to mind at present is the good investment the Government are making in agricultural research.  We must ensure that this investment is not undermined by what are blatantly anti-democratic practices by the organisation concerned.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to exercise his prerogative and to have a firm of specialist consultants look at what happened before he decides on the next grant he will make to that body. Frankly, as a scientist I am shocked by what has happened.  I feel it will undermine very substantially the confidence of the agricultural community in the direction and organisation of that.  I know I cannot say more on this debate but it is a financial matter and the £1.3 million that has been spent on it is a big figure.  We are entitled to get value for that.  Above all, we are entitled to have a headline set in accordance with the Act which was passed through this House in 1960 which set up An Foras Talúntais.</P>

      <P>We will probably be able to get in more of it on the Horse Industry Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We scrutinised the Finance Bill again for any signs of a legitimate capital gains tax but despite calls for it over the years none has appeared. In case a capital gains tax may be regarded as some evil, sinister, socialist, almost communist tax we should realise that it is a major tax in the anything but socialist United States.  It is just a legitimate part of any incomes policy, in effect.  One cannot expect any of us on salaries to take kindly to restraints when we have examples all round us of people who bought, say, a patch of land near the city for £5,000 and a few years afterwards sold it for £30,000 or £40,000 for building solely due to the pressures on building space or on amenity grounds.  The State should go in there and get its rightful share on behalf of the taxpayers of the increase in the value that has occurred. I am asking that reasonable, legitimate gains should be allowed.  I am asking for a legitimate allowance on the lines of the United States type of capital gains structure which I feel is sufficiently reasonable and probably too lenient in fact.  At least we must make a start and I am heartened by the fact that the Minister has announced that next year there will be a complete change in the tax structure and that <Col N="1270" /> added value tax is coming in.  Surely in such a context the provision of this capital gains tax must be considered and introduced.</P>
    <P>There is of course the cry about the old dependables&mdash;drink and petrol&mdash; that they cannot stand any more taxation and that we are taxing ourselves out of the tourist market.  The plain fact is that these are not the necessaries of life.  They are luxuries and, therefore, if money is needed this is obviously a legitimate place to look for it.  That cry precluded the Government from making some special concession to tourists. Such a concession would not cost very much.  Concessions are given in other countries where special petrol vouchers are given.  While that might not be possible here, perhaps it would be possible to have some system of recompense for tourists on production of the hotel bill. We should be able to improve our tourist image by allowing certain deductions to tourists by payment of subsidies to the hotels by the Government. We should not allow the damage that increased prices can do to the tourist trade to be used as a means of preventing the Government from getting increased taxes from luxury items.</P>
    <P>The competitive position at home is being eroded by prices and by the dismal failure of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. Every month it becomes more frustrating to see how little effort is made in this regard.  The Minister for Finance should be in a position to make a positive contribution and to ensure that the subvention to the IDA is increased to enable them to do a good promotions job.  It is not enough to have a campaign to &ldquo;Buy Quality Irish&rdquo;.  We want a campaign which emphasises the necessity to buy Irish and keep our children from emigrating. In other words, buying the article must be linked with the provision of employment at home.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement should take a greater part and ensure that their members are aggressively conscious of the employment factor.  I would welcome seeing a strike called in a store by employees if they claimed that the management were preventing them from giving Irish products their proper show on the counters, as happens <Col N="1271" /> in many of the chain-stores.  There is necessity for a complete overhaul of the IDA work and for its enlargement to include all the groups who have a positive contribution to make.  Time is running out in the case of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  With the advent of the Common Market such practices will not be legitimate.  While we can still do something in this regard by Government action, it should be done. Afterwards the action will depend completely on the local groups who cannot, in any conceivable situation, be controlled from Brussels or by anyone outside the country.  The Government will be able to do little in promotion of this type in the future.  When we are discussing the Finance Bill next year I hope we will be able to acknowledge the very solid progress made in this regard and to welcome the great increase in expenditure under this heading in that Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the amount spent on agriculture.  I know the sum is very substantial, but there can be grave disagreement about whether the total is legitimately charged to agriculture or not.  We must look at the figures as they are.  It is right that we should question whether we are getting value for our money.  A certain amount represents income transferred because the wage rounds create steady inflation of values and it is only right and proper that the self-employed&mdash;those in agriculture <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;should have their incomes cushioned against inflation. Their position has deteriorated substantially over the past ten years despite Government action.  A fair amount has been made up by increases in productivity and scientific knowledge. The real necessity at the moment is to channel the funds and to use the money to put us in a competitive position if and when we enter the Common Market.  We must put the accent on quality.  The Government's failure to do this is to be deplored.  A penny may be put on the gallon of petrol but to try to get that tied up to quality standards has been resisted in the past.</P>

It has been traditional for Ministers for Finance coming in to promise that they will engage in Civil Service reform and will try to cut the bill.  This year we did not have any such statement from the Minister.  I hope that the absence of such a statement does not mean that the problem has been shelved as it has in the past.  I hope this means that there is now more momentum than there has been in the past to carrying out this very vital reform.  We may have an opportunity at some stage, if we stay here long enough, to discuss the Devlin Report.  I do not say whether we will get it in 1970 or not but it looks highly problematical.</P>

      <P>Finally I commend the efforts that have been made to get a voluntary prices and incomes policy.  I wish the group working on it every success in their efforts, but I hope that we will get results speedily and that it will involve all classes of prices and incomes so that justice will not alone be done but will be seen to be done by all.  The time has come for a re-dedication to the national effort and to the task of ensuring that the country continues to expand and develop as it has been over the past ten years, in which the record has been good, though no better than the average in Western Europe.  Still for us that has been quite good, and it is a pity to think that sectional interests would be allowed to damage what has been done in the past.</P>
      <P>I appeal then to the Government.  I cannot see much holidays for them because they do have to grapple with this problem, and grapple with it fast, and I for one will be quite happy to support any legislation that will succeed in putting this country back again into a competitive position with inflation controlled so that it is at certainly not more than the average in other countries and probably a little less so as to restore our competitive position, because by and large the success of our efforts in building the country can only be measured by the numbers employed here.  There is no other absolute yardstick, and if inflation threatens to cut out the numbers in employment and to reverse last year's figures where, for the first time in the last 20 years we recorded a net gain in total employment between agriculture and industry, we cannot at this stage allow that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, in concluding on this <Col N="1274" /> Finance Bill, I would like personally to commend the Taoiseach for his very forthright and statesmanlike speeches in recent times, especially the one on the north and the message he addressed to the north and the address that he made yesterday on the problem of inflation.  It is bringing a note of realism and a touch of leadership into this country that augurs well for the 'seventies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister himself has set the theme of this discussion, and he has in his Second Reading speech described the background of this year's Budget as being dominated by inflation.  I want immediately to take issue with the Minister on this speech because I believe that the Minister has been deliberate and at the same time naïve in proceeding from that statement on inflation to deal with increases in wages and salaries.  A fair reading of the Minister's speech would lead one to believe that the main cause of our trouble <i>vis-à-vis</i> inflation was due to the recent round of wage increases.  I do not deny, nor can it be denied, that wage and salary increases make and have made their contribution to the present situation, but I repeat that I take issue with the Minister on what I would describe as the undue emphasis on the round of wages and salaries increases and the implication that they and they alone have contributed to the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be well aware that the Government are very powerfully represented on the National Industrial Economic Council, and they in their report on an incomes and prices policy, and referring to the inflation which has occurred in Ireland, gave two main sets of causes, those originating abroad and those originating within our own country.  The NIEC has this to say in this unanimous report: &ldquo;It is not possible to measure precisely the contribution which each of these has made, and their relative importance has varied from one year to another.&rdquo;  The same report went on to describe the contribution to an inflationary situation which is made by money prices and also amongst other things the expenditure by persons, firms and the Government.  We have, if I may refer <Col N="1275" /> to it, the statement of the Taoiseach yesterday in the Dáil that our situation in relation to inflation is such that&mdash; and I quote the Taoiseach&mdash;&ldquo;Many people, particularly the young, had no experience of any other environment in this country except continuous inflation after three decades of it.&rdquo;  So we have the Taoiseach's own statement that we had 30 years of continuous inflation, and these are 30 years during which the present Government have been in office for most of that time.</P>
    <P>So I make the point that at the beginning of the Minister's speech there is undue and I would submit unfair emphasis on the contribution which the recent increase in wages and salaries has made to what we are being told is the present situation.</P>
    <P>I also want to deal, for a few moments anyway, with the question of an incomes and prices policy, and perhaps to clear up some of the confusion which surrounds that concept particularly in so far as it refers to the trade union movement, to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions signed the NIEC Report on an incomes and prices policy and one at least of those signatories makes no apology for that because he believes that therein contained is a provision representing a sane and reasonable policy for this country.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that this report was not rejected at the annual meeting of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  On the basis that it needed some clarification, and that certain unions and delegates were not clear on the precise details, it was referred back to the executive council.  The House will be aware that this is a democratic device which denotes neither acceptance nor rejection.</P>
    <P>It has to be said also that not the least of the important elements in that incomes and prices report is the establishment of an employer-labour conference. That conference remains in being, albeit with somewhat changed terms of reference.  One of the terms of reference of the conference&mdash;this may interest the House and the Minister&mdash;<Col N="1276" /> is to provide a forum for the discussion of the problems attached to money incomes, prices and industrial relations, to cover the scope of national, industrial and plant level agreements, to discuss wages, prices, productivity, pensions and other non-wage benefits.</P>
    <P>It is important that these points should be made here because the impression may have been given that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, meeting in Cork recently, adopted a somewhat irresponsible policy and outlook. Far from it.  A resolution, unanimously adopted in reference to prices and incomes, supported a proposal that there should be adequate surveillance of prices including development land and housing prices, profits and the inordinately inadequate growth of incomes.  A further motion expressed recognition of the fact that indiscriminate wage claims can be detrimental to the interests of the general body of workers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I take this opportunity of joining in the concern that is being expressed at the prospect of inflation and what it might do to our country and to all of our people.  I wish to make the point also that there are many contributing factors and that it would be unfair to single out wage and salary increases or to give them undue and inordinate significance.</P>
    <P>It was stated by the Taoiseach that unless a general trade union agreement is achieved in a voluntary manner for a pause in wage claims, or unless there is an extension by six months or more of existing agreements, consideration will be given to statutory control of wage and salary increases.  With whatever degree of responsibility I may possess, and sharing, as I have said, the concern of all for the present and potential situation, I strongly advise the Taoiseach and the Government to think very carefully before considering the imposition of statutory control of wage and salary increases.</P>
    <P>General experience in countries which we would define as free would indicate that such a policy would fail. It would fail because in the order of human labour and in the reward which men and women get for their labour, <Col N="1277" /> we are in a realm that could not be likened to traffic to be controlled by Government order: we are in a realm of human relations, and free people would resist strongly any Government control of what they believe to be their rights in that direction.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware such statutory controls are successful only in countries which pursue an ideology which is anathema to us.  If their ideology is anathema to us, we should think very carefully before we adopt any part of their way of doing things.  All of us hope that the voluntary nature of these exercises, which was emphasised in the NIEC report, will form the basis of the operations and activities of the employer-labour conference and of the activities of employers and trade unions.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the employer-labourer conference, with newly defined terms of reference, will be concerned with wages, prices, productivity, and with industrial relations, and while I would not be so foolish as to prophesy that their way will be easy, we must accept that in a free democracy the way of such things is never easy; and while there may be an immediate attraction for the Government to impose statutory control, they must ponder whether such control would not make the last state worse than the first.</P>
    <P>Many&mdash;I would say the majority&mdash; in the trade union movement who are responsible in matters of this kind might be antagonised were the Government to adopt a policy such as was forecast by the Taoiseach yesterday.  If &mdash;I hope it is not an &ldquo;if&rdquo; with a question mark&mdash;we are to achieve this order and sanity in industrial relations, it must be done with the free consent of all concerned, by voluntary participation and by all concerned subscribing to what we believe is in the best interests of the country, and not because it has been imposed on us. Such a policy failed in Britain and contributed to much greater industrial unrest than it was supposed to cure. That lesson should be taken into account by the Government if they are giving further consideration to such a proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> Governments, politicians in general, trade union officials, all have in common that they are dealing with human beings.  Human beings at times may be vexatious, at all times unpredictable and at no time, thank God, set in a common mould.  One thing that must be thought of in dealing with our people is that we have got to be patient. At a time like this in the history of a country's economy, it is not unusual for the trade union movement to be singled out, and I believe that is what happened in the Minister's speech and in the references made by the Taoiseach yesterday in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that we are not all saints, that there are many sinners in our group, but we are all part of a whole and we should like to see more attention being paid by the Government to those other partners in industry who might require some control. I say that, even though I hope that to some extent there also agreement would be of the voluntary nature that we ourselves want.  We would like to see more concern with inordinate profits where they take place.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to inflation in so far as workers are concerned is that they see prices spiralling all the time and they consider they have no alternative but to seek wage increases not merely to give them a comfortable way of life but to allow them to keep their heads above water.  One particular aspect of social policy that appeals to me is in relation to housing.  I believe that the housing situation in this country, although nobody would deny that great work has been done in that sphere, is very near a scandal.  It is a scandal in particular where advantage is being taken of our people by way of the profits that are being made by land speculators and by some who are engaged in the building trade.</P>
    <P>We must have concern and compassion for our young people starting their married life.  These people find it impossible to be allotted a dwelling by a local authority with the result that they are forced either to purchase their own house or to go into these so-called furnished flats.  I know that every TD, every Senator and every <Col N="1279" /> trade union official interviews people every day who find themselves in this tragic situation.  Young people who buy their own houses do so at exorbitant prices that are dictated by the present spiralling situation in regard to housing and land.  As I said recently elsewhere this is a very important, if not a major, contributing factor to the inflation that we are now experiencing.  What other alternative have these young people in these overpriced houses to better themselves when they are faced with the difficulties and contingencies of married life but to seek wage and salary increases so that they might maintain even a modest standard of living?</P>
    <P>If the Government were to tackle the housing problem and to give it priority they would be justified in declaring a national emergency and in adopting measures very near to what we would describe normally as socialist.  If such measures were needed, as I believe they are, no government should be afraid to adopt them because while we may be a mixed economy&mdash;a mixture of public ownership and private enterprise&mdash;this is an area which we should not leave entirely to the private enterprise that has resulted in great hardship to many of our people.</P>
    <P>I thought I should clear to some extent the position on the incomes and prices policy in relation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The employer-labour conference is still in existence and will remain in existence. It has terms of reference that are akin to what the Minister has referred to in his Second Reading speech.  To the extent that I can warn this Government against considering imposing statutory controls on wages and salaries increases, I would say that if these were to be adopted and, particularly, without similar strong action being taken in other spheres, it will be met by very strong opposition from the trade union movement and even from those who, in normal circumstances, would be described as being responsible within that movement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, the Seanad uses the Finance Bill to discuss the proposals outlined in the Budget.  To my mind this Budget is little more <Col N="1280" /> than a lazy man's Budget&mdash;it is the Budget of a man who took the easy way out by simply increasing turnover tax to the extent of 100 per cent in order to bring in necessary revenue.</P>
      <P>This measure took no account whatever of the many indicators of the time to the effect that inflation was rising at a rapid pace, that prices were rising out of all control and that something needed to be done urgently.  What we should have had was a deflationary Budget and definite concrete steps should have been taken to cool off the economy.  Instead of that, what we got in the Budget proposals and what is being given legislative form in this Bill are measures which, if anything, can only help to turn on the heat.</P>
      <P>One must be forgiven for referring back to the crisis about which the nation was told more than 12 months ago when the former Minister for Finance called in representatives of the various trade union groups and employers and when he went on the national television network to announce his concern at the trend the economy was taking and the need for the exercise of caution on all sides.  We were told that it was the intention of the Government to take firm and decisive action.  However, we are still waiting for that firm and decisive action.  In the interim, we have had a new Budget and we now have a new Minister but when is an attempt to be made to restrict prices and to regulate the inflation in the economy?  There was hardly any indication of such attempt in the Minister's speech yesterday.  Neither was there any indication in that speech to indicate that the Minister shares the concern which has been expressed by many people in this House during the past two days and by many others of eminent status outside the House in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to take note of the present trend.  It is no harm to place on the record of this House the percentage increase in the consumer price index over the past few years.  In 1965 it rose by 5 per cent&mdash;it will be agreed that at that time it was somewhat abnormal; in 1966 it rose by 3 per cent; in 1967 it rose by 3.2 per cent; in 1968 it rose by 4.7 per cent and in 1969 it rose by 7.4 per cent.  That was an unbelievable <Col N="1281" /> increase.  The figures up to May of this year already show an increase of 5.6 per cent in the index this year.  This means we have already outstripped the increases in 1966, 1967 and 1968.  If that trend continues one shudders to think what the final increase in prices is likely to be at the end of 1970.</P>
    <P>No firm or decisive action is being taken to regulate prices.  The Budget doubled the turnover tax which can do nothing more than increase prices in itself and stimulate and provoke manufacturers to increase the prices of their finished goods and workers to demand increases in their wages to meet the additional cost of living increases which have resulted.  This, in turn, will provoke and stimulate an upward trend in the retail price of manufactured goods when employers and manufacturers seek to compensate for the increased cost of production. Concern has been expressed both inside and outside this House that if this trend continues the country will be heading along the sheer and definite path of pricing ourselves out of competitive international markets.  We all know just how competitive those markets are at the present time.  We all know the concern being expressed by countries larger than our own and the efforts they are making to see to it that their exports compare favourably with those of other countries, but how do we stand in that regard?</P>
    <P>In the past few days Córas Tráchtála published their annual report. Again, I do not think there is any harm in placing on the record of this House the export performance of this country compared with members of the EEC.  In 1968-69 Great Britain and Northern Ireland had a percentage value increase in their exports of 13.9 per cent.  Their export prices increased by 3.25 per cent.  The volume increases was 10.65 per cent.  Germany had a percentage value increase in their exports of 15 per cent; an export price increase of only 2 per cent, a very commendable figure, and a volume increase of 13 per cent.  France had a percentage value increase in her exports of 22 per cent; an export price increase of 5 per cent and a volume <Col N="1282" /> increase of 17 per cent.  Italy had a percentage value increase in her exports of 18.5 per cent; an export price increase of 1.1 per cent, a remarkably low figure, and a volume increase of 17 per cent.  The Netherlands had a percentage value increase of 15.5; a 1 per cent increase in export prices and a volume increase of 14.5 per cent. Belgium had a percentage value increase in exports of 18.5; a price increase of 2 per cent and a volume increase of 16.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Ireland, tramping triumphantly into the 'seventies under the bright, shining Fianna Fáil Government had a percentage value increase in her exports of 11.1&mdash;the lowest percentage increase in export prices; an increase of 6 per cent in export prices&mdash;the highest.  We are top of the league but, unfortunately, this is the league where one gets the prize for being bottom.  This 6 per cent increase in export prices is almost twice the percentage increase of prices in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and with the exception of France more than three times the price increase of any EEC country.  The percentage volume increase stands at only 5 per cent.  It is interesting to note that in relation to all the other countries I have mentioned the volume increase percentage-wise was far greater than the figures shown for the increase in prices but in relation to this country the price increase last year was 6 per cent and the volume increase was only 5 per cent.  This means we had a smaller percentage of volume increase than we had percentage rise in prices.</P>
    <P>Further on the Córas Tráchtála report states that in 1959 total exports amounted to £129 million and in 1969 they amounted to £403 million.  They go on to say that the percentage increase in exports was over 211.  In other words, our exports in terms of £SD produced three times as much money as they had done in 1959.  What the very laudable gentlemen in Córas Tráchtála is neglecting to do in comparing export prices for 1969 with those for 1959 is to convert the 1969 figure in real money terms to that of 1959.  The fall in the value of the £ has not been mentioned.  In mid-August 1969, £1 was equivalent to <Col N="1283" /> 13s 7d in mid-February 1959.  I quote mid-August deliberately because that was close to the date of the Córas Tráchtála figures.  If one converts the 211 per cent increase which Córas Tráchtála produced over the ten-year period and reduces the £ to 13s 7d in 1959 terms one discovers that the increase is 112 per cent.  Exports have not trebled in real money terms over the last ten years.  They have doubled.</P>
    <P>There will continue to be a constant erosion of the value of money in real terms.  If we continue to compare two years and make no effort to take the fall in money values into account we are doing nothing more than attempting to delude ourselves.  The £403 million exports in 1969 represents £274 million in 1959 prices.  This figure of £274 million is the one which should be compared with £129 million shown on the chart.</P>

      <P>I am merely pointing out the figures outlined by Córas Tráchtála in their report and reconciling them in real money terms.  I am referring to the figures quoted on page 13 of the 18th Report of Córas Tráchtála.  The figures merely show the rise in money terms in Irish exports in ten years.  My concern is with the exports of this country.  It is fair to compare the percentage volume increase and the percentage increase in prices in one year for the Common Market countries against the figures for our country.  There is no need to convert <Col N="1284" /> those figures back to 1959 terms because the trend is given by Córas Tráchttála to exemplify the manner in which this country is pricing itself out of the export market and failing to keep up with the percentage increase in value in other countries in one year. This is why I adverted to it and why the Minister is upset by it.</P>

      <P>I want to speak about the increased turnover tax.  I understand that some Senators on the Government side of the House were gracious enough to inform the House that the people were unconcerned about this increase and that it did not upset them.  We may yet be told that the people welcomed the increase in turnover tax with open arms. Perhaps it is as well that the record of this House expresses the annoyance, disgust and upset which the vast majority of the people of this country feel about the imposition of what must be one of the most unfair taxes the Government could find.  It runs right across the board and is imposed on everybody from millionaire to social welfare beneficiary.  It was imposed on everything from Mercedes cars to the loaf of bread.  This tax means that what the Government decided to do in order to increase the social welfare benefits was to put a tax on the loaf of bread and on essential foodstuffs. In referring to the increased social welfare benefits we should remember that the pensioner may be getting more but he is paying more for basic foodstuffs <Col N="1285" /> that they still need to purchase to keep them living at the subsistence level that they obviously must remain on despite the increase in the pensions being paid to them, because of the spiralling rise in prices which the Minister has made no attempt to check.  That is the point I am making.  This is the old Fianna Fáil trick.  The Minister for Finance hands an increase to the pensioner and to the widow on the one hand in grudging charity on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party but, if he does, the Revenue Commissioners have at least two hands in both their pockets at the same time removing that increase, and very often even before it comes, as witness the present situation where the increased turnover tax started on 1st May this year and most of the increases which the pensioners are to receive will start on 1st October.  The increases in prices we all know about have also had to be paid by old people and by widows, and the compensating increases in their pensions will not come for several months yet.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister&mdash;I was going to say if he would be introducing a budget, but all the signs are that he probably will because a budget in the autumn of this year looks a dreadful necessity at the present moment&mdash;but if he will be introducing a budget for the full financial year some time in April or May next, if he is still there and if he decides to impose tax such as turnover tax, he should at least ensure that the imposition of that tax coincides with the day on which any increase in payments to the social welfare classes comes about. The pensioner should get his increase at least on the date on which he is asked to pay more money to fund it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a feeling in many parts of the country, and certainly in many parts of the city of Dublin, that this tax has been abused by retailers.  There is a feeling in the minds of many housewives especially that there are many shops who heretofore had not been charging the 2½ per cent turnover tax, but were including it in their prices, but who when the turnover tax was increased put up their prices and claimed that they had been carrying <Col N="1286" /> the tax themselves up to this.  There is absolutely no suggestion that anyone was bearing this tax himself, as the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners well know.  Any trader in business is obliged to pay turnover tax.  If it does not appear on the prices which are put up as his retail sale prices he is taxed on his turnover by 2½ per cent. That was the position up to the last Budget, so he was not carrying the tax. He was merely upgrading his prices without showing the prices apart from the 2½ per cent tax.  He arrives now at the situation where through the lazyman's Budget he discovers that he can add a further 5 per cent and masquarade it as being turnover tax and that the additional 2½ per cent on his original price now becomes an additional profit for him.  I am not saying that this is happening in many cases, not because I do not believe it is happening but because I do not know in how many cases it is happening.  It is however obvious that it is happening, and if you talk to any housewife, it seems it is happening apparently to quite a considerable degree.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to see to it that the most stringent steps are taken to ensure that the increase in the turnover tax alone is not just an easy way to increase prices following the Budget of this year.  In this regard I would like to make a point which may not be really relevant to small priced items but which is certainly relevant to dearer items.  If up to this a retailer was selling an item at £X, and £X represents his selling price plus the 2½ per cent on it, and he now imposes a 2½ per cent upon £X, it gives him a selling price of £X plus 2½ per cent and that represents the 5 per cent, but in fact the final 2½ per cent is imposed not upon £X but upon £X plus 2½ per cent.  I wonder how many retailers in the country have been adding the 2½ per cent to the original price of the goods before they put on the further 2½ per cent now, giving them an additional 2½ per cent revenue which in some cases is more than 2½ per cent of the original selling price.  In relation to small goods obviously this is a very small figure, but in relation to large items it could amount to a considerable amount.  This is of course something <Col N="1287" /> that the retailer might be forgiven for doing, but the Revenue Commissioners issued some form of circular in which they actually advised them not to charge 5 per cent turnover tax but, I think it was, 5¼ per cent.  It was certainly a fraction over 5 per cent, and the reason for this was to reimburse the retailer for the administrative costs of having to impose the tax, in other words a form of allowance from the Government to the retailer for being an unpaid tax collector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is right in saying that there was a circular from the Revenue Commissioners, which said something like 5.14 per cent.  It was a fraction over 5 per cent, but it was not for the reason that the Senator has said, to recoup the cost of administration, but because the additional tax had to be charged on the turnover. That is not the reason the Senator gave.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That would have been quicker and simpler to say.  It is simply a different way of putting it. The retailers were advised by the Revenue Commissioners to charge in excess of 5 per cent.  The point I was going to make was that if the Minister decided to raise the turnover tax 100 per cent, that is from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent, in fact that was ensuring that prices were rising even more than 5 per cent in this way because the retailers were advised by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1288" /> to charge more than 5 per cent in order to cover themselves.</P>

      <P>1s 3d on £100 is a matter of little concern to Fianna Fáil but it is 1s 3d which should not have been there.  This is the point, and there are many much larger sums than £100 involved in the economic turnover day by day to 365 days in the year.  Perhaps the financial and mathematical brain of Senator Norton would tell us how many hundred thousand pounds there are day by day by day and what that represents in terms of the financial year.</P>

      <P>Perhaps from his lofty perch on the other side of the House Senator Norton might also advise us, at some point when the <Col N="1289" /> Chair is particularly patient, at which stage the Government will ensure that this increase remains simply and solely 12s 6d per £1,000?  There are many things the Government could do, but that is beside the point.  I will return to the contribution I was attempting to make when the interruptions began.</P>
      <P>The point I was coming to in relation to abuses and potential abuses in relation to prices at retail level is that there is a need felt not only by the consumer, the housewife, but also by the man behind the counter, for a definite detailed chart showing how much per 1s, per £, the Revenue Commissioners advise should be imposed on selling prices so as to recoup the turnover tax. If that chart had been made available, the many disputes which I and other Senators know about would not have happened in so many shops throughout the country.  The chart could be hung beside the cash register setting out how much the increased turnover tax meant on 1s, 2s 6d, 5s and so on up to £1.  It would be a simple chart and it would obviously be of great help to consumers and retailers alike.  I hope that when the Minister is replying he will refer to this and give us an undertaking that the Revenue Commissioners will undertake such a task.</P>
      <P>There are many proposals in this Bill, one of them being in relation to sub-contractors who, as the Minister said, are commonly known as &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;.  I am a little confused as to how the Minister intends to see that income tax is levied on &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;. He referred in his speech to giving a certificate to sub-contractors who would have to provide their business addresses.  I presume he is referring to a plasterer who would contract to plaster, say, 100 houses for a certain sum of money.  When I referred to Fianna Fáil earlier the Minister interrupted me but now when I am looking for information he will not indicate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed the Senator had looked at the section.  If he had he would have seen that it refers to &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; and to genuine sub-contractors. The certificate would in general operate for <i>bona fide</i> contractors <Col N="1290" /> but I do not think the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; would be able to qualify for that.  If not, other arrangements will operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The man who is making the payment to the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; will deduct 7s in the £ and remit it to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The contractor would deduct it from the contract price and would pay it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other thing about that.  The Minister referred to sub-contractors but there are also &ldquo;lumpers' &rdquo;&ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;.  A &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; obviously is not going to plaster 100 houses himself.  He will employ three or four men to work with him.  If tax is being stopped by the contractor at 7s in the £, the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; receives his contract price less that amount.  That obviously is a very harsh imposition on the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo;, granted he may have been operating for years without paying tax.  There is then the fact that most &ldquo;lumpers' &rdquo;&ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; are married men, with a few children, who would not be paying 7s in the £ because the children would qualify for allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any practice whereby a &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; employs people.  In such circumstances, they would be paying tax on a PAYE basis. In any case of a &ldquo;lumper&rdquo;, it is a matter of a group working as a group and dividing the money.  The group would have nominated one man to represent them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The other way also operates.  Let us suppose there is a group.  That group will be sharing the lump price, less 7s in the £.  Many of them are married men who would qualify for allowances and who would therefore not be liable to pay the 7s in the £ on total earnings.  Are we to take <Col N="1291" /> it that the intention in the Bill is to wipe out the &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; and to bring them into the system proper?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention of the Minister to see to it that those men will be allowed to make their normal claims in the normal way?  I do not think they can do that because one cannot expect a contractor to start working out allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not have to do that.  He would deduct the total amount at 7s in the £ and remit it to the Revenue Commissioners.  The people concerned would then apply to the Revenue Commissioners and under the section, as amended in the Dáil, they would get a rebate once a month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners would send them a cheque?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the old story. The cheque would come to the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; and then there would be the story of Fianna Fáil being the great people.  One of the things that struck me about this is that most of those &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; do not pay social welfare contributions because they are not employed in the ordinary way.  Perhaps they are on the &ldquo;lump&rdquo; because they think they will make more money in that way and avoid paying tax.  Now, they will no longer be able to avoid paying tax.  If the Minister is to take steps to bring these people within the income tax net&mdash;I am not objecting to that&mdash;he should also ensure that in so far as possible, steps are taken to ensure that these people will make social welfare contributions because when these people become ill they have no social welfare benefits whatever and would be relying on home assistance as administered by their local authority. These people are among a small group still in existence who, as it is said, are known neither to Church nor to State. If the State is to take 7s in the £ from these &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; they should see that <Col N="1292" /> they contribute to social welfare.  I do not know how this would be done because it would be difficult to assess income in the ordinary way and, also, they are not being paid in the ordinary way but I am sure the Minister will work out some way of dealing with this.</P>
      <P>There is a remarkable trend in taxation increases.  During the ten years to which I referred earlier in relation to Córas Tráchtála exports, the years 1958-59 to 1968-69, central government tax increased by 211 per cent.  In other words, the tax in 1969 was three times the level at which it was in 1959. During the same period rates increased by 105 per cent so that in 1969 they were twice what they were in 1959. Before any of the mathematical computers from the Fianna Fáil benches start accusing me of not being consistent, I must point out that the figures I have given are percentage increases and were given either by the Minister or by his predecessor in reply to a Dáil question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the increase in stamp duty, one of the intentions of this Bill is to take in the goodwill content of sale prices.  I appreciate that up to now certain attempts were made by some people so that they might pay less stamp duty.  While it is fair enough to endeavour to take steps to eliminate this, there is a case to be made for exercising such steps with a certain amount of clemency.  A public house standing in a busy area with all the appointments such as lounge, fittings, goodwill content and so on, can be assessed fairly readily and that assessment would not change very much because the public house would be in a large residential area and would continue to do business.  On the other hand, one might take the example of a small restaurant which was being run by a highly qualified chef.  The building might be worth about £3,000 but because of the atmosphere generated and because of the type of food that was being served a very large clientele might have been built up and people might be coming from near and far to the restaurant.  However, if the chef were to sell the restaurant to someone of the same rank as himself he would <Col N="1293" /> obviously get far more than £3,000 for it.  In fact, he might get as much as £20,000 or £25,000.  The goodwill in that case would have been brought about not because of the situation of the premises but by the activities of the proprietor.  I suggest to the Minister that the provision in relation to goodwill should be looked at in the light of the example I have cited and that it should not be dealt with in a rigid way.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is interesting to note that the Government published an explanatory memorandum with the Finance Bill but after the Bill had been passed by the Dáil they published a second explanatory memorandum. Anybody looking through both in a hurry might be forgiven for thinking they were virtually the same but there are some significant little changes in the second one.  For instance, in Part IV, which relates to stamp duties, the original memorandum read and I quote:</P>
    <P>Section 39 provides, with effect as from the 1st August, 1970, a new revised First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891, in substitution for the existing schedule.  Some headings are being abolished.  Under the headings which are retained the rates of duty now in force are...</P>
    <P>and so on.  In the explanatory memorandum which appeared later in relation to section 40 which, in fact, was section 39 previously, there is the following paragraph in relation to stamp duties:</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides, with effect as from 1st August, 1970, a new revised First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891, in substitution for the existing schedule.  The duty under many headings is being abolished.  Under other headings, it is being reduced and in a few cases it is being increased, in particular, in the case of conveyances or transfers of property other than land...</P>
    <P>Here we are told the duty under many headings is being abolished; that under other headings it is being reduced and that in a few cases it is being increased, in particular in the case of conveyances or transfers of property <Col N="1294" /> other than land.  This is the sort of thing that we get with Bills like this.  I am sure that the Minister and his advisers as well as many Members of this House will agree that such Bills are complicated and that it is difficult even for Members of this House who are acknowledged experts in the field, to read them.  There are so many complicated references to sections and parts of other Acts that it is very difficult to understand and even if one were doing a proper study of them, it would take a great length of time to read them.</P>
    <P>We are all eternally grateful for the explanatory memorandum which was published.  Some of the sentences in it are far less close to the truth than the first explanatory memorandum, which states that the duty under many headings is being abolished and under other headings is being reduced; in a few cases it is being increased.  This gives a far clearer picture and takes only a few seconds more to read.  It conveys to the House that under some headings duties are being increased.  The definition attached to the word &ldquo;few&rdquo; is different in the minds of the people from what it is in the minds of the Revenue Commissioners. To my mind, duty is being increased.  The point is simple.  When the Department of Finance are putting before the Oireachtas a complicated Bill of this nature there is a moral, and to my mind a legal obligation on them to publish an explanatory memorandum and explain adequately, properly and accurately what each section is about instead of repeating the better parts of the section presumably in the hope that it will pass through the Committee Stage without too much comment.  I leave that thought with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The economy is suffering from a serious case of galloping inflation.  One could be forgiven for thinking that this disease has been brought about by the action of the Government.

The Government have taken steps to pour money in, put prices up and turn the heat on as witnessed by the turnover tax.  The Government's cure for inflation is to inject large doses of that very disease into the bloodstream of the economy.  It has not proved effective. There is a simple and definite solution open to the Government and the Minister. I am prepared to offer it to him at any time.  It is obvious from the silence on the Fianna Fáil benches that Fianna Fáil Senators do know of a solution. Everyone smiles but not one of them has the courage to say what it is.</P>

      <P>A suggestion has been made that I should advocate that old age pensions be decreased in the present financial year.  I would certainly not advocate that old age pensions be decreased at the present time when old people, even with the present increase, will be living below subsistence level.  I would contemplate reducing social welfare benefits if members of the opposition were so irresponsible as to advocate to the people that they refuse to pay their taxes this year.  If that happened we might have to reduce some allowances.  Indeed, if there was a world recession as there was in 1929 and allowances all over the world were being reduced and old age pensions were reduced by 2s in the £ in Great Britain as they were in 1920 or 1930 then we might have to reduce old age pensions by 1s.</P>

      <P>I do not think this course of action would be acceptable to the vast majority of the people.  I do not believe anyone would like to see anything but substantial increases for old age pensioners and widows.  It is my firm belief that if the Minister were to concentrate on substantially increasing allowances to old age pensioners and widows, even at the expense of not increasing some of the allowances of other social welfare recipients, this would be welcomed by the people. If this alone necessitated extra taxes being levied most decent people would be prepared to pay those extra taxes where they believed that the extra taxes were going simply and solely to fund the increases in payments to old <Col N="1297" /> people and widows.  I advocate to the Minister that the next time a Finance Bill is necessary this is the line he should take.  The old person and the widow in this country are still living at subsistence level.  The increases they are being given this year will not materially improve their position because of the price increases caused by the turnover tax and the general inflationary trend in prices.  This will mean that in the course of the next 12 months these two classes of people will still be living at subsistence level.  They will be no better off than they were before the Budget was introduced.</P>

      <P>On the point made by the Leader of the House, I am asking did he not receive great co-operation from this side of the House in dealing with the business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was speaking about inflation and suggesting that if the only cure which can be thought of is to inject massive doses of the disease into the economy, a simple solution is open to the Minister if he cannot find a way to take Caitlin Ni hUallacháin off her sick bed and put her back on her feet in a position where she would be able to face up to any of her competitors from the Continent both pricewise and in volume of exports.  If the Minister cannot bring about a situation whereby that takes place&mdash;and this Minister was Minister for Industry and Commerce when he had this percentage rise more than three times that of other countries and twice that of Britain and he was Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1968-69 when we produced a mere 5 per cent increase in volume in our exports as compared with 14, 16 and 17 per cent in the EEC countries&mdash;and if our prices are to continue to spiral and if the consumer price index is to continue to show abnormal figures like 5 per cent for the first four-and-a-half months of this year, and if the Minister can do nothing about it the simple course open to the <Col N="1300" /> Minister and to the Government is the course which the people of the country are expecting.  The NIEC Report on Incomes and Prices says:</P>
    <P>Over the past year, prices and money incomes have risen faster in Ireland than in any other OECD country (except Iceland), and the external deficit on current account for 1969 was £60 million or more. The measures so far applied have not contained the inflationary pressures at work in the economy.  The indications are that, if present trends continue, serious economic difficulties will arise in 1970.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the gentlemen of the NIEC are not very proud of it but their report has been borne out and will continue to be borne out unless the Minister does something about it. I do not believe that the present Budget is doing anything about it.  It can have no more than an inflationary effect on the economy.  If that is all Fianna Fáil have to offer the best thing they can do is to go quietly into the Opposition benches and review their economic and monetary policies, because these policies are in urgent need of overhaul in the world of the 1970's.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be very brief in my contribution because obviously the agreement is that we finish at 5.15, but after listening to Senator Boland for the last hour and a quarter I am a little bit bothered on one topic.  I wonder if when he was in the boys' infant class he learned the rhyme in the boys' school &ldquo;Inky pinky parry winky&rdquo;, or if he went to the girls' school he learned &ldquo;Ring-aring-rosy&rdquo;, because he took 25 minutes here trying to work out how the Government collected 3¾ in every £25.</P>
      <P>I certainly hope to be very brief in this debate, which has strayed in many cases from the actual Finance Bill and has been a wake for the final analysis on the Budget.  There is one little point in the Budget that I would like to talk about.  The reference is at column 1743 of the Dáil Debates for 22nd April, 1970.  It concerns western development. There is first a phrase introduced there, and I quote: &ldquo;The development of our western counties occupies a central and fundamental position in all our economic planning.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> I certainly welcome this most important statement, and I say that after listening here for some time to the cry-baby attitude of the midlands&mdash; and when I say &ldquo;midlands&rdquo; I mean midlands including Leinster and the eastern area of our country&mdash;in which you have strife throughout industry where something in the region of 200 men can hold up an important industry for as long as they wish.  I do not deny the right of those people to do that, but sometimes I feel that I should deny their right to do it for a trivial matter.  In comparison to that, some time ago when the present Minister for Finance was Minister for Industry and Commerce he put into the city of Galway an industrial estate.  He showed trust in the people of Galway in doing this and they certainly have appreciated what has been done.  We have not yet in three and a half years of operation had one slight industrial disruption, and I say to the Minister for Finance now that our record is so good in this field that if there is to be continuous strife in other parts of the country he can always look to our area as one which will certainly appreciate all the efforts made.  At column 1744 of the Dáil Debates there is the following statement concerning industrial prefabricated buildings for small industries:</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that very often the success which has followed on the establishment of small local industries depends on the immediate availability of premises in which either staff training or the operation itself can commence immediately.</P>
    <P>This certainly shows an interest in western Ireland, because some reasonably large industries have left small villages and towns because up to date they did not have the prospect of having a site with buildings on it for training or going into operation.  I hope that this idea will be used to its utmost.  We lost some small industries which would have meant a great difference to some of the smaller towns in the west.  I hope that the Minister for Finance will use this idea to its utmost, because in my opinion it is very important.</P>
    <P>Arising from that, I myself come from Tuam where there is a major <Col N="1302" /> industry, the manufacture of sugar by the Sugar Company, which could be further utilised.  The Sugar Company in Tuam, which is a semi-State body, has since 1937 phased out investment of capital in its operational planning. Last year the Tuam factory was brought to court for a case of effluent going into the river, and this year the staff of the Sugar Company in Tuam made a budget for about £23,000 to try to stop this terrible thing.  I can assure the Minister for Finance that the company have now refused to invest that small amount of money to right this.  It shows the fear that is beginning to grip the people of Tuam and the west in general, that the Sugar Company are intentionally phasing themselves out of the west.  I do not know whether this is because the EEC is around the corner or not but this warning is being given that this would be a tremendous blow to the west of Ireland in general and will not be accepted.</P>
    <P>There is no point in criticising if I do not offer an alternative.  Last year agricultural imports into this country amounted to something in the region of £9½ million.  Here we have a sugar company with an agricultural staff in constant contact with farmers and an engineering staff spread through most of the country selling imported farm machinery, and this is shameful.  I could name some, the Varsta Silage Harvester, German disc harrows, and the likes.  It might sound rather trivial to mention this in the Seanad, but the company have the finest personnel and staff in the country.  They have engineers of all degrees, they have the sales ability through their agricultural department to move into this business of manufacturing farm machinery. They are in actual fact at the grassroots of this industry in every aspect. If pressure were brought to bear on them now to move into this type of industry it would be a very good thing for the workers and all others interested in Tuam.  Sometimes there is a sharing of blame for many things but it may be inevitable to have a phasing out of the Sugar Company when we enter the EEC.  That may be through the economics of the EEC or the hard fact that perhaps the plant in Tuam may <Col N="1303" /> not be able to operate under those circumstances.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity for them to move into this line of production of farm machinery, and at the same time maintain their manufacture of sugar.  I ask the Minister to view this suggestion of mine with the intention of pressurising the company and returning confidence in them by the general public in this factory area.  Now is the time to move in this industry.</P>
    <P>At the end of the Financial Statement there is reference to further incentives to industrial development in the west and it is stated that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is relaxing the conditions under which the small industries programme operates in that area; that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would shortly announce details.  This we await.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that he is giving £96 million to farmers in subsidies.  All these subsidies are welcome.  Some people think they are not sufficient and here there is a difference of opinion.  Be that as it may, we can do with them.  A problem is, however, that some of these subsidies are misdirected.  A large proportion goes to dairy farmers for the production of milk, butter and cheese, but there is over-production of butter and cheese in all European countries where they are now stockpiling them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries initiated a scheme called the beef incentive scheme, giving a £16 grant for the rearing of calves to anybody who was solely in the business of rearing calves but who was not sending milk to the creamery.  The scheme is a very good one.  The reason for it was to help farmers to diversify from milk to beef.  However, people in the milk business who should benefit from it cannot do so because of the way the scheme is operated at the moment.  In order to benefit they would have to stop sending milk to the creamery, thereby losing their monthly cheques.  If they rear calves and send milk to the creamery they will not qualify.</P>
    <P>It is only the very wealthy farmers who can buy heifers, get calves from them and wait for 18 months for the subsidy.  When the calf is 12 months they would get £85 for it including the subsidy.  They are people who do not need the subsidy.  The person in the greatest need of it is the dairy farmer who cannot afford to give up milk production in order to avail of this scheme.  I suggest that some way could be found to enable farmers who send milk to the creamery to avail of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Increased production of beef is very welcome because if and when we go into the EEC, beef is one product we will have no trouble in selling, unlike butter and the other products of milk. I am sure the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are aware of the shortcomings of this scheme.  I suggest that they re-examine it in order to allow farmers producing milk for sale to the creameries to benefit and to go into beef.  Even if the Agricultural Credit Corporation could give such farmers loans to tie them over until the calves were ready for sale, it would benefit many farmers.</P>
    <P>My point is that this scheme is not doing what it should be doing&mdash;helping the farmers who most need help and helping out in this process of diversifying from milk to beef.  Subsidisation of milk and butter is costing the Exchequer a lot of money but the rewards are not anything like they would be if such producers were helped properly to diversify to beef.  That is <Col N="1305" /> one subsidy which I think is misdirected. It is not getting to the source which needs it most.</P>
    <P>There is the subsidy to meat factories for the export of beef cattle.  It cost about £2 million last year.  It is meant to go directly to the farmers but that is not happening.  It is going to the proprietors of meat factories and this year one firm alone showed a profit of nearly £750,000 of which at least £100,000 was subsidy.  The farmers, for whom the subsidy was meant, did not get one penny.  That is another subsidy which is misdirected.</P>
    <P>Another matter which concerns me and many others is our constant imbalance of trade with other countries. One begins to wonder when the bubble will burst.  We cannot continue to buy more than we sell.  We have been doing it for some time.  I will quote some figures to show how this imbalance operates.  Our trade figures with West Germany last year showed that they exported to us £42,889,986 and they took from us £10,553,887.  That is an imbalance of more than £30 million with one country alone.  We took from the Netherlands goods valued at £14 million and we sold to them only £7 million worth.  The imbalance with Italy was £10 million as against £4.6 million; with Sweden it was £10.4 million against £2.4 million.  We took £5,559,291 from Denmark as against less than £500,000.  What can Denmark sell to us that we have not got ourselves? Denmark is the same type of agricultural country as ours.  Do they buy cheese or butter from us?  They do not, but they sell us cheese.  I was in a supermarket the other day and I noted tins of Plumrose sausages on a shelf.  I discovered that they had been imported from Denmark.  Imagine importing pork sausages from Denmark. I understood in fact that it was illegal to import meat produce into this country because of foot-and-mouth precautions.</P>
    <P>We imported goods from Poland to the extent of £5,453,298 as against our exports to that country of £1,131,039. What can we buy from Poland except, perhaps, coal?  The other day my wife had put a jar of pickled onions on the table and to my great surprise I noticed that they had been imported from <Col N="1306" /> Poland.  Can we not grow and pickle all the onions we need here?  The figure for Canada was £9 million as against £4 million; for Japan it was £7 million as against £5 million; for Russia it was £1¾ million as against £¼ million.  I suppose it is timber we import from them but we could do without trading with them.  These are but some of the figures.  I only have the trade figures for January and February of this year but from these I see that for the months of January and February, we imported £7,220,000 worth of goods from Germany while they took only £1,330,000 worth from us.  This upward trend is alarming even on last year's figures when the ratio was about four to one whereas for the first two months of this year it is seven to one.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to read in today's papers, however, that there are some German people here to buy meat from us but they will have to buy a lot of meat to make up the deficit in our balance of payments with them.  From Sweden we imported £2 million worth of goods while they took goods from us to the extent only of £394,000.  We have an imbalance with every country except Britain.  What worries me is how long the Government will allow this position to continue.  Have they any intention of doing anything about it? Our trading imbalance with West Germany is frightening.  This country's economy is bad enough but this trend must not be allowed to continue.  I have no wish to create alarm but I am frightened for the future and there are whispers of a devaluation of our £. I do not know if there is any basis for this but I am sure the Minister himself has heard it.</P>

      <P>People can hardly be blamed for holding this fear when they study these trade figures.  Perhaps if the Minister took the problem up with our ambassadors who are accredited to those countries it might help.  Surely these people are aware of the situation?  It is their function to promote and to negotiate equitable <Col N="1307" /> trade agreements between the Irish Republic and the countries to which they are accredited.  As far as I can see, most of these are sitting on their fat backsides in these countries and they do not give a damn about what is happening so long as they are left there with the title of ambassador.</P>

Why have a Mercedes when we can buy British cars since, in any case, Britain is buying more from us than we are buying from them?  Neither do they put tariffs on our cattle.  Our balance of payments with them is favourable.  I do not see why we must use Mercedes, Volkswagens, Opels, Fiats or Volvos when we can buy British cars.  I would not wish the House to think that I had anything against the assembler of Mercedes or Volkswagen cars; in fact, the man is or, at least, was a personal friend of mine.  However, I shall leave it at that having pointed out the grave situation in relation to our balance of payments.  I can only hope that the Government will do something to right that situation.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to delay the House or the Minister but there are a few remarks I should like to make at this stage.  The Minister's speech can be divided roughly into three parts&mdash;one deals with inflationary trends, another deals with concessions given in the Budget which, I take it, were given in order to help counteract the increases in the cost of living; and the third is a justification of turnover <Col N="1308" /> tax as a system of collecting revenue.  I have not the time now to develop any of these as I would have liked to have done.  I do not gloat over any of the sentences in the Central Bank Report. Neither do I gloat over the report of Córas Tráchtála or, for that matter, over the Minister's speech where he said and I quote:</P>
      <P>The background of this year's Budget was dominated by inflation. While inflation is not of course a phenomenon confined to Ireland its pace in this country is nevertheless becoming a cause for serious concern. The main reason for the recent acceleration of inflationary pressures in our economy has been the excessive income increase which have been spreading throughout the community since 1969.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be disrespectful to the Minister but I would ask him what measures were taken in the Budget to curb any of these trends?  What measures have been taken to promote better relations between employer and employee?  The Minister gives one of the reasons for income increases as being strikes and threats of strikes.  It is true that we have had too many strikes and there are threats of further strikes but it is also true that one of the strikes might have been avoided if the employers had made an offer to employees without waiting for 11 or 13 weeks to go by.  Some of these bodies are State bodies and semi-State bodies but they do not make a reasonable offer to the workers in an effort to avert a strike.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to ask the Minister what steps have been taken in the Budget&mdash;I realise that he neither prepared it nor introduced it to the Dáil&mdash;to curb inflation and what steps are being taken to see that we increase productivity, get rid of inflation and put ourselves in a position to compete with the other members of the Community we hope to join.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to thank Senators who welcomed me here in my capacity as Minister for Finance.  Secondly, I should like to say, without appearing in any way to be condescending, that the debate on this Bill <Col N="1309" /> was impressive from all sides of the House.  Perhaps, I may be forgiven for mentioning the thoughtful and able speech made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  I was particularly impressed by it and by many of the other speeches.  There were, of course, one or two exceptions, as there always are, notably Senator O'Higgins who in some kind of Rip Van Winkle style seemed to be trying to fight the last election here again on this Bill.</P>
      <P>The main theme of the contributions, indeed the main theme of my own introductory speech, related to inflation and a prices and incomes policy.  I propose to deal with that in some detail and in the course of doing so I hope to be able to answer the question I was asked at the close of the debate about what action has been taken to deal with it.  There were some other points raised which I shall try to dispose of first.</P>
      <P>Senator Owens asked if the arrangement proposed for farmers under a value added tax would mean they were excluded from sales tax.  The arrangement envisaged for farmers under the added value system is designed to exclude them from the requirement of keeping accounts for the purpose of that tax.  They will pay tax on what they put into production such as seeds, fertilisers and so on.  But as with existing taxes, wholesale and turnover tax, the added value tax will be borne ultimately by the consumer.  This is so in respect of any sales tax and it will also be the case in relation to the added value tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators referred to excessive price increases because of the addition to the turnover tax in the Budget. It was said that the line taken by some shopkeepers who had previously been carrying the 2½ per cent was that they were unable to carry the additional 2½ per cent and were now adding on 5 per cent.  Senator Boland dealt with this very adequately.  In fact, it was one of the few things he said which I agreed with.  He pointed out that there is no such thing as carrying turnover tax.  The shopkeeper has to pay the tax.  He has to build it into the price he charges but if any shopkeeper has added 5 per cent to his prices consequent on the Budget increase, he is <Col N="1310" /> not entitled to do so.  Any cases of that kind if reported to the Department of Industry and Commerce are dealt with quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch asked if an income tax allowance can be given where a son or daughter is attending an institute of higher education and the parents' income is just over the limit qualifying for a university grant at the moment.  I do not know if what I am about to say answers his question but I presume the Senator is aware that income tax allowances are given in respect of all students attending a full time course in an institute of education.</P>
    <P>Senator Prendergast talked about trade imbalance.  He mentioned a number of countries and quoted figures, to show the lack of balance in our trade with them.  The majority of countries with which we trade have a favourable trade balance with us.  We would like to remedy this but the really important thing from our point of view is the overall balance of trade which gives a different picture.  I do not want to go into details of that at present. Suffice it to say that while there are no grounds for complacency, there has been an improvement this year as against last year.</P>
    <P>If the improvement continues, barring a prolonged British dock strike and allowing for the bank strike and the cement strike, the trend seems to indicate that there is a good chance we might reduce our balance of payments deficit to £50 million.  I mentioned this when replying to the Budget debate in the Dáil as being the target we had set.  If we reach that target this year, while there will not be any grounds for complacency there will be no grounds for alarm.</P>
    <P>When the British import levy was imposed we made a special effort to get our exporters to diversity their exports away from the British market. We introduced various special measures and assistance to help to bring this about.  It is paying off to some extent.  Speaking from memory&mdash; I think the figures are right but I do not want anyone to take them as having full official authority behind them&mdash;since the British import deposit <Col N="1311" /> scheme was introduced our exports to non-British markets have been increased by 20 per cent.  There is plenty of room for them to go further but this is a fairly substantial increase in a relatively short time.  When we purchase from a country with which we have a poor balance of trade it is usually because that country has things we need which we cannot get cheaper anywhere else.  It is not always so but it is generally the case.  We have statutory authority in relation to certain eastern European countries to impose an embargo on trade in the absence of a proper balance.  Even where we have this power when we go to exercise it we find the effect of it is that we are going to damage people here who are importing raw materials or consumer goods not available in this country and not available as cheaply anywhere else.  Unless we can force that country to step up its purchases from us we are not gaining very much.  In many cases our purchases are so small compared with the size of their markets that the leverage we have is not very great.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment Senator Horgan who, having criticised the imposition of the additional turnover tax in the Budget, made an effort to suggest alternatives as to how this may have been done.  I compliment him for attempting to do that but I cannot compliment the Senator on the suggestions he made because they are just not workable.  The Senator referred to the fact that I, in speaking on Second Stage, said that nobody had produced acceptable alternatives and he questioned the word &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; and asked, &ldquo;acceptable to whom?&rdquo; Obviously, they must be acceptable to the public in general and this is one test.  Another test is that they must be acceptable in the sense of producing the revenue needed, which was £20 million in this case.</P>
    <P>The Senator suggested certain alternatives which are not acceptable, first, because they would not yield anything like the money required and, secondly, because some of them are not practicable.  One of the other Senators seemed to dispute the statement I made that to achieve the same amount of <Col N="1312" /> revenue one would have to increase income tax by 1s 9d in the £.  In this connection I should like to quote from page 17 of the printed edition of the Budget Statement which explains some of the reasons for a reduction rather than an increase in income tax which was, in fact, effected by this Budget. I quote:</P>
    <P>Income tax is paid by a comparatively small section of the community. Furthermore, it has changed significantly in character in recent years and can now represent a considerable burden on a wide variety of small incomes.  Its weight falls on many individuals with incomes which are below the level in real purchasing power at which an income tax should normally apply.  Nor does the argument which has been advanced for an increase in direct taxation on this occasion for its disinflationary effects really stand up to close examination.</P>
    <P>Because of our system of PAYE, for most taxpayers the impact of an increase in income tax is immediately felt in the pay packet and consequently is little different in its effect on pay claims from a corresponding amount of indirect taxation. In the Budget speech last year I pointed out that direct taxes tend to discourage effort and to have widespread disincentive effect but that significant changes in our direct taxation structure could only be undertaken in the context of a comprehensive recasting of the general pattern of taxation.  I am taking a considerable step in this direction this year.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied, that, whatever our difficulties, some relief must be given this year to income tax payers and especially to those with small incomes upon whom it bears very heavily.  The reliefs which I shall now mention have been framed as carefully as possible towards this end.</P>
    <P>Some of the basic assumptions in Senator Horgan's alternative proposals did not take account of the facts mentioned there.  The Senator referred to a capital gains tax, as did other Senators, as one line of approach. Many people do not realise that, in effect, we operate a capital gains tax in certain areas.  Any dealings in <Col N="1313" /> development of land which is done as a business&mdash;and I understand what this could mean if one did it even once&mdash;become liable to taxation. Secondly, dealings in stocks, shares and securities in the hands of persons whose business is dealing in such property are also taxable.  I think the interpretation in that case is a little less stringent than in the case of land but it is still fairly stringent.  The Commission on Income Taxation examined this question of a capital gains tax very carefully and came to the conclusion that they had no option but to recommend against its introduction in this country in view of the grave disadvantages associated with it, in particular because of the disincentive effect it could have on savings, investment and economic growth.  In my view the primary aim of economic policy must be growth.  This must be consonant with the economy being kept on an even keel.  Subject to that, the primary end in our circumstances must be growth.  We must have as our primary aim the achievement of growth&mdash;in our circumstances where we have not got full employment and still have emigration.  It might be a different situation if we had achieved that, but in our present circumstances a general capital gains tax would not be conducive to growth.</P>
    <P>There is another and compelling reason why there is not much point in introducing it and why it would not help to provide £20 million.  The capital gains tax in Britain yields less than 1 per cent of the total taxation.  In this country it would yield relatively much less because we have far fewer people relatively who are well off and make capital gains than they have in Britain.  The yield here would be relatively much smaller than that.  In addition to the capital gains tax which I have mentioned, Senators will recall that there is also a duty of 10 per cent on the building of speculative office blocks and, indeed, the incidence of death duties to some extent is a capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to two points made by Senator Killilea with regard to the Sugar Company and to the suggestion that they should engage in the manufacture of farm machinery.  The Senator knows that they engage in that <Col N="1314" /> operation to some extent.  I agree entirely with him that our imports of farm machinery are very disappointing in a country which is so strongly agricultural.</P>
    <P>For that reason some time ago, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I called a number of the main people concerned together and told them of my concern in this regard and that I wanted to see, as fast as possible, getting together the establishment of a worthwhile farm machinery industry in this country which I thought would serve not only our home market but could develop substantial markets abroad.  Progress is being made.  The Sugar Company took charge and their representative is chairman of a group. They are in contact with the Minister for Industry and Commerce at present and efforts are being made to get such an industry going on a proper basis as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reference made to the small industries scheme for western areas, I am sorry that it seems to have escaped the notice of most Senators that an announcement was made.  Very briefly, the position was that heretofore, and as yet for location outside the undeveloped areas, the maximum figure for an industry to qualify by way of capital for a small industries grant was £60,000.  For the western region this has now been extended to £100,000.  Another test was that they did not employ more than 30 people.  For the western region that has been increased to 50 people.  This is basically what the announcement was.</P>
    <P>Senator Bourke expressed the opinion, which I think some other Senators subscribed to, that the increase in social welfare benefits in the Budget did no more than offset the increase in prices of essentials arising from the turnover tax increase.  The current year's increase in the non-contributory old age pension, for example, was about 13? per cent.  This is more than enough to outweigh the price rise for the current year.  When we go further back, between August, 1961, and August, 1970, the increase in the non-contributory old age pension will be 180 per cent while the price rise over this period will have been about <Col N="1315" /> 60 per cent.  Or, if you take August, 1965, to August, 1970, the rise in the old age pension will be about 80 per cent over the same period while prices will have risen about 33 per cent.  So while it is true, of course, that increases in prices, particularly the prices of food and essential commodities, do affect social welfare recipients and do erode increases given to them, nevertheless, it is not true to suggest that the increases given have only kept pace with the increased cost of living or, as some people have suggested, have not kept pace.  Those people are affected, and God knows we would all like to see them paid more, but at least we ought to see that their real position, their position in real money terms, has improved.</P>
    <P>One Senator asked for details of the savings scheme which is referred to in the Bill.  I would suggest that that might, perhaps, be better dealt with in detail on Committee Stage, and I will do so when we come to it.</P>
    <P>If I might turn to what I think is the main theme of this debate, the question of inflation and an incomes and prices policy and, indeed, the general policy to deal with inflation, there are some figures which I think have been quoted in this debate and are being quoted generally recently but they bear repetition because they mark out in the clearest possible way, with what are almost neon lights, what is happening to our economy.  These statistics relate to productivity, to the unit costs of what we produce.  In 1969, last year, our productivity in manufacturing industry rose by about 1 per cent.  At the same time, weekly earnings increased by 11½ per cent, with the result that unit wage costs rose by about 10½ per cent.  That is a rate that was more than double what happened in British industry in 1969, and, indeed, in a number of other countries with which we are competing, the increase in unit wage costs was very much less than in Britain.  If we can realise the significance of that, of what happened in 1969, this is the root of all we have heard in this debate and elsewhere of what has been happening to our exports, about the dangers of what may <Col N="1316" /> happen in the future, about the threat to the employment of our workers, and it illustrates very clearly one of the enormous economic disadvantages of inflation.  There is no estimate available at the moment of the trend of productivity and earnings in the first quarter of 1970 but the indications are that the deterioration in competitiveness which set in in 1969 continued in the first quarter of 1970.</P>
    <P>Let me say, with regard to inflation generally and in particular to the references made by Senator Dunne quoting from something said by the Taoiseach yesterday about inflation having gone on for the past 30 years, that this is true, of course.  It is my own belief that a certain amount of inflation is inevitable and is very possibly desirable, particularly in an economy where one is trying to achieve growth. I think it is desirable but, whether it is or not, it is inevitable.  I should like Senators to understand that what we have been faced with in the past couple of years is not merely a small creeping inflation.</P>
    <P>It is inflation at such an accelerating rate that it poses for us one of the most serious problems we could face.  If it were allowed to go unchecked the rate of inflation would increase year by year and, ultimately, month by month; it could even come down to day by day, and of course, all that we have achieved in the past would simply disappear and the most widespread hardship and misery would spread throughout the community.  But those who would suffer most, those who have suffered most already from what has happened, are the poor and the old and the ill and the weak sections of the community. The Budget endeavoured to try to do something to redress the balance in favour of those people, but we cannot contemplate&mdash;none of us can contemplate&mdash;with equanimity a situation in which this is going to continue, and continue at an increasing rate.</P>
    <P>Exception was taken by Senator Owens and Senator Dunne to a statement which I made when speaking at the beginning of this debate on the grounds that it appeared to single out wage and salary increases as being the cause of inflation.  I think these Senators <Col N="1317" /> will agree&mdash;and, indeed, I think Senator Dunne said as much&mdash;that that was not precisely what I said but that it was the implication of what I said.  I want to establish, first of all, that when I referred to income increases those included income increases of all kinds. Senator Dunne is right in saying that I laid more emphasis on wage and salary increases.  I did so for good reason. As he rightly pointed out, there are a number of factors involved in inflation, and certainly wage and salary increases are not the only ones, but I do not think that we ought to fool ourselves as we have fooled ourselves in the past.</P>
    <P>I think that the time has come when we have to be realistic and honest about this.  Let us say what the trouble appears to be, and that is that they are a major factor in it.  While this may not be as obvious as it should be, there are certain aspects of that which I hope will demonstrate the truth of what I am saying.  If we take what has been happening, all this is tied in with the fact that if you have increases in costs of any kind, whether wages, salaries, profits or anything else in Ireland, there are increases in prices.  Let us take first the situation about prices.  Consumer prices rose by 4.7 per cent in 1968 and by 7½ per cent in 1969.  The increase in the first two quarters of 1970 was 7 per cent over the corresponding period of 1969.  For 1970 as a whole it is expected that the increase will not be less than in 1969.</P>
    <P>Now it is true that taxation contributed to some extent to these price increases, but what I want to put to the House is this, that increased taxation, in large part, has been made necessary to cover the costs of pay increases in the public sector.  In line with this burden on the economy at large it has also been made necessary to provide additional State support for agriculture according as non-agricultural income rose.  The Government have accepted the obligation&mdash;this cannot be disputed by anybody&mdash;to try to ensure as far as they can that the gap between agricultural and non-agricultural incomes should not be widened, and, indeed, to go further and try to achieve some kind of equilibrium.</P>
    <P>Directly arising out of price increases comes the question of increased pay for <Col N="1318" /> the public service, and this covers an awful lot of people&mdash;and increased contributions to agriculture to try, as I have said, to redress the imbalance between agricultural and non-agricultural incomes to some extent.  This is a direct link between price increases and taxation which may not be very clear.</P>
    <P>This gets us back to what is causing price increases.  Some may say that it is a chicken and egg situation, that it is price increases that cause increased wage and salary demands, or that it is wage and salary demands that cause increased prices.  I think that is to say, as some Senators have said, that the Government have failed to control prices and that this has led to demands for increased salaries and wages, is really to fool oneself.  It is ignoring the basic causes of price increases.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that price controls exercised by the Government operate in relation to manufacturing industry very stringently.  I know from personal experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce that in quite a number of cases the margin of profit of some Irish manufacturers is dangerously low.  When I say &ldquo;dangerously low&rdquo; I mean those industries are in danger, because of inroads on their markets or for other reasons, of having to close down and of putting their workers out of employment.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I was frequently faced with the dilemma of either allowing a price increase or of refusing it altogether or of reducing it, at the risk of causing that firm to close down and put its employees out of work.</P>
    <P>I am making this point because it is frequently thought, or appears to be thought, that most industrialists are making enormous profits.  I can say that none of the Irish industrialists serving the home market&mdash;they were the things with which I was concerned&mdash;is making enormous profits.  Some of them are making satisfactory or even handsome profits but many are making dangerously low profits.</P>
    <P>We can only exercise control in relation to unjustified price increases. If we try to control price increases which are justified, we can do it for <Col N="1319" /> a short time, but, ultimately, if we persist, we will close down the firm concerned.  We, therefore, have to get back to the basic cause.  This, as far as the vast majority are concerned, is increasing costs to industrialists, and the bulk of those increased costs arise out of wage and salary claims.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this that is mathematically certain and obvious and yet seems to be forgotten.  It is that if you increase your production by 6 per cent and if you increase your wages by 10 per cent, the value of that increase to the recipient is not 10 per cent but 6 per cent; and to the extent that you go over your increase in productivity, automatically the adjustment is made and you will find it works out every time, that the margin which is above productivity disappears, usually by way of price increases.</P>
    <P>I must say I welcomed Senator Dunne's contribution, particularly in regard to incomes and prices, which I will come to in a moment.  I realise that he and the vast majority of his colleagues in the trade union movement are reasonable, rational men who know what is happening.  Indeed, this was underlined recently by the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions when he said:</P>
    <P>I am perfectly willing to accept reduced increases in basic wages provided, but only provided, I can be assured of an increase in real wages.</P>
    <P>Therein lies the truth of where we should be going.  We know from our experience some years ago that some years when there were modest increases in wages and salaries they were real increases and there was no cost inflation. We increased our productivity, we became more competitive, we sold more abroad, we created more jobs and those who were working were better off.  But because somewhere along the line we lost out on this and tried to go too far ahead, we got into a spiral at such an accelerating rate that it is leading us to perdition unless we do something about it.</P>
    <P>This leads to another point made by Senator Dunne, whose contribution, as I have said, I welcome.  I was aware of the position arising out of the annual <Col N="1320" /> conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but I think the clarification of the position by a man in Senator Dunne's job was very welcome. He made it clear that as far as the trade union movement is concerned nothing could be further from the truth than to say they have rejected an incomes and prices policy.  On the contrary, they have made it clear that they are anxious to have such a policy and have supported the idea, having expressed reservations about the proposals put forward.</P>
    <P>Senator Dunne also made a very important point which I wish to underline. It is that the employer-labour conference exists, that it is working and that it can do a great deal of the job that must be done to get an incomes-prices policy off the ground.  There are aspects of the NIEC proposals which are important, particularly in view of the fact that they envisage an examination of wages and salaries in the same context as an examination of prices and profits.  This is an aspect of an incomes policy which is essential.  It may be that the employer-labour conference operating on its own would not be able to do that, but I wish to make it quite clear that, as far as the Government and I are concerned, while we realise the value of the NIEC, and moved immediately to try to implement the recommendations, we realise that the machinery is not the important thing.  The important thing is the achievement of a workable incomes and prices policy.</P>
    <P>If the machinery proposed is found not to be acceptable, other machinery can be devised but the important thing is that we get such an incomes and prices policy in operation.  It is very important&mdash;in fact, it is crucial&mdash;that it should happen quickly because the next few months are vital in this area. There are substantial wage agreements coming to hand and unless it can be ensured that the approach to the agreements to be concluded is in line with what is required by everybody in the country and particularly by the workers concerned, that is, an attack on inflation, we are going to be in the most serious trouble in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> Senator Dunne and, as I say, the vast majority of his colleagues in the trade union movement are very conscious of the fact that the interests of their members are threatened.  I want to suggest that the time has come when an approach on the basis of &ldquo;It may be right on one side but all I know is that prices are going up and I must be compensated for this&rdquo; will not do any more because each one of us has seen for himself or herself what the consequences are.  The value of money is decreasing.  Workers think they are getting an increase but they find they are not.  People on fixed incomes and, in some cases, social welfare recipients are suffering considerable hardship as a result of what is happening.  This brings me to the question of what can be done about the situation.  I must say that I agree fully with almost every word that was said by Senator Dunne in his contribution on this and I should like to say also that this whole question of the problem of housing and the problem of the cost of land for housing to which he referred is one that is receiving urgent consideration by the Government at the present time.</P>
    <P>I want to put a proposition to Senator Dunne although I agree with virtually everything he said.  He said that he would advise with all the forces at his command that the Government should not embark on or contemplate an enforced or an attempted enforced control of wages and incomes by way of legislation.  I want to make it clear that the Government certainly do not contemplate lightly any such action. No government would.  Senator Dunne said this operates only in countries which have ideologies that are an anathema to us.  He is right in that but it operates in another situation also.  It operates in free and democratic societies where a country is at war or in grave emergency.  I want to suggest that the inflationary situation in this country is now such that we can regard ourselves as being in a battle for survival which all must wage.  We might almost regard ourselves as being at war because the consequences for this country are as bad as if we were fighting a war that we were going to lose.  It affects every man, woman and child in the country.  I suggest that in this battle <Col N="1322" /> those who are working against the national interests&mdash;and there are such people although there are not very many&mdash;should be identified and exposed. This can be done only if the rest of the community, that is the vast majority of the community, will indicate clearly that they have had enough of inflation and that they have had enough of people using brute force to jack up their position to the detriment of everybody else.</P>

      <P>I believe that Senator Dunne and his colleagues&mdash;the vast majority of them&mdash;think on these lines but the time has come when the vast majority of trade unionists, the rational men who can see what is happening and who can recognise the dangers for themselves and their members should stand up and be counted and not allow any small group to force not only the trade union movement but the whole community into chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am dealing with this particularly for two reasons.  One, as I said, is because of the vital influence of wage and salary increases and the other is because of the references made by Senator Dunne during his contribution.  I shall go on to say and I do not wish that anybody would misunderstand and think that the solution to this problem of inflation lies in controlling wages and salaries themselves.  That is not the case.  I agree with Senator Dunne that there is no prospect of a workable incomes and prices policy whether it be voluntary or compulsory unless, at the same time, action is taken to deal with unwarranted increases in other forms of income. Anything I have said is based on the premise that I believe it is possible to work out quickly a voluntary incomes and prices policy which would be acceptable to the vast majority of our people and our trade unionists.  It is possible to do it but we cannot waste any time because time is vital in this and it is also vital to ensure that when that is reached no small group of people&mdash;there are such people who would do their best to upset any such agreement&mdash;will undo <Col N="1323" /> this because the whole future of our country is at stake.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a minute the possibility that all efforts to reach such a voluntary policy might fail.  Senator Dunne has warned us not to contemplate enforcing this by legislation.  As I said, we do not want to do it in this way but supposing every effort fails, what else can be done?  The Government cannot abdicate.  They cannot stand by and see the whole economy of the country and everybody's money disappear in smoke.  The people cannot allow us to do it and we do not want to do it.  We do not want anything other than a voluntary approach but the time has come, as the Taoiseach indicated yesterday, when we must say that we have been looking for a voluntary approach for quite some time but there is a limit to how long the country can afford to go on without reaching an agreement on this.  I believe as I believe from what Senator Dunne has said, he believes also, that it is possible to have such agreement and that it could be a workable agreement and I want to ensure that we have it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We must not run away from the issue which is: if we do not have it, what will we do?  In my view, if that happens we have no choice.  I know the terrible consequences which Senator Dunne had in mind but I do not want to contemplate them.  In all honesty I have to say if we cannot get a voluntary policy agreed on this, then the Government have no option but to do what they can to enforce in any way they can measures that will ensure we are not going to go down to galloping inflation.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other items in regard to inflation and so on and some details which I had contemplated giving the House, but I have already detained the House beyond its usual time.  I hope I have conveyed to Senators the position which obtains.  This is not a situation for panic but it is an extremely grave situation for the economy of this country.  We are not talking about our balance of payments.  We are not talking about abroad.  We are talking about what is happening here in this country and what is being done <Col N="1324" /> by our own people and our Government. I believe the importance of this is such that it merits the approach I have tried to take to it and the approach which the Taoiseach took to it yesterday.  I want to assure everybody, and in particular I want to assure the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, that in arriving at a workable policy on incomes and prices the Government recognises clearly that it has a part to play.  It has a duty to try and create circumstances in which such a policy can work.  I want to promise Congress the fullest co-operation of the Government in that and in discussing with Congress and the other parties concerned the details of such a policy and the details of how the Government can act to enforce the circumstances which will make it workable.  There is no magic wand as we all know for curing this.  But there is a possibility of getting a policy working which will save this country from disaster.  In getting that policy on a voluntary basis, I want to assure congress of the maximum support and co-operation of the Government in doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I have paced myself wrongly but there were certain matters which I should have mentioned.  Again, in dealing with inflation, there are certain actions, apart from the question of a voluntary policy on incomes and prices, which the Government can take to deal with inflation. I want to talk about these and the steps which have been taken.  It can be tackled on three fronts: credit policy, fiscal policy and incomes policy, with which I have dealt.  With regard to credit policy the developments which have occurred in the present year and the action which has been taken by the Government in the present year include the tightening up of hire purchase restrictions very considerably and the placing of a ceiling of £75 million on lending by the associated banks.  It is unfortunate, to say the least, that due to the bank closure we do not know for certain whether the guidelines which have been issued are being adhered to.  We shall not know this until some time after the reopening <Col N="1325" /> of the banks.  There are indications that the guidelines are being adhered to &mdash;strangely enough.  The situation is quite different from what it was on the occasion of the last bank closure.  As I have said, there are indications that these guidelines are being adhered to but we cannot be sure.  In fact, we may be wrong in our reading of these indications. It is clear that when the banks reopen particular attention will have to be paid to a reassessment of credit policy in the light of developments since the closure and the prospects for the rest of the year.</P>
      <P>With regard to fiscal policy in this year's Budget, the Government contributed to an easement of inflationary pressures by moderating the rate of expansion of public expenditure both current and capital.  This approach was more successful in the case of capital expenditure than it was in the case of current expenditure.  The increase provided in 1970-71 in the public capital programme as compared with the 1969-70 out-turn is 12 per cent as compared with 15 per cent as between 1969-70 and 1968-69.  In the case of current expenditure the increase is 15 per cent as compared with 16 per cent. We were not so successful on the current side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a matter in this connection which I should like to mention in regard to action being taken by the Government.  Decisions regarding public expenditure are normally made very close in time to the year to which they relate.  This has a number of advantages not least of which is that at that stage commitments tend to become rigid and limit the scope for reduction.  With a view to ensuring that fiscal policy makes the maximum possible contribution to easing inflationary pressures, the Government have recently made certain decisions with regard to the method of dealing with Estimates both for current and capital expenditure.  One effect of this will be to advance by more than six months the time for determining next year's Estimates. On this basis provisional allocations will shortly be considered by the Government on a basis which relates much more closely to the resources available on existing rates of taxation rather than on the basis of what are the <Col N="1326" /> demands.  It may appear to some people that this is simply a change in procedure but it could have, and in my belief it probably will have, quite farreaching effects on the control of Government expenditure in the future. This, of course, is a vital matter in dealing with inflation.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, one of the methods of dealing with inflation is Government expenditure both current and capital.  It is all very well to say that we must cut back.  This can be done but in so doing enormous depression and deflation in the economy can result.  This means that not alone do the Government cause enormous misery to thousands of people but economically we do not gain.  I am not one who believes that in order to see a correct balance either on our external payments or in the Budget, one ought to ignore the longer term economic consequences or the shorter term human consequences for the people.  I think and believe that it is the primary duty of any Government to ensure that the economy is on an even keel because without that no amount of progress already achieved or planned for the future&mdash;whether in social welfare, education or industrial development or in any field one can think of&mdash;will get anywhere unless the economy is kept on an even keel.  Not alone do I believe that but the Government share my conviction and intend to ensure that the economy of this country is righted because it is going a bit out of kilter. The Government intend to right that and thereby to carry on faster, we hope, with expansion in the very desirable fields which are open in which all of us wish to see expansion taking place.</P>
    <P>I repeat that without a basically sound economy being not cautiously, not conservatively, but prudently managed&mdash;without that kind of management being provided by the Government, we are only fooling ourselves in thinking that we will achieve any progress. For this reason we are determined to provide for the country that kind of prudent management which I have described and which we believe is the primary duty of any Government. I am confident it can be done. There are many difficulties and I do not underestimate them.  One of the <Col N="1327" /> major difficulties lies in the fields, to which I was referring earlier, of incomes and prices but, as I have indicated, I believe this can be handled and I also believe that it has got to be handled.  We have no choice.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying something that may sound a bite trite.  Maybe it is something that many of us have said at election meetings on occasion but I believe it and I think most of us believe it when we think about it.  Many of our people can be foolish.  They can be, perhaps, rapacious on occasion but taking them in general, as a people and as a group, if this country and its economy is in danger and if the danger is explained to them and if it is explained to them that action by them will cure it, our people on the whole will respond, and respond magnificently. The Government have a primary duty, but all of us have a duty to make clear to our people the danger that exists and the fact that we have a remedy in our own hands and that by exercising that restraint which is required&mdash;not to stop increases in wages but to ensure that there are regular increases in wages every year but worked in such a way that they will be a real increase&mdash;our people can avert this grave danger.  If we can make this clear to our people I am certain they will respond as they have responded in the past.  We can demonstrate once again, and we must demonstrate fairly fast, that this ability of our people which they have demonstrated so often in the past still exists in our people in 1970.</P>

      <P>I have not been following as closely as I intended to and wished to the reports of the debates in the other House and I do not know what I have read or what I have not read, if the Minister could understand that position; but, obviously, a mistake was made in the preparation of the section, though I do not exact an acceptance of that from the Minister.  I wonder how, in fact, this thing is going to work.  Will there be amending legislation required, because we all know that there will be assessments made after the 15th December next relative to this year after which date the decimalisation code will operate and a recurring decimal will be applied.  I have two questions.  The first question is, is it intended to have an amending Bill to deal with the situation after that date, and the second question is that from my own understanding it would seem to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The second question is that, administratively, it seems to me that this kind of relief is going to be very costly in so far as it is going to make the matter of raising assessments more complicated.  At this point of time nothing can be done about it, but I wonder whether the Minister would consider for the future some adjustment in the decimal allowance which would eliminate this additional calculation which has to be made in the case of many taxpayers.  I have great sympathy with the Minister in his position, not merely in the major problems from Second Reading but to be thrown in deep into the troubled waters of income tax and estate duty not to mention stamp duty and these other elements that are headings to different parts of this Bill.  Therefore, as I said, I am not demanding.  My request to him in relation to this is, <Col N="1329" /> first of all, there is a question of what we do after 15th December next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I say after the 15th December?  It should, of course, be after the 15th February. My concern is what we do after that in the matter of making available these revised reliefs, and, secondly, whether any costing has been done of this kind of relief, whether some other type of adjustment might not be found which would make the net cost to the Exchequer more beneficial.  In making these remarks I do not want to threaten the Minister with an evening of costings debate, because I do not intend to, particularly when we are actually in a position where we cannot do anything about this Bill.</P>
      <P>We can only hope that if he sees any defects in it the Minister will improve it next year and invite the Revenue Commissioners to consider these paragraphs that are referred to as extra-statutory concessions in regard to a number of the provisions in this Bill. At some other time I should like to be told the theoretical basis on which extra-statutory concessions operate.  I do not personally understand the theoretical basis.  I think it is that the Revenue Commissioners might leave themselves open to surcharge by the committee operating on behalf of the Dáil.  I am not certain of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald has made the point I was about to make. The date 15th February seems to be the sacred cow, the sacrosanct date.  I presume it is because of our relationship with the British economy, because the British Exchequer are bringing in decimal coinage on that date.  If it is not for that reason why are we adhering to that date?  Why do we not have the commencement at the beginning of the financial year?  There may be reasons for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald made another point and the Minister issued it in tabular form.  It occurred in another Bill where yards were being changed to metres.  There is the provision here of two-thirds and one-third involving a recurring decimal all the time and it <Col N="1330" /> does not seem appropriate to have it brought in in this way.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be easier to make it one-half of the first £100 of taxable income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators may have noticed that I looked somewhat mystified during the last contribution.  The reason is that I was searching section 2 for 15th February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We can deal with it now.  The 15th February was decided on here largely, I think, because it was the date decided on in Britain.  If we had a different date it would add considerably to the confusion, and with the best preparations in the world there will be certain confusion during the changeover to decimal currency.  It was to reduce the possibility of confusion that we decided on the same date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the calculation, this should not really present any problem because, if necessary, the calculation can be made on the basis of two-thirds of 7s and then the result converted into decimals.  The Decimal Currency Bill provides a schedule which shows exactly how the conversion is done.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cost of administration, I am advised that virtually all assessments will have been made before 15th February, but those which still remain can be dealt with in the way I have indicated.  There is no reason, therefore, to anticipate that there will be any noticeable increase in the cost of administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement in regard to the date.  Indeed, I had guessed what his answer would be.  It seems extraordinary to me&mdash;of course, we have no power over it&mdash;that the British Exchequer should have picked 15th February when they could have picked the beginning of the financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My point about administration did not relate to <Col N="1331" /> decimalisation but to the reduced relief.  The inspectors making the assessments will have to give time for calculations to be made at the reduced rate.  A great deal of time, obviously, was involved in this matter. We had a reduced rate of relief which we abolished for administrative reasons and I should like to know why we restored it.  Is the reason that fewer taxpayers will be affected?  Is this the answer that would justify the additional cost that must be involved in making these calculations and assessments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the reduction was what I referred to earlier on Second Stage&mdash;an effort to reduce the incident of income tax on people who are now within the net.  Some will be released by the minimum earned income relief and there will be some within it who would marginally be liable.  It is to reduce the incidence on them as well as to reduce the incidence of income tax on everybody that this is put in.  In regard to the calculations, I have no information at the moment as to costings but I do not believe there will be any enormous amount of cost or trouble involved.  When I said in the other House that the preparation of the PAYE assessments have been gone ahead with and was nearly finished in anticipation of the passing of this Bill, exception was taken by some people there.  I hope this will not be so in this House.  In the other House exception was taken to the statement on the basis that this was a case of the Civil Service treating the Houses of the Oireachtas as rubber stamps.  This is a misconception because, of course, if the Oireachtas decided to change this, the calculation would have to be made in accordance with any such change.  It is commendable that the Revenue Commissioners should have made arrangements in so far as they could so that if the House agreed with the proposals the taxpayers concerned would not be inconvenienced by holding them up for a long time during which they would not be able to get the allowances to which they were entitled.  I hope this explanation will not upset Members of this House.  It indicates that a great <Col N="1332" /> deal of the difficulty that might have been involved in this has already been overcome and I do not think it presented undue difficulty.  It would be only in the case of assessments having already been made out so that a fresh start would have to be made that real difficulties such as envisaged by Senator FitzGerald would arise.  It is true that the situation he envisaged could arise in the case of non PAYE taxpayers but in terms of numbers, PAYE taxpayers are the bulk.</P>

      <P>This is the section where an employer is expected to anticipate the income of an employee up to the level of £2,000.  In other words, the onus is being put on an employer on whom sufficient onus is placed already by way of collecting of taxes.  He is now being asked to anticipate the earnings of an employee.  This was mentioned first in the Dáil debate.  it is my opinion that there is too great a tendency in most of these taxation bills to put the onus on employers. Under this Bill employers are not only becoming tax collectors, they are becoming computing machines because they have to assess how much their employees are going to earn.  They must find out if their employees are going to earn an income over £2,000 a year. Am I correct about the figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is right. There are two figures involved here, one is £900 and the other is £2,000. The principle which the Senator is talking about applies in this section. In the case of the £900 limit it is true that the employer has to anticipate this but any return he gives is only based on his knowledge and belief.  He does not take on any liability if he is wrong in his assessment of it.  In the case of employees earning over £2,000 limit, this only applies when the employee has actually received it.  Furthermore, I understand that this liability to anticipate, as the Senator puts it, is not new.  It is merely a change of the figures to take account of the new reduced rate relief.  It is not a new principle. It has been in operation previously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, I should give a little more detail on this.  In order to retain the relative simplicity of the scheme of deductions and deductions under PAYE, effect is being given in this section to the new reduced rates and minimum earned income reliefs by coding in these reliefs by way of provisional deductions in income.  For this purpose employers will be asked to supply a list of married employees whose earnings are not likely to exceed £900.  Where this information is given the contemplated regulations will oblige the employer to notify the inspector should the earnings exceed that figure.  Let me say here that this is for the benefit of the taxpayer without which he would not get the benefit until the end of the year.  If it is clear at the beginning of the year that the earnings of an employee will exceed £2,000 maximum earned income relief of £500 is coded in as a deduction from income and the tax free allowance certificate and the tax deduction card issued require deductions of tax to be <Col N="1336" /> made at the standard rate.  In every case, effect is given to the one-fourth earned income relief by authorising deduction of tax at three-quarters of the standard rate.  If in one of these other cases the earnings go above £2,000, the continued application of the one-fourth earned income relief would result in the maximum of £500 being exceeded.  To overcome this situation it is proposed to oblige employers by regulation to notify the inspector that the earnings of an employee have exceeded £2,000 unless he already holds a tax free allowance certificate authorising the deduction of tax at the standard rate.  This liability is to notify the earnings of an employee are in excess of £2,000.</P>

      <P>This is a welcome amendment but I do not think the Minister goes far enough.  I wonder if the Minister, with the assistance of his officials, could give us some idea how the wife's earned income relief operates in Britain and how the figure of £74 in this Bill compares with it.  We will have to increase this figure in order to draw married women back into employment in the years ahead.  I do not think the Minister will find the figure of £74 is high enough.  I should like to have the Minister's views as to what he thinks about the situation.  I am sure he has had representations both as Minister for Industry and Commerce and as Minister for Finance about the question of earnings for married women.  We shall have to take cognisance of this factor in the years ahead.  It is certain that there will be far more married women working and available for work in factories here.  It would be unwise to shut our eyes to that fact.  Now is the time to take steps to ensure that they can earn reliefs comparable to those in other countries, particularly Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Russell except on one point.  I do not know why we should compare ourselves with England at all times.  We should not compare ourselves with anybody.  The Minister will probably agree with me to this extent.  Anything we do will come from the resources <Col N="1338" /> of this country.  Anything we do will depend on what we can produce. One of the great resources of this country&mdash;and the Minister implied it in his speech&mdash;is labour.  Senator Russell has a point here.  The Minister in his remarks to the Seanad or the Dáil said that he wanted to attract more female labour into industry.  This provision does not go far enough to attract them.  The £74 is not enough. Senator Miss Owens said that it would be better if, for this purpose, a marriage partnership were dissolved and if each person got his or her full allowance as if they were single people. The Senator did not put it as I have put it.  She did not suggest that the marriage partnership should be dissolved but that each one of the partnership should get a full individual allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Russell in his observations on this point.  I deal with a fairly large factory.  According to advice we are given, the factory could literally multiply its exports according to the availability of female labour. This is the restricting and limiting factor.  We could double the exports. This is almost entirely an export factory.  As I understand the position, I agree more with Senator Russell than with Senator Belton in thinking that we must look at the UK position.  The position in Britain with regard to the wife's allowance is that man and wife should be allowed in their joint assessment the equivalent of the personal allowance which, I think, would raise that figure of £74 to £325.  In addition to that, there is another factor which cannot be ignored in dealing with a married couple and that is that the earned income relief given to such a couple does not stop at £500.  It is two-ninths up to a maximum of £890 and one-ninth on the balance up to a figure of £1,660.  This would mean £1,600 plus £325 where we have £500 plus £74.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the position of the skilled husband taking a job back in Dublin where his skills are needed because they might make employment of others possible.  Such a man would consider his position under the legislation <Col N="1339" /> operating with regard to taxation and would find that he and his wife would be subject to much higher taxation if the wife went to work.  Their joint net income would be much less than in Britain.  It is good that the Minister has come from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Office of the Minister for Finance.  The Revenue Commissioners will become aware of the economic consequences of fiscal changes.  I do not know what the cost of making this adjustment in the earned income relief is.  In making any calculation of the cost of the £325 and £74, if I am right in my figures, the consequences in terms of yield of income, the extra work, the extra taxation resulting from the people employed, and the exports gained would have to be taken into account.  I have some reservations about whether the Revenue Commissioners have done so.  It would be quite an operation to make that calculation.  Between now and next year I should like the Minister to see that calculations are made on this matter and that in making them account is taken of the earnings for the economy which are produced by the people who are persuaded to go back to work.  It has been found that married women are better employees than they were when they were young.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanAlton" hpid="Dr. Alton Dr. Alton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a strong plea for this.  I should like the Minister in the course of the next year to try to induce many married women back to work.  In our own field we are becoming dependent on married women to do part-time work as radiographers, medical technicians, laboratory technicians and nurses. These are highly skilled women whose services are being lost to the country when they get married because of the very poor earned income relief.  We do not want to keep them out because we have a shortage in these groups.  We must not only give relief, but we must also induce them to return to help the country in this particular field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Alton has said what I intended to say.  Under the new Health legislation, which was before this House during the winter, there are incentives for domiciliary nursing services <Col N="1340" /> and also for married women coming back as nurses.  The incentive here given to raise the allowance to £74 may not be sufficient.  Hospitals and health services in general may not function effectively because of the lack of nursing services and the lack of personnel in these services.  I think that every possible inducement should be given to nurses to return.  I rather feel that the impact of this will be very serious for the community in future years.  It may finally be that the Minister for Finance may have to provide extra money to allow married nurses back again.  They cannot usually live in, but the domiciliary nursing service under the new Act is going to be expanded out of all recognition.  Senator Alton will agree with me on that. Unless the Minister gives greater inducements for them to come back, the nursing service will be short of staff very quickly and having regard to the shortage of nurses, such relief would be very acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should say in response to a question put earlier that in Britain the married women in employment gets an additional allowance equal to the single person's allowance. The effect of this for a married couple is almost the same as the allowance for three single people.  What we are doing here is making the allowance the same as for two single people.  It is not the same as for three because we could not think of this on the grounds of cost for one reason.  It is difficult to estimate the cost but, as far as we can estimate, it would be very heavy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am about to say may disappoint a number of Senators but I think I should say it.  We are increasing this figure here for two reasons&mdash;one, that the general fall in the value of money would indicate that there should be an increase in it, and, secondly, the shortage of women workers in a number of areas is leading to much difficulty, as has been mentioned by Senators.  However, I have reservations about this and I would think very hard before I agreed to increase it any further under present circumstances. The reason is that the areas in which there is a shortage of women workers are largely in the cities, but there are <Col N="1341" /> some parts in the rural areas more than in the cities&mdash;there are a number of places in the country&mdash;where there are plenty of women looking for work who have not got it.  I do not think that we should go overboard in catering for this problem until we have solved the problem of employment in the areas of the country for the young women who need work, so I am going some of the way but I have reservations about going further until we have solved this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister has made a good case in regard to that in that conditions in the rural areas are different from the cities.  I am more concerned with a city, and the one I have in mind has an industry with which I have some association, the clothing industry.  The Minister has had representations made in regard to that industry which in Britain, and to an increasing extent in this country, employs married women.  We are reaching a situation in the Limerick area, taking in a large sector of the rural area around Limerick, for as the Minister is aware the Limerick factories and the Shannon Airport factories draw their personnel, as I think Senator Honan would agree, from an area as much as 35 or 40 miles outside, so that, in fact, we are drawing on the pool of rural labour.  The situation is rapidly being reached, certainly in Limerick, where there will be an acute shortage of female labour.  Whether we like it or not&mdash;I have my own reservations on the question of married women working&mdash;we will have to offer inducements to more married women to encourage them to take up employment.  I appreciate the Minister's points.  This could be a situation which could change very rapidly, but at this juncture I think that the Minister largely agrees that this is something that should be taken cognisance of in the next Budget and the next Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister says, but there are areas&mdash;we may be one of the exceptional ones&mdash; where many young girls find it very difficult to get employment and, indeed, I think that this spreads itself into a different field where people <Col N="1342" /> nowadays are doing two jobs instead of one while there are quite a number of people walking around the streets and standing at the labour exchanges. I do not think that anything should be done to worsen that situation.  I could not say how you could apply this suggested relief on a selective basis, and if you were going to apply it it would have to be applied right across the board, because there are many small shopkeepers with their wives participating in the running of the shop and necessary to maintain the business and I would say that they would be people who should be included in this.  I know many working-class people whose wives work in hospitals as maids and one thing and another, so that if this were applied it would have to be right across the board.</P>

      <P>I was just about to make the point that has been made by Senator Honan, but I want to add a little to it, because we must also think of the wives who are at home caring for young children.  They are working in a very real sense.  Therefore, if we are going to give reliefs of this sort consideration should undoubtedly be given to the desirability of getting married women who are in a position to work into work, but, on the other hand, it should not be used to encourage women with young children to leave the home for the sake of the work.  Any inducement offered, consequently, I would say would probably be better given either by an increase in children's allowances or an increase in the marriage allowance as long as there are children who are under a certain age, or that the wife would be entitled to that relief as long as she had children under a certain age irrespective of whether she worked or not.  It is a complicated process, and I agree with the Minister that it is something that we should go fairly carefully about.</P>

It was decided, I think last year, that the children's allowances should become subject to tax where they had not been previously, for the reason that lots of people are getting them who do not really need them.  It is in application of this principle that this has been done.  The effect is that income tax allowances are reduced to correspond with the increased payments being made.  These are related only to the increases given in allowances.</P>

      <P>This section of the Income Tax Act of 1967 was the most welcome piece of legislation ever introduced for a struggling attorney.  I should like to know how have the figures been worked out; what is the basis?  It relates to self-employed persons who wish to provide pensions for themselves.  I am aware of the usefulness of the provision but is the intention here to put these self-employed persons into a non-risk category such as the Revenue Commissioners?</P>

      <P>There are two reasons <Col N="1345" /> for the figure of £750.  As the Senator probably knows, it was £500.  One reason is the continual one we meet, the fall in the value of money.  The other is partly coincidental.  The limit in operation in Britain is £750.  It has been in operation there since 1956.</P>

      <P>I am convinced that there was an excellent intent behind the original enactment of the provisions which it is here proposed to amend, but I want to place on record my view, based on very considerable experience, that I have known of no case of a public flotation where the matter of availability of this relief changed the judgment of people making the flotation.  I think this is a relief which is costing the revenue money without bringing any benefit to the economy.  I realise that the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister have difficulties in regard to any concessions in respect of any existing industry. Consideration should be given as to whether this relief should be retained in relation to State issues.  I understand that these two sections are to deal with situations which probably have arisen in which there were defects in other sections in relation to public companies because certificates could not be issued until a later date.  This is the sort of situation which these sections are designed to improve.  In so far as they make that improvement they are welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a few cases which have come to notice in <Col N="1346" /> which companies have issued stocks and shares but omitted to apply for the requisite certificates and no relief could be given between the date of the issue of the stocks or shares and the date of the certificate.  The object of these sections is to amend the provision subject to which a 20 per cent relief from income tax and surtax was granted in respect of dividends and interest on stocks, shares or securities of Irish companies.  The amendment here has effect in relation to dividends or interest paid on or after 6th April, 1966.  The relief has hitherto operated from the date on which the certificate was issued.  In regard to the other point raised, it is a fairly novel experience for a Minister for Finance to have such a suggestion made to him in either House and I will give it consideration between now and next year's Finance Bill.  If what Senator FitzGerald says is correct, and I have no reason to doubt him, it would make sense to take away this relief if it is not having the effect it should have.</P>

I am not inclined to give up anything until negotiations are completed.

    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's predicament here.  Probably it might be more decent to refer to these people as subcontractors rather than &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;.  In fact, I think the term &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; is exclusive to the construction industry.  These are people who agree to become subcontractors without notifying anybody.  If I use the term &ldquo;registered&rdquo;, I do not mean it in its literal sense.  I mean that they do not notify the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>There is an avoidance of tax on the part of these people.  In the building industry these people, labourers and skilled workers, unite to work by contract. I am not including them among general <i>bona fide</i> subcontractors.  In this section the Minister is endeavouring to get these people in his net.  However, I wonder if the effect of the section will be worth the effort.  There may be some people who are caught within the net but I am not so sure that this will not act as a disincentive because if these people never came together to do a particular job they would be ordinary employees of a builder.  They would work certain hours and they would be entitled to wet time pay and so on but under the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; system they are a unit working on contract and they will be prepared to work in any type of weather.  That is why I say this section may act as a disincentive. I accept the Minister's reply on Second Reading when he said that it was not possible to assess the amount of money being lost to the Revenue Commissioners on account of these people because, as the Minister pointed out, if he knew that he would know who the people were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my opinion that the machinery to be set up will be used at the expense of machinery doing work that will gather in taxes in another field.  Either new machinery will be used to collect the taxes or existing machinery will be used for the purpose.  I wonder if the cost involved in collecting this tax will be worthwhile.  Combined with that it is to some extent a disincentive to these people.  There are further objections <Col N="1348" /> also in that there may be subcontractors who are bigger than the contractor and the subcontractor may be having money collected from him by the contractor who, in fact, is a smaller builder.  This does not appear to make sense and the Minister might have a further look at this.  I can sympathise with him in his intent in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse what has been said on this section by Senator Belton.  I am not very happy about this section because I, too, consider that it will act as a disincentive in getting houses built more quickly.  As a member of a local authority, I find that in general it is the small contractors who take the small jobs, especially the building of isolated cottages.  Generally, they depend on getting those houses built by a subcontractor. A difficulty will arise for that type of person but I also have another type of person in mind.  I think this section will militate very much against a person building his own house under the Small Dwellings (Loans and Grants) Act.  Perhaps such a man would, with family help, have the foundation dug out, filled in and left ready for block layers.  He would then employ a couple of block layers.  He would supply the material and they would complete their work in ten days or so.  In the same way he will get the house roofed, the woodwork and plastering done, and by doing it in this way he can save a considerable amount of money.  He may do the labouring himself instead of employing block labourers.  I am concerned about that type of person who now finds added to the difficulty of finding a site, acquiring a grant and getting permission to build that he is liable to pay to the Revenue Commissioners the tax due on the money he has paid to the subcontractors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the case made by Senator Belton and Senator Jack Fitzgerald.  I think we all agree with the principle that where a legitimate profit is made tax should be paid on it but I am not quite clear of the workings of this.  If a subcontractor does a job for £200 the contractor must deduct £70 and pay him £130.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That assumes that a subcontractor or &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; has made a profit on the transaction.  He is being taxed on his total receipt from the job, there is no allowance for his costs, including the costs of his own labour. This is wrong in principle.  It is possible that the subcontractor or &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; may not have made a profit but he is being taxed on the total receipts of the job without consideration being taken of the costs of his own labour and other costs which he may have to bear. Like Senator Jack Fitzgerald and others I have a good deal of experience of local authority house building.  I have a fair knowledge of the dependence which contractors have on subcontractors who do work under extraordinarily adverse conditions.  The incentive of getting the job finished quickly and getting a handsome return for it stimulates them to get on with the job when other workers may not be inclined to work.  The Minister should go very slowly about introducing this new schedule.  We shall all be interested to hear the enormous amount of money that is being lost to the State as a result of this gap in the income tax code.  If the Minister could demonstrate that, I think the House would be more sympathetic towards this section.  I would <Col N="1350" /> have to be satisfied that the tax gatherers were losing a great deal of money before I could justify interfering with the present system.  It is an established system which has worked pretty well in the past particularly in regard to local authority housing and SDA housing.  I question whether the Revenue Commissioners are going to secure all this extra tax revenue as a result of bringing in this provision.  It is not impossible to imagine that there may be collusion between the contractor and the subcontractor to avoid this form of tax.  I would have a good deal of sympathy with a hard-pressed contractor who had employed a &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; if he made some arrangement with the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; to avoid paying this tax. The Minister may have information which we do not have but I would ask him to have another look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be much wider than that.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this section, where in the performance of a construction contract, whether made before or after the commencement of this section, in the case of which the principal is&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  a person who, in respect of <Col N="1351" /> the whole or any part of the construction operations to which the contract relates, is himself the contractor under another construction contract, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a person carrying on a business which includes the erection of buildings,</P>
    <P>If he is caught under subsection (b) I shall have to stop 4,000 seven shillings from him.  The section is so wide that it does not apply only to &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;. It includes contractors as such and it will lead to a tremendous amount of difficulty.  What a contractor will do in such a case is that he will push up the price of the house.  He will say to himself that he is going to be stopped 7s in the £ on this job and he will have to get an auditor to work out the cost and verify what he has earned. I would be fearful of anything that would push up the already spiralling building costs.  If the Minister is dealing merely with &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; I can sympathise with him because I do not feel anybody should be able to escape the tax net, but where a contractor has a fixed home and the inspector of taxes feels he is liable for income tax he sends him a notice of assessment, which is considerably higher, and if he does not pay he sends him an estimate of the amount and if he does not appeal against it he will be fined if this section includes contractors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the latter part of his remarks Senator Nash made the point that is worrying me.  I do not like the section at all particularly the effect it will have on the consuming public. People who want to get houses built will have to face increased costs.  The natural reaction of a subcontractor faced with this tax is that he will put the price up by approximately one-third, which is the amount of this tax. While admittedly in turn the consequences of that would be more money going into the revenue net because more would be deducted for income tax, in so far as the consumer is concerned I am afraid this may mean an increase in the price to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I want to make is one I have made to the Minister <Col N="1352" /> already.  It is in relation to the penalties involved here.  Two sets of circumstances are likely to arise.  There could be accidental omission to make the deduction.  I would like to know if there is an automatic revenue penalty in circumstances where the deduction has not been made, whether it is accidental or deliberate.  How is one going to differentiate between the person who deliberately refuses to make the deduction and to pay over the tax to the Revenue Commissioners and the other case where a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> mistake is made?  Will there be a penalty which is automatic or will it be discretionary on somebody's part as to whether it will be waived?  It seems to me that the penalties are to be dealt with by regulations.  I do not know whether I am correct in that or not.  If that is so, it is not a situation which I would like to see exist.  Nor do I like generally the idea by legislation here of compelling the principal to act as tax gatherer.  I am sure the Minister will make a sound case for this and I will not obstruct him on it.  I would like very much to know the answer to the point raised by Senator Russell as to what estimate is worked on as the loss which has been occurring over the years in this particular field.  I presume some estimate must have been made before this section was introduced. What, in the Minister's view, is likely to be the increase in tax revenue as a result of the operation of this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I pin my faith to subsection (11) which gives the Minister the power to fix the date on which this comes into operation.  It is conceded from all sides of the House that any evasion there may be must be stopped, whether it be little or large.  I invite the Minister to be very slow in bringing this section into operation. This is the section of the Finance Bill which gave me the most concern.  I think I am correct in saying that subsection (7) was introduced at the Report Stage in the Dáil debate by the Minister.  There is a tone about it which I do not like.  It suggests that the respectable contractor will be distinguished from the subcontractor who is not so respectable.  There will be found to be in existence legitimate useful elements in the building trade in Ireland if this is examined by people with other things beside tax evasion in their minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator J. Fitzgerald has described the situation where trades people including plasterers, plumbers, electricians and painters carry on genuine small businesses in the building industry. They may possibly be engaged in tax evasion but they are improving the efficiency of the building industry.  The Minister should be most careful to see that such persons who may not have <Col N="1354" /> been schooled in the idea of having an established place of business are not adversely affected.  The question arises whether it is right that the deduction in many cases where people do not so establish to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that there is an established place of business should be at the full standard rate.  There may be people engaged in evasion using materials which should be taken into account in considering what their net incomes would be.  The Minister should look at what was proposed in the British legislation.  There could be a case under the proposed law of the Commissioners there now being satisfied that the deduction proposed to be made should not be at the full standarl rate but at a lower rate than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the effects of this section.  We have a construction industry here whose capacity to erect buildings is strictly limited by the availability of skills.  Some body should make a study of the possible consequences of a flight of these skills from our land as a result of any legislation we might enact.  I agree that we must let some skilled tax evaders go. This might be right.  Before bringing the section into operation the Minister should assess this element also because at the same time as we are enacting this legislation there is a programme whereby we are trying to attract back to Ireland skills whose availability determines the number of unskilled people we can employ. Everything else I wanted to say has been already said on this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, on the question of whether a person building his own house is covered, I gather that Senator Nash was looking at the definition of a construction contract.  It is correct that if he refers to subsection (2) he will see that even in the case of a construction contract as defined, the section applies only in the case in which the person is either a person who in respect of the whole or any part of the construction operation to which the contract relates is himself a contractor or a person who carries on a business which includes the erection of buildings, so that a person who builds a house for himself would not come <Col N="1355" /> under either 2 (a) or 2 (b).

      <P>The question was raised as to how much revenue was involved in this.  As I said earlier to Senator Belton, we do not know.  If we did know we would not have this problem because we would not have to be doing it.  The only thing is that the indications which we have are that it is reasonably significant, but perhaps even more important is the fact that it is growing and if we do not take some action it will almost certainly grow considerably as a form of tax evasion and we could not contemplate just letting it mushroom in that way.</P>
      <P>The point was made, and I think it has some validity, that this might act as a disincentive, that it might cause the disappearance of certain skills in the construction industry which at present exist.  I cannot say categorically that neither of these things will happen.  I do not know positively that they will, but it seems to me that it is possible that they could happen to some extent.  In these circumstances we are forced to consider the principle involved here.  I do not think that this House can really contemplate deciding solemnly that either because it will act as a disincentive and thereby reduce efficiency in the industry or because of the loss of some special skills in the industry&mdash;that for these reasons this House should solemnly decide that these people should not be taxed.  We really cannot make that decision, but I think that most of the arguments put forward would involve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that if the amount involved is small there are other tax evasions going on that we are not getting after and the same principle <Col N="1356" /> applies, but as I have said, the indications are that it is significant at present and that it will certainly grow considerably if we do not take action. For that reason I think we are justified in taking action on this.</P>
    <P>As to the actual operation of the section, what I had in mind in drafting the amendments which were introduced in Dáil Éireann and which are achieved, I believe, in the section as it now stands were these things: firstly, what you might call genuine <i>bona fide</i> subcontractors whom Senator Alexis FitzGerald referred to as respectable people.  I admit that there is this awful distinction in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Legitimate subcontractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, legitimate subcontractors, as Senator Russell says.  Having a registered place of business and undertaking to furnish or having actually furnished accounts to the Revenue Commissioners, they get a certificate which will ensure that this section will not apply to them, and no problem arises for them.  This leaves us then with the people who either cannot or will not comply with the simple conditions in relation to the certificate. Some of them will not be able to do this because of the way the &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; operation is carried out.  Groups of people get together, but they change; some change from one to another; they move from one job to another; and in many cases it would not be easy for them to have accounts.  I am concerned in these cases where it is not possible for them to comply with the requirements to get a certificate, but where, while they are not actually rushing into the Revenue Commissioners to pay tax, nevertheless, they wish like other citizens to live with an easy conscience as regards the Revenue Commissioners.  In such cases their position will be that they will apply to the Revenue Commissioners giving details of their circumstances, and every time money is deducted it goes to the Revenue Commissioners and they will be enabled on a monthly basis to get from the Revenue Commissioners a refund of any tax that was taken in excess of what should have been deducted from them on a proportionate <Col N="1357" /> basis, that is, after the first month, they would get the repayments to which they would be entitled for that month and so on during the year&mdash;they would get the proportionate repayments.  A special section will be set up in the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that there is no delay in dealing with these cases.  I have given instructions to the Revenue Commissioners that I want to ensure as far as it is humanly possible to do so that in the case of &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; who, as I say, want to act as ordinary law-abiding citizens but cannot do so because they are unable to produce accounts or for some similar reason they will be facilitated as much as possible. I think that they may have some difficulty, but after the thing gets going they will be able to settle down.</P>
      <P>We have a third category.  These are people engaged in this business who have no intention of paying tax if they can possibly avoid it.  It was mentioned at an earlier stage that they not only avoid paying income tax but they do not contribute to social welfare, and this can raise problems for them and their families afterwards, and certain other things, but here I am concerned directly with tax.  I want to say quite frankly that I have not any sympathy with those people.  What is going to happen to them is that they will have deducted from their payment tax at the standard rate of 7s in the £, and unless they have considerable income from some other source, this will mean that more tax is deducted than they are liable for and, therefore, I would expect the bulk of them will report to the Revenue Commissioners and will get their allowances and work on the basis of the monthly adjustment.  The truth of the matter is that many of these people, strictly speaking, should be operating under PAYE, but because of the way the system operates they amount to independent contractors.  It is possible that some of these groups who have some form of stability would as a result of this change their system and have one man nominated who would enter into the contracts, receive the money and pay them.  He would be a subcontractor and employ them.  Of course, if you reach that stage, it is a question of PAYE deductions and the problem does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> I think we have gone as far as it has proved possible to go, as far as ingenuity can bring us, to ensuring that the genuine subcontractor will not be inconvenienced at all, that the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; who wants to conform is convenienced as much as it is possible to convenience him and that the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; who is trying to evade his liability will get his deserts.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which he explained the problem but I am not satisfied that it will not be a disincentive to those engaged in building.  We have had talk about respectable contractors with registered places of business. Everybody knows that the type of people who are being caught here are not sophisticated people.  They are hard bitten people who go round the country with a trowel and plumb rule, with a couple of labourers, to get a job done as quickly as possible and to get as much money as they can.  This provision will increase the price of building.</P>
      <P>Take for example a man who will charge £150 for block laying.  The contractor will say to him: &ldquo;I have to deduct 7s in the £.&rdquo;  That man will not be interested.  He will say to the contractor: &ldquo;Deduct as much as you like but I want £150.&rdquo;  That is what will happen.  I do not want to introduce a discordant note into this discussion&mdash;I would be the last to hurt the Minister &mdash;but it appears to me that we always get our inspiration from across the water and that we are now following the road trod by Roy Jenkins, and we know what happened to him.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with Senator Fitzgerald.  Of course, all tax is a disincentive.  If you are in a factory and you employ men overtime they know <Col N="1359" /> they are already taxable before they start their overtime.  They are not inclined to come back for that reason unless they want to make more money. In this case I cannot see the disincentive content any more than in the case of the ordinary contractor who might be said to want a bigger net profit for himself.  I do not think that will happen. All the subcontractor has to do is to write to the inspector of taxes and state: &ldquo;I am doing subcontracting work.  I undertake to give you accounts at the end of the year.&rdquo;  Then, the Revenue Commissioners shall&mdash;there is no choice&mdash;they must give him a certificate and he can go ahead with an easy mind.  It only means he must undertake to pay his tax the same way as the unfortunate labourer does.  I have no sympathy with anybody who tries to dodge paying tax.  If everybody paid the tax to which he is liable there would be greater revenue with which to help people in need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody who has spoken on the section has suggested that there should be tax evasion.  The main point made by most speakers was whether this is worth the candle.  My feeling, notwithstanding what the Minister has said, is that it is not.  The type of people who do these small jobs of work are not the sort of people to write polite letters to the Revenue Commissioners.  They are people who see a chance to make money, who will take on a contract for £100 or £200, who do a job as quickly as they can and then go and look for another.</P>
      <P>I am afraid the effect of this will be to kill this trade altogether and to add to the cost of building.  A point the Minister might have made and which I am making against myself is that the illegitimate &ldquo;lumper&rdquo;, if I may use that expression for want of another, will be put out of business, but is it likely that the business he loses will go to the legitimate contractor?  If so, it might be a welcome development, but I do not think it will happen.</P>

      <P>The Minister said &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; will be facilitated when they apply to the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1360" /> for refunds of money.  We know that when the Department have to pay out, it is three weeks before they do so.  Could these rebates be paid in a week?  Those people would like to have their money fairly quickly. Secondly, there is the problem of the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; who is married.  He is paid in cash up to his tax free allowance. What he earns over and above that allowance he is paid by cheque.  Will this section cover him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of repayment, it should be possible to do it within a week.  That is what is anticipated.  With regard to the second point made by Senator Crinion, it was possible to do this heretofore more easily because there was not any obligation on the employer.  This places an obligation on him and it creates a somewhat different situation.  Senator Jack Fitzgerald said we were copying the British in this.  I should like to say that the Revenue Commissioners have been working on this for quite some time on the lines now included in the Bill long before the British proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact the British system is not in operation at all but the system they were proposing is a great deal more elaborate than ours, which is relatively simple.  There were two Bills in Britain.  One was the Finance Bill in Britain the other was their Construction Industry Contracts Bill but, because of the general election, this Bill did not go through and the corresponding section of their Finance Bill was withdrawn.  Therefore, it is not in operation there at all.  I repeat that I accept that to some extent this may act as a disincentive for some people.  Indeed it will act as a disincentive for anybody who has succeeded in working away, earning money on these contracts but who is not paying any tax.  I suppose it could be said that for them to have to pay tax now would be a disincentive but that is not a good enough reason for us to decide that such people should go on not paying tax.  There are lots of other people doing the same kind of work in their capacity as employees but <Col N="1361" /> who are paying income tax to the full under the PAYE system.  One must have some regard for these people and for all other taxpayers as well.</P>
      <P>I agree that these &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; work very hard but if the circumstances arise as mentioned by Senator Jack Fitzgerald when these people would say if they were getting £150 for a job that they wanted £150 and that the contractor could fix the adjustment&mdash;if that happens&mdash;there would be a return to the Revenue Commissioners of the money from the contractor but the contractor would have to indicate to whom the money was paid and in respect of whom it was paid.  My opinion is that the third category we were talking about would not want to pay anyway.  As far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned they will have the names and addresses of these people from the contractor.  I have no sympathy with that category but I think I have made it clear that there are people engaged in this kind of work on a &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; basis who are good citizens, who are working hard and who are willing to meet their obligations as citizens but who may not be able to furnish accounts and so on.  It is for such people that we have provided this arrangement for repayment on a monthly basis and the Revenue Commissioners would ensure that such people are facilitated.  We cannot go any further than that.</P>
      <P>I cannot say to what extent this will be a disincentive or to what extent it may add to costs in building.  One can only speculate as to whether it will act as a disincentive and no one can say what will be the reaction of the &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;.  We shall have to wait and see how it operates but I cannot accept the proposition and I do not think Senators are urging me to accept that we should deliberately decide these people should not pay any tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be a disincentive because those people who, <Col N="1362" /> at this time of the year, would probably work for 16 hours each day would not be inclined to do so because they would have to pay tax and this in itself might slow down building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point I would support the Senator.  No one in this House would wish for legislation that would exclude tax evasion but before bringing in this measure I would urge the Minister to examine some aspects of the building industry during the past few years to see whether tax evasion has not led to the pooling of skills but which does not tend to produce houses that are less costly.  I invite the Minister before bringing this measure into operation to consider very carefully whether he should not bring in this legislation until next year when he could propose a deduction not of 7s but at a rate lower than that because if this is done these people will not be treated in a worse fashion than PAYE people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to the administration of this section. One is the cost of its administration and the second is, when it is implemented, the cost to the building industry. The Minister said, and I accept, that he could not give me any answer to this.  I can see the reason why he cannot do so but could the Minister change this Bill so that by regulation or otherwise he could frame the section in a way that he could impose it or take it away by regulation&mdash;in other words, to give it a chance?  We agree that anybody who is trying to avoid tax should not be allowed to do so but I am more interested in whether the cost of the implementation of the legislation will be worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister will agree to consider the suggestion I made that while bringing &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; into the tax net he should also ensure they pay social welfare contributions so that when they are out of work they can receive benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving consideration to this.  I cannot ensure that this will happen but I think it will be a spill-over from the operation of this section.  The main reason most people did not pay social welfare contributions was that they felt they would be marked on the books of the Revenue Commissioners.  Once they are on the books of the Revenue Commissioners I am sure many of them will be anxious to obtain social welfare benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is enough to say a number will be anxious to obtain social welfare benefits. Employers are required to deduct <Col N="1365" /> social welfare contributions and make tax deductions and in return employees are paid benefits when they are unemployed. These people have been working very hard and have earned a lot of money and now we are going to try to get them to pay tax.  If we are going to get them to pay income tax we should ensure they pay social welfare contributions.  I would ask the Minister to devote his talents to devising a scheme whereby they are obliged to make social welfare contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle on which this has operated is that the person who makes the investment is the person who gets the allowance.  The Senator may say where somebody takes on a long lease he is in fact making an investment which would entitle him to allowances but the effect of what he has suggested is that the allowance should be apportioned between the original investor and the person to whom he sold, assuming that the investment of the person taking on the lease is smaller than the original investment. This is not always the case.</P>
      <P>A person taking on a long lease is usually paying a rent and a fine.  If the fine is big the rent will be correspondingly small and <i>vice versa</i>.  What is happening is that the fine is in effect a commutation of rent and to the extent that that happens the rent paid is smaller.  A person who was taking it solely on a rent without any fine is clearly not entitled to this.  Simply because there is a commutation of it does not entitle him to do so.  The fact that the allowance is available to the lessor must be taken into account in arriving at the terms of the least both in relation to the fine and the rent.  It can not be said that the person who was taking the lease, namely, the lessee, is losing out on the allowance to which he would otherwise be entitled.  The allowance continues to exist.  If the lessor is getting the allowance the lessee can make a bargain with him and have this taken into account.  I do not think any injustice is being done to the lessee.  It would be unjustifiable to give the allowances I have mentioned to the lessee and in practical terms it would be extremely difficult in some cases.

Am I wrong in thinking in the management of industrial estates that it might be desirable that the transaction should be carried out by a lease rather than by way of sale? If this is correct, does it not have adverse effects on the management of industrial estates in so far as it would tend to put the person negotiating into a position where he would want assignments and the difference between coming into one estate and another would be changed and this would be bad for some estates?</P>

      <P>The allowance would be available to the person coming into the industrial estate who did not erect the factory but was coming in to occupy it, provided that he acquires the entire interest in the premises and is the first user of them.  His expenditure would be deemed to be the expenditure incurred by the person who actually erected the premises and he would then be entitled to the allowance. The situation is different if he is not the first occupier and if the premises have already been occupied and the allowance given.

That would be a matter for the management to arrange.  One may get permission from the planning authorities for the use of structures without designating the actual business.  It may allow light <Col N="1369" /> industrial use or heavy industrial use but the management may decide that the particular industrial use to which a premises is to be put shall be the making of cardboard cartons in one area and something else in another area.</P>

      <P>This point has been made in the Dáil.  I am ready to be corrected.  My point relates to subsection (3).  I am not clear on the effect of a three-partner partnership where three partners become two.  I am clear where there is the position where seven partners become six: there is no discontinuance resulting from anyone dying or retiring.  If you are one of a two-partner partnership and there is a retirement there is a discontinuance for the continuing partner.  There is an exception here providing for the case of a single individual whose death leads inevitably to the discontinuance of the profession in which he was practising but there is no provision for the discontinuance resulting from the death of one of two partners.  We try to <Col N="1370" /> arrange all sorts of things to suit ourselves but arranging our deaths is something that is more difficult to negotiate.  Tax avoidance of this kind by two partners arranging that one of them shall die so that particularly beneficial results should flow from discontinuance because of his death is an unlikely form of tax avoidance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In Britain there is an option in all circumstances whether it be a two-partner operation or three, four or five, for the continuing partner to opt not to have a discontinuance, but there has been a failure here to reconcile the operation of the partnership provision of the 1965 Act with this section which is in fact a copy of the UK section.  This should not apply in the case where a single individual has discontinued by reason of the death because he is one of two partners.  I recognise that we can do nothing about amending this Bill at this stage, but I would refer to those extra-statutory concessions available to the Revenue Commissioners and inquire whether these could operate in the case of death of one of two partners.  There may be two partners for whom this may have very serious consequences which could be cured by subsequent legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To comply with what Senator Alexis FitzGerald is suggesting we would logically have to apply that to section 62 and if we were to do that this would lead to very substantial evasion.  The section was introduced to prevent that evasion, so I find it impossible to accept it in this case without doing it in the other case, and if I were <Col N="1371" /> to do it in the other case there would be substantial evasion which I cannot contemplate.</P>
      <P>The question of using extra-statutory concessions to meet this would not really operate in such cases.  The authority for these extra-statutory concessions lies in the care and management section usually at the end of a Finance Act.  These extra-statutory concessions really operate in cases which are not within the letter of the law but are within the spirit or intention as far as these can be gathered.  It is fairly narrow and I do not think that it could be contemplated that it would operate in this case.</P>

Section 62 of the Income Tax Act before me makes this exception where a trade is carried on by a single individual and is discontinued because of his death similar to subsection (3) of this section, but if you amend this I agree with the Minister that logically that involves amendment of section 62.  Why should a death of one of two partners be treated differently from the death of a single individual or one of three, or four or five partners?  I completely fail to see that distinction or how it can lead to evasion.  I have said as much as I can on the subject and I will leave it to the Minister for consideration on another date.</P>

I have seen this happen and, in relation to creditors called together to assist a company which is in difficulties, this will now give rise to income tax liability of the company.

      <P>I think I have understood Senator FitzGerald's point, but if I have I do not think that it is correct to say that the company which would release the debt in the circumstances would lose out as a result of this section.  The liability only arises in respect of debts which are set off against profits and subsequently released, which I think does not arise in the case which Senator FtzGerald was talking about.  It will have the effect in that kind of case&mdash;more or less a composition and reconstruction where heretofore the Revenue Commissioners tended to lose out&mdash;that they will now get their fair share of tax, but I do not think that the company which is concerned will lose out because it will only apply where debts have been set off against profits and subsequently realised.</P>

      <P>There is a real weakness in this section if I read it correctly in relation to section 20. This is designed to provide relief for persons who die or go out of professions at particular ages.  Assuming you have somebody who goes out at the age of 65 and whose date of birth is right under the section, he gets relief <Col N="1373" /> of three-quarters, but the relief under section 25 is available only if the individual who is seeking to get the benefit of the section is engaged in the employment on the date of the passing of the Act.  I know of cases where persons of more than 65 years will have retired before the date of the passing of the Act.  Therefore they are not in practice and therefore they do not get the three-quarters relief provided for in section 25.  They get caught under subsection (2) of section 20 in respect of sums received.</P>

      <P>There was a commutation of tax which used to apply.  There are large numbers in the teaching orders who have taken vows of poverty and who are not entitled to receive any money for themselves.  Anything, the order get is expended in charity and they are heavily in debt.  Many orders got badly into debt and they found that certain members of the order who had become very old were not entitled to teachers' pensions.  They are all qualified teachers and when they took salaries as teachers they found that despite their vows of poverty and despite the fact that they cannot have money of their own, they were charged income tax and given only personal allowances.  Their income on a salary basis, which approximately amounted to the same figure as they formerly got as capitation grants, became taxable.

I refer to section 26 (1) which applies the charge to all sums arising from the carrying on of the trade or profession.  The words occur in it &ldquo;their amount or value&rdquo;.  There is an alternative, and presumably the Revenue Commissioners will be concerned with the higher amount. &ldquo;Value&rdquo; suggests something that is net.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My observations will be much briefer than they would have been if the Leader of the House had not cajoled my Leader into terminating the debate tonight.  I suggest that the Minister asks the Revenue Commissioners to have a look at the provisions in the 1894 Act.  I think section 7 (10) provides for relief from double charge of duty.  I may be anticipating, but section 37 of the Bill provides for relief from double charge of <Col N="1375" /> duty in certain cases.  There should not be, of course, double charge of duty in any case.  It was not intended in the 1894 Act that there should be.  Of course the same property does not pass on death and I am certain that the Revenue Commissioners have no intention to make any double charge in any case.</P>
      <P>There may, however, be times when people may get irritated at finding that somebody has been very witty in relation to some aspect of his affairs and that he so arrange them that no duty is payable.  Then it may be found that the person so arranging his affairs exposed himself to double charge.  I do not think this is fair or right because I think double charges should be excluded. In any case, it would make for better legislation.  I shall give one case where a man forms a company.  The Minister said that some companies are formed for the purpose of evading estate duty.  This can be done rightly and in certain cases for the proper protection of people coming after.</P>
      <P>I made a calculation today at the Library for the Minister.  Really, I brought the figures more up to date. A man who, in Ireland, would be regarded as being very comfortable at least would now have to pay in real terms of estate duty six times what he would have had to pay in 1939.  I invite the Minister to have an entirely new look at the whole code of estate duty. Let us assume we must collect £8 million but perhaps we could add whether by reorganising the scale this could be done.  In Britain, for example, a man with a farm gets immediate relief of 45 per cent of the value of that farm.  It is not assessable at its future value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald seems to think that a man with assets of, say, £10,000 would pay a lot in death duties.  According to my calculation, if a man leaves all of his estate to his wife or dependent children he would have to have at least £15,000 before there would be liability for death duties because the widow would get an abatement of the first £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1376" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I was going to make this point in relation to what was said by Senator FitzGerald concerning liability in Britain.  It is true that there is an abatement in respect of agricultural value.  If there is a side value other than the agricultural one, this becomes liable in the normal way.  I must make the point also, however, that farmers in Britain are liable to income tax and there is also the factor that we operate a system of abatements in respect of widows and children as had been pointed out by Senator Nash and this is quite substantial.  Such system is not in operation in Britain.  Therefore, if we wish to compare the two we should take these matters into account.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other point raised by Senator FitzGerald double charge of duty would not arise.  As I understand it between the 1894 Act and our section 37 here there should not be any case in which the double charge should arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the First Schedule that I wish to discuss.  The Minister's attention was drawn during the Dáil debate to these duties on property.  The First Schedule reads:</P>
      <P>CONVEYANCE or TRANSFER on sale.</P>
      <P>Of any stocks or marketable securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relative figures are set out thereunder. One of the points that are important to realise in relation to this is that heretofore in this country there was a different rate of stamp duty relating to the transfer of what might <Col N="1377" /> be regarded as real property in the sense of its being immovable property, lands, houses and so on.  Between that on the one hand and the transfer of property there are matters such as the transfer of goodwill, of licences of various kinds and matters of that sort. I wish to refer in particular to the question of the transfer of goodwill. Heretofore and for as long as I have been a practising lawyer, the position was that on the transfer the rate of duty was fixed at 1 per cent.  The rate of duty in relation to property other than goodwill, what I have referred to as real property, varied according to the amount of the consideration.  We could regard it for purposes of giving an example of stamp duty payable on the transfer of property which would average 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The transfer of goodwill up to now has been 1 per cent but it is proposed here by virtue of the definition set out on page 35 that there is to be a higher rate of stamp duty in matters such as goodwill.  Up to now the position was that if a person was selling a business as a going concern, he was selling the premises in which the business was carried on.  The practice was to calculate as between property on the one hand and the goodwill on the other. When the apportionment was made the value of the property was charged at whatever the appropriate rate of duty might be, which I shall regard for the purpose of this example as 3 per cent and the value of the goodwill was liable for duty at the rate of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>My recollection of the line the Minister took in his Second Reading speech was that this was being introduced for the purpose of stamping out a practice. I think I am correct in recalling that he described the practice of apportioning an excessive amount to goodwill in transactions of this sort.  I do not know what evidence the Minister has that any such practice exists or has existed. I would be interested to know what evidence he has.</P>
    <P>My experience is, and I hope this will be confirmed by Senator Nash and other practising lawyers, that when an apportionment of this sort is made more often than not the apportionment is made on the basis of a valuation <Col N="1378" /> prepared by competent valuers.  If it is not done on that basis the stamps branch of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash;the adjudicating branch&mdash;would quickly call for evidence of that sort. Where an apportionment of this sort is made the adjudication office would require to be satisfied as a matter of course that the apportionment is a genuine apportionment and the amount of condition put on the premises on the one hand as against the goodwill on the other is the fair market value of it.  I do not appreciate what evidence there can be to say that there has been a practice of apportioning an excessive amount to goodwill.  Even if that practice did arise or did exist the way to deal with it would be to try to stamp out the practice instead of equating the duty for goodwill with the remainder of the property by making people pay the same rate of duty on goodwill as is payable on the remainder of the property.  Other steps could be taken to arm the Revenue Commissioners with ways of penalising people who put in for duty avoidance purposes a valuation which is excessively loaded as to goodwill.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the original reasons were for having the duty on goodwill fixed at 1 per cent and variable duty changing from time to time on property at a different rate.  Whatever the reasons which inspired it originally I can see sound reasons for keeping the differentiation today. Goodwill is an intangible.  There is a certain amount of speculation involved in any sale of goodwill.  Even in a business of a rather impersonal nature, there is still something intangible about it.  Certainly it is entirely&mdash;perhaps that is an exaggeration&mdash;it is largely intangible and speculative when talking in terms of the transfer of goodwill in relation to any business or professional practice depending largely on personal attention.  I am thinking, for example, of the transfer of a doctor's practice, a lawyer's practice or a veterinary surgeon's practice, where, to a large extent, the goodwill will be tied up with the individual.  No matter how successful and how large the particular practice may be, and no matter how high the hopes of the purchaser are that it will <Col N="1379" /> continue at the same level, however good the intentions of the vendor to try to continue at the same level by doing what he can to facilitate the transfer of goodwill, there must be an element of doubt because of the intangible nature of the asset.  It may be that ultimately through no fault on the part of the vendor or the purchaser the goodwill turns out to be less valuable than had been thought.  It seems to me this is a sound argument for keeping the rate of duty payable on goodwill, provided&mdash;and I concede this to the Minister&mdash;the apportionment as between the goodwill and the premises is fairly arrived at&mdash;given that, it seems to me that there is still a strong case for a differentiation in the rate of duty.  This is going by the board here not only in relation to goodwill but in relation to other property including licences.</P>
    <P>I have, so far, been talking on the Schedule.  If I can go back to section 40 there is another point here which I think should be considered by the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners. Section 40 is to come into operation either on the 1st August, 1970, or whatever date the Bill passes, whichever should be the later.  We, in this House have facilitated the Minister so much in this matter that it would seem to me that the relevant date will be the 1st August.</P>

      <P>The section provides that it will come into operation on 1st August, 1970, or the date of the passing of the Bill, whichever is the later, but shall not have effect in respect of any instrument executed before such coming into operation. This means, if there is a sale of what I call real property on the one hand and intangibles such as goodwill on the other, it has got to be stamped before 1st August in order to get the <Col N="1380" /> benefit of the old rate of duty for goodwill. There may be a number of cases where this will not be possible even though the contracts have been entered into and the actual deed of sale or transfer executed before 1st August.  I am sure most legal practitioners have had difficulties on account of the bank strike.  One of the emergency methods evolved to deal with the situation is that while legal practitioners, with the consent of their clients, are continuing to close sales on the basis of accepting cheques, they are doing it on the condition that they will not part with the deeds whether it be the final deed of the sale or transfer deed or the earlier documents of title until the bank situation permits of cheques being lodged and cleared.  Talking from personal experience I have dealt on behalf of vendors with a number of such cases where the arrangement I have made in order to facilitate the purchaser to go into possession is that I will accept the unguaranteed cheque which is offered to close the sale but I will not part with the deeds.  I will give the purchaser's solicitor an undertaking that as soon as the banking situation permits I will lodge his cheque for clearance and when cleared I will send on the deeds. That is a method which has probably been adopted by a number of my colleagues in the legal profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily fully executed.  Possibly that case I am speaking about is weaker than the next one I am coming to.  A number of the deeds will not have been executed. Others might be executed by one party and not by the other.  I have cases in mind where notwithstanding my advice as to how the matter should be dealt with in order to facilitate the purchaser my client will not allow me to close until the banks reopen and the matter can be dealt with in an ordinary way.  In such a case there will be no question of the deed being executed by anyone until the banks reopen. There is another set of circumstances where contractors have entered into contracts involving the sale of businesses including goodwill such as contracts <Col N="1381" /> involving the sale of professional practices where the contract has been entered into but where for one reason or another and possibly on account of the bank strike, the matter will not be closed until after the 1st August.  The Minister will know from his own experience as a practising solicitor that very often for one reason or another, and more particularly where the question of possible goodwill is concerned, it may be necessary to have quite a lapse of time between the initial negotiation and entry into the contract and the deed of final handing over. Obviously, the bigger the business involved the more likely it is that the time-gap between the initial negotiations and the contract on the one hand and the final closing on the other hand will be a long one.  I have in mind a particular case which is not really comparable with what I am saying because it involves the purchase of shares and the buying into a company but is the kind of thing which is likely to operate where the contract, to the best of my recollection, was entered into in March last and where there are a number of conditions that have to be fulfilled before the contract falls due for coming into operation and before it can be finalised.  A number of those conditions have been complied with and there are others in the course of being dealt with and, no doubt, they will be complied with.  One way or another, it is unlikely that in that particular case the finalisation will take place before August, September or October.</P>
      <P>I can visualise exactly the same situation arising in the case of a number of contracts where the question of goodwill is involved.  The particular one I have in mind does not come into that category but is running on parallel lines.  It seems to me that if this goes through as it stands at least some consideration should be given and some exception made to the cases where contracts were genuinely entered into before this change of law was proposed and where those contracts will not be finalised until after the 1st October.</P>

      <P>If I might deal first with the later points made by Senator O'Higgins.  I do not think in fact there will be any problem at all in the cases the Senator outlined.  He was speaking of certain cases and he said that a genuine contract was entered into before the 1st August or the date of the passing of this Bill.  Where a genuine contract was entered into, the contract can bear the duty and, indeed, in the case of goodwill has to bear the duty, and where it was entered into before the critical date the existing rates of duty will apply.  I do not think there is any problem in the circumstances the Senator outlined.  With regard to the general question of changing the rate of duty on goodwill and on other items, I would like to remind the House that prior to 1947 the same rate of duty applied to all property, moveable or immoveable.  What we are doing in effect is restoring that position.  The change was made in 1947 because at that time a first effort was made to inhibit the sale of land to non-nationals by increasing the rate of duty on land and property, immoveable property, in the sense that Senator O'Higgins used it.  There have been changes since then, of course, but it is from that date that the change between the two kinds of property arose.  Prior to that they were the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One question is the principle of whether they should be treated differently.  The other is the rate.  I think it is clear enough that except in that special situation which arose in 1947 the principle was that they were treated as being the same and subject to the same rate of duty.  I questioned this when I heard it, as to why there was a difference, and the reason is what I have given.  There is no reason in principle why they ought to be treated at a different rate of duty. It is true, as Senator O'Higgins pointed out, that the rate of duty has increased since 1947 above certain levels of value, but if the principle is accepted that they are the same for the purpose of stamp duty and should be treated similarly as they were prior to 1947 then I do not think one can object to applying the higher rate which has been applied to land and premises heretofore. We are not proposing to change that.  Simply what we are proposing to do is to restore the position as it was prior to 1947 by applying the same rate of duty to all these properties, but we are applying the current rate of duty.  The one exception to that is and has always been stocks and shares, which are in a different category.  They were an exception prior to 1947 as well, and they are still an exception.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's explanation of the reason but I thought that the differential went back far beyond that.  I am a bit troubled <Col N="1384" /> at one thing that the Minister said. He said that the case of a genuine contract for the sale of goodwill or involving the sale of goodwill presents no difficulty because the contract originally, he said, in the first instance can bear the stamp duty and in the case of goodwill must.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister check that?  If I enter into a contract with Senator Nash to sell me a business as a going concern for £x I think that, unless I am entirely wrong, that can be stamped as far as the contract is concerned at 6d and that at a later date when the final date is going to be entered into the question of apportioning as between the premises and the goodwill will arise.  I know that there are some cases&mdash;for example in connection with an agreement for a lease which is to be followed by a lease the Revenue Commissioners may request that the stamp duty applicable to the lease will be paid on the agreement for a lease, and then when the lease is ultimately presented for stamping it would not bear stamp duty because it has already been paid.  Possibly what the Minister has in mind is that there may be some similar discretionary power in the Revenue Commissioners to look for apportionment at the time of the contract.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis for what I said is in the Stamp Act, 1891, section 59, subsection (1), which provides that any contract or agreement for the sale of any equitable estate or interest in any property whatsoever or for the sale of any estate or interest in any property except lands, tenements, hereditaments or certain other kinds of property shall be charged with the same <i>ad valorem</i> duty to be paid by the purchaser as if it were an actual conveyance for sale of the property agreed to be sold.</P>

      <P>This is true.  This is the point I was making.  Again I will confess that my recollection, which may be getting rusty now, from my days of <Col N="1385" /> practice was somewhat similar to that of Senator O'Higgins, but one thing he can be sure of is that whether duty must be paid on a contract or not it may be paid on the contract, and therefore his problem about contracts entered into before the critical date does not arise.</P>

      <P>It does not arise in the case where stamp duty has been paid on the contract but if I am right in my contention that you can, and unless I am greatly mistaken frequently do, have contracts which involve the sale of goodwill&mdash;the example I have given is the sale of a public house or something like that as a going concern which is not stamped <i>ad valorem</i> on the contract; it is stamped with a 6d postage stamp in some cases.  I am talking about cases presented at the Castle for stamping and stamped at 6d&mdash;let us assume that such cases do exist and that the transaction is not finalised until mid-August, am I not correct in saying that in those cases the new rate of stamp duty will be payable on the purchase date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

This is an inflationary measure which will be an incentive for those in employment to demand increases in wages and salaries.

      <P>In relation to this section I would ask the Minister whether there is any precedent for a section of this sort.  The reason for the section is self-evident but it seems to be a most extraordinary section.  Maybe there is precedent of some sort for this but let us consider what we are doing here.  The legislation deals with a contract that has already been made between two parties.  This is where the reason is self-evident&mdash;the change in the turnover tax, if legislation of this sort were not introduced, would be very expensive on one of the contract departments.  What the Minister is doing here is endeavouring to solve that situation but the way in which he is doing it seems to me to be extraordinary by virtue of an Act of Parliament altering a contract that has already been entered between two partners.  For myself, I would prefer to see this done in some other way.  I <Col N="1391" /> should like to see the same effect being achieved but in a way other than legislative activity interfering in contracts, the terms of which have been arranged and entered into by the contracting parties.  We are not saying that in addition to the payment one of the contracting parties may recover something from the other but we are saying &ldquo;as an addition to the payments specified in the contract&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are hereby altering the terms of a contract which has already been entered into.  If the Minister can tell me there is precedent I shall be happy and accept the amendment but I do not recall any Act which provides for interference in this way.  I know of several Acts in which it is said that there will be an implied condition and that such shall be implied in relation to particular contracts.  I know of legislation which provides that people cannot contract out of obligation imposed by legislation but what is proposed here is new to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>From a practical point of view, I think it would be impossible to have this otherwise because tax can be paid either on goods invoiced or cash received.  If a person is manufacturing or wholesaling he can pay turnover tax as he invoices but in that way he is running the risk of paying turnover tax on bad debts.  He can also say that he will pay turnover tax on cash receipts.  In that case, if he has invoiced goods in advance, the purchaser has received the goods but the wholesaler or manufacturer does not receive payment until this comes into force.  He then has to pay the increased tax on the cash received.  From the point of view of revenue it would be impracticable to do this in any other way.</P>

      <P>If, for example, I purchased goods and received them last April but did not pay for them then and had not paid for them before the 1st May, I would now have to pay the additional 2½ per cent.  Has the Minister given any consideration to this point or to the fact that by the continuing failure of various people to settle the bank dispute, a person would not, perhaps, have been able to pay for them.  Therefore, because of this dispute with the commercial banks he is obliged now to pay an additional 2½ per cent on the contract originally made.  One could also take the case that where a contract was entered into after the 1st May and both parties to the contract agreed to deceive the Revenue Commissioners it would be simple for them now to backdate invoices and private cheque books are freely available so that they could backdate also the cheques and in that way avoid the 2½ per cent taxes which came into operation from 1st May.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that <Col N="1393" /> the provisions of this section are operating very harshly on certain people engaged in the tourist industry who, we all know, have not been experiencing the most marvellous year.  Many people in the industry published brochures, as they were advised to do, by the Minister for Transport and Power in the middle of 1969 setting out their 1970 prices.  They entered into agreements with holiday makers from abroad to come and stay in their hotels and holiday camps at those prices.  I was speaking recently to a large scale operator in the holiday camp field who attracts considerable numbers of British tourists every year&mdash;although not to the same extent this year.  He pointed out that while he would be entitled to ask them to pay an additional 2½ per cent on the agreed price he did not feel it would be correct to do this because of the difficulties the tourist industry is already in.  He is doing his best to persuade them to come back next year and he feels if he asked the tourists to pay this 2½ per cent this year they definitely would not come back again next year. Would the Minister consider granting concessions to these people who have to quote prices many months in advance? Must this section apply so rigidly to them?</P>

The same thing applies to them.  This provides a degree of certainty as to what the liability is. If the person concerned in the Senator's instance decides for what are good and sufficient reasons not to charge this additional tax, that is his business.  He is entitled to do that, but as he is liable he could charge it to them.  I could not contemplate exempting him or, indeed, all the other numerous classes who would make representations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give an outline of what is contemplated here?  I think all of us are prepared to support and do more than pay lipservice to the necessity for saving.  It was made quite clear by the various contributions on Second Reading and also by the Minister in his reply, not only how desirable but how essential savings are in the present economic atmosphere and the inflationary situation which is there to be corrected.  I am not saying this is an effort to throw cold water on the idea but I often think that when we talk about inflation on the one hand and savings on the other we are going around in a vicious circle.  Savings are, as I say, not only desirable but even necessary in an inflationary situation. Unless people have real confidence that the inflationary situation will be overcome they will not save.  The purchasing power of the £ has decreased here by nearly 50 per cent in a short time.  There is no incentive in that sort of situation for any worthwhile savings.  Obviously, if a person is going to put money by, particularly if he is going to do it as a patriotic duty in order to help the economy of the country in response to the appeals made by the Minister or others to do this, he is entitled, when he is deliberately postponing the enjoyment of the spending of that money, to know that when he spends that money he is going to get at least the same value as the money he is putting aside.  The big problem we are up against here&mdash;and money values are falling all the time&mdash; is that the person who puts aside a pound which is worth 20s gets back 15s or 13s when he comes to realise it. I do not want to discourage insurance policies but it is very much the case that the person who took out an insurance policy 15, 20 or 25 years ago visualised a return in the terms of money values as they were when he was entering into the insurance contract. <Col N="1395" /> We all know he is not getting that today and this is the problem.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give us his ideas of the type of scheme proposed to be operated.  As far as I am concerned, the more attractive it can be the better.  The more attractive it is the more likely it is to achieve some degree of success and the more likely is the person who responds to the exhortations to save in relation to a scheme of this sort to get reasonable value for his money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that an inflationary situation is a disincentive to saving.  This is another argument for controlling our existing inflation. Nevertheless, I think that there are still quite a number of people who are anxious to save if they get the right scheme and the right terms.  I believe what we have in mind will prove to be the right scheme and the right terms.  I undertook on Second Stage to give details of the terms of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Senators will have noticed that section 18 of the Bill provides for exemption from income tax of any form of the interest paid under a saving scheme.  Section 53 provides for the actual operation of the scheme by the Minister for Finance, a bank, a trustees savings bank or a building society.  A scheme other than a scheme operated by the Minister for Finance must be approved by him and all schemes must be certified by him in order to qualify for tax exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new scheme will be managed on my behalf by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Under this scheme a person will undertake to save through a trustees savings bank, Post Office, or direct to the appropriate section of the GPO, Dublin, a stated instalment each month for 12 consecutive months and to leave the total so saved on deposit for a further two years.  The instalments must be in complete £s subject to a maximum of £20 per month.  For each £12 left on deposit for two years a bonus of £3 or 25 per cent will be payable. If employers and employees agree, the instalments may be paid by deduction from pay and the employer may pay the money to the GPO.  A person <Col N="1396" /> who had saved the maximum of £240 would receive a bonus of £60 after two years.  The bonus is equal to 9 per cent per annum compound interest free of tax.  In the case of a person liable to income tax at 7s in the £ this is nearly 14 per cent per annum gross.  If a person withdraws his savings before the end of the two year period has passed, the interest at 4 per cent per annum, tax free, will be payable for each calendar month following that in which the final instalment is paid.  With exemption from income tax, this is equivalent to about 6 per cent per annum gross. If a saver does not complete the 12 monthly instalments, he may withdraw his savings but no interest or bonus will be payable.  The proceeds of the scheme will accrue to the Exchequer and form part of the central fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand what I read and what is implied in sections 53 and 18 is that this is referable to an instalment savings scheme. It might be worth the Minister's while to look at it from the point of view of a person who might be able to afford to enter the scheme on the basis of paying the money in one sum and not paying by instalments.  I do not know whether the Minister's scheme envisages that happening.  If there are such people, perhaps, they should be encouraged. All the money is savings.  While the basic idea may be to cater for small savings in the sense of contributions by monthly instalments as the Minister has suggested by arrangement with employers and employees I would suggest to the Minister that the scheme should not be restricted to payment by instalments.  I agree that it is necessary or desirable to restrict certain things.  If there are people who are prepared to put down the payments for 12 months altogether the Minister should not rule <Col N="1397" /> them out.  People may find it easier for one reason or another, perhaps, because of overtime worked, back pay, or a bonus due, to put down the 12 months payments together.  Such money might otherwise be spent and not saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree with that suggestion.  There are existing saving schemes and numerous methods of investing money of the kind the Senator has in mind.  The idea here is to encourage savings out of current earnings.  If we were to adopt Senator O'Higgins' suggestion we would find ourselves paying a fairly high interest rate on peoples' savings and money already invested would be transferred into this scheme to earn a higher rate. This rate is designed to attract people who will save out of current earnings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

If the Minister or anybody else has money on deposit or in any type of account with one of the commercial banks that are at present closed, that money is his, which he is legally entitled to, and that bank when it accepted his account entered into a legal obligation to honour cheques presented by him to draw on that account so long as there was money there.</P>

      <P>I will explain what I am getting at.  If a person so desires he would have quite a legal case for getting his money from the commercial banks.  In the same way the Government chooses the Bank of Ireland to operate the particular loan in question. The money borrowed by the Bank of Ireland does not belong to the Bank of Ireland but to the Government, and the Government have the right to demand the return of that money because of the fact that the bank would surely have entered into a legal obligation with the Government to make available to the Government money which was their own and not the banks.  Also in relation to this could not the Government&mdash;presuming that the first suggestion I have made is not correct, though I think that it is, <Col N="1399" /> but if the Minister would disagree with it&mdash;bearing in mind the realities of the situation&mdash;could the Government not make cash payments to the people concerned, with the commercial banks bound on reopening to recoup this out of the moneys which they hold in relation to this loan at the present time?</P>

      <P>The question of the precise obligations undertaken by a bank to its customers is one for the courts and not for me.  The question of payments being made to the people concerned here by the Government and then recoupment when the closure ceases is not a practical one, because the registers which when the banks are open change every day are in fact in the custody of the Bank of Ireland. There are difficulties about obtaining them, but even if they could be obtained the problems of making sure that any such payments were made only to the persons entitled to them and of making sure that all the details were on the register would be such as would render the suggestion not practicable.</P>

The Government are legally entitled to the registers, and I am sure that the Minister from his vast legal experience will feel with me that if the Government chose to have recourse to the courts it would be felt by the courts that the Government had a perfect right to have restored its registers, and not only that but to have restored to them their funds in relation to this loan.  I want to suggest to the Minister not only that this section is completely unnecessary but that this could act as a test case on behalf of all the other people who have money at present tied up because of the closure of the commercial banks, and it might even serve to popularise the Minister in his personal capacity where people would feel that he was prepared to take this action on their behalf.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I want to make one or two points to the Minister. I would like to declare a modest interest in this as a holder of a modest amount of one of these stocks.  I want to ask the Minister in relation to subsection (2) here which says that as soon as reasonably may be after the closure ceases the Minister shall, by order, fix a date not being more than three months after such cessor for the redemption of the stock.  I want to ask the Minister, while I quite understand that he should feel the need to have the amount of elbow room that the three months would give him, does he intend to utilise the full period or is it his intention to fix the redemption date reasonably soon, say a month after the banks reopens?  I think that most Senators will appreciate that in terms of redemption when you come into the list within the last six months, or say a month or two or three from the redemption date, that can have quite an effect on the market value of the securities.  I think I am right in saying this&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that in relation to at least one of these stocks the original redemption date was about October, 1970, and I think it was announced by the Minister's Department that the redemption date had been advanced to July.  The result of that was to increase the market value of that stock by three or four points or thereabouts, so it would to my mind have quite a bearing on the market value as to what the Minister does, whether he fixes it at 6 months&mdash;I think that the nearly par value would be maintained if he did that&mdash;but if he were to postpone the redemption date for three months after the reopening of the banks I think it might have the effect of depreciating the market value of the securities.  I do not know whether the Minister feels free to express his intentions at this point, but I suggest that he might bear it in mind in any event.</P>

      <P>I should say that it is my intention to effect this redemption as soon as it is possible to do so, but the information I have would indicate that it is unlikely to be very much before three months&mdash;that the whole of that period is likely to be needed in <Col N="1401" /> order to take the necessary steps for the payment of dividends and redemption.</P>

      <P>The second point&mdash; and the second time I spoke about this&mdash;was that the Minister was forced to the point of not being able to get money from the banks because they held the registers. The Government are entitled to the registers, and I do not see why the Minister in order to operate that scheme properly, and indeed to bring about a very rapid conclusion of the trade dispute, would not consider taking this action.  Not only would he be able to make repayments on his loan, but the commercial banks would be back in operation within a week.</P>

I also said that even if we had them, the difficulties involved in ensuring payment to the right people were such that it did not make this a practical proposition.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask a few questions on this.  First, how will this be implemented?  Who will determine which are smuggled pigs and which are <Col N="1402" /> not?  How will identification be made, and by whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it is not possible to identify smuggled pigs.  If it were, we would not have this problem. Therefore it cannot be approached from the simple angle of applying a levy to smuggled pigs.  It will be approached on the basis that the levy will be imposed where there are certain grades of pigs, very heavy or very light, which are most likely to have been smuggled.  The amount of levy would be determined by the going rate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>For pigs, having regard to whether they were smuggled or not. The levy would be imposed in relation to grade and weight.  The amount would depend on the market price but there is provision, or there will be, for exemption from such levy based on, say, the supply of pigs from sources such as fattening stations and so on, where there is no doubt as to the source of the pigs&mdash;that they were not smuggled.  This cannot be done on a broad basis, but in general this is the way it would be approached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean there will be a levy on all fat pigs? Especially in the area from which I come, the factories buy fat pigs.  The pigs are fattened to a certain weight. This is a requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say there will be a levy on all fat pigs, nor can I say there will be a levy on all light pigs.  It depends on the circumstances at the time.  Any order will be made after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whose bailiwick this is.  There is provision for exemption from such levy in cases where it can be clearly demonstrated that the pigs are our own product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister stand over the statement that it can be clearly demonstrated they are our own pigs? I can foresee tremendous difficulties in operating a scheme like this.  The further one goes away from the Border the more likely the exemption. That being the case, the pig producer living close to the Border will <Col N="1403" /> suffer because of his proximity to the Border.  How can one identify an Orange pig or prove that a pig is not home produced?  Must one produce a birth certificate for a pig?  I do not see how the scheme will operate.  I am sure that John B. Keane and people of his sort will have a field day on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying this quite seriously: if the danger should cease to exist, will the Minister give an undertaking that this levy will not be continued&mdash;that it will not be imposed on what he described as home produced pigs?  In other words, will he undertake that this will not be a levy purely for the purpose of raising funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
