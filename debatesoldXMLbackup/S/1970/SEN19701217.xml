      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) (No. 3) Scheme, 1970, prepared by the Minister for Defence with the consent of the Minister for Finance under sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932 and section 4 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1938, and laid before the House on the 11th day of December, 1970, be confirmed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin) Gerry Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a scheme made pursuant to the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts, 1932 to 1968.  These Acts provide that before a scheme such as this comes into operation it must be confirmed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  Its purpose is to improve the retirement benefits payable under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, 1937 to 1970, and to amend these schemes in other respects.</P>
      <P>Article 5 provides that the special responsibility allowances payable to certain senior officers who hold posts of responsibility and which have not hitherto been reflected in the retired pay of these officers will now be taken into account.  A 20 per cent increase in the normal rate of retired pay is being provided in the case of an officer who retires while holding the appointment of Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General, Quartermaster-General or Assistant Chief of Staff and a 10 per cent increase in the case of an officer who retires while holding the appointment of Officer Commanding a Command. These increases are modelled on a provision in the existing schemes whereby officers of the Army Medical Corps receive a 20 per cent increase in the normal rate of retired pay while other professional officers received a 10 per cent increase.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Article 6 is to bring the schemes into line with other superannuation codes which provide, in addition to pension on retirement, a maximum lump sum of one and a half years pay.  At present the maximum gratuity payable to a married officer represents about 80 per cent of a year's pay.  It can be earned for much shorter service and at a much earlier age than apply to other public servants.  The new provision will provide a maximum gratuity of one and a half years pay in the case of an officer retiring on reaching the prescribed age limit or within two years of it.  There will also be a considerable improvement in the gratuity payable to those who retire within five years of reaching the age limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Article 17 of the principal scheme the retired pay of reserve officers who are called out on full time service is suspended for the duration of <Col N="197" /> that service.  Article 7 revokes this provision and will enable the reserve officers who were called out in August, 1969 and whose retired pay was suspended to receive the retired pay for the period of suspension.</P>
    <P>Article 8 provides that the non-contributory pensions payable under the schemes to the widows and children of officers will not be payable where pensions are payable to widows and children under a contributory scheme which is being introduced for the widows and children of deceased officers.</P>
    <P>Article 9 increases the pension increment of 1s a week payable to a soldier for each year of service over 21 years up to 31 years.  This increment was introduced in 1947 and the increase which varies with the date of discharge, represents the average percentage increase in the pay of the various non-commissioned ranks since that time.  The increase will be payable until the soldier reaches the age of 70 years and becomes eligible for a contributory old age pension or until he becomes otherwise eligible for a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>A gratuity for a married long-service soldier discharged on pension is provided for under Article 10.  The gratuity will be one week's pay for each year of service subject to a maximum of 31 weeks pay.  The pay and allowances of soldiers have recently been consolidated with effect from the 1st June, 1969.  At present a condition for the grant of an additional married pension to a soldier is that marriage allowance be payable to him at the date of discharge. Article 11 makes some consequential changes resulting from consolidation. A married pension will now be payable to a soldier who was in receipt of a married rate of pay at discharge.  It will also be payable to a widower soldier discharged on pension and will be continued in the case of a soldier pensioner whose wife predeceases him after discharge.</P>
    <P>Under the existing schemes only continuous service in the Army Nursing Service is reckonable for pension purposes.  Article 12 removes this requirement <Col N="198" /> in the case of a member of the service who resigns on marriage and is reappointed after being widowed. The service before marriage will now be reckonable and any marriage gratuity paid will be deducted from her pay or from her retirement benefits. Provision is also made for the aggregation of separate periods of service in the special case of a member who resigned for domestic reasons and was later reappointed.</P>

      <P>On the face of it there seems to be no reason why any Member of this House should object to the motion that is being proposed. Regulations in regard to superannuation are in many respects confusing. Regulations in regard to Army service also tend to be confusing.  Therefore when we get regulations in regard to Army pensions they very often are doubly confusing.  It is, I think, really difficult for the Members of the House, on the basis of the regulations themselves, the explanatory memorandum and the Minister's speech, to appreciate and to evaluate precisely what is being done in this regard.  We have no reason to raise objection to it but in the future steps might be taken which would enable us to examine these matters a little more closely.</P>
      <P>In the course of a debate here yesterday, one of our Members indicated that no one was happy about the prospect of armed men in this country not in the uniform of the State but I think if we fail so close to Christmas to have this particular motion here, Members of the House might be worried about armed men wearing the uniform of the State.  I would suggest that while we agree with what is in these regulations, it is hard for us to discharge our duty fully in regard to them.</P>
      <P>We have before us, and the Minister has referred in his speech to the fact that we are dealing with a main scheme prepared in 1937, and an amending scheme some ten years later.  There are, so far as I know, numerous minor amending schemes.  The Minister has not told us how many there are; maybe he got tired counting how many amendments have been made to the Army pension regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> Here I must come to something that has been put in this House to various Ministers in regard to many schemes of this kind namely, a plea for consolidation. I know the Minister and his colleagues have heard this before but I would suggest that in regard to this particular code of Army pensions this is something that should be done.  It may well be that the Minister's own officials are perfectly happy, that they have well-marked copies of the code, but I imagine that many pots of paste have been used in the making of a fully marked up copy of these Army regulations.  Probably a few pairs of scissors have been blunted in snipping out the pieces and putting them together.  I would ask the Minister to consider very seriously producing consolidated regulations of this type.  I do not know how difficult the task might be, but I would suggest that it would be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any place in which we can find most of these regulations in print.  If there is such a printing I suggest that a reference to this effect should have been made in the explanatory memorandum.  I must confess to the fact that I have not undertaken the job of digging back.  I would ask the Minister to consider this, not just to convenience Members of the House but to convenience those who are concerned under the regulations. There is a tendency for employees to know very well the particular regulations that apply to themselves and in all walks of life people tend to know their superannuation code fairly well. Nevertheless, there is a very firm case here for consolidation.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points that I should like to make in regard to the regulations.  It is difficult to discuss this and each of us in a single speech, to us by way of a motion.  We all agreed that this was the proper way, and that it was not necessary that we should have legislation every time we wished to change the regulations, but this new system has its disadvantages.  It means that we have in this one single debate, and each us of in a single speech, to show what is involved in the amendments to the scheme.  There is no opportunity for a Committee Stage discussion <Col N="200" /> which we could have had if these regulations had come forward to us on the basis of a Bill.  We are in the difficulty that we cannot, as we might on a Committee Stage, ask the Minister to give further explanations in regard to individual items and then perhaps to bring forward further supplementary points.  We find ourselves, as I have said, in a real difficulty in probing what is here.  It is necessary, therefore, when we have got questions to ask that we do so in the one speech which we are allowed to make.</P>
    <P>Following through the explanatory memorandum which explains the various articles, we come to Article 5 which provides for retirement pay of officers who hold certain senior appointments in the Army.  In this regard, I should like to ask the Minister if this is a reflection in the pension of certain allowances which are part of their pay while they are holding the office.  I am anxious to know if, in fact, this is what is involved.  If so, I think this is probably fair.  If people hold a position of responsibility and in order to avoid complicating the grading structure of any employment, be it the Army or anything else, occasionally they are made certain allowances but if they carry these allowances for a long number of years then these should be allowed for pension purposes.  Too often an injustice is done to a person if it is decided to grant an allowance rather than have a further grade or make a further promotion.  This is often forgotten when the person comes to retirement and this may be unfair.  It may well be that I am completely misconceiving what is involved in this particular Article but it does seem to me, if I am right in my interpretatiton, that this is a reasonable case.</P>
    <P>In regard to the next few Articles there are no questions that immediately occur to me until we come to Article 8.  I would like the Minister in his reply in regard to this, to explain to the House what is the position, or what will be the position, when these regulations come into force in regard to the widows' and orphans' scheme.  It is noted here in the explanatory memorandum that a contributory scheme is to come into force, and when it comes into force that the widow and children <Col N="201" /> of an officer will not be eligible for the existing pensions.  I should like to ask the Minister what change is involved here.  If there is to be a contributory scheme, does this mean that persons who previously were entitled to certain gratuities on a non-contributory basis now have to contribute to them?  Again, I think we are at a disadvantage here because this is a point one would like to discuss in detail on a Committee Stage.  All I can do now is ask a question and again revert to the fact that if we had a consolidated version of the regulations and perhaps further details in regard to explanation, it would make the debate when it came to the House all that much easier.</P>
    <P>Articles 9 and 10 appear to apply to long service and I do not think any of us will query this.  I think we should do everything we can to increase the incentive towards long service in the Army.  In regard to Article 11 there appears to be a shift in the basis in regard to marriage allowances and we would be glad if the Minister could indulge the House in his reply by perhaps speaking in greater detail of the changes which are being made here. It is not easy for the Members of the House to appreciate it on the face of the regulations themselves or on the single paragraph in the speech which the Minister made at the commencement of this debate.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Army nursing service, we should welcome here the provision that, in the case of a person who re-enters the service after being widowed, this would rank as continuous service and this prompts me to ask a further question.  In these days of international humanitarian activity, I take it there may be instances where members of the Army nursing service may be seconded to work in special international organisations.  I would like to ask the Minister if this has occurred and if, in fact, the policy in his Department is that members of the Army nursing service who wish to be seconded to serve in special agencies under the United Nations&mdash;outside our own United Nations commitments&mdash;are allowed to do so.  If this is not possible under the Army regulations there would be a strong case here for ensuring <Col N="202" /> that the person would be eligible to return to the Army nursing service without affecting pension rights in regard to the service which has been earned in the Army both before and after the break in service.  We see no reason why these changes should not be made.</P>
    <P>In general it is difficult to evaluate the exact changes which have been made in some of these instances.  A more detailed description of some of them from the Minister at the conclusion of this debate might be helpful to us and consolidation of the regulations would be helpful to many people besides ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Motion before the House but like Senator Dooge I am at a disadvantage that this is a Motion and not a Bill.  If it were a Bill we could examine it in depth on Committee Stage but as it is a Motion we have to rely on the Minister being cooperative in trying to explain some of the points about which we feel a little bit perturbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that strikes me as being an anomaly <i>vis-á-vis</i> local authority workers is that Article 9 increases the pension increment of 1s per week payable to a soldier for each year of service over 21 years up to 31 years.  This increment was introduced in 1947 and the increase which varies with the date of discharge, represents the average percentage increase in the pay of the various non-commissioned ranks since that time.  The Minister stated that the increase will be payable until the soldier reaches the age of 70 years and becomes eligible for a contributory old age pension or until he becomes otherwise eligible for a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  That means that his Army pension ceases when he becomes 70 years of age and he will then qualify for the contributory old age pension.  If that is the case there is a grave anomaly here inasmuch as a council worker who pays superannuation and who retires on pension can draw his pension and contributory old age pension when he reaches the age of 70 years.  If that is the case there is not much incentive for a man to adopt the Army as a career. <Col N="203" /> I would be grateful if the Minister, in his reply, would clarify that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the other speakers in welcoming this motion.  I wish to express regret that we have not had an opportunity of studying the matter in greater depth, due to the manner in which it is being dealt with.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one or two questions arising out of the scheme.  The House, to a great extent, has to take this at its face value.  It appears to represent a considerable improvement on existing schemes, but as we have not got the existing schemes we must assume that what the Minister said in his introductory statement is correct in all detail.  I should like to ask the Minister why there is a differentiation between the increases awarded to officers who retire while holding the appointment of Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General, Quartermaster-General or Assistant Chief of Staff, in which case they get an increase of 20 per cent of the normal rate of retired pay and the increases awarded in the case of an officer who retires when holding an appointment of Commanding Officer, which is only 10 per cent. There may be some very good reason for this differentiation and I should like to know what it is.  I should also like the Minister to give us some idea how this scheme compares with similar schemes in other State services.  I assume that the Army have no opportunity of considering these schemes before they are put into effect, that there is no body such as the Garda Representative Body who can negotiate on behalf of the Gardaí. Perhaps it is a good thing, but I do not know.  The only method by which a soldier can agree or disagree on the terms of his appointment is apparently after the terms are made.  We rely on the loyalty and the patriotism of our force and there is a serious obligation on us in the Houses of the Oireachtas and on the Minister for Defence to make the terms of appointment for a career in the Army as attractive as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some criticism in recent years that the rate of recruitment <Col N="204" /> in the Army has fallen off and for this reason the Minister should be complimented on improving the terms of the pension scheme.  The new Minister has an opportunity to throw aside some of the inhibitions which bound his predecessors.  He should look even more closely into the terms under which our Army operates at the present time.  The Army should be made attractive to young men.  It should comprise a career that would be satisfying to an individual and also of benefit to his country.</P>
    <P>One section of the Defence Forces which was not mentioned in this scheme is the FCA, which is the second line of defence.  I do not know if the Minister has it in mind to do anything for this force which is largely a voluntary one, but it is an essential part of our Defence Forces.  The House would wish that the Minister would be equally generous in dealing with this section of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I can recall the days of the LDF from 1940 to 1945 when the treatment meted out to that voluntary force was anything but an encouragement to them.  I can remember in 1945 when both the LDF and the LSF were left more or less in a situation of suspense while the then Minister was making up his mind if the force should be disbanded long after Germany had capitulated. If we are to have a defence force, then every facet should receive comparable treatment.</P>
    <P>I should like again to congratulate the Minister for showing commendable enterprise and I hope that this is just a small example of other improvements in our Defence Forces which he intends to bring into effect.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Cosanta. Ní dóigh liom go raibh sé sa Tigh linn cheana.  Mar a dúirt cuid des na Seanadóirí eile níl sé fuiriste na hActaí seo a leanúint.  Dá mbeadh sceideal pinsiúin de shórt éigin leagaithe amach in einfheacht leis an doiciméid seo, bheadh sé níos éascaí ar fad.  B'fhéidir nach mbíonn an t-am againn ceisteanna mar seo do scrd½.  Tá sé soiléir ar ndóigh go dtabharfadh aon duine againn ar aon taobh den Tighe gurbh <Col N="205" /> i bfhabhar go gcuireann aon duine againn fáilte roimh aon ní a chuireann feabhas ar mar a níochtar muintir an Airm as a seirbhís.  Tá sé fuiriste alt 12 a thuigsint.  Níl aon deacracht ann agus molaim é.  Ní thuigim é go ró-shoiléir mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Mac Gearailt alt a naoi.  Fé mar a thuigim é tá na costaisí áireacas á íoc fé láthair ag an Arm nó ag an Aire.  Sé sin costaisí an &ldquo;Superannuation&rdquo; ach má tá, tá sé tuilte ag gach aon saighdúir.  Dá bhrí sin ní thuigim cad na thaobh go mba chóir é a ghearradh sa pinsin a bhaineas leis an méadúchán de scilling sa tseachtain nuair a sroiseann an saighdúir 70 blian d'aois.  Dá mbeadh sé ag díol a chostasaí féin, ní dóigh liom go mbeadh an rún so cóir ach bfhéidir go bhfuil sé ceart ins na coinníolacha atá ann fén arm ach bfhéidir go bhféadfadh an tAire a rá cad a chosnóidh sé mar a mbeadh an coinníoll seo ann go ngearrfar an méadú pinsean seo nuair a sroiseann an saighdúir 70 blian d'aois.</P>
      <P>Maidir le na h-altannaí eile sa scéim go dtuigim iad cuirim fáilte rompa, ach fé mar a dúras b'fhusa i bhfad dá mbeadh sceideal de shórt éigin go bhféadfaidh duine a thuigsint na rithraithe atá le teacht.

Tá ard-mheas ag gach aoinne air mar Aire.  Tá ard mheas air, ach go háirithe, ag oifigigh agus fir an Airm agus is maith an tuar é sin don am atá le teacht.</P>
      <P>Having welcomed the Minister to the House and having commended his work and his deep interest in the Army, both officers and men, I may say that the Army has well served the Irish people.  The Army has as fine a body of men as are to be found in any country in the world and this applies in the case of officers and men of all ranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> People are beginning to understand that there is more to a soldier's profession than shooting people.  That is as it should be, because the Christian tradition should be that a soldier's first duty is to help the weak and those who are in need of help and to fight evil. These were the principles of the knights in the time of chivalry and these characteristics were to be found in our Army long ago&mdash;I refer to the legendary Fianna.</P>
    <P>Lest I digress too far, I will come back at once to these regulations which, at least in a small way, help to make the Army a more attractive profession. The Army should be made as attractive as possible.  Our Army is of a very high standard and that standard should be maintained.  At home and, maybe, in a particular way, abroad, our Army are the best ambassadors we have.  In a great part of Europe I have heard our forces praised highly for their conduct and bearing, their Christian outlook and their deep interest in promoting peace between warring factions in Cyprus and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I agree with those Senators who spoke of the difficulty in understanding the various regulations and amendments. The same applies to many other Departments.  The ideal solution would be to publish a revised edition of these regulations from time to time, say every couple of years.  That would enable people to study these matters and have a better understanding of them.</P>
    <P>Again in regard to the soldier's responsibilities, his duties and training, the wider training a soldier can get, not alone in the spheres of war, self-defence <i>et cetera</i>, but in such fields as social activity, language and culture, economics, human relations, modern history, the better.  In the world of today we require men of common sense. Many of the world's problems arise from the fact that we have so many specialists.  The man of wide interests is the man who will command respect and make the world a better place in which to live.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his great enterprise since he has become Minister for Defence and I am sure this is just a small example of what he intends <Col N="207" /> to do and we wish him every good luck in his career.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Cranitch said, we have many experts in the world today.  I do not profess to be an expert in any field, certainly not in the rather complicated field of Army pension schemes.  I should like to join with those Members of the House who welcomed the Minister here today.  It is the first time he has come to this House as Minister for Defence and I should like to welcome him.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I do not exactly see my way to endorsing the gratuitous compliments being paid to the Minister for having introduced this scheme since he became Minister.  This scheme, I understand, has been a long time in the melting pot, a long time being awaited by members of the Defence Forces, and it is long overdue.  They have the normal grievances that so many people have in the public service. In the matter of pensions and, from time to time, pay awards, they feel that the public sector, or parts of it, are one of the last to be treated. But in relation to the Defence Forces there is some difference.  Other people in the public sector have representative bodies of one type or another to negotiate and make strong representations on their behalf and to make their views as a collective body publicly known.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have no such organisation and they must consequently await the Minister's pleasure. When he is replying, perhaps the Minister could enlighten us a little bit on this: they have been awaiting the Minister's pleasure for much longer than the present Minister has been in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the scheme at last and the Minister might be good enough to tell the House when he envisages that it will actually be put into operation, or whether parts of it have more or less been arranged, or many already be in operation.  My particular reason for asking that is that I know one particular pay award given to one section of the Defence Forces, in common with the rest of the country, has not yet been awarded to Army nurses.  They <Col N="208" /> have not got the salary and status that nurses throughout the rest of the country got some months ago.  I hope that the passing of this motion by this House will ensure that there will be a speedy implementation of the provisions in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Article 5 which provides that certain people holding special responsible positions would receive a percentage increase in their retirement pay, I presume as a mark of recognition for the positions they had held.  In this regard I wonder if there might not have been, say, some recognition of certain senior NCOs who hold positions of responsibility also in the Army, over and above the ordinary duties which an NCO might be expected to carry out.  Would there also be a special responsibility percentage increase awarded to them?</P>
    <P>With reference to Article 9 in relation to increasing the increment of 1s a week, payable to a soldier for each year of service over 21 years up to 31 years, it is of interest but, as all the speakers have pointed out, these are very complicated regulations.  The Minister tells us that the 1s a week increment is being changed.  Could he say to what it is being changed?  Could he give us an idea what a soldier retiring now would receive by way of pension; and what a soldier retiring next week&mdash;by which time I hope the Minister will have the scheme in operation&mdash;with the same length of service, would then receive?</P>
    <P>Finally, would the Minister be good enough to enlighten us as to how our military pensions generally compare with military pensions which are awarded and in operation in other countries?</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch very rightly commended the high reputation which our Army has gained for itself and for the country abroad but I am afraid it did not gain it on the strength of the money it had in its pocket.  We have all read stories of how badly paid Irishmen were in comparison with men from other countries with whom they were serving abroad.  It might be interesting to have a comparison of our pension scheme with those of other countries in this field.  The scheme is to be welcomed <Col N="209" /> but it is one that has been long awaited.  The Members of the House have a duty to point out that the Defence Forces are the only part of the public sector who do not have some representative body to negotiate for them and to publicise their case.  Therefore there is an onus on every Member of the House of the Oireachtas to see to it that the scheme is examined as carefully as possible and to urge the Minister, who has good intentions in this regard, to ensure that on any future occasion increases of this type are not left outstanding for such a long time.</P>

      <P>I shall not detain the House very long.  I just want to add my voice to the sentiments expressed by the previous Senators.  I welcome any improvements which can be made by the Minister and the Department in the working conditions of our Defence Forces.  We all realise the importance of having a Defence Force and therefore the necessity for having a contented force determined to serve the nation and the people.  From time to time members of the force have their problems, which they always seem to have difficulty in airing.  I have no doubt that, as time goes on, they will find machinery which will be acceptable to them and to the Government for the purpose of airing their grievances. I welcome the new provisions in this Bill and I join with the previous speakers in endorsing this Motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to express my appreciation of the very kind reception I received from the House on my first visit here today.  As well, I must convey my thanks to the contributors for the useful points they raised.  I shall endeavour to give as much information as possible.  Some criticism has been made about the manner in which this scheme has been brought before the House, and I note that comment. Senator Dooge referred to the necessity for consolidation of pension schemes.  I can assure him that we are working on consolidation and we agree that it must come.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge also referred to the increase in the retired pay of certain senior officers, that is, the Chief of Staff, Quartermaster-General and so on.  These increases are given as a recognition of their higher degree of responsibility.  We think it is a justifiable increase and one that ought to be given.</P>
      <P>A contributory pension scheme for widows and orphans has been introduced for the civil service and is now being introduced for Army officers.  It means that widows and children of officers will get higher pensions under the new scheme than under the noncontributory scheme which was in operation before now.  This was also mentioned by Professor Dooge.</P>
      <P>The question of the Army nursing service was also raised by Senator Dooge and in this connection all I can say is that we have no experience of nurses being seconded to other services and the point has not arisen.  It will be considered if it does arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald raised the question of the reduction of a soldier's pension on payment of the old age pension at age 70 years.  All serving Army men are covered under the Social Welfare Acts and qualify for contributory old age pensions.  These pensions are paid for by the State as well as by the men <Col N="211" /> themselves and, on attainment of the age of 70, when the contributory old age pension comes into effect, any increments of pension payable under the new scheme will cease to be payable. This is in line with general principle.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that some NCOs should qualify for a higher rate of gratuity in view of the higher gratuity being given to senior officers.  The fact is that NCOs get a higher pension and gratuity than the lower ranks and in this way their extra responsibility is fully recognised.</P>
    <P>The question of changes in the payment for married personnel has been raised.  Under the existing scheme, a condition for the grant of an additional married pension to a soldier is that marriage allowance be payable to him at the date of discharge.  With effect from 1st June, 1969, marriage allowance has been incorporated in a married rate of pay.  As from that date a married pension will be payable to a soldier who is in receipt of a married rate of pay at date of discharge.  It will also be payable to a widower soldier discharged on pension and will be continued in the case of a soldier pensioner whose wife dies.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland inquired as to when the payments are likely to be made.  I can assure him that gratuity cheques will be issued this side of Christmas. The question of military participation in pay and pension negotiations was also raised.  I should like to clear up this point by saying that military representatives were at the negotiations on pensions.  On the question of the FCA I would point out that the scheme refers to the Permanent Defence Force only and therefore the FCA were not taken into account.</P>
    <P>I hope I have touched on the points raised by the various speakers.  It is evident that the scheme is being well received.  I feel a deep responsibility towards our armed forces and it would be my intention to endeavour to secure better pay and better pensions for them.  I should like to take this opportunity of commenting on the performance and conduct of our military personnel both here and in foreign parts. Our men are setting a headline for the <Col N="212" /> world in the performance of their peace-keeping duties in Cyprus.  I am very proud of our Army and I can assure the House that I shall endeavour to continue the improvement of their conditions at all levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Minister that he was asked if he could enlighten the House as to what is the present scale of pensions payable to a soldier, as referred to in Article 9, and what difference the increase will make? I know it does not arise directly out of the scheme.  There was also reference to the long-outstanding pay awards to Army nurses.  Perhaps the Minister would let us have this information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Article 9 a soldier discharged on or after 1st January, 1971, with 31 years service will become eligible for a total increment of pension of £3 5s a week instead of the present 10s.  It will be calculated by multiplying 5s 6d by ten plus the present 10s&mdash;£3 5s as against 10s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give a few examples.

A married private with 31 years service will be eligible for a pension of £11 3s 3d a week and a gratuity of £689 15s.  A married sergeant with 21 years service will be eligible for a pension of £9 1s a week and a gratuity of £554 8s.  A married sergeant with 31 years service will be eligible for a pension of £12 6s a week and a gratuity of £818 8s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister said in his reply that this scheme <Col N="213" /> refers only to the Permanent Defence Force.  Does he contemplate introducing any scheme in regard to the giving of gratuities to members of the FCA who have served an agreed number of years?  I appreciate that they possibly could not qualify for pension for obvious reasons, but surely a gratuity would be only fair recognition of their services after a period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of gratuities for the FCA was not considered. This scheme has to do with the Permanent Defence Force only.  I shall certainly be most sympathetic towards any proposals to better the annual grant for FCA personnel.  It was not considered in connection with this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  Could I just ask one more question?  I did raise the question of the percentage increase in the case of certain senior officers as compared to the low rate of increase for the more junior officers.  I appreciate the Minister's reply.  I think he was. referring to my point in saying that senior officers, having regard to their greater responsibility, would be entitled to a higher rate of pension.  The point I was trying to make was this: I presume there are existing differentials in the pension scheme but to give a 20 per cent increase to the officer getting the higher rate of pension while giving only 10 per cent to those in receipt of the lower rate of pension will result in further increasing the differential between the senior and the junior officers.  Is that the Minister's intention? In other words if there already exists a difference of say £3 a week between, for example, the Chief of Staff and an Officer Commanding a Command, if the senior man gets a 20 per cent increase and the less senior man 10 per cent, the differential is increased even further.  Does the Minister follow what I am trying to say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, yes.  Up to now certain senior officers including the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General have got the same pension as the ordinary line colonel even though they have a responsibility allowance which a line colonel does not have.  Until now they got the same <Col N="214" /> rate of pension but in future it is proposed to increase the normal rate of retired pay so as to reflect the rates of responsibility allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 37, to add &ldquo;whenever such certificate is issued or made&rdquo; after &ldquo;made&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment because I thought it was necessary for clarification. The intent is that the certificate may be issued after 15th February.  I was prompted to do this because during the course of the debate yesterday, when the Minister was well represented by the Parliamentary Secretary, there was a confusion in the House as to whether or not this certificate had to be given before 15th February, 1971, Decimal Day, or could be given after it.  If there is any doubt that the intention is that it should be open to a banker to give the certificate afterwards, then I think words of this kind should be inserted by way of amendment to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would argue that considerable difficulty will arise if the certificate cannot be issued after 15th February, 1971.  There are a host of contingencies, natural and human, which may make it impossible to get some of these <Col N="215" /> instruments into the hands of bankers in time for bankers to give the certificates which would be required under the section to render valid these documents which would have been invalid under subsection (1) of section 2.  I cannot list all the different contingencies but one can conceive of strikes, lock-outs, fires, traffic breakdowns, obtuseness, even negligence, people being unaware of their obligations, people who are responsible to others failing to discharge their obligations and being thereby themselves rendered liable to the persons whose paper is now worthless because they did not in fact have the bills or promissory notes certified by the banker.</P>
    <P>I was thinking also in relation to these documents that there are cases&mdash; and Senator Nash mentioned such in the course of the Committee Stage&mdash; where the promissory note is not in fact a matter between a banker and anybody, where in fact it is held by the debtor and is encashed on whatever date it is due for encashment, where there may be great doubt as to when this promissory note was made, where the doubt can only be put out of existence by going to the banker and getting the certificate which is required.</P>
    <P>I therefore recommend this amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say first of all that it seems from the terms of the section, and I am so advised by the legal adviser, that there is no restriction in the section as regards the date at which the banker's certificate can be given.  If there was any confusion in this regard on an earlier stage, Senators will understand, of course, that not having been present then, I cannot comment with accuracy on that, but on the basis of what Senator Alexis FitzGerald has said I assume that a certain amount of confusion may have arisen.  If that is so, it may have been due to some reference to the intention that a great deal of publicity will be given to what is involved here and to the belief that the vast majority of post-dated cheques or promissory notes would have been certified by bankers before Decimal Day.  But the section does not preclude <Col N="216" /> such certification after Decimal Day. In such cases where it has not been done before that day, then the people concerned will have to find some other way to satisfy the banker that the cheque or promissory note was drawn before Decimal Day.</P>
      <P>The amendment does not add in fact to the section and, on one reading of it, it could indeed be thought to cloud the meaning of the section slightly. Since it does not add anything to it I do not think there is any point in putting it in.  The important point is that it should be stated quite clearly that the section does not preclude the certification of post-dated cheques after Decimal Day.  This, I think, is what Senator Alexis FitzGerald wants to establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this section yesterday with Senator Alexis FitzGerald and there was, as the Minister has said, some confusion in regard to the certification of a cheque drawn before the 15th February but payable at a subsequent date.  Not disturbing what the Minister has said, I wonder if he would agree to accept some amendment on the lines suggested by Senator Alexis FitzGerald to illustrate beyond any doubt that a certification after the 15th February, or whenever made, would be valid.  There certainly was doubt created yesterday in the minds of the Senators present when the discussion took place and I think it would relieve those doubts and put this beyond any doubt in regard to the general public, particularly the commercial community, that a certificate subsequent to the 15th February would be valid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to support this amendment.  In a very full informal discussion here yesterday this question was widely discussed and I feel that the case put up by Senator Alexis FitzGerald is a very reasonable one.  I feel that the Minister has an obligation to ensure that a large section of the public will not be inconvenienced in this way.  Is it not better to provide for it now rather than find people knocked about in a few months time?  Surely the public have had sufficient trouble with their monetary and banking system this year without a few <Col N="217" /> getting into difficulties next year over something that can be rectified and put beyond reasonable doubt at this stage?</P>

There is nothing in that about the date on which this is to happen.  Consequently, I cannot accept the amendment because I think it might make the section less clear in its meaning than it is now.  On examination I think it is quite clear that the point which Senator Alexis FitzGerald wanted to get across does come across.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2 to insert after line 37 the following subsections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  A banker who issues a certificate pursuant to subsection (3) shall not be liable in damages to any person unless it be proven that the certificate was issued in wilful default.</P>
      <P>(5)  Any person who makes payment of any sum to the holder in due course of a bill of exchange or promissory note which is rendered invalid by subsection (1) shall not be liable to the repayment of such sum or damages to any person because of such invalidity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> (6)  Notwithstanding subsection (1), any bill of exchange or promissory note dated not earlier than the 15th November, 1970 shall be valid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put this down in recognition of the fact that where anyone does make a payment to anybody who is entitled to receive a payment in respect of a bill of exchange or promissory note which is rendered invalid, if my view of the law is correct, the drawer of the instrument will be entitled to look for damages in respect of payment.  I know that the intentions of the banks are not to press this section, to use it to educate their customers in the importance of drawing the documents in proper order in the new currency but if someone does bring into existence a bill of exchange which is put in £sd currency, and then a payment is made by a banker in respect of that instrument, I cannot see how that person or someone who has held ownership of the bill can be prevented from recovering damages from the banker who made the payment in respect of an invalid instrument.  I want to protect the banker and anyone who chooses to recognise an £sd cheque as in order on any loss he might suffer through innocent payments made to anyone in relation to this.  I also want to encourage bankers to issue certificates in certain circumstances.  Legal people present will know that there is a major development in the law of negligence now and I want to cite the famous Hedley Byrne case, which in fact has been followed by the High Court.  This renders anybody, irrespective of whether he owes a duty to someone, liable in negligence if he does something which damages another person. There is no longer any necessity for the banker to be responsible to the customer.  He is liable in negligence not only to his own customer but if he does something which damages someone else, even if he has no knowledge of the existence of that other person, the banker is liable to that other person.</P>
    <P>Bankers are at this moment obviously an anomaly.  I am not on the Irish Banks Standing Committee, so anything I say is fraught with great danger.  Notwithstanding that I shall say it.  Obviously the banks are now <Col N="219" /> very much concerned with trying to get a coming-off day so that their accounts get turned into decimal currency on 15th February, 1971.  It is very easy for them now to say: &ldquo;Of course we are not going to dishonour cheques; we are going to pay them&rdquo;, and try to encourage people to draw them correctly. That is all very well, but some bank advisory is going to say to them at some stage: &ldquo;If you do that, you will be in trouble&rdquo;.  After the 15th February they are going to get tighter and tighter about issuing certificates.  I want to encourage them so that they will have a section which will say: &ldquo;We cannot be liable even if we do certify this to be in order and to have been drawn up to date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to subsection (6) which I propose should be inserted, this is for consideration merely.  It is not a particularly well thought upon subsection, in my point of view; it simply recognises the fact that ordinary cheques are drawn and are honoured but do not get lodged until perhaps three months after they are drawn.  This is to recognise that all these cheques, no matter when they are drawn or made&mdash;even if drawn or made next February&mdash;that they are all right if they go back to 15th November or after that date.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister seriously to consider what Senator FitzGerald has said.  I think the Senator has made a valid point and I could see the possibility that the banks would be taking risks, having regard particularly to the present development in the law of negligence.  I can see the banks would be taking risks.  I can see this particularly where a cheque is issued to A, endorsed by A to B, by B to C, and is lodged in the bank by C.  I do think that where there are <i>bona fide</i> mistakes every possible encouragement should be given to the banks to honour <Col N="220" /> the cheques in the circumstances and a point may arise when banks will be advised by their legal advisers that it is rather dangerous to adopt the course suggested, even though you promise the Government that you will do so.</P>

      <P>The people who are mainly concerned and for whom the amendments would provide the greatest protection are the banks.  They are not exclusively the people concerned but it is quite clear they are by far the majority of the people who will be concerned.  They are satisfied with the Bill.  As regards the point which the Senator had in mind in relation to subsection (3) this was adverted to in the drafting of the Bill and the view expressed by the draftsman is that the use of the word &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; in subsection (3)&mdash;&ldquo;shall be deemed to have been drawn or made before 15th February&rdquo;&mdash;is sufficient protection for the banks.  I also understand that the banks have adverted to this position and are satisfied that this is so, that they will be adequately protected by reason of the use of that word &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; in subsection (3).  This being so, it does not seem to me that the amendment of that subsection is necessary.  In view of the circumstances that we cannot discuss this backwards and forwards, as perhaps we could on Committee Stage, I want to say that I am not disputing the point raised by Senator FitzGerald and Senator Nash as to the consequences which could arise if there were not protection for bankers who certify.  I am advised there is protection in subsection (3) and that the banks accept that they have that protection.  I do not think the amendments are necessary.</P>

      <P>This is a matter for the House to decide.  I should like to ask the Minister if it <Col N="221" /> would inconvenience him.  Is it agreed to discuss amendments Nos. 3 and 4 together?  Are separate decisions required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  I would like to draw the attention of the House first to amendment No. 4 to section 14.  I am very concerned with the language used in section 14.  I have searched for a precedent for the words used &ldquo;writings of a formal legal kind.&rdquo; I could not find a precedent for them. Therefore, it is fitting to interpret them according to their natural meaning. These words suggest something that is thrown into a form which would be prepared by a lawyer.  Even if the document in question is not prepared by a lawyer, in practice, it seems to me extremely desirable that it is made perfectly clear by this section that any agreement which at this moment is being entered into by persons would be enforceable at law as a contract giving rise to rightful obligations even if after 15th February, it is expressed by ordinary people in the kind of currency that they have been dealing with all their lives, should be as valid as any instrument of a formal legal kind.</P>
      <P>We all know in this House that we spend our lives making contracts without knowing that we are doing so. Every time we go in and put down 2s to buy whatever one can buy with 2s, we are making a contract.  In fact, quite a substantial amount of business is done by telephone and gives rise to enforceable obligations.  These transactions&mdash;the sort of case I thought of yesterday in particular of somebody who might buy a whole standing crop of timber on the basis of so many shillings and pence per whatever the standard unit of purchase might be&mdash; are going to continue to be made in £sd.  There is no doubt about that.  We cannot teach old dogs new tricks.  This will continue for another ten or 15 years and whatever they may do when it comes to writing cheques&mdash;they are easily enough trained into that&mdash; whenever they meet the final score of what they have got to pay, the deal will be done in £sd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not absolutely clear to me that there is any necessity whatever for <Col N="222" /> section 14.  The fact that it is thought that it is necessary to save instruments from being rendered invalid by this Bill suggests powerfully to me that there must be good reason to save other transactions which could not, under any circumstances, be called instruments. Correspondence between solicitors or correspondence between businessmen, ordinary exchange of letters, could not be called, by any stretch of the imagination, instruments of a formal legal kind because they would not in fact be such and are very often designed not to be such.  Good business people do business together over years on the basis that they do not set a thing out in such a way that it would be too formal.  They do not like their relationship to be put on that kind of level.  I want it to be such, however, that the rights and obligations of the party are clear.  If section 14 is necessary to save instruments, section 14 should also be extended to save any contract, whether oral or written, whether informal or formal.</P>
    <P>I should now like to draw the Minister's attention to section 4.  As I understand section 4 it is to help in the interpretation of cheques and other documents that are listed in subsection (3) so that there is an automatic conversion and everybody knows that if it is written in £sd it is automatically converted and we do not have this bothersome recurring decimal about which we had a discussion at one stage &mdash;the 333 has gone.  If we write into a legacy, a war loan or something of that kind in a will: &ldquo;I leave my £2,113 19s 3d worth of war loan&rdquo; that is automatically converted by reference to this table too.  Or if there is somebody who leaves an indefinite share in a residue which works out at £sd that is automatically converted too.  I do not wish to press subsection (3) as much as I wish to press subsection (4).  If subsection (3) is necessary to convert these odd items, we could get rid of a lot of the vagueness that may arise in the interpretation of contracts and the interpretation of wills if we have an automatic conversion by reference to this table.  This table is an excellent device, if I may say so, and I think if it applied to these documents or contracts it will remove the possibility of <Col N="223" /> somebody being put in a tight corner. We do not have to be too bright to realise that people in tight corners can put up very technical defences and one of the grounds on which a contract can be rendered void is vagueness.  I do not know that some bright lawyer is not going to come along and argue that some contract is unenforceable because there was not an automatic conversion from £sd into decimals and maybe some benighted judge will hold in favour of the person putting up this odious defence.  I would like to know what is wrong with making the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator FitzGerald on this amendment. This section&mdash;I refer specifically to section 14 which was the subject of quite a lot of discussion when we considered the Bill on the Committee Stage&mdash;must be taken in conjunction with section 2. In fact reference is made to the section in section 2 and, as I understand it, section 14 sets out the instruments which shall be regarded as not being invalid after D-Day.  All other instruments are invalid as provided for in section 2 (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Senator for a moment?  He may be mistaken on that.  This refers to the appointed day at the end of the changeover period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall read the section. Section 14 (1) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>Save as provided for by section 2 of this Act, no instrument shall be regarded as being invalid because of its containing a reference to an amount of money in the old currency.</P>
      <P>Section 2 states quite specifically why certain instruments are invalid after D-Day.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But then there is subsection (2) of section 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. The point I was making is therefore that the only documents or instruments which are not invalid are those that are set out in section 14, subclause (b).  Is that correct?  This point <Col N="224" /> was raised with the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary and he said that the word &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; was sufficiently omnibus to include contracts or contractual agreements of any kind.  I specifically raise the point in regard to contracts because, as the Minister himself is no doubt aware as are other Members of the House, contracts are quite a normal method of doing business. A contract may be made perhaps months in advance of the actual transaction taking place and if, by any chance, the words &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; or other writings of a formal legal kind do not specifically include any type of contractual documents, the contract could be declared invalid.  That is why I support Senator Alexis FitzGerald. I do not think it will detract from the subsection.  In fact it will put beyond any doubt whatever that this section includes anything that relates to a contract or agreement or a document of any kind, not necessarily a formal legal document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 2 cheques in the form of decimal currency are invalid if drawn in £sd after what we call D-Day or a specific date.  That is primarily the intention of the Bill.  It is also the intention of the Bill that no other documents or contractual relations created after D-Day shall be invalid because they mention the words pounds, shillings and pence.  That is my understanding of the Bill.  Section 14 goes on to say &ldquo;save as provided for by section 2 of this Act no instrument shall be regarded as being invalid because of its containing a reference to an amount of money in the old currency&rdquo;. We have now a definition of the word &ldquo;instrument&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instrument is deemed to mean anything whatsoever creating rights or obligations other than a cheque or a promissory note.  Therefore, if the definition of instrument is wide enough to include those then it is fine.  It goes on in subclause (b) to define what is meant by &ldquo;instrument&rdquo;.  Under this subclause &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; includes wills, documents and all other writing of a formal legal kind.  The introduction of the words &ldquo;of a formal legal kind&rdquo; there confines it to a specific class. Those words &ldquo;of a formal legal kind&rdquo;<Col N="225" /> would not cover the whole lot.  They would not cover a situation such as that mentioned by Senator FitzGerald.  The timber is sold by the cube as they call it in the terms of those who deal with timber of that nature.  Sometimes it is sold by the standard.  The cost is 5s 3d per cube or 18s 10d per standard as the case may be.  Neither would it cover a contract created by letters.  In setting a bog or a meadow, for instance, so much might be paid per perch.  It is most important that the word &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; should be defined as broadly as possible.  I raised this point on the Second Reading.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not agree with me.  He seemed to think the word &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; would cover everything, but in my view it is specifically confined to documents of a formal legal kind, and all other items of a formal legal kind.  If the Minister and his advisers are satisfied to the contrary, I accept this.  I think they should come to a decision on this and I have the gravest doubts as to how they will decide ultimately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could, perhaps, in dealing with this point try to outline something before I go into detail, section 2 provides for bills of exchange or promissory notes being invalid if drawn in £sd after Decimal Day.  This provision is there to enable the banking system to handle the whole operation of a multitude of financial transactions that they could not handle if they were dealing with both currencies at the one time.  Apart from those documents, there will then be a transitional period and subsection (2) of section 14 which relates to instruments, including wills, documents and all other writings of a formal legal kind, will operate only at the conclusion of the changeover period on the appointed day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of this discussion Senators do not seem to have adverted to section 13 which is the general provision covering normal contracts and business transactions, certainly the kinds that Senator FitzGerald had in mind which might be concluded over the telephone or by an exchange of letters.  Section 13 provides that in those cases there will be conversion in accordance with the Schedule of the <Col N="226" /> Bill.  It could be argued perhaps that section 14 is not necessary at all because of the provisions of section 13, but primarily what were in mind in section 14 were documents such as wills.  There are other things covered as Senators will see.  Wills were one of the principal categories that were in mind because they can lead to rather difficult litigation on occasions and it was thought wise to specify particularly in regard to wills and other formal legal documents that they would not be deemed to be invalid because of containing a reference to an amount of money in the old currency.  Section 14 is primarily aimed at clarifying and removing any doubts that might exist.</P>
    <P>With regard to the kinds of informal communications, whether they be written or oral, to which Senator FitzGerald referred, section 13 is quite adequate to cover them after the changeover period. Formal contracts and so on will, of course, come under section 14.  It will preserve their validity if written in £sd. I suggest to the House that these two sections cover the various problems which Senators had in mind and consequently the amendment proposed to page 7, line 5 to insert &ldquo;or contract&rdquo; after &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; is not necessary. With regard to the other amendment, I think it is amendment No. 3, I would say in relation to section 4 the purpose is to provide a standard method of conversion for cheques and similar documents which are drawn before Decimal Day in £sd and which are not paid into a bank until Decimal Day or later. The section in this case takes effect as from Decimal Day.  I would suggest to the House that contracts would be out of place in this section because a contract is not the medium by which a payment is effected.  If Senators will look at the various items listed in that section they will see that each of the references is to a medium by which payment is effected.  Contracts are covered in section 14.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should mention about this particular amendment and that is that if accepted it could lead to difficulties in specific cases.  It is obvious that different methods of conversion and different degrees of precision may be appropriate for different types of references.  For example, if an <Col N="227" /> £sd reference is a price per unit to be applied to bulk purchases, then a fairly precise conversion of the units price would be necessary.  If such a unit price were to be converted by the whole new penny conversion table as would be the case under the proposed amendment, the conversion difference per unit would be multiplied perhaps many thousands of times in the course of calculation of the amount to be paid.  I understand that in many cases parties to contracts have already agreed on methods of conversion.</P>
    <P>However, pending agreement between parties to arrange otherwise, all calculations under £sd contracts can always be done in £sd leaving only the final result which is the actual amount for payment to be converted to decimal terms.  In this case the actual difference would be minimal.  This conversion for the amount of payment is covered by the provisions of the Bill in sections 6 and 13 which prescribe how £sd amounts for actual payment can be discharged during the changeover period and after the changeover period. Therefore, this particular amendment as I say could lead to great difficulty in certain contracts.  I think it is clear that in the case of, as I said, a contract on the basis of a price per unit where you have many thousands of units, the conversion in that case should take place on the final amount due, not on each unit.  That is one thing that was not adverted to by the Senator.  I would submit to the House in any event that, for the other reasons I have given, the two amendments are not necessary and that the difficulties adverted to by the Senator are in fact covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point which was made very well with regard to substituting this table in relation to bulk transactions. It could have obviously a distorting effect.  I also take his point about section 13 but I would remind the House and the Minister I did say that my view of the Bill as it stands was that there was no necessity for section 14. That was my view but section 14 is there.  If we dropped section 14 I would be quite happy but section 14 immediately <Col N="228" /> raises a doubt as to the transactions which it does not cover.  It declares those instruments which are not to be regarded as invalid and immediately raises the question of the validity of instruments which are not defined or transactions which are not within the definition of &ldquo;instrument&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to impress on the Minister the reason why the insertion of the words &ldquo;or contract&rdquo; cannot possibly disimprove section 14.  I know it would disimprove the Minister's day and dis-improve the business the Government must transact today in that trying to find what the intentions are in regard to the other House means that you have to go back to that House, if the Minister is disposed to accept this amendment, to get it accepted by the Dáil.  But I would ask the Minister to tell me in what way the insertion of the words &ldquo;or contract&rdquo; can possibly damage the section.  I ask the Minister to open his mind to the proposition that section 14 as it stands raises questions about the validity of transactions which are not within the definition of &ldquo;instrument&rdquo;. I am pressing the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might just informally put a question to Senator FitzGerald. Do I understand his contention correctly that he is saying that because of the existence of section 14 which describes certain formal documents as being valid, there is therefore an implication that other agreements not coming under section 14 are invalid? Could I suggest to the Senator that since section 14 refers to an instrument as including wills, documents and all other items of a formal legal kind, it does not carry the implication that documents which are not of a formal legal kind and are therefore in a separate category, are invalid.  If I understand the Senator correctly that is his basic objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly my point.  There is this implication that any agreement enforceable at law and entered into between parties which does not come within the definition of &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; there, is not valid.  If section 14 did not exist I would be content that this argument could not successfully be offered.  The Legislature <Col N="229" /> will be deemed to have come in to save legal transactions of a particular kind&mdash;these are transactions which fall within the definition of &ldquo;instrument&rdquo;&mdash;and was not concerned to save transactions that do not fall within the definition of &ldquo;instrument&rdquo;. That is why I am pressing the Minister on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator suggesting that agreements which are not of a formal legal kind come into the same category as those which are of a formal legal kind?  I think this is inherent in his argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that they ought to but under the terms of section 14 they do not, and if those of a formal legal kind are saved by section 14, I can see someone arguing in the High Court or the Supreme Court that the others are not therefore valid.  This must be taken as meaning that the intent of the Legislature was to render everything not saved by section 14 invalid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>As it appears to me, section 13 enables the conversion to be expressed in £sd, for instance, £14 and 50 pennies but first of all you must be entitled to £14 and 50 pennies.  You are not entitled to £14 and 50 pennies unless you are entitled to it by reason of some contract or agreement.  Section 13 is fine as far as it goes but the right must exist first.  This is the weakness. Section 14 is what gives you the right under the contract.  Now, I do not know whether the Minister will agree with me.  I assure him that I am merely trying to be helpful.  Section 13 gives a right to convert from £sd into pounds and new pence but you must be entitled to the £sd first.  The contract under which you become entitled to the £sd must not itself be invalid.  If it is invalid then you do not become entitled even to the £sd.  Section 14, unfortunately, is narrow in particular in subsection (b).  In fact if (b) were out I think <Col N="230" /> it would be better or, alternatively, if (b) were worded as follows&mdash;this is what I suggested on the Second Reading of the Bill:</P>
      <P>in this subsection &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; includes wills and all documents and writings which create rights or impose obligations.</P>
      <P>It need not be of a contractual kind, a will or a codicil to a will does not create a right of a contractual kind.</P>
      <P>Section 13 is splendid as far as it goes but there is no use in saying that something can be converted from £sd into £ and new pence unless the right exists. If the contract under which the right exists is in itself invalid then the whole thing disappears.  This is what I would be afraid of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Nash.  There is no use having a provision for a conversion if in fact you cannot have a valid instrument on which to claim.  It is for this reason that I said I understood that Senator FitzGerald's contention was basically that, by having section 14 at all, one may be making certain agreements invalid.  I have doubts as to the validity of that contention by Senator Alexis FitzGerald but my doubts are sufficiently weak to make me think that this matter ought perhaps to be looked at again.</P>
      <P>The Senator has adverted to what are the difficulties with which I am faced. I would point out that nothing can arise under section 14 until the end of the changeover period, which cannot be earlier than the autumn of next year.  I would give an undertaking to the House that between this and then I would examine this matter very closely and if any doubt whatever remains bring forward an amending measure to cover it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the civil war.  By the civil war I do not mean the civil war referred to yesterday, by some Senators obliquely and more directly by others. I refer to the civil war that is on our hands at the moment because a civil <Col N="232" /> war is the only thing I can call it. During the 11 months from January to November, 1970 475 people were killed on our Irish roads.  The number injured was 8,215.  Some of those injured are maimed for life.  It is hardly possible to describe that slaughter in any terms other than civil war.  For the moment, let us leave aside spiritual considerations, family considerations, social considerations in considering this figure of 475 persons killed.  Let us look at it for the moment in a rather more mundane or economic sense.  Think of the time spent in rearing all these children, boys, girls, men and women.  Think of the hours, the days and the years spent in their rearing.  Think of the cost of their education and training, think of their potential in their professions and their ways of life, think of the good they could do for the country and then consider that all that has been lost, all that labour, all that work, all that money gone for nothing.  Think of all the time that has to be spent subsequently on inquiries conducted by the gardaí, court proceedings.  Think of all that labour.  Think of all the time that has been unnecessarily lost, all because of criminal negligence and carelessness on somebody's part.  I think we will agree that the root cause of this slaughter on the roads is downright carelessness, indifference, intoxication, bad temper and so on.</P>
    <P>The question next arises, what can we do about it?  Somebody said to me the other day this requires a declaration of a state of emergency.  We can declare a state of emergency.  What good will that do?  I have jotted down a few points which I shall now put before the House.  One of the main causes of these accidents is partial or total drunkenness.  People should realise the lethal weapon a car, a lorry, a motor bicycle or a push bicycle can be.  Suppose some Senator came in here, pulled two guns out of his pockets and started firing indiscriminately, one would say the man should be interned straight away, but if a man who is incapable of driving a car kills or maims someone while he is driving, nobody suggests that he should be interned.</P>
    <P>Though the efforts of the Department <Col N="233" /> of Local Government in sending posters, advertisements, warnings, to schools are commendable, I think they should go a step further and send out appropriate posters for erection in every public house and hotel bar.  That may help to bring realisation to people who may be tempted to drive when under the influence of drink that they had better have second thoughts about it.  If people want to drink that is their own affair but if they drive while under the influence of drink it is everybody's affair.  We have a responsibility as Members of the Oireachtas to see that large numbers of persons are not killed as a result of unnecessary and avoidable accidents.</P>
    <P>Another thing which could help in avoiding accidents is the proper distribution of stop signs at secondary roads. I know of an accident in which a girl of 22 years was killed instantly.  It occurred where a secondary road crossed a main road.  The stop sign appeared about five yards from the junction.  The roads crossed at right angles.  It is a matter of great urgency that not alone should there be a stop sign near the junction but that there should be a preliminary warning 50 or 100 yards back from the junction.  A big notice marked &ldquo;Prepare to stop&rdquo; should be erected, followed by a notice &ldquo;Prepare to stop immediately&rdquo; and then the final notice &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  This is necessary.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of pedestrians walking at night.  Would it be possible to introduce legislation to make it an offence to walk after the hours of darkness without a reflectorised belt?  It is impossible in bad weather conditions to pick out pedestrians dressed in dark clothing.  These belts and arm bands are one of the greatest discoveries, and they should be used.  School children wear the arm bands and are very careful about wearing them.  Their parents and teachers make sure that they wear them.  It is not quite fair to blame adults for not wearing these bands because I have yet to find out where one can buy them.  The idea occurred to me whether it would be possible to organise a drive, where these reflectorised belts are concerned, to make them <Col N="234" /> available, to advertise intensively in order to get the public acquainted with the shops or premises where they are available.  If the people do not find them satisfactory, we would go so far as to say that legislation should be brought in to insist that people wear them.  If people are careless about risks to their own lives it is up to the public to see that they do not run unnecessary risks.</P>
    <P>Along with that we must have constant admonitions, warnings, appeals. Some people advocate that if young people are trained in the rules of the road that is sufficient.  It is far from being sufficient.  We are all inclined to forget that these admonitions must be before us always in the form of advertisements in newspapers, radio, television and posters.  I will repeat the figure: from January to November of this year there were 475 killed and 8,215 injured.  These are appalling figures.  Something will have to be done in a big way to put an end to what I call the civil war or at least to reduce the number of casualties substantially.</P>
    <P>I suppose no debate of this kind would be regarded as read, so to speak, unless one made a reference to Northern Ireland or the Six Counties. Much has been said about the Six Counties which should not have been said and a lot has been left unsaid which should have been said.  In dealing with a problem, the first thing is to realise what the problem is because a problem understood is a problem, very often, on the point of being solved.</P>
    <P>There are a great many people in the Twenty-six Counties who do not understand the problem as it exists in the Six Counties.  There are many people in the Six Counties who never get an opportunity of understanding the problems in the Twenty-six Counties. One of the first things that strike me, as one who keeps in touch with Northern Ireland and who visits there as often as possible and who has many contacts there, is the conditioning of the minds of the people in the Twenty-six Counties.  On my last visit up there I tried out an experiment.  I relaxed my mind completely, watching television in the North, listening to radio broadcasts &mdash;BBC Ulster Radio.  I read newspapers, <Col N="235" /> pamphlets <i>et cetera</i> and let my mind be entirely receptive.  After four or five days of that I began to feel that my mind was in the way of being conditioned and that I was inclined to look at the problems from an angle from which I never looked at them before.</P>
    <P>Then I turned the switch and came back to normal again.  The first point I want to make on the North, having seen the problem, is that the next thing to do was to educate the people who so far entertain ideas that to us are absolutely ludicrous.  So many people in the North seem to think that if they have any association with us here, if they come down and visit us, they are extremely lucky if they go back all in the one piece.  Many people absolutely and sincerely believe that, and until such time as we realise that that is there and that we must educate those people to the knowledge that we are all Christians, even though we worship at different shrines very often, and that we are all entitled to call ourselves Christians, there will not be a solution. We have many people going about at the moment offering solutions to the northern problem, solutions that come to mind as a result of over-simplification of the problem.  Many people, especially here in the Twenty-six Counties, are inclined to divide all the people in the Six Counties as belonging to this side or that side&mdash;polarisation. They are either orange or they are green.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be further from the truth.  We have all at some time or other listened to that song &ldquo;Forty Shades of Green&rdquo; but we have at least 40 shades of some kind of green in the Six Counties and we have many times 40 shades of orange.  Very often those people who annoy us by their speeches and behaviour in the North are the most sincere.  It is a frightfully complicated problem and although I say that the education of the people up there&mdash;and the education of quite a number of people down here as well&mdash; is of primary importance, we must have patience of a very high degree because one must remember that the actual artificial border that is there could be removed very quickly but that will not solve the problem.  It is unity we want. <Col N="236" /> We want toleration.  Moving an artificial line and putting it somewhere else or abolishing it altogether will not solve the problem unless there is unity of heart and mind.</P>
    <P>I remember on many occasions being in the company of traditional musicians from the North of Ireland who were Presbyterians, Church of Ireland and various religions.  I knew they were of these persuasions but I never asked them and they never asked us.  While we were playing and enjoying ourselves, exchanging tunes and chatting, we were all one at heart.  That is the kind of spirit we must endeavour to promote.  Cultural communion, communion in sport and in business activities, the breaking down of the curse of suspicion which is one of the most dechristianising influences in the world. It is completely foreign to the Christian concept because suspicion can beget all kinds of things.  If a man has a point of view in which he is sincere he is entitled to have that point of view accepted.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to the North of Ireland I collected a number of pamphlets and I have one here which was of very great interest to me.  It is a pamphlet that possibly many of us are not acquainted with.  I intend to quote a section from it.  It was written by Reverend M. W. Dewar, with a foreword by the late Right Reverend W. S. Kerr, formerly Bishop of Down and Dromore and Grand Chaplain of the then Orange Lodge of Ireland.  In this pamphlet we have, under the heading &ldquo;The Qualifications of an Orangeman&rdquo; the following:</P>
    <P>The Master and members of every Lodge into which a candidate is proposed to be elected must satisfy themselves with all due solemnity previous to his admission that he possesses the following qualifications.</P>
    <P>These are the qualifications as laid down for an Orangeman.  Again I quote:</P>
    <P>An Orangeman should have a sincere love and veneration for his Heavenly Father, a humble and steadfast faith in Jesus Christ, the Saviour of Mankind believing in Him as the only mediator between God and man.  He should cultivate <Col N="237" /> truth and justice, brotherly kindness and charity, devotion and piety, concord and unity and obedience to the laws.  His deportment should be gentle and compassionate, kind and courteous.  He should seek the society of the virtuous and avoid that of the evil.  He should honour and diligently study the Holy Scriptures and make them the rule of his faith and practice.  He should love, uphold and defend the Protestant religion and sincerely desire and endeavour to propagate its doctrine and precepts.  He should strenuously oppose the feeble errors and doctrines of the Church of Rome and studiously avoid countenancing, by his presence or otherwise, any act or ceremony of Popish worship.  He should by all lawful means resist the ascendancy of that church, its encroachments and the extension of its power ever abstaining from all uncharitable words, actions or sentiments towards his Roman Catholic brethren.  He should remember to keep holy the Sabbath Day and attend public worship of God and diligently train up his offspring and all under his control in the fear of God and in the Protestant Faith.  He should never take the name of God in vain but abstain from all cursing and profane language and use every opportunity of discouraging these and all other sinful practices in others.  His conduct should be guided by wisdom and prudence and not by intemperance and insobriety.  The glory of God and the welfare of man, the honour of his Sovereign and the good of his country should be the motive of his actions.</P>
    <P>I think that this prayer out of <i>The Qualifications for an Orangeman</i> will be most enlightening to many.  There is so much there to which we could all subscribe, and if those people believe this and act accordingly then we should take another look at them.  The trouble is that so many of them formally subscribe to it but they do not always live up to it, to judge by their speeches and very often by their actions.</P>
    <P>Now I come to what I will call provocative parades&mdash;no doubt they are provocative and can be provocative.  I remember the first time I saw an <Col N="238" /> Orange parade, more than 30 years ago in the city of Belfast.  Hundreds and hundreds of people attended.  There were 200 or 300 people behind the band.  Then followed another band with 200 or 300 more people and so on. They stretched for three-quarters of a mile.  Three things occurred very forcibly to me when I saw that parade. The first was the joy and the happiness on the faces of the children participating. That was followed by an abhorrence of the idea of the conditioning of those children.  They were young children of from six to ten years of age at that time but some of those were undoubtedly involved in the terrible scenes in Belfast and Derry within the last 12 months.  At that time there was joy all over their faces.  It was a festive occasion for them.  They were all dressed up and I am sure they got plenty of drinks of orange and lemonade that particular evening.</P>
    <P>The second thing that occurred to me was the excellence of their bands. They had fife and drum bands, accordion bands, all kinds of excellent bands.  All the players in those bands seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely.  It was a joyous occasion. The third thing that occurred to me most forcibly was the incongruity of the whole scene.  One of the bands were playing a tune popularly known as &ldquo;Three Cheers for the Red, White and Blue&rdquo; while 50 yards down the road another band played &ldquo;Let Erin Remember the Days of Old&rdquo;. The point was, and I see it clearly now, they were not really concerned about what they were playing.  They were playing music and like all those parades in the North&mdash;and we have to face up to this&mdash;they actually are joyous manifestations of a belief or a philosophy.  Many of our parades, especially at Eastertime when we commemorate our fallen dead, are rather inclined to be more dismal than joyous.</P>

    <Title>Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann (Privileges and Procedure) Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I need say very much about this Bill.  Members of the House will be aware af the fact that on 1st December Dáil Éireann remitted to the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann the examination of certain expenditure under a grant-in-aid in respect of relief in Northern Ireland. The Committee of Public Accounts of <Col N="240" /> Dáil Éireann met and furnished an interim report in which they set out what they apprehend to be certain difficulties which might arise in regard to privileges and in regard to the attendance of witnesses.  They have requested that they be given power to deal with these matters by legislation.</P>
      <P>This Bill does precisely what the committee requested and it passed through all Stages in Dáil Éireann this morning.  As Senators know, the Committee of Public Accounts is an all-party committee; the interim report requesting this legislation was, I understand, unanimously passed and the Bill was passed in Dáil Éireann without opposition this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that this is essentially a matter for the Dáil.  It is dealing with the work of the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts and it does not really affect this House.  There are some matters arising on the Bill about which the Minister will probably be able to give me some reassurance.  In section 2&mdash;this is the section which extends the privilege&mdash;there was possibly some doubt as to whether the privilege existed as fully as set out in this section. This section may be regarded as clarifying the position as specifically extending the privilege as set out there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point I want to raise on that is whether the Minister is absolutely clear that the privilege extends to the publishers as well as to the members of the committee.  The answer to that is probably that once the thing is privileged the daily newspapers are entitled to publish it just as they are entitled to publish remarks made by either House of the Oireachtas.  If that is the position I am quite satisfied and, as I have remarked, it is essentially a matter for the Dáil.  If there was more time available, and if the matter was not one of some urgency from the point of view of the Dáil Committee in question, it would be relevant to consider and to discuss if these provisions should not have general application to the proceedings of the committee rather than be limited to a particular inquiry.  In any event if the position is that the committee have asked for these powers in relation to this particular <Col N="241" /> inquiry, the question as to whether the powers should be given generally in relation to the work of the committee could be considered at a later date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator O'Higgins has said.  If the Bill coming before us were wider in scope there could be absolutely no question but that it would have to come to us with due notice and be very thoroughly examined.  It may well be that we can accept the point of view that this is a matter of the Dáil regulating the business of its own committees, and being of the opinion that it was necessary to have legislation for the purpose of carrying out this work effectively, they ask for the legislation.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, there are implications, even in a Bill as narrowly drawn as this, for all committees&mdash;whether they are committees of the Dáil or of the Seanad.  Accordingly, we cannot regard this purely as a matter of the regulation of Dáil business.  It is a custom, when legislation is introduced, that the promoting Department circulates the heads of the Bill to other Government Departments and the provisions of the Bill are, in turn, examined by the other Departments before there is final approval and introduction of the Bill into the Oireachtas.  If time was available and matters were not urgent, even if the Dáil were initiating legislation in regard to the regulation of its own business and if it were convinced that this had absolutely no effect on the business of the Seanad, this should be referred to Seanad Éireann.  It is most unfortunate that this Bill is brought before this House and speedy passage for it is being asked without the Bill having been considered by the Committee of Procedure and Privileges of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a real difficulty here.  It may well be said that the Bill is narrowly drawn and because of the way in which it is narrowly drawn that it will not affect the committees which are not mentioned.  It may be held that it refers only to the particular investigation which Dáil Éireann has asked to be carried out.  Nevertheless, the fact that a Bill is introduced in order to put beyond doubt privilege in regard to this <Col N="242" /> committee in this particular piece of work, may well afterwards be held as reinforcing the doubt; it may afterwards be appealed to as a ground that privilege does not exist in other committees of either House of the Oireachtas. Once we take positive action in legislation in regard to this particular instance we are affecting the whole question.  Members have been circulated with the Interim Report of the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts and some Members may have been happier than I was about the clarity of the opinions expressed.  From reading that report, I certainly could not come to any conclusion but that there was doubt in the minds of at least those reading the opinion.</P>
    <P>We must enter a warning note that what is being done in this regard may well have an effect.  We have, in Seanad Éireann, a Committee on Statutory Instruments, a Committee which is doing an excellent job of work, year in year out.  It may well be that having passed this Bill rapidly, gone home, enjoyed our Christmas, we may suddenly realise that by enacting this particular piece of legislation at the behest of Dáil Éireann and its Committee of Public Accounts, we may have by that very act thrown doubt upon the powers and the privileges of our own Committee on Statutory Instruments.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, if we are prepared to give him this Bill here today, will he undertake, having got this Bill for this purpose, to have the whole question of privilege examined?  If it is found that the Bill will cast any doubt, or weaken in any way the privilege of any of the other committees, will this matter be brought forward for earnest consideration, and any possible undesirable consequences will be mitigated in this way?  I do not think it is necessary to remind the Minister of the possible difficulties in this regard.  Both of us served on the Committee on Constitutional and Administrative Procedures, in which the difficulties in regard to this question were discussed. Subsequently, the remarks of the committee on these difficulties were gravely misunderstood among the general public. Perhaps it is necessary to go ahead in this regard.  It is certainly necessary <Col N="243" /> to ensure that this sticky area as regards the privileges of our committee should be looked into.  If the Minister could assure us that this matter will be thoroughly examined, I for one would be happier in allowing this Bill to pass.</P>

      <P>Senator Dooge completely misunderstands, whether deliberately or not, the whole situation in regard to this Bill.  There is no question whatever of the situation which he attempted to portray, of the Bill being rushed, giving the illusion that this was another example of rushed legislation. This Bill was not rushed by the Government; it was not asked for by the Government; it was not wanted by the Government.  This Bill was asked for by the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann which is inquiring into a matter which was demanded by the Opposition in Dáil Éireann.  If Senator Dooge wants assurances on this, that or the other thing, that is a matter for the Minister but as far as I am concerned I would say, &ldquo;Let the Bill stand.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the query raised by Senator O'Higgins I should like to say it is my understanding that <Col N="244" /> the position is, as I think he understands it to be, that privilege would also extend to the publishers.  It is true to say that this Bill was prepared in a hurry.  It is also true that it did not follow the normal procedure followed in regard to Bills through various Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The wording of section 1 makes it quite clear that the operation of this Bill is intended to be confined to the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann while engaged in the performance of the functions assigned to it by order of Dáil Éireann made on 1st December, 1970, and no further.  It was requested by the committee and it was in response to that request that the Bill was brought forward in a hurry.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it quite clear that this Bill is not similar to the usual Bills coming through being sponsored by the Government.  It is necessary to have it sponsored by the Government in order to comply with the procedure but my attitude and the attitude of the Government in this matter is that we are complying with the request of the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>If there is any objection to this Bill, we are certainly not pushing it.  If it is not unanimously acceptable to this House I shall be happy to withdraw it. I am not in a position, nor would I accept, that I should offer any undertakings to the House in return for the passage of the Bill.  I am merely acting as an instrument for the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann in bringing the Bill before this House. Therefore, I am not giving any undertakings in return for the passage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The whole question of privilege relating to other committees is a matter that I would not wish to have dealt with in this hurried way.  There could be many implications involved and the types of committees that could be affected.  All kinds of matters would need close examination before I would contemplate any other legislation in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, this Bill is confined solely to the matter I have mentioned.  I want to repeat the position, so far as I am <Col N="245" /> concerned, that if it is not acceptable to the House I withdraw the Bill.  I am not pushing it on the House in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think section 2, subsection (1) is the source of the anxiety which I have in regard to this Bill and which I have expressed.  I should like to ask the Minister why it is thought necessary to introduce subsection (1) in this particular Bill.  Is the position in regard to the members of the committee not already adequately provided for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of legal opinion to the effect that the matter dealt with under subsection (1) is already provided for.  Nevertheless, I understand that members of the committee have some apprehension in this regard.  I could put it this way, that subsection (1) is bringing this matter beyond any doubt in so far as such a doubt exists.  I am myself inclined to the view that there is no doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty here, which was completely misunderstood by Senator Ó Maoláin, is that this subsection does not put the privileges of members of all committees beyond doubt.  It only puts beyond doubt the privileges of the members of one committee in regard to any one matter.  A reasonable anxiety to express in regard to this Bill is that if it is thought necessary to introduce this subsection in order to assert that the members of the Committee of Public Accounts are <Col N="246" /> privileged on this particular occasion, this, in itself, may weaken the preexisting position of other committees, in respect of which such legislation has not been introduced.</P>
      <P>The problem is that, normally, when we attempt to put something which we feel to be the position beyond doubt by legislation, we put it beyond doubt in regard to all instances.  Here we say that what we intend doing is to pass legislation to put it beyond doubt in one instance.  To my mind there may be a danger here of creating the doubt in the remaining instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this subsection, although I would like to make it clear that I have not studied the position, I am inclined to agree with the view the Minister expressed that so far as the members of a committee are concerned they have the protection of privilege and the immunities which are being reinforced by subsection (1) of section 2.  When a request is made by a committee which is required by the Dáil to perform a particular function which is assigned to it by the Dáil, if there is doubt in the minds of members of that committee it is reasonable that those doubts should be set at rest.  Even if it means being ultra-cautious, it is right to bring in this section in order to allay those doubts.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that one reason why there would be doubts in the minds of members of the committee is that it is intended to hold this inquiry in public. The ordinary situation which obtains in the Committee of Public Accounts, consequently, might not obtain.  For that reason I am a bit unhappy about the position of the publishers. I hope the Minister's view, which I think is similar to my own, is the correct one. I do not want to hold up things, but I would feel more comfortable about this section if it finished by saying that these various things wherever published should be privileged and that the privilege shall extend to the publishers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way the section goes at the moment, subsection (1) makes it clear that particular immunities are given to the members.  Subsection (2) goes on to refer to the documents of the committee, <Col N="247" /> certainly to all official reports and publications of the committee, and thirdly to utterances of the members, advisers, officials, and agents of the committee.  All of those things are going to be privileged wherever published. The implication there is that the privilege is extending to the members, its officials, its records, its agents. Does it also extend to the publishers of those things?</P>

They are the people who asked for this and they are the people who are all trying, with their usual tactics, to read more into the Bill than is in it.

If the Minister tells me that he is happy that publishers are covered, I am not going to press the point any further.  I realise that what the Minister says is quite right, he is not urging this Bill; he is simply acting, so to speak, as agent for the committee in doing it.  I am calling attention, in a perfectly serious way, to people who cannot speak for themselves here&mdash;the publishers of information or evidence or whatever you like to call it, given at an inquiry held in public.</P>
      <P>I simply wish to inquire in a perfectly civil way from the Minister as to whether their position is covered.  I would be extremely disappointed if the Minister did not give a civil answer to that.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment for lunch I was dealing with relations between the Six Counties and the Twenty-six, or rather the relations we would like to exist between the people in both areas.  Nobody who seriously studies this matter has any doubt as to the root of the trouble; we have to go back to the time of the Plantations for that.  There we find the root cause, but much water has flowed down the River Lagan, into Dublin bay and into Cork harbour since then. We cannot go back and regenerate conditions which obtained at the time; we have got to accept things as they are.  As I said earlier, a problem realised, a problem properly assessed, is a problem almost solved.</P>
      <P>One of the bedevilling factors is the absolute ignorance of the public of Great Britain as to the true facts of the situation.  It comes as a shock to anybody who goes to Britain, and meets intelligent, well-educated people who have not the foggiest notion as to the set-up here and the cause of the troubles that have been in existence for so long.  I suppose the greatest propaganda machine the world has ever known is the machine that we seem to accept now as being inherent in British life.  They seem to think that their view on anything is the only view.  I have made a point over a number of years of studying closely news reports given by various stations at home and abroad, as compared with the news given of the same events on the BBC, and the discrepancies are most extraordinary. Sometimes one would wonder if they were dealing with the same subject at all.</P>
      <P>I suppose the British attitude could to a large extent be summed-up in the well-known saying&mdash;supposed to be said by a Britisher when he found difficulty in getting, a continental to understand him&mdash;&ldquo;If you shout loudly he will understand you.&rdquo;  If they shout loudly enough and long enough they will, to some extent, have succeeded in getting the world to think that the northern question is an entirely British one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> It is our duty as members of the Oireachtas to do our best in every possible way to enlighten the public of Britain as regards the true facts of the situation.  By and large, the Britisher is a fair-minded man.  If he understood the case I am sure his sympathies would lie where they should lie, and he would do his part in bringing about a rapprochement between the various sections in the north who treat us with a touch of suspicion and distrust, and ourselves who are anxious to be one in spirit as well as being one territorially.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá anois i dtaobh na Gaeltachta agus Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Dúirt Seanadóir éigin le linn na díospóireachta go raibh sé de thuairim aige gur as na bailte móra agus as na cathracha a leathanódh an Ghaeilge amach ar fud na hÉireann.  Aontaím leis.  Ag an am gcéanna ó rud é gurb í an Ghaeltacht foinse cheart na Gaeilge caithfear an Ghaeltacht a choimeád, caithfear an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú.  Bíonn ar gach éinne dul siar nó dul ó thuaidh nó dul ó dheas chun na Gaeltachta anois agus arís mar in ár gcuid cainte i rith na bliana sa chuid eile den tír bíonn an baol ann i gcónaí go dtagann tanú nó laige ar bhlas ár gcuid cainte agus téimíd go dtí an Ghaeltacht chun feabhas a chur ar an mblas agus dul i dtaithí ar chaint na ndaoine a mbíonn an Ghaeilge mar ghná-theanga acu ó mhaidin go hoíche.</P>
    <P>Tógadh mo chroí le déanaí i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall.  Chonaic mé daoine, idir óg agus aosta, ag dul go dtí na cruinnithe polaitíochta agus gan ach an Ghaeilge ina mbéal acu.  Is tuar dóchais dúinn go léir san Oireachtas go raibh cainteoirí inár measc a dhein an soiscéal nó an drochscéal polaitíochta a chraobhscaoileadh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta as Gaeilge. Gan dabht, ba mhór an masla ar fad do mhuintir na Gaeltachta dul ina measc agus scéala poiblí den tsaghas sin a phlé agus a chur ina láthair as Béarla.  Pé cabhair is féidir a thabhairt don Ghaeltacht, is ceart í a thabhairt agus os rud é gurb iad cúrsaí maireachtála, slí bheatha a bhaint amach, an gad is goire don scórnaí a scaoileadh, caithfear freastail orthu ina dtaobh sin ar dtús.</P>
    <P>Cé go labhrann muintir na Gaeltachta <Col N="251" /> an Ghaeilge ó mhaidin go hoíche, ar chuma éigin tá a lán acu agus ní heol dóibh gurb í an Ghaeilge a bhíonn á labhairt acu.  Labhrann siad an Ghaeilge toisc gur tógadh le Gaeilge iad.  Labhraimíd an Ghaeilge anseo sa chuid eile den tír toisc gur comhartha náisiúntachta é, toisc go gcreidimíd nach bhféadaimíd a rá gur Gaeil sin muna ndéanfaimíd beart de réir ár mbriathar agus féachaint chuige go bhfaighidh gach duine seans an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim, a chleachtadh agus a labhairt ar gach ócáid is féidir.</P>
    <P>Caithfear a chur ar a shúilí do mhuintir na Gaeltachta gur comhartha náisiúntachta é, gur comhartha uaisleachta é an Ghaeilge a labhairt, a chaomhnú agus a leathnú.  Pé scéal é, dá luaithe a raghfar chun cinn le monarchain a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht sea is fearr.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil antsuim ar fad ag Aire na Gaeltachta san obair seo agus go bhfuil a chion féin á dhéanamh aige ar son na Gaeltachta, ach caithfear bheith cinnte nach mbeidh sé le rá ag éinne de mhuintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil sé níos measa as ná a dheartháir sa Ghaeltacht.  Más féidir é sin a chur i bhfeidhm fanfaidh an t-aos óg sa Ghaeltacht agus beidh tairbhe dá réir sin ag muintir na hÉireann uilig.</P>
    <P>Airím go bhfuiltear chun stáisiún radio speisialta a bhunú do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Dá luaithe a deintear é sin sea is fearr.  Cúis árdú-mheanmain, cúis dhóchais dúinn go léir é sin a chlos.  Ba cheart féachaint chuige le go bhféadfadh gach éinne eile sa tír éisteacht leis an stáisiún sin.  Ba mhithid, ar ndóigh, lasmuigh de Radio Éireann, stáisiún eile a bheith againn chomh maith, agus níor cheart go mbeadh focal Béarla le cloisint sa stáisiún sin.  Níor cheart bheith ann ach Gaeilge idir díospóireachtaí ceol 7rl, agus ceol de gach saghas anois; níor leor ceoltóirí traidisiúnta amháin a bheith ar an radio sin. Ní mór féachaint chuige an ceart céanna a bheith ag Gaeilgeoirí chun ceol clasaiceach agus mar sin de a chloisint agus atá ag muintir na Galltachta.</P>
    <P>Molaim an tAire as ucht an tsuim a chuireann sé ins na cúrsaí sin agus tá súil agam go raghfar i mbun an stáisiún <Col N="252" /> a thógáil gan aon ró-mhoill.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the sum of money we are voting today is a sizeable one and, as far as lies in our power, we must ensure that the best value is got for that money.  One of the great curses of the present day, not alone here but throughout the world, is the curse of inflation.  In my opinion the root cause of inflation is not any of those that have been alleged but the unfortunate fact that so many of our people have got into the deplorable, unchristian habit of not doing an honest day's work.  I have discussed this with many people and the general opinion appears to be that the output per man in any department, if we exclude a small number, is not what it used to be.  I have seen people who were supposed to be working but whose main concern seemed to be to do as little as they could, spread it over as long a time as they could for as much money as they could get.</P>
    <P>Until that process is reversed the present unsatisfactory situation will remain.  You cannot legislate to make a man work if he does not want to. There must be a new attitude, a re-baptising, so to speak, into belief in the dignity and nobility of work.  It is primarily, I suppose, a matter for the churches.  If a fair day's work was done production would be greater and the danger of inflation would be minimised.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal from time to time about a workers' republic.  This is most annoying, because a prerequisite for a workers' republic should be workers.  Many of the people who shout for a workers' republic would be the last to dream of doing a day's work.</P>
    <P>I can hardly finish without a word about this internment crisis.  Much has been said and blood pressures have been raised in this regard, but the fact remains that nobody has yet been incarcerated and let us hope nobody will be.  The whole point is this: if the Taoiseach and the Government have been informed by the competent authorities that there is a danger of further bank raids, a danger of kidnapping, then since we must assume that the Taoiseach is no fool, the Government are not fools and the Garda are not fools, there is a justification for <Col N="253" /> threatening the reintroduction of the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>Nobody detests internment without trial so intensely as we do and as the people of Ireland generally do, but if it must be done or if it must be threatened then it is not without reason.  Let nobody think for one moment that you could not have kidnapping here.  Certainly you could have it.  We are becoming a very sophisticated society.  We are very close to the Continent, very close to the United States and all parts of the world now, and I do not see any reason at all, our sophistication having reached the peak it has reached, why kidnappings would not take place here as in Canada, Brazil or any parts of Europe.  Therefore there is no need for all the hubbub or the excitement about this threat of the introduction of the Offences Against the State Act.  It was not without reason and I am sure the warning given by the Government will have a very salutary effect.</P>
    <P>We have been through very difficult times during the last 12 months. Many of these happenings are indications of the degree of sophistication we have achieved.  They are commonplace in democracies in other parts of the world.  We are a democracy and we intend to remain a democracy and you cannot have entertainment without entertainment tax.  You cannot have a democracy without having some of the situations we have experienced.  Mistakes have been made and will be made again.  The Government are doing their very best and will continue to do their best to face the problems courageously. Recently while reading I came across this French saying: &ldquo;La patience est le courage de tous les jours&rdquo;&mdash;patience is the courage of every day.  It is my belief that this quiet patience, the quiet strength, the quiet confidence of the Taoiseach and the Government will be justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin with a reference to the remarks with which Senator Cranitch concluded.  I think every Member of the Seanad would agree we are coming to the close of what might be described without exaggeration, as a somewhat turbulent <Col N="254" /> year during which we have had many changes of one kind or another, including Ministerial ones.  When we were talking on the Appropriation Bill 12 months ago we had a different Minister for Finance sitting in the Chair. Now 12 months later we are addressing our remarks to Deputy Colley in that office.</P>
      <P>The year came in like a lamb, notwithstanding the economic position, but it is certainly going out like a lion with the threatened introduction of section 2 of the Offences Against the State Act.  I do not propose to dwell at any length on this particular measure which is the basis for an amendment put down by Senator O'Higgins and Senator Kelly.  The subject-matter of that amendment was dealt with very comprehensively and adequately by Senator O'Higgins.  I think that the Senators here who would not agree with what he said would give him credit for giving a very able exposition of his point of view and, in fairness, I think the same remark would be applied to Professor Kelly's contribution.</P>
      <P>It is usual for Senators to refer to the ordinary people they meet as a cross-section of the public.  It is amazing at times the different opinions one gets from such cross-sections.  I listened to Senators on one side of the House talking about the views expressed by cross-sections of the people they had met on the threatened introduction of Part II of the Offences Against the State Act.  I also discussed this measure or threatened measure with what I would regard as a fair cross-section of the public, people who would not be politically partisan but at the same time would take an intelligent interest in the country's affairs.  I can say that, generally speaking, there was, and, I believe, still is very strong opposition amongst the ordinary people of this country to the introduction of a measure such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have described it as smacking of the jackboot mentality and the police State.  These may be exaggerated terms but at least they do suggest that the ordinary man and woman are not happy to say the least of it about the possible introduction of this measure. They asked a number of questions <Col N="255" /> which I personally found it very difficult to answer and which, as far as I can see and from what I have read of the Dáil debates, the remarks of the Taoiseach and some Ministers have not been answered.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if I reiterate some of those questions now it may be helpful to a rational and moderate dialogue on this matter.  The most common question one hears is the obvious one: Is the measure really necessary; is it a panic decision or a diversionary tactic or has the Taoiseach been guilty of making an error of judgment by rushing into the threat of introducing this measure?  The next question is&mdash;and the previous speaker, Senator Cranitch, seemed to support the point of view that it was necessary&mdash;why has the Taoiseach not spelt out the reasons clearly and frankly?  I am aware of course, as we all are, that he stated in the Dáil that he had received evidence from the Garda authorities that certain actions threatening life and property had been contemplated by certain individuals unnamed or organisations unnamed.  If this is so I think the Taoiseach might have gone further and given the Dáil and the people more concrete evidence of these reasons for introducing, at such short notice, this unpleasant measure.</P>
    <P>Further questions are: have all the existing resources of the State for the maintenance of law and order been exhausted and found ineffective to contain this unexplained threat to persons and property?  Have the Garda always enjoyed the full support of the Government in matters like this?  Is the threat so great that if the Garda force was expanded and better equipped, they could not deal with it?  Is it not a fact that members of an illegal organisation have openly paraded with arms in defiance of the Government and got away with it?  Is it true that action against members of an illegal organisation has been called off by direct or indirect intervention of members of the Government?  These questions must be answered before the Government take action to prevent any citizen from enjoying his rights to a fair trial before internment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> During the past 12 months and since 1964, what might be called the year of the green light, the year in which the then Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, took a decision which appeared to many to be largely dictated by political rather than economic considerations, we have been suffering from inflation. Today we have roaring inflation, rising costs, prices up by approximately 20 per cent in the last three years, rising unemployment, falling production, growing balance of payments deficits, all the signs of a sick economy.  These words are not my words; they are the words that the Minister for Finance and other Ministers and the Taoiseach have been using very emphatically, particularly during recent months.</P>
    <P>The Government's efforts to grapple with the situation have lacked firm handling and have failed to carry conviction, due to the stop-go nature of their policies.  Towards the end of 1969, the Taoiseach announced a norm of 7 per cent for wage and salary increases. He warned manufacturers and businesses generally that any increase in excess of this figure given to the employees would not be allowed when applications were made for price increases. This norm failed mainly because it was hopelessly untenable in the circumstances of the day and because it was made without any prior consultation with employers or workers.</P>
    <P>Next came Budget No. 1 in 1970 in which the then Minister solved his deficit problem by doubling turnover tax thereby giving another push to inflation. Then came the present Minister's short-lived strong measure which put a ceiling on outstanding 12th Round increases and on future wage and salary increases.  The reason for this action by the Minister was stated to be the failure of the employers and workers to arrive at an acceptable formula for wage increases.  The Minister, as we know, was forced to modify his action, quite rightly, by allowing 12th Round increases to stand and virtually abandoning the 6 per cent ceiling.  The ball was then fired back to the Employer-Labourer Conference, with the Prices and Incomes Bill hanging over their deliberations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> The recent agreement is the first sign of stability and is to be heartily welcomed even though it does appear to be above the Government's limit for increased wages and salaries.  Everybody should support the Employer-Labour Conference in bringing about the first measure of stability, in providing the basis for regularising our economic affairs and getting the economy off the ground again.</P>
    <P>The Finance (No. 2) Bill which we are considering in conjunction with the Appropriation Bill has one provision on which I would like to make a comment. I refer to the shattering increase in corporation profits tax, a bombshell which will have very serious repercussions on industrial expansion and consequently on employment.  I realise that the Minister for Finance had a serious problem on his hands arising from the mismanagement of the economy which left him with the difficult task of having to find £21 million to cover the deficit in the current accounts.  He has decided to find this money under several headings: first of all, by reducing Government expenditure by £7 million.  The Minister has not told us, as far as I am aware, under what heading he proposes to reduce Government expenditure by £7 million.  It is a move that is well worthy of commendation.  It is the first really anti-inflationary measure that will have some results if the Minister can put it through.  The Minister has decided to raise a further £5.3 million by extra taxation, just under £1 million on luxuries and almost £4½ million from extra company taxation.  He proposes to borrow £8½ million but has not told us so far from where that £8½ million is to come.  Is it to be borrowed from internal sources or from external sources?  If it is to be borrowed from internal sources it is bound to add to the inflationary cycle; if it is to be borrowed from external sources it will bring more money into the economy and have an even worse effect on the inflationary situation.  The Minister is faced with a very difficult problem in containing inflation.</P>
    <P>His taxation on companies is the worst possible anti-inflationary measure.  It must have an effect on <Col N="258" /> capital growth, it must affect future production and consequently employment opportunities.  In this day and age it is extremely difficult to borrow money.  The Minister and the Government indicated before the bank strike that there should be a restriction on the amount of credit which the banks would make available.  In conjunction with this restriction the Minister is cutting down on the opportunities for manufacturers and companies generally to save money out of profits and to plough them back into their enterprises.</P>
    <P>Although the situations are not strictly comparable, it is worth noting that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer quite recently reduced the rate of corporation tax on companies by a very small amount, 2½ per cent, while our Minister for Finance has increased total taxation, corporation profits tax and income tax combined from 50 to an effective 58 per cent or approximately 16 per cent.  In the current year, taking into consideration the retrospective nature of this new measure, companies will be called on to pay something like 74 per cent in taxation.  This measure seems to me to be completely against the views which the Minister himself expressed in this House only as far back as 29th July last at the conclusion of the debate on the Finance Bill.  The Minister made what most of us will recall was a very fine speech and I, for this side of the House, proposed that we should let our tea break run on a little longer than usual in order to give the Minister an opportunity of concluding.  The Minister impressed not only those on his side of the House but also those on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>On that occasion the Minister said, and I mention this in relation to his recent policy of increasing the already high level of taxation on companies, at column 1318 of the Official Report of that date:</P>
    <P>I know from personal experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce that in quite a number of cases the margin of profit of some Irish manufacturers is dangerously low.  When I say dangerously low I <Col N="259" /> mean those industries are in danger because of inroads on their markets or for some other reason of having to close down and of putting their workers out of employment.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce I was frequently faced with the dilemma of either allowing a price increase or of refusing it altogether or of reducing it at the risk of causing that firm to close down and to put its employees out of work.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>I am making this point because it is frequently thought, or appears to be thought, that most industrialists are making enormous profits.  I can say that none of the Irish industrialists serving the home market is making enormous profits.  Some of them are making satisfactory or even handsome profits but many are making dangerously low profits.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister hit the nail directly on the head there.  With due respect to the Minister, I do not think the situation has changed in any event to warrant the heavy increases in taxation on company profits that he has brought in under the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  It might be said quite rightly that the Minister by his action has helped, or is helping, to kill the golden industrial goose and is doing so on the eve of our probable entry into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this situation which I feel I should mention.  The Minister's decision to increase heavily taxation on manufacturers and companies generally coincides with the period of continued reduction in tariff protection.  This occurs at a time when tariffs are beginning to bite severely. Continuing inflation combined with rising costs, the Minister's increased taxation on companies and the lowering of tariffs are bound to affect manufacturers and companies in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>In connection with the question of tariff cuts, I have two examples very close to home of which the Minister himself will have some knowledge. They are the clothing industry and the footwear industry.  Two factories in <Col N="260" /> Limerick city&mdash;one is a clothing company which employs 650 workers and the other is a footwear factory which employs 250 workers&mdash;are in difficulties. The footwear factory has recently been served with notice of a probable closure next May and the clothing factory is now experiencing very severe competition not only in the export market, where they have been trying to build up satisfactory and profitable connections, but more important still in the home market.  That is a fact that is sometimes lost sight of when we talk about lowering tariffs and the protection which industry has enjoyed over the last 20 or 25 years.  Not only are we being offered the opportunity, with which I agree fully, of exporting and competing in the foreign markets but we are also opening up our small home market to factories outside this country. Most of those factories are larger than our own and, of course, are able to operate with lower costs.</P>
    <P>Imports, as we know, have been increasing. Our exports have increased over the last ten years but they are not increasing at a sufficient rate to cover the increased rate of imports.  In saying this I do appreciate that over the last 12 months there has been a slight improvement in our balance of payments situation.  This improvement is so small that it will not make any significant difference within this financial year unless there is a tremendous increase in exports over the next four or five months or a substantial reduction in imports.  None of the present indications seems to suggest that either of these things will happen.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to a matter which has been brought very much to our notice recently and which concerns certain factories which are in danger of closing down in the face of heavy competition from outside.  I refer particularly to the position of branch factories in this country which are owned by outside interests.  Where a policy of rationalisation of production is decided upon by a British company&mdash;I am not specifically selecting British companies but they are the nearest to us and they are the cases of which we have most examples&mdash;because its markets are falling, because it has to lower its <Col N="261" /> costs or for some other reason the chances are that it will close down one of its Irish factories, or its Irish factory if it has only one, and supply the Irish market from its home base.  This is a perfectly logical development.  It might be regarded as ruthless and lacking in humanity, but I am afraid we are living in an age of ruthless economic policies.  We are living in an age when decisions are made by faceless men in backrooms in big companies who decide by looking at a set of figures that they will close down a factory in Kerry, Limerick or some other county, so as to reduce their costs or increase their profits.  These decisions are taken without any reference to local interests and, so far as I can see, there is very little that our Government can do about it.  It is called rationalisation, but it can be a very cruel exercise indeed.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn for a few moments to another development in this country in which I see great opportunities and great potential.  I have been critical up to now and in one respect at least I would like to show some optimism.  I refer to the policy of regionalisation, a subject about which public representatives and others.  The we read and hear a great deal from the individual does not count any longer.  We are living in an age when policy of regionalisation offers this country, in our particular circumstances, a tremendous opportunity of harnessing all the various interests and combining all the relevant facts for a national effort which must be made if we wish to overcome the material and geographical difficulties under which we suffer.</P>
    <P>Regional development organisations with no statutory powers have already been established, and there are regional tourism bodies.  Regional health boards have just been established.  The trouble so far in regard to the regional bodies dealing with economic and financial affairs and industrial development, apart from the fact that they have no statutory function, is that a great deal of overlapping occurs.  Semi-State bodies such as the Industrial Development Authority overlap with the county development teams.  The tourism bodies <Col N="262" /> are intruding on other organisations and it seems to me that the development of industry, which I regard as a primary necessity, is divided among too many conflicting interests.</P>
    <P>I should like to see certain provisions of the Devlin Report put into effect so that the Industrial Development Authority would not only promote new industries but would also finance them.  No Department of State should be allowed to interfere with their work. This body should be given adequate funds and skilled personnel and allowed to get on with the job.  The fact that it is proposed that the Industrial Development Authority should be regionalised is a very encouraging measure, provided we have genuine regionalisation and not centralisation under a new facade.  One of our great tragedies is the amount of centralisation we have had in recent years.</P>
    <P>In spite of all the committees and regional organisations set up they are all really only talking shops.  They propose resolutions and demand that Ministers act in this way and that when, in fact, the faceless men in the Departments in Dublin decide the issues eventually.  These local committees and councils have little or no power.  We depend on the human element.  Unless we can generate enthusiasm and come together in a binding force to work for the common good, I take a dim view of our future in the free trade area.  In each regional area there should be a regional board with proper statutory powers to develop the area.  There has been criticism about the growth areas and suggestions that if there is a growth area the countryside is denuded.  I do not agree with this because if a city like Limerick is chosen as a growth area, the smaller towns and villages nearby will prosper along with the city. They have a much better chance of prospering if they are represented on a board who are responsible not for the development of a limited area but for the entire area.</P>
    <P>There is one way to ensure that lopsided development does not take place, as I fear may happen under the existing scheme.  There must be some balancing factor.  If <i>laisser-faire</i> policy <Col N="263" /> is adopted the east coast will be developed to the maximum and the south and west coasts will be virtually deserted apart from tourism.  These regional areas all have the necessary facilities to supply skilled technicians. After battling for many years, we in Limerick have at last succeeded in getting what has been described as a third level Institute of Higher Education.  I am very much in favour of providing this technological training in a wide area and of the giving of pass degrees. This Institute of Higher Education appears to have become bogged down despite the enthusiasm of a very competent and enthusiastic Director, Dr. Walsh.  Although it does not come directly within the ambit of the Minister's Department, this is the only opportunity we shall have before the New Year of referring to it and I should like the Minister to use whatever influence he has in helping this project to operate as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I may have over-emphasised the question of the regional boards, but they are very important.  If their regional objectives could include equality of opportunity and living standards in the context of the national development and if they are given the necessary powers and financial help the imbalance of development which I regard as a very real threat would not occur. Some devolution of the State machinery will be necessary if regionalisation is to be a success.  I do not agree with this idea of transferring one or two State Departments to the west of Ireland or any one area.  It may be a political gimmick but it is an ill-judged suggestion.  I would prefer to see in each of the development areas a Government house or State house with sections of each Department represented. Then there would not be this great delay in the payment of social welfare benefits because every claim, no matter how minor, must go to Dublin for judgment by some anonymous person in the Department of Social Welfare.  I am not criticising the people in that Department; they are the victims of a machine.  I remember that, years ago, when social welfare payments were dealt with by the local <Col N="264" /> social welfare officers&mdash;I instanced this example when talking on a similar Bill last year&mdash;if payment to the people in his area was delayed, he cycled two or three miles to make sure that the person concerned received their social welfare benefit, knowing that they could not wait until the following day.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of little human touches that are completely missing from the type of State-governed machine which we appear to be erecting in this country.  The individual is beginning to count for less and less while the organisation, the committees, the consultants and the commissions count for more and more.  These are perhaps all good things in their own way but to my mind almost completely divorced from the human element and certainly from the individual.  We Irish are a nation of individualists and if for any reason we get carried away with this modern concept of the big organisation, the big machine, the big company, the big government, we shall have lost something which this country has maintained in good terms over centuries.</P>
    <P>I should like to return to this question of competition, because it is something of which the message has not been spelt out or has not been appreciated by those concerned&mdash;either the manufacturers or the workers.  Whether we enter the EEC or not, we are going to be faced with continuing and growing competition under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  Therefore if we are to survive in this country and if we are to continue to expand employment, which we must do if we are to absorb people coming off the land, we must prepare for greatly increased competition.  In many ways we are more vulnerable than any other country in Europe.  Our geographical position as a small island off western Europe, underpopulated, leaves us in the position that if we cannot manage our own affairs to provide for our own people, somebody else is going to do it for us.  If we cannot compete on equal or better terms not only will we lose our export trade which has shown, especially in manufactured goods, such a wonderful expansion over the last decade&mdash;I pay tribute to all concerned <Col N="265" />&mdash;but our home market will also be in danger from outside competition.  We can withstand this challenge if, and only if, all sections of our people combine in a sustained effort to produce goods of acceptable quality at competitive prices backed by efficient marketing and distributing organisation.  In this regard I should like to pay tribute to the very effective work that Córas Tráchtála have done since their establishment. I think that any Senator here who has had experience in dealing with Córas Tráchtála would join with me in paying them tribute.  Their officers are excellent, they do a very good job sometimes under very difficult circumstances and their enthusiasm to do a good job is a tremendous encouragement for anybody who has to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I should also like to pay tribute to the Industrial Development Authority and particularly to their small industries division, since being set up under the directorship of Mr. Tom O'Connor, the former County Limerick Manager they have done wonderful work and have really got down to a basis of supplying and assisting small industries in isolated country towns and areas that normally would not hope to qualify for industrial development.</P>
    <P>I recall some years ago the then Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, proposing that Government Departments should become developing corporations. I remember that made quite an impression on me at the time.  I could see what he had in mind: instead of just being a State Department in an anonymous Civil Service, they should be brought more or less into the daylight, so to speak, and given an opportunity to show their worth.  I do not know what happened to that theory or policy&mdash;it seems to have fizzled out, and it is a great pity because I think Mr. Lemass had something in that idea.</P>
    <P>It is very disconcerting to all of us who read newspaper extracts from the recent report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  One sentence in that report is illuminating; where they describe</P>
    <P>the incredible deterioration in recruitment for the Public Services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> That is an appalling state of affairs and taking that statement in conjunction with the hope expressed by Mr. Lemass some years ago, it is obvious that something has gone seriously wrong.  The Devlin Report also says:</P>
    <P>There has been no attempt to link qualifications to requirements in recruiting to the Civil Service or State Departments.</P>
    <P>If the State Departments are to become effective agents for the promotion of industry or services, they must be run as efficiently and economically as possible and I agree with the Devlin view that reorganisation is required urgently to suit the requirements of modern Ireland.  State Departments should have an incentive comparable to the profit motive in private enterprise to use the best talents of their staffs.  In addition to attractive salary terms and conditions, they should include the satisfaction that comes from doing a good job and knowing that it is appreciated.</P>
    <P>So far I have been fairly critical of some Government policies.  It is easy, and I suppose it is part of our job here, to define difficulties but to do so without offering some policies and alternatives is a negative attitude. There are certain priorities the Government must undertake.  The first and most obvious is to come to grips with inflation by moderating the growth in Government expenditure as far as possible. The second is to maintain the maximum incentives to industry and business generally to enable them to expand.  This means the reversal of the policy of placing additional taxation on companies, many already short of cash and finding it increasingly hard to get credit, even for the most deserving projects.  Finally and possibly the most important of all, there should be the ability and the courage to take decisions which may be unpopular politically in the short term but which, in the long term, will have been to the benefit of the nation.  In any age the Irish people never failed to face up to a critical situation and I am confident they will not fail to do so now if&mdash;and I emphasise &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;they are given the <Col N="267" /> true facts and given sound and fair leadership.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by referring again to the Minister's speech on the Finance Bill in July.  In that speech he said many things with which I agree and I could almost use the same words myself verbatim.  However, I would rather quote from column 1327 of the Official Report of 29th July, 1970:</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying something that may sound a bit trite. Maybe it is something that many of us have said at election meetings on occasion but I believe it and I think most of us believe it when we think about it.  Many of our people can be foolish.  They can be perhaps rapacious on occasion but taking them in general, as a people and as a group, if this country and its economy is in danger and if the danger is explained to them and if it is explained to them that action by them will cure it, our people on the whole will respond and respond magnificently. The Government have a primary duty, but all of us have a duty to make clear to our people the danger that exists and the fact that we have the remedy in our own hands and that by exercising that restraint which is required&mdash;not to stop increases in wages but to ensure that there are regular increases in wages every year but worked in such a way that they will be a real increase&mdash;our people can avert this grave danger.  If we can make this clear to our people I am certain they will respond as they have responded in the past.  We can demonstrate once again, and we must demonstrate fairly fast, that this ability of our people which they have demonstrated so often in the past still exists in our people in 1970.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Seanad that now on the brink of 1971 those words of the Minister are even more applicable.  But if our people are to respond they must have, as I have said, firm and fair leadership.  We cannot cod all the people all the time.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if the Taoiseach and his Ministers are fair with the people and tell them what the dangers <Col N="268" /> are, if they are prepared to eschew short-term political advantages I am convinced, as I think all of us in this House would agree, that our people will respond magnificently, as they always have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House very long on this Appropriation Bill.  A great deal has already been said and I will try to be as brief as possible.  However, I will start by referring to the importance of agriculture to our national economy.  I would impress on the Government and on the Minister that every effort should be made to stabilise the rural population. I am glad to say, however, that a great deal has been done over the years to assist the rural population.  A great deal remains to be done in the future.  Every effort must be made to preserve the family farm and to raise the level of farm incomes.  While I am dealing with the family farm I must say I believe in the establishment of small industries to absorb any surplus labour which will become available as a result of families growing up on small farms.  I am glad to say that the Government are very favourably disposed to the establishment of more small industries in rural Ireland.  That is a step in the right direction and everything must be done to continue and improve the activities in that direction.</P>
      <P>Some reference must be made to semi-State bodies which are closely associated with agriculture.  I will name one which was established by the Government&mdash;Bord Bainne.  Bord Bainne are doing a worthwhile job and have more than justified themselves over the years in their activities throughout the world.  Let us hope that that trend will continue and that Bord Bainne will continue to have support from successive Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural community will always respond to any little incentive which is offered to them.  They have proved that through the years and I have no doubt that they will continue to do so in the future.  The farming community are anxious to participate in the building of a solid economy and any price supports which they receive will be channelled towards greater efficiency <Col N="269" /> and greater all-round production. I should like to say that, while many may not be satisfied, I believe that this Government have done a great deal for Irish agriculture and let us hope that help will continue.</P>
    <P>Leaving agriculture I should like to deal briefly with some of the activities of semi-State bodies.  The position of some of our semi-State bodies bears examination at the present time.  I wonder have we given too much power to semi-State bodies and too little power to the Ministers, the Government and the various Members of the Oireachtas.  I would like to see some control being retained over such bodies as the ESB for instance.  They are growing further and further apart from the Irish people.  They are a board which are becoming difficult to approach at times and I would welcome a change in regard to the powers and functions of the ESB.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Government and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs have decided to do some pruning with regard to the activities of Telefís Éireann.  If my memory serves me right, Telefís Éireann was established to provide the Irish people with a good and a true service.  I think those were the opening words of the President of Ireland at the inaugural opening of Telefís Éireann.  I regret to say that I believe Telefís Éireann have not lived up to the functions for which they were designed and destined to serve.  Many of the programmes which are shown are not suitable for viewing by young children.  I must also refer to films which have the wrong influence and can act as an inducement to crime and violence.  I must refer to those cowboy films, those cocky gun-slinging characters who participate in all those programmes. Many boys who practise the games of cowboys and indians have discovered that they went too far with their play-acting and deaths resulted from these imitation hanging efforts and sometimes stabbing efforts.  I know, of course, that those films can be rented very cheaply and I am fully aware of the cost of putting before our viewers home productions.  If we must continue to show that type of cowboy <Col N="270" /> films early at night when children can see them Telefís Éireann should close for short periods if we have nothing else to put on at that time.  If we must have cutbacks, then there should be some savings made in the activities of the outdoor camera crews.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the outdoor camera crews of Telefís Éireann should seem so anxious to film the activities of minority groups.  Have they never given any thought to the activities or the efforts of the silent majority in this country?  One has to be a protester of some sort or other in order to be news today.  That is a situation which should not be allowed to develop.  The plain people of Ireland should be heard and their actions and deeds should be heard.  Unfortunately, the mass media as set up at present, seem to go out of their way to publicise the activities of the minority groups in our community. The actions of those groups can only be regarded as alien to the way of life of the vast majority of the Irish people. I would say again if we are to have savings in RTE that is one field of activity in which they could be made unless the people concerned are prepared to give the Irish people what they deserve and expect&mdash;good and true programmes.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to move on to the field of social welfare.  Criticism has always been levelled at the Government for not doing enough in this field but it is accepted today that in Budget after Budget increases are being given to the less well-off sections of our community.  Ministers associated with the Department of Social Welfare have given all the Vote allowed to them to give each year and I would compliment them for their efforts in this regard.  It is very easy to say that widows' pensions, orphan's pensions and old age pensions are too low, but acquiring the necessary capital to finance these increases is a very difficult job.  One must bear in mind the very limited resources available to the Government.  I would say the Government have done the best they could possibly do during the years to provide assistance for the less well-off sections of our community.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal fully with <Col N="271" /> education but there is one aspect of education which I should like to discuss. I refer to the post-primary and primary education system.  I believe we are in too great a hurry in forcing our educational programme through primary and post-primary schools.  The curricula are completely overloaded and the children are not able to absorb all the work which is being forced on them.  Greater concentration on specialised subjects would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I now wish to speak for a few moments on the school transport system as it is operated.  Most children in country districts still reside in rural cottages and on farms.  Many children of cottiers and small farmers still have to walk to school, whereas their better-off colleagues in other areas can qualify for free transport.  This is the cause of resentment among many sections of our community.  We should take another look at our school transport system so that children who reside in remote areas and in sparsely populated districts can be included.</P>
    <P>A minimum of ten pupils is required at present for the provision of a school bus in an area.  This system is causing great confusion and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider it at the earliest possible opportunity.  It is the cause of unrest among parents and children who fail to understand why the system is being operated in this manner.  Almost every public representative receives regular complaints from parents that their children cannot be transported to school while their neighbour's children are transported despite the fact that their parents may have a car.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Department of Local Government are increasing all the time.  I am glad to see that the Department are now favourably disposed to providing low-cost houses. That is a step I welcome.  I would advise the Department to consider the building of low-cost houses in groups in rural areas.  It is important that we make every possible effort to stabilise the rural population.  They are the backbone of this country.  We are reaching the stage now where our larger towns <Col N="272" /> and cities are becoming so overcrowded that it is becoming more and more difficult to live and work in those places.  When I hear people complain about the shortage of houses I often wonder do we ever pause for a moment and consider the number of houses that have been provided by local authorities, with Government assistance, during the years.  If we paused now and again and counted our blessings we would have less complaints. One can look around this city and see the number of new houses that have been erected.</P>
    <P>Greater savings by wage earners who want to marry and establish homes should be encouraged.  The present trend seems to be to get married first and then to approach the housing authority for a house.  People should make up their minds to save and to build their own houses with the State assistance which is available.  In that case there would be fewer housing action committees and more constructive thinking with regard to housing.  It is a good trend that there should be a demand for houses: it is an indication that our people are not emigrating, that they are not running away in desperation and despair and that they are anxious to live and work in their own country.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of new thinking today with regard to living and working at home.  People have opportunities now that did not exist some years ago. That is the main reason for the backlog of housing applications.  An improvement can be noted in that regard and it is something we all welcome very much.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the Town and Regional Planning Acts which were enacted a few years ago. The last of these Acts is still in its trial stage.  It is an Act that is causing a great deal of confusion as to interpretation and operation.  It appears that it can be applied differently in every urban and built-up area.  The result of that Planning Act is that there is a large number of planning applications at present with the Department of Local Government.  It was found necessary to appoint a Parliamentary Secretary fulltime on the job.  There is a <Col N="273" /> great backlog of work awaiting decisions in that Department.  I would appeal to the Government and the Minister to introduce some new thinking to simplify that Act so as to make it easier to operate.  I am of the opinion that some of our planners are enforcing the Planning Act too stringently.  This is having a detrimental effect on planning throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Finally, I feel that I should say a few words on the introduction of section 2 of the Offences Against the State Act.  I may be subject to correction on this but it is my opinion that the last Government to introduce this section were the inter-Party or Coalition Government, in 1957.</P>

      <P>They discovered before they left office in 1957 that they had to reintern people and many arrests were made.  I will stick to my point on that. One thing that we must remember is that we are all governed by a code of behaviour.  If a code of behaviour is acceptable to the vast majority of our people I see no reason why any particular minority should get preferential treatment.  They too should abide by the code of behaviour most acceptable to the majority.  It is for that reason that we should not lend our support to any of those minority groups that tend to carry out acts of lawlessness today.  It is noticeable from some of the Opposition speakers yesterday that they are endeavouring to woo the support of those minority groups for particular reasons that are known only to themselves.  If they are <Col N="274" /> really concerned with the future of the country no responsible political party should lend their support to any subversive organisation or group of people who have not the interest of our country at heart.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution might be a bit of an anti-climax, as many of the speakers have ranged widely over the whole scope of this Bill, and these are just a few hobby horses I wish to ride.</P>
      <P>I want to start at the primary level of education and consider the position of the people being trained as primary teachers.  I talked about this matter in the House before and I have always advocated the training of primary teachers with every other kind of teacher in the university environment. I still think it is wrong to put this grade of teacher into a separate institution where he meets nobody but people who are in the same line of business as himself. I am quite certain that the calibre of people going into training institutions for primary teachers is very high, higher indeed than the calibre of those coming into the university.  However, while they get a high level of training I do not think that matters so much as the broadening of the outlook which comes from mixing with a variety of people during this training period.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Quinlan talking about the secondary teachers and their problems.  I believe that if primary and secondary teachers were trained together many of these questions of prestige, which seem to be creating difficulties at present would never arise and the difficulties about salaries could be solved more easily.  Senator Quinlan made a suggestion about the secondary teachers' strike which appears to be pending.  Of course I should be very glad to co-operate with him in any way possible in that respect. I sincerely hope it will not come to a head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking about secondary education, the minority to which I belong&mdash;not any political minority but a different kind of minority&mdash;appreciates very much the sympathetic attitude of Ministers for Education towards the proof <Col N="275" /> vision of assistance towards free secondary education for all the children of this country.  There is a particular problem in our area because of the scattered nature of this section of the population, but we have found the Minister sympathetic.  I do not think the problem has been resolved but we do look forward to further sympathetic consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I saw an announcement in the press lately about the likelihood of there being established a protestant comprehensive school in Cork.  I welcome this very heartily indeed.  I was at one time an officer of an organisation, an incorporated society responsible for three Protestant schools in the Cork area, and I know the difficulties they have had.  On behalf of that society I have had on a number of occasions to go down and meet the Cork people.  Needless to say as a Dublin man venturing into Cork on a mission like that I did not resolve all the difficulties, but I think we got a certain distance.  The answer is a single school for the area, and I think the idea of a comprehensive school is to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The question of higher education and the need for increased support for it was referred to by Senator Quinlan. Being involved in it myself, I thoroughly agree with his comments there.  Compared with institutions in Belfast and with corresponding places in England, we have a very poor student-staff ratio.  We should try to improve that.  On the other hand, I am not in agreement with Senator Quinlan in his reference to what he calls the unanimous agreement reached between the four university colleges on the future of university education.  I regard the solution put forward by that group as very unsatisfactory, particularly as far as professional education is concerned and, in the area of professional education, particularly in relation to the medical school position. I need hardly stress that there was no medical man on that group which reached the so-called unanimous agreement. There were a few medical men on a small working party and they discussed the position but the proposals which came forward from that other <Col N="276" /> party were not presented unanimously. There was a strong feeling that they would not work.  Of course, the staff of the medical school in TCD have rejected the proposals that were put forward.  These proposals are now being considered.</P>
    <P>In any area in this part of the world, a population of two or three million people is regarded as a reasonably sized population for a medical school. On that basis, we in the Republic would rate one university school.  Of course, we realise that the position in Cork and Galway is rather special.  If these centres were to be deprived of their medical schools the quality of the health services would deteriorate. Therefore, they should continue to have them.  They should be good medical schools and not some sort of second rate cousins to the institutions in Dublin. They should be supported fully even if they are not as big as the type of institution that would be required for economic operation.  I do not believe that even by the end of this century, Dublin will have a population of 1,000,000 people.  Why, then, should we have two university schools here?  This makes no sense to me.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal also that perhaps the difficulty could be resolved to some extent by having two preclinical schools and one school at the clinical level.  There are to be two separate and dependent universities and these two are entitled to run a single clinical school for the last three years of the student's course.  For the past seven or eight years the same kind of situation has prevailed in the dental hospital.  There is one dental hospital school which is run by three dental schools in Dublin.  Each professor in the dental hospital is also a professor in TCD, in UCD and in the College of Surgeons and no one has any right to interfere with his work in any way. I cannot see how any better solution could be reached by trying to run one clinical medical school by one single body.  That would not work.  The operation would be too complicated to be realistic.</P>
    <P>I associate myself with the remarks made by Senator Quinlan in relation to the late Donogh O'Malley who, as <Col N="277" /> Minister for Education, put forward the proposal for a university merger in Dublin.  However, I notice that what the Senator said did not tally with what he is reported to have said recently at a meeting in London.  I would hope that the present Minister for Education would show the same vision and the same courage in his approach to this problem as did his predecessor.</P>
    <P>The next aspect of higher education on which I should like to comment is that of hospital training of prospective doctors.  The clinical teaching of doctors is extremely important.  The whole quality of our medical service depends on this teaching but it has been the cinderella of all education in this country up to now.  The reason is that it falls between two Departments, the Department of Health and the Department of Education.  The Department of Health are responsible for hospitals as places where people who are ill go for treatment while the Department of Education are responsible for education but that is based on the universities.  The universities do not own the hospital and, consequently, see no reason why they should spend any money on them.</P>
    <P>Recently we witnessed the opening of that very fine new teaching hospital, the new St. Vincent's at Elm Park.  This is a splendid institution and without having seen it in any great detail, I would venture to bet that the clinical facilities far surpass the respective facilities that are available to professors of the universities.  Before the end of this century I expect we will have at least two more new hospitals. I hope that one of them will be associated with the medical school run at present from TCD.  I hope, also, that this hospital will be situated on the site of the present St. Kevin's Hospital. We have been working on this now for a few years.  When the time comes for this hospital to be built it is my hope that the Ministers for Health and Education will be able to persuade the Minister for Finance to give them sufficient support to make the hospital not only a good hospital capable of producing the best medical services but also that it will be a good place for teaching.</P>
    <P>Recently, a group were brought <Col N="278" /> together by the Departments of Health and Education.  This was the first time that this type of co-operation occurred. The group represented all medical schools in Dublin and they made recommendations simultaneously to the two Departments as to the amount of accommodation required by the medical schools.  The amount required is substantial and would cost at least £½ million to provide.  However, that is not as much as 10 per cent of the cost of producing a hospital as an institution and if the Minister has spent £5 million or £6 million on producing a new hospital, an extra £500,000 spent on providing good teaching facilities will be justified.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would refer briefly to the position in relation to research, in particular medical research.  Of course, this is related directly to education, in particular it is related to post-graduate and vocational training.  Our medical research council receives a grant of £100,000 per annum.  That amount represents 0.007 per cent of our gross national product.  In Britain, the Medical Research Council receive £20 million per annum.  That represents 0.05 per cent of their gross national product. In other words, they receive seven times the portion of the GNP that ours receive.  The amount given here is too little.  I may not be quite in order in speaking about this because the money comes not from the Appropriation Bill but from the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>

      <P>May I remind the Minister for Finance that this means he spends nothing at all on medical research?  This must be the only country in the world which from its central Budget has no provision at all for medical research.  I should just like to ask him to reflect on that and to see if he can say, £ for £, what the Hospitals Trust Fund, which is just a charity, gathers throughout the world to support our hospitals and compare it with the small amount which is given to research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to that there is one last <Col N="279" /> point to be made, that is, that there are a number of bodies interested in research which, one way or another, impinge on medicine or health.  There is the Medical Research Council; the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, which at the moment are looking for proposals for producing equipment which is mainly of interest to doctors, particularly surgeons; the Agricultural Research Institute which have to do greatly with nutrition and other social problems; the Economic and Social Research Institute; the Medical and Social Research Board; and finally the National Science Council. The Minister for Finance supports all of these except the Medical Research Council and the Medical Research Board which are supported by the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    <P>I wonder has the Minister ever thought about a mechanism for coordinating the activities of all these bodies.  I do not think there is one.  If you happen to be on more than one there are informal arrangements for finding out what each is doing.  Some co-ordination should be aimed at because between all of these organisations a great deal of money is spent.  I hope the Minister will find some means of dealing with this.</P>

      <P>The Appropriation Bill covers a very wide area of Government activity and it is true to say that no one can accuse the Seanad of not availing of the opportunity to discuss every area of Government expenditure and indeed, to range further afield.  During the past three days we have heard very many fine contributions.  I was specially impressed by the contributions of Senators Kelly and Keery.  Speaking at this Stage of the Appropriation Bill and Finance Bill one is left with very very little to say so I would like to address my few remarks to the amendment in the names of Senators O'Higgins and Kelly relating to Part II of the Offences Against the State Act.  It has been touched upon by most Senators who have spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I heard them right when they said that not only does the Act <Col N="280" /> give powers of internment to the Government but it even gives powers of internment to individual Ministers who under their seal&mdash;I can be corrected if I am wrong in this&mdash;can order the internment of any citizen.  A very interesting situation would have arisen if this Act had been in operation last May.  I wonder would the recent arms trial have taken place and all that it revealed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it.  Let us imagine what would happen in the Six Counties if this Act were introduced in the Republic.  We would be giving the green light to the Government in Stormont to introduce their Special Powers Act and one would hate to think of what would happen if that were introduced in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>I realise that if the Act were introduced here we would immediately have the announcement of the reintroduction of the Special Powers Act in the Six Counties.  While we would hope for a more civilised approach to the operation of the Offences Against the State Act in the Republic, We could not hope for the same treatment if the Special Powers Act were introduced in the Six Counties.  All the opponents of the Government would be rounded up and interned, and they would not include the Craigs, the Wests or the Paisleys. Those who are engaged in fighting for civil rights would be quickly put out of circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I add my voice to that of Senator Kennedy and Senator Desmond who made an appeal from those benches yesterday for the withdrawal of even the threat of the Act being put into force.  We have to remember that we are speaking of an Act that was introduced during the emergency in 1940, 30 years ago.  We have a new generation who do not know the implications of the Act about which we have been talking during the past 14 days.  It is a most obnoxious Act.  It is one of the worst ever put on the Statute Book in our 50 years history of self-government. Not only would I appeal for the threat to be withdrawn, but I would appeal <Col N="281" /> that this Act might be withdrawn from the Statute Book altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with very great interest to the speech of Senator Fitzgerald.  As a lawyer, imprisonment without charge is anathema to me. There are, however, some aspects of the matter which strike me as strange. The Act to which the Senator refers has been in existence since 1940.  It is there as a big stick to be used in special circumstances.  What the Taoiseach said recently was, if I may paraphrase it: &ldquo;There are certain circumstances in existence at the moment which in the view of the Government threaten the very life of the nation.  I want to warn those concerned that unless they have second thoughts we have this big stick and they leave us with no alternative but to use it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the substance of what the Taoiseach said.  That is all that has happened.  We have heard many statements expressed in favour of the principle which we all hold very dear and that is that in ordinary circumstances, and unless the very life of the nation is threatened, we should not have imprisonment without trial.  We must, however, be pragmatic and realistic and appreciate that in a small country a proportion of the community feel entitled to refer to themselves as the military organisation of the nation, a situation which does not apply to other countries.  We must also realise that, although this Statute has been on the Statute Book since 1940, on two occasions since then, Senator Fitzgerald's party have been in power and a member of his party was Minister for Justice.  I am sorry the Senator has left.  There were two Coalition Governments.  It would have been open to them, if they wished, to repeal the Offences Against the State Act.  They did not do so.  I personally do not blame them for not doing so, because again they were pragmatic; again they realised that the circumstances in this little country are not similar to circumstances in other democratic countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Circumstances are not normal in this country where you have people holding themselves out to be the military organisations, referring to some of their <Col N="282" /> members as chiefs of staff.  There are all kinds of officers and sub-officers; there is the publication of bulletins and so on.  This is not a situation which exists in other countries.  Unfortunately, we have that kind of thing here owing to our unhappy history and owing to the unhappy division of our country. We must realise that it could apply only in the case of a country such as this.</P>
    <P>Therefore, with great respect to both Senators Fitzgerald, I would say that they were probably correct when they were in power in not having repealed that Act.  I cannot see that very much blame can be attached to the Taoiseach because he indicated to certain sections of this community who hold life cheaply, who hold property rights as non-existent, that if they do not learn to behave themselves the powers are there to insist that they do so and to insist that the rule of law shall be preserved in this country.</P>
    <P>In the past three years, unfortunately, we have had a situation which militated against the economic progress of previous years.  The blame for that cannot lie at the door of the Government. We have led the international stakes in strikes and strike attitudes.  We have had a complete absence of co-operative themes and co-operative relations between trade unions.  We have had the unfortunate situation where certain small organisations, because they control the most sensitive economic arteries of the country, were in a position to hold the knife to those arteries and to insist on demands which grievously damaged the economy of the country and which would have no other effect on the psychology of workers generally than to make them dissatisfied with themselves.</P>
    <P>This is a most unfortunate situation. Although I have the greatest respect for the trade unions, I cannot help but feel that some of the responsibility for this must lie at the door of the trade unions.  We were told by Ministers up to three years ago that the trade unions of Ireland could draft their own trade union legislation to enable them to control their own members, to enable them to control recalcitrant unions among themselves.  Nothing <Col N="283" /> was done.  The result is that the progress which was being made of 5 per cent and 4 per cent increases in national product sank to about 3¾ per cent in 1969 and so far I doubt if it will reach even 3 per cent in 1970.</P>
    <P>We had the cement strike which held the entire building industry up to ransom, though a relatively small number of men were concerned; we had a group of people who are better paid than their counterparts anywhere else in Europe outside Switzerland&mdash;the banks&mdash;who held the whole economy up to ransom for almost six months.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances the people of Ireland in general must have welcomed the introduction by the Minister for Finance of the Prices and Incomes Bill.  It is nearly time that people realised that there are not two sides but three sides to a bargain regarding wages and incomes.  There are the employers and the employees, out there also are the general public.  The Minister felt his obligation to the general public.  The employers and the employees chose to get together to settle their differences on a basis which would be fair and reasonable to the general public.  After lengthy sessions which extended over a long period they were either unable or unwilling to do so.</P>
    <P>It was in the light of that that the Minister for Finance felt compelled to introduce the Prices and Incomes Bill. Let us hope that they have solved their problems in a way which will be to the benefit of the general public.  In those circumstances anyone could or would take exception if the Prices and Incomes Bill were withdrawn, but I feel that it should be withdrawn in such circumstances as would leave it open to those people to realise that if their agreement does not work out through bad faith on either side similar steps will be and can be taken in the future.  In the circumstances, and while the necessity existed, it was an excellent piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister for Finance when he was dealing with the matter.  He found, in such a short period as Minister, that <Col N="284" /> he had to collect in a very short period a sum of £21 million.  He was left with a very limited period of time in which he should decide how to get it.  Therefore, if I criticise the manner in which this tax has been raised I do so in the hope that before the next Finance Bill the Minister may have an opportunity of looking into it more fully and perhaps amending some of the forms of taxation for which he has provided in this Bill.  The £21 million was provided by, firstly, a reduction of £7 million in Government expenditure.  What we really need are anti-inflationary measures and certainly nobody could allege that that is inflationary.  For that reason it is to be welcomed. A sum of £8.5 million is to be raised by borrowing.  In this regard I would have certain doubts. Either that amount of money will have to be borrowed at home or it will have to be borrowed on the foreign exchanges. In either case I fear that it may be inflationary rather than anti-inflationary. If it is borrowed at home it is taking from the savings of the people to be utilised on capital items, and therefore I feel it will be inflationary. If it is borrowed abroad, it is borrowed again not to increase our capital assets and for that reason I feel it may be inflationary, too.  However, in the circumstances it would appear that there is no alternative to it and therefore one cannot quarrel with it too much.</P>
    <P>The aspect of that Bill with which I would be inclined to find most fault is the increase in company taxation. In my view productivity is an attitude of mind.  To the <i>entrepreneur</i> nothing is impossible if he has the will and the determination to do it.  To say that we are a capitalist country is utter nonsense because while many of the buildings, the factories and the large stores and shops may belong to private individuals, they are, in the end result, stone and mortar which nobody can take with him.  It matters very little from the point of view of the public if they are owned by the State or if they are owned by the people.</P>
    <P>The only thing that would make a difference is who takes the profits.  In any company in this country heretofore, <Col N="285" /> if a profit were made the Government took approximately half of it&mdash; 10s in the £&mdash;between income tax and corporation tax.  It is just too bad if a loss were inflicted.  The people who own the company have got to pay and bear the loss.  Possibly 10s in the £ might be considered fair, although it is in excess of that paid in other countries.  Out of what is left&mdash;the remaining 10s, the capitalist, as we call him, has not only to service the money put up for the business but he has also to put reserves back in because anyone will realise that if you are to replace machines the new machines will cost approximately three times the price that was paid for machines three years ago.  Also, provision has to be made against a number of contingencies.  For example, when the British Government imposed the import deposit of 10 per cent it had to be paid on all goods exported to England and that money had to be found.  If the finances of a company are tight, if their liquid capital is short, if they have to go to the bank, the money may not be readily available.</P>
    <P>It is most important that companies should be able to provide reserves.  To suggest that the provision of reserves is a kind of hidden profit of the share-holders&mdash;as is sometimes done by Labour speakers&mdash;is utter nonsense. Where it goes is not into the pockets of the shareholders but back into further buildings, further machinery, further expansion.  To suggest that when shareholders get bonus shares they are any better off is also utter nonsense because it is the same buildings, the same machinery, it is the same capital expanded, and the bonus shares merely represent expansion in buildings, machinery and the reserves.</P>
    <P>Progress in a company and progress in economics is really a matter, in my opinion, of an attitude of mind.  It is not what goes out the front door in a factory that counts; it is what goes out the back door.  The manager has first to consider if he is buying in the cheapest market&mdash;where there is multiplicity buying can he buy for a fraction of a penny less?  Having made arrangements for his buying he has got to concentrate, if he is paying the minimum freight, on getting the raw <Col N="286" /> materials from their place of manufacture to his factory door.  He has got to consider how to eliminate rejects where he can, reduce movements where he can, make saving where he can, and eliminate losses.</P>
    <P>It is an attitude of mind.  Heretofore, he and his directors had been getting ulcers and blood pressure by realising that out of every £ they make, for every hour they work, half of it goes to the State; that for every two hours they work, one hour is for the State; that for every four days they work, two days are for the State and two days for the company.  If you say to them that, out of every five days you work, three days are for the State and two days for your own company, it will have a very depressing psychological effect on them.</P>
    <P>This is what I fear most.  The absence of enthusiasm in many cases prevents people from starting.  This enthusiasm, I fear, will be killed if we should go above the 50 per cent.  Let us suppose a draper's shop prices a thing at 19s 11d instead of at £1.  If they price an article at £1 Os 1d the psychological effect will prevent people from buying.</P>
    <P>This provision in the Bill will undoubtedly have a very bad psychological effect.  It will prevent companies from setting aside adequate reserves to ensure that they will progress.  It is no use giving companies grants and special loans: usually companies which seek such assistance are sinking and are seeking every advantage of State aid.  They are not really progressive. The companies to be assisted are those that have the proper attitude of mind, and I fear that this extra taxation will interfere seriously with such companies. The £5 million which this tax is supposed to bring in will be a very high price to pay.  As I said earlier, I appreciate the problems facing the Minister.  I should like to see a company that do not spend money on dividends, that do not spend an undue share of their profits on directors' fees, that plough practically all of their profits back coming out with a special low taxation.  Heretofore, up to a few years ago we had the unfortunate situation that a man who was worth a <Col N="287" /> quarter of a million pounds could die and would not have to pay any death duties.  That was a very sad and improper situation.  He could have formed himself into a private company, he could have given control of the company to 100 shares, 5 per cent preference shares, which enables him to control the company and draw what he likes out of it and do what he likes with it; but when he dies he is only worth £100.  I am glad to say that that situation has been altered.</P>
    <P>Today we have a situation in which a man in private practice, as a professional or otherwise, finds that he has to pay tax and surtax&mdash;on a relatively small figure he is liable to surtax at 16s. in the £&mdash;so that for every £ he makes, he gets only 4s.  For every five days he works there is one day for himself and four for the State.  Perhaps that is as it should be, but our standards of wealth are considerably less than those of other countries.  If the person concerned formed his business into a company he could be making £20,000, £50,000 or £100,000 and still pay only 10s. in the £, because the company, although he is the owner, are liable for only 10s. in the £.  What he did instead was that he had himself paid directors' fees.  He then paid to his family so as to bring them all up to £8,000&mdash;but none of them paid more than 10s. in the £ and they still had a substantial income of perhaps £40,000 or £50,000; but none of them paid 16s. in the £.  In the ordinary course of events at £7,000 or £8,000 income, 16s. in the £ is payable in tax.  Very substantial sums were also paid out in dividends.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a tax structure for companies whereby special allowances would be made where the amounts are not drawn out of the companies in directors' fees beyond certain normal, reasonable amounts. The same would apply to dividends. I feel that that would have brought in a certain amount of the additional tax provided for in this Bill and would not have the same regressive effect on companies.</P>
    <P>It would be in the interest of the economy if the Minister could see his <Col N="288" /> way to look into this whole matter of the tax structure on companies between now and the next Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like, first of all, to say how pleased I am to have an opportunity of discussing the recent announcement by the Taoiseach because I should like the House to know that there has been considerable concern expressed in the universities, and as a university representative I should like to bring this before the House.  As a university representative, I have been asked by my constituents to explain what is going on and all I have been able to say is what I have read in the newspapers.  I said I felt the Taoiseach would not make such a special announcement had there not been some good cause.  Since this matter involved Members of the Oireachtas I think it was a matter of sufficient seriousness to have warranted an announcement by the Taoiseach jointly with the leaders of the two Opposition parties.  All politicians are involved in this.  It is an extremely serious matter and some co-operation on this internment announcement would be welcome and would have made it acceptable to the general public.</P>
      <P>I am glad this is only an announcement and I sincerely hope that the Offences Against the State Act will not have to be invoked.  In the case of wrongful internment of any citizen there would be a tremendous howl, certainly from my constituents, some of whom make their views heard in a very forceful way.  University graduates and undergraduates feel very strongly about this measure and we hope it will not be invoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a great deal of sympathy with members of the Garda during this period of unrest.  Their job is a difficult one and reading through last year's debate on the Appropriation Bill the late Senator Sheehy Skeffington made some remarks about the conditions under which the gardaí operate.  I am <Col N="289" /> glad that the recommendations of the Conroy Commission have brought an improvement and I urge the Minister for Justice to keep up the good work, because we must have an efficient and contented police force.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the House for not having this information this morning, but I should like now to say that gratuities to Army officers&mdash;this comes under the Estimate for the Minister for Defence&mdash;are not paid to unmarried officers.  This is a serious form of discrimination against single men.  I am a single man myself and I have sympathy with them that gratuities on retirement are paid only to married officers.  If this is correct it should be rectified.  Why should a single officer who has given the same number of years receive any less emolument at the end of his career than a married man?</P>
    <P>Next, I should like to talk about the situation in the North of Ireland.  I should like to have the words &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; used officially instead of that unpleasant term, &ldquo;Six Counties.&rdquo;  As a Protestant Member of the Seanad, I should be able to make a special contribution in helping relations between these two parts of the country.  I observe, as a minority representative in the Seanad, that the representation in the Seanad reflects roughly the distribution in the country as a whole.  I am glad to be able to say this to the Minister for Finance because some years ago I heard him express some very strong and sensible views on the role of the minority.  I say on my own behalf that I regard myself as an Irishman.  I have no allegiance to any other country.  I live a happy and contented life in the Republic of Ireland. I have extremely good relations with my Roman Catholic neighbours and I feel that I can and would like to play the fullest role in the life of the country. The Protestant minority have been generously treated by successive Governments, and I hope that this treatment will continue.  As a Protestant, it is important to say&mdash;and it may reassure some of my co-religionists in the North&mdash;that our life in this part of the country and our relations are extremely happy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> However, whereas we feel that discrimination here is very slight, if one looks from outside there are points which could cause considerable concern, and I believe do cause concern to the Protestant people in the North. I have spent quite a lot of my time in the North of Ireland: ever since I was small I had my summer holidays of about six or eight weeks there.  I make frequent visits and have very strong contacts with members of all communities in the North of Ireland and I can give some reasonable opinions on what the people in the North feel.</P>
    <P>The Protestants there must view with some concern the special position of the church, the restrictions on family planning, the specifically denominational schools and hospitals.  I should like to mention in this regard, the concern with which I viewed the statement of the Archbishop of Dublin at the opening of St. Vincent's Hospital.  He outlined his intention that that should be a specifically Catholic hospital.  This is a very big hospital which will be one of the major hospitals in the south of the city, and it will obviously have a large number of Protestant patients.  I know there are areas in which this can cause conflict and my plea would be that we should have reached the stage where we can get away from specifically Catholic hospitals or specifically Protestant schools and we should regard things as being Christian and in the truest Irish tradition.</P>
    <P>We should not in any sense be playing off one denomination against another.  I am very much in favour of education in which all denominations come together.  The more that can be done in this regard by the Department of Education and by the universities the better.  I welcome the recent moves of the hierarchy towards Trinity College.  These are very important steps and I think they will greatly help relations in this part of the country and indeed they will certainly affect them in the North.</P>
    <P>While I am talking about what I consider to be some of the basic rights of the minority in the South, I should mention one thing that causes more friction than anything else I have referred <Col N="291" /> to and that is the <i>ne temere</i> decree.  It is a real barrier to harmony.</P>
    <P>I should now like to make some constructive remarks about what one can do to improve North-South relations. For example, I am pleased that my home town, Midleton, is involved in a twin-town arrangement with Coleraine. It has worked out extremely well; we learn a tremendous amount from those contacts and I am very pleased that Midleton has made an arrangement of this type with a town in the North of Ireland.  I advocate this sort of working together.  I should like to see interchange of university staffs from North and South.  I am involved in trying to do something about this at the moment.  I should like to see interchange of teachers in the schools.  This is a matter for the Department of Education.  I recently heard of an anomaly in this respect; a teacher in Belfast had been teaching Irish for 11 years in a school there and had been teaching the children something about the national identity they had, whether they liked it or not.  She came to teach in this part of the country and found that her service was not recognised. At that time Northern Ireland was classified along with the underdeveloped countries for purposes of recognition of teaching service.  This is fantastic.  I am not sure if this is the most up to the minute information, but if it is, surely this situation should be rectified and surely we should encourage exchanges at all levels&mdash; exchanges in universities, exchanges in schools and another important exchange would be exchanges of priests?  I know that there are some moves afoot to encourage priests in the Church of Ireland who work mainly south of the Border to interchange with Church of Ireland people north of the Border, and I hope that this will happen in all the churches, not just the Church of Ireland.  I am sure it would be of great benefit to everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>While talking about the North, I should like to thank Senators, particularly Senator Brugha and Senator Cranitch, for their remarks.  They were sensible and those sort of remarks can only help the situation.  We want to be <Col N="292" /> constructive.  Senator Keery pointed out the existence of the inter-Department committee: the inter-Departmental unit in the Department of External Affairs which is specifically studying northern problems.  I hope to make contact with this unit.  It has not got enough publicity, and we should all direct our remarks towards it in a constructive way.</P>
    <P>Just before the adjournment I was particularly enthralled by Senator Cranitch's description of his experiences with Orange parades and I wondered, when we adjourned, if he would lead the House marching out through the door with suitable traditional music and flags and banners.</P>
    <P>I should also like to touch on the subject of education.  I have mentioned the recognition of service for teaching abroad.  It is high time we modernised our ideas and did not just restrict ourselves to recognising service in underdeveloped countries and countries where we go for language qualifications. The more experience we can get in developed countries, the better for our teachers.  I certainly have benefited very much from spells in the UK and the United States.</P>
    <P>I echo Senator Jessop's plea for harmony between the Department of Education and the teaching organisations. His suggestion that primary training should come under the university umbrella is an excellent one.  It could help to solve a lot of the problems that we have with the various organisations vying on matters of salary and conditions.  It is a very sad situation and it is not entirely the teachers' fault: the Department must take at least half the blame.  Senator Quinlan's suggestion that the university representatives in the Seanad could get together and meet the officials of the Department and also representatives of the teachers' unions is an excellent one, and we should like to play our part in any rapprochement and healing of the breach and we certainly hope that talk of strikes and action of that type can be averted.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make.  We have entered an era of comprehensive education and I know there is a problem.  Comprehensive <Col N="293" /> education has many good points but there is a problem for a certain group of children, perhaps 15 per cent or less, who are not quite as intellectually as strong, or perhaps they are slower developers than the main body of pupils in the class.  I should like to see some special provision made by the Department of Education for training teachers to deal specifically with this problem.  Up to now we have had streamed education, especially of the secondary level, but this presents a new problem.  It is a very difficult problem to solve.  Having done some school teaching myself, I know it requires special training and often requires special gifts on the part of the teacher to deal in a mixed group with pupils who are not just quite as strong as the others.  I hope the Department will make special allowances for this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased Estimate for Social Welfare.  I was particularly interested in Senator Ryan's remarks about our stance between capitalism and socialism.  I think we are somewhere between the two, and what we should do in this country is to achieve as fair and as just a balance as is possible between these philosophies.</P>
    <P>There is one social welfare problem I should like to mention.  A lot of work has been done behind the scenes by local authorities regarding the settling of itinerants.  I think that the itinerants all wish to settle.  They may have problems, they may still have in some cases a desire to wander even though they have been settled.  However, I think they all realise there is no future for their children in the travelling life and they want them to get the benefit of an education and of a settled life. Any support that we, as individuals, or the Department of Social Welfare or Local Government, can give the bodies who are settling the itinerants is most valuable.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention the problem of conservation.  There is legislation pending on this matter and I look forward to it very much.  I hope the legislation has some teeth because it must deal with a rapidly deteriorating situation.  We need a new authority which will deal with all problems of conservation and which will give us a <Col N="294" /> coherent national plan on the many problems which come up under the conservation heading.  These include pollution, land use, industrial development, preservation of old buildings and buildings of historical interest.  Having regard to the situation of Dublin at the moment, the deterioration in the Dublin Bay area, the pollution which hangs over the city caused by the increasing number of cars and related problems, we need strong legislation and we need it fast.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The increased revenue for the postage and telephone services must be justified by better qualities of service.  I have noticed in my few days in the House that the telephones from Leinster House are just as bad when it comes to interference, with people breaking in on other lines, as they are in other parts of the city.  If the Post Office is going to increase the charges it has got to increase the quality of the service.  I have received a large number of complaints recently about the quality of the telephone lines, the quality of the reproduction, which is often poor and subject to interruption, and I hope that the Department will deal quickly with these problems.</P>
    <P>In regard to our entry into the European Economic Community, this will be one of the most important decisions this country will ever make.  Our decision, to my mind, is based on negative reasons because we seem to depend so much on what Britain is doing.  I would emphasise Senator Quinlan's warning on the change of outlook in the European Economic Community.  I think that they have become less outward-looking and we need more relevant information, especially about the parts of the economy which are going to suffer.</P>
    <P>I hope if we go in that our agriculture will be geared to taking advantage of the opportunities of the higher prices.  This will necessitate a great effort on the part of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in research into the production, processing and marketing of our agricultural goods. We need to work fast on the industries <Col N="295" /> which will undergo tremendous change and suffer terrific competition when they come into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I would ask that when the official documents are issued they do not hedge on the industries and sectors of our economy which are going to suffer when we go into the EEC.  From reading one booklet, <i>The Membership of the European Communities; Implications for Ireland</i>, laid by the Government before each House of the Oireachtas in April, 1970, I regard the sections on the industries for which the outlook is not so bright as distinctly evasive. The first one that comes to my mind is horticulture.  I will not bore the House by reading the section, but it is distinctly evasive and we want more clear information.  If the information is pessimistic then we must have it, because we have got to make up our minds on the basis of the full picture of the European economic situation and our application to join the Community.</P>
    <P>I would like to end by echoing Senator Quinlan's plea that the Seanad be used more; that we move towards a system of government which involves joint work between the parties; involves more committee work and gives an opportunity for all Members of the House, whether members of a party or Independents, to work together for a more efficient parliamentary system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to congratulate Senator West on his contribution to the debate and on his maiden contribution this morning. I think we will all agree that the tone he struck is the kind of tone that we like in the Seanad.  It was a contribution which will add to the weight of opinion that democracy is essentially government by discussion.  Perhaps it is permitted to me to say that the Minister who is present encourages one when debating measures here to think that the discussion is not a waste of effort and perhaps that note may be taken of points that are made.  I think it is also right to say that we do not have too much politics here and if there are some politics in my speech it will be based on the proposition that something does not cease to be true because it is a point made against a political party by a member of another political <Col N="296" /> party.  I shall later on be making some points of this kind as being points which, I think, could be listened to by the members of the Government Party, as I would expect them to be listened to if I were a member of that party.  I certainly should make those points if I were&mdash;perhaps not in public&mdash;so that they could be weighed by anyone who had to make important decisions.  The party in Government is, of course, carrying a great burden of responsibility for the effect on the whole community of the decisions it makes.</P>
      <P>Senator Nash who, unfortunately, has left the House, did say&mdash;and I think it is right that this point should be questioned right away&mdash;that the Government were not in any way responsible for the inflation.  I give you the following words, and they are not my words:</P>
      <P>The strength of the public expenditure factor, as an inflationary force in Ireland, can be gauged by comparing the rate of increase in Government expenditure with the rate of increase in national production.  The disproportion is great even when gross national product is taken in monetary, as distinct from real terms, and it is tending to become greater. Total Government expenditure has been increasing in the last three years at an average annual rate of about 18 per cent, as against an average rate of increase in real gross national product of about 4 per cent and in nominal or money gross national product of about 11 per cent.  Current expenditure has been increasing at an accelerating rate, recording a 13 per cent rise in 1967-68, a 14 per cent in 1968-69, 17 per cent in 1969-70 and probably over 19 per cent this year.  Making all allowance for the interaction of inclement cost increases and public expenditure it is evident that we have here a powerful inflationary force in its own right.</P>
      <P>The words are not mine; the words are those taken from an address by Dr. Whitaker, Governor of the Central Bank, when he addressed the Business and Economic Society of Trinity College, Dublin on 24th November last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here in this Second Reading <Col N="297" /> debate, to consider in combination not merely the Appropriation Bill but the Finance Bill as well.  I must refer first to the Finance Bill because it is of primary interest to me.  The first observation one must make of the Finance (No. 2) Bill is to ask why was it not in Finance (No. 1) Bill? What new facts have emerged?  We had a debate last July when we had a Finance Bill handled by the same Minister and I am endeavouring to give him an escape by saying that I did not attach a great deal of importance to collective responsibility, that obviously it was not his Bill.  It was the Fianna Fáil Government's Bill and it is their responsibility if we are doing now what they think they should have done last April or May.</P>
    <P>In my speech on that Second Reading, I said I felt very strongly that in an inflationary situation, in a time of increased money expenditure, what was most needed was a reduction of expenditure rather than raising taxation. I must commend the Minister for his reply to this idea.  I am not going to call on him for details of the expenditure he is going to cut back. I am going to say quite firmly that I think he is absolutely right in cutting back expenditure.  Of course, it is a difficult art, it is a difficult matter of judgment, as to what you can cut back which will not be injurious, particularly which will not affect people's employment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will be able to deal with the following points.  I am told that when higher civil servants travel abroad they always travel first-class. We all know about Christmas cards and I am not going to emphasise them.  We all know about the closed circuit television to comfort members of the Oireachtas.  We all walk on scrumptious carpets in our different party rooms.  We all know that in the Department the Minister has occupied &mdash;it may be true of all Departments&mdash; one could not go in to discuss anything but one sat down with two civil servants, generally on the basis that presumably you were going to mislead the Government in some fashion. These items are insignificant but they are a specimen which, being analysed, <Col N="298" /> discloses the condition of the patient. There has been a great deal of waste in public expenditure over the years and it is very important, indeed, that the line which the Minister has taken on this is followed rigorously and firmly and not abandoned.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to talk too much about what I said in that speech but I think I recommended more direct taxation.  If there must be additional taxation I believe the taxation ought to be direct.  I realise it must be very tedious for the Minister to have to listen to what is being said which he has heard many times from other people but, perhaps, I may be able to say something new.  I do think that the changed basis for the taxation of companies has been a very bad error indeed.  To give a short account of the history of the matter, when the corporation profits tax was 15 per cent it was then not deductible in determining what was assessable for income tax.  Then it became deductible and because it became deductible they raised the rate to 23 per cent.  We have reached the stage when we must revert to the first condition but the raised rate of 23 per cent is now not deductible when the original rate of 15 per cent was not deductible.  I can anticipate what the Minister may wish to say on this.  However, the vast majority of Irish companies are not going to be affected by this increase at all because 80 per cent of Irish companies, will, in fact, be so conducting their affairs that they will absorb the income of the company by the payment of salaries to the partners, because essentially it would be a partnership enterprise.  We are left with 20 per cent of the companies.</P>
    <P>I agree if one could forget the existence of the rest of the world that raising this rate of taxation on people who have companies that are merely holding portfolios as investments is not going to be injurious.  I am not thinking of these companies.  I am thinking of the companies which are manufacturing or industrial companies that are productive enterprises.  There is no doubt at all that this is quite simply a tax on savings.  In the same year in which a savings instalment scheme is introduced we introduce a <Col N="299" /> tax to take away savings of companies and corporations, which would be available for these corporations to generate development and increase employment.  I think this is a very bad blunder.  A short definition of capital employed in these kind of companies is demand for labour.  If you take increased taxation from these companies you take away the funds they have got at their disposal to enable them to provide and generate additional employment.</P>
    <P>I think, even at this late stage, the Minister might seriously consider amending the Finance (No. 2) Bill so that at least it does not apply to manufacturing companies, as manufacturing companies are defined in the Income Tax Act, 1967, even if it were limited to manufacturing companies that have quoted securities on the Dublin stock exchange.  This is coming in at a time when these companies have to gear themselves to the most severe competition. Many of these companies will go down&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash; and some of the responsibility for this will be attached to a piece of legislation that we are proposing to enact today and tomorrow.</P>
    <P>It is a very grave step to take and is a matter of acute responsibility for this House to see that this step is not taken. Some people have expressed doubts to me as to the basis on which calculations have been made as to how much will be brought in in this year.  The calculations in respect of this year are almost certainly correct because the Revenue Commissioners must have at their disposal the accounts of most of the companies whose trading year ended in the year 1969.  These are the companies whose additional taxation will be reflected in the receipts for this year.</P>
    <P>It is the calculations for the full year and the calculations for subsequent years about which I have the greatest doubt.  We all know that in respect of this year&mdash;it has been said many times and it is convenient that I should repeat it so that I can make my next point&mdash;we will have an increase in taxation for some companies from 50 per cent to 74 per cent.  They will be obliged by law to set aside 74 per <Col N="300" /> cent of their profits to pay for the 58 per cent instead of the 50 per cent taxation which will be payable in January, add the additional 8 per cent payable in the following January, 1971, plus the additional 8 per cent which has to be provided for in respect of the trading year.  That will be a very severe impediment.  In terms of the effect on quotable securities where you just look at the market, it is one of the factors operating.</P>
    <P>I am going to suggest to the Minister that in fact the calculations made may be very much more optimistic than they ought to be in respect of the receipts to the revenue in the coming year.  I want to refer to this particular case, of which I am aware.  I practise in a particular profession and if I am faced with a UK company which have an Irish subsidiary, it will be my duty to tell that company that they should close down their Irish subsidiary and run a branch here instead.  They will then have a company managed and controlled from the United Kingdom; not assessable for Irish income tax; assessable for Irish corporation profits tax at a rate of 23 per cent, which would be allowable against the 42½ per cent corporation tax in Britain. They will reduce their potential liability of 58 per cent to 23 per cent, and thereby save 35 per cent.  The effect of this must be to lose a substantial amount of income tax to the Irish revenue.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that if an Irish company wants to save what I calculate as 3s 1d in the £ tax it can do so by moving into the United Kingdom and running its affairs from there.  They do not have to do anything more than go through the motions of having board meetings in England, as the law stands at present.  Matters can be so arranged that the assets stay outside the range of capital gains taxation.  There is no doubt about the latter proposition.  No one can tell me that these companies will not go over there because of the capital gains taxation.  They will be able to organise their affairs so that they can stay outside the range of capital gains taxation.  So they will be organised and there will be loss of <Col N="301" /> revenue resulting from this attempt to get more.</P>
    <P>We had this before in 1952 when they raised the tax on whiskey to the point that they actually got a reduced receipt from the tax.  This will be the result of this move.  The provisions could be there if it were thought wise to have them there.  There are a lot of well-off people in this country.  Some of them were domiciled in Ireland and some of them have come here and made it their home.  They came here at a time when they were attracted by the tax arrangements that could be made for them, as compared to the provisions in Britain.  They have investment trust companies and it is quite simple for them to move these investment portfolios outside Ireland to somewhere where there may be no tax.  If you are in a situation where you pay 58 per cent tax the position where you pay no tax is very attractive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the new basis for taxation of companies when I was unfortunately interrupted for an hour and a half.  I should like to say one or two further things on that subject.  Investment portfolios at the moment are handled by investment trust companies.  Some portion of them are certain now to move elsewhere.  I know there are considerable objections to introducing laws here which would be similar to those in British legislation with regard to the transfer of capital abroad in order to avoid taxation.  The objection particularly arises from the fact that people have come here because of the advantages, from their point of view, of our taxation arrangements.  If legislation of this kind is proposed the consequences of it should be more closely considered than is evident in the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility that capital would be transferred abroad should have been considered.  Perhaps it has been considered and I should like the Minister to say what is his assessment of that situation.  I should have thought, and have thought for many years in terms of our taxation, that perhaps we might <Col N="302" /> have one kind of law with regard to people whose domicile of origin is Irish and another kind of law for people whose domicile has become Irish but whose domicile of origin was other than Irish.  I do not know what peculiar difficulties attach to that kind of legislation.  We have a different type of legislation for those who do not gather Irish domicile but there is no particular legislation for those who manage to gather Irish domicile and they are treated in exactly the same way as Irish domiciled persons whose domicile of origin is Irish.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have this stringent type of legislation, then if my calculations are correct, every company, irrespective of who the shareholders may be, whose income after providing for remuneration of employees and officers is in excess of £2,500, will now be paying 11s 6d in the £ taxation, irrespective of the income of the persons entitled to a proprietary share in that company, that is to say, they are paying a rate of taxation which will be half-way between the two early stages of surtax, the 3s and the 6s.  This is a very grave matter and the consequences ought to be considered fully.  I have dealt with that as adequately as I can. I attach great importance to it.  I was in favour of increased direct taxation but not direct taxation of savings available to be ploughed back to employ more people.  I believe the consequences of this will either be a loss in revenue in so far as people will go off to avail of the UK arrangements and save themselves 3s 1d in the £, or there will be an increased demand for employment by Irish companies.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the internment measures recently threatened on the people, because it is fair to say that was what was involved in the Taoiseach's statement.  I am not going to quote what he said; we all know what he said.  Probably on some subjects, particularly social matters like housing, I should be on the extreme left wing of my party or of any party of which I might be a member, but in relation to law enforcement I must put myself, I am afraid, on the other wing.  Nobody would get any support from me for any measure which <Col N="303" /> threatens the security of the State because the security of the State is the protection of the weakest of our citizens. There are responsible people who have talked to me and have said: &ldquo;There is no plot.  This is all part of the Fianna Fáil tradition and part of a continuing contest.&rdquo;  I do not accept this view.  I do not believe for a moment that the Taoiseach would have made this statement without believing it.  I do not believe that he would have been advised of the existence of a plot unless responsible people believed that it existed.  Therefore, I accept that there is a plot.</P>
    <P>It is a very grave and serious situation into which we have drifted.  Why has there not been a campaign of education of the public for this measure? Why was there no consultation with the Opposition?  The Opposition at least can be granted this by Fianna Fáil, that never at any time, in any way, have Fine Gael or the Labour Party, who honourably occupied the Opposition benches in the early days of the State, given any sustenance or succour to groups who marched in uniform or given help to any people who tried to usurp the authority of the State.  Why were we not consulted or told?  Are we not to be trusted?  Is this the position that in 1970, after nearly 50 years of self-government, the Government party cannot trust either of the Opposition parties?  This is outrageous and I protest most strongly about it.  Why were men allowed to march in uniform during the last two or three years?  Why were they allowed to fire arms over their comrades' coffins?  Why were there bank robberies and murders?  Why was the law not enforced until a situation was created in which it was possible for the Government to say that internment was a measure, and the only measure, which could be used to enforce the law?  In another place I heard the Taoiseach say, as an excuse for having internment, that under our law there is a presumption of innocence, which meant that unless there was evidence or people to give evidence, guilt could not be established.</P>
    <P>I accept internment absolutely as an extreme measure that the State is fully <Col N="304" /> entitled to employ to deal with these people, but only when they get to a state so dangerous and so terrible that you have what is equivalent to civil war.  However, what the Taoiseach said is simply not true.  I am not going to bring the Seanad through all the sections of the Offences Against the State Act, but section 24 of that Act shifts the burden of proof:</P>
    <P>On the trial of a person charged with the offence of being a member of an unlawful organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Saor Éire, I presume, are this wordless body we are all talking about&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>proof to the satisfaction of the court that an incriminating document relating to the said organisation was found on such person or in his possession, or on lands or in premises owned or occupied by him or under his control shall, without more, be evidence until the contrary is proved that such person was a member of the said organisation at the time alleged in the said charge.</P>
    <P>There is a similar section dealing with the publication of treasonable, seditious and incriminating documents. Again the onus of proof is shifted. This is not too surprising.  It is a long time now since I was employed to defend somebody in a case where he had possession of a salmon.  The onus of proof was shifted there too; the State is jolly good at shifting the onus of proof when it is necessary to shift it. This is no excuse for introducing a measure which means that the Government can intern without trial, without proof against anybody.  This is very bad, and the final comment I make on that is it is terrifyingly bad government to achieve the situation when, by threatening without interning, when there should have been an internment without a threat, the most unpopular group of criminals in the country have been supported by mass demonstrations in the streets.</P>
    <P>The appalling effect of this threat is we had a thousand people&mdash;I am told by the other side of this House&mdash;out there the other day, people about whom I do not have anything other than this to say: they are entitued to their views. Many of their views could be right. <Col N="305" /> Some of their views may be capable of criticism.  All I am saying about them is they were there.  Can we conceive of a time in the last 40 years when a demonstration of a thousand people or more would have gathered to support a group like Saor Éire of whom nobody in this House would, I imagine, spare a breath to speak in favour?</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that it was difficult here sometimes to do what politicians are supposed to be doing all the time, talk politics and to make a speech which has a political impact or bearing.  I said and I repeat that the truth does not cease to be the truth merely because one Senator or one Deputy says it, because that sentence or judgment, whatever it may be, reflects a judgment of the other side.  It may well be his duty to say it and it may well be a corrupt thing for people to ignore it and to use phrases by which I am constantly annoyed, such as &ldquo;successive Governments have&rdquo;.  What are we talking about?  Anything that is relevant at the moment is relevant to the performance of the Fianna Fáil Party which has been in power for 14 years.  &ldquo;Successive Governments&rdquo; merely means that the fellow just does not want to pronounce judgment on the Fianna Fáil Party and is wrapping himself up in this, to me, unamiable phrase.</P>
    <P>First of all, let me take all the events as known.  I am not going to go through the miserable performance of quoting what somebody said somewhere.  We all know what has happened in the last year.  We all know that Senator Ó Maoláin was at his delicious best on the opening day of the Seanad when he accused the Opposition of occupying the time of the Dáil so that we did not have legislation.  This was marvellous. I enjoyed that thoroughly, I am bound to tell you.  I would be dishonest to myself if I did not say that I thought it was wonderful brass.  I was simply left admiring.</P>
    <P>Of course certain events did occupy the other House but really is there anybody in this House this evening who believes for one moment that the Opposition ought not to have debated what they debated in the Dáil during the last year?  Is this not the proposition <Col N="306" /> that was being presented by Senator Ó Maoláin when he said that the reason why there was no legislation to deal with here and why we were having a holiday for 137 days&mdash;God be good to us all for it&mdash;was that the Opposition were occupying the time of the House?  The Opposition were doing their duty and, a Chathaoirleach, I hope you are not thinking that the expense of this operation is not in the Appropriation Bill because it certainly is.</P>

      <P>I shall get the Official Report in due course, but the circus was certainly conducted by the Government and not by the Opposition. I am going to be critical of the Government, not for too lengthy a time, I hope, but I believe it is necessary. The standing, the reputation of any political party is affected by its association with power, and I do think that Fianna Fáil&mdash;and this has got to be said and repeated over and over again &mdash;have been, for their own good and for the country's health, too long in office.  Some years ago the Minister who is in charge of this debate indicated an awareness of that, but it is one thing to indicate an awareness of this; it is another thing to act in accordance with his awareness.  I am not aware of how Cabinet votes are conducted, but I see no evidence that the Minister is now aware that his party have been too long in power.  I think everyone in this House would agree that this is a distressing time for anyone concerned with the public affairs of our country, anxious about its reputation, anxious about the integrity&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;the authority of the institutions of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government can propose a measure which may have great merit in <Col N="307" /> it&mdash;and there was considerable merit, am going to say, because I would have said it if it had reached this House&mdash;in the Prices and Incomes Bill. There is no doubt that the excessive demand for incomes is the larger cause of the increase in costs in this country. There is no doubt that in some fashion or other this has got to be controlled and there is no doubt in my mind that an Act of Parliament is not necessarily the way to do it.</P>
    <P>If an Act of Parliament was necessary I certainly, despite the consequences, would support such an Act, but the real truth is that the Government of this day do not have the authority, are not legitimate in the eyes of many of the people.  I believe everyone here is concerned with the good of the country.  I hope that is true anyhow. I think one of the worst consequences of the polarisation of politics around the civil war debate was that the Fianna Fáil Party in particular&mdash;I say this making an act of judgment that is as clean as I can make it&mdash;because of their association with power, because of their being in opposition during the first ten years after the establishment of the State, because they then had all their able people ready in a position to organise themselves as a wing of their army, so to speak, have degraded and corrupted language through the employment of the propaganda war and the peacetime politics of ordinary debate.  Nobody will read a word of what I am saying; I will not be reported in the press.  I am really talking to you.</P>

      <P>Indeed I am. I never fail to address you with as much respect as I am allowed to show you.  The worst thing that has happened to Fianna Fáil&mdash;and I am now talking to the angels; may I point at one&mdash; is that they have been deceived by their own propaganda.  They have misunderstood the lessons of their own leaders.  All of us here are from different traditions and some of us like to think that we have respectable <Col N="308" /> traditions on this side and some of us are prepared to allow there are respectable traditions on the other side.  The Fianna Fáil Party was founded by someone who obviously must be regarded as something of a political genius, a statesman of reputation and someone whom history will remember, however it may judge him.  He was succeeded by a political craftsman of great skill.  I would be prepared to go on record as saying he was a Minister of State of great worth.  Neither was a man of the kind of temperament which would in fact allow him to look at their situation and say &ldquo;It would be better for us and better for the country if we got out.&rdquo;  It is unfortunate that this is so, because these are the lessons that are handed over to someone who in charity I intend to criticise.  The Taoiseach is not in need of my charity, because he is well able to collect votes, but I give him charity in so far as I would criticise him.</P>
      <P>Power has been transferred from people who knew what they wanted it for to someone who does not, who does not grasp the situation and who is being hypnotised by phrases like: &ldquo;We did not run away from our responsibilities. Unity above all.  Loyalty to the party.&rdquo;  These are frightful things: loyalty to the party at the expense of the country?  The unity of the party at the expense of the country?  &ldquo;We do not run away&rdquo; as an excuse for not handing over power to those whom the country want.  You have been judged by your peers.

It is my duty here to say, as the man after whom Edgeworthstown was named said: &ldquo;To speak the truth without harshness&rdquo;&mdash;and I hope I am doing that&mdash;&rdquo; is the most certain way to succeed in every honourable pursuit.&rdquo;  I know that the Minister and Senator Ó Maoláin have a feeling that this year <Col N="309" /> they have faced into a great problem very resolutely and have done a great job, having cut out a cancer in the centre of our affairs, having participated in and perhaps led the purgation from the Fianna Fáil system, if it is out of it, of the poison that was found in the centre.  They should ask themselves the question how was this cancer allowed to grow?  How did these people have the power that forced others to eject them from office?  Who appointed them as Ministers?  We did not appoint them.  We opposed their appointment.  They should ask themselves the question: &ldquo;Have we a responsibility to the people who like hungry sheep look up and have been looking up for a long time now and are not fed?&rdquo;  They took advantage of the situation which existed in April, 1969.  They know the people were not faced with the proper alternative.  The people acted, I think, rightly; they picked a Government, bad though it has proved to be.  They picked the only Government available.  Now the Government know the situation is difficult. May I tell you something of which you may not be aware?  In 1957, the then Taoiseach was faced with a situation analogous to the one with which Fianna Fáil are faced now, he was faced with the withdrawal of the support of the Clann na Poblachta Party on the issue of law enforcement. Although he and his Government were in the middle of a balance of payments correction which was not and could not be producing effects at that stage, rather than be hampered or handicapped by any sense of inadequacy in dealing with law enforcement, he went out of office.  He said a general election was necessary for the sake of the people.</P>

      <P>At the end of this long debate I hope the House will not take it amiss if I as a member of this vocational body nominated by a vocational group should advert to a problem which is exercising the minds of those who nominated me on my way to the Seanad.  In the appropriations which are before us, a large amount of money is devoted to the carrying out of work throughout the country as part of the engineering operations of our various local authorities.  I regret very much that it is necessary this year, as it was equally necessary last year and the year before, to draw the Minister's attention to the manner in which the engineering officers of the local authorities charged with the carrying out of these works have been treated by the Government.  Happily there does appear to be a glimmer of light on the horizon and so while I have to speak on this topic this year I can speak with somewhat more hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Members of this House are members of local authorities.  They know the work which is done by the local authority engineers throughout the country, not merely work of engineering expertise but work of management, work of professional skill which is bringing economic and social benefit to the communities they serve.  These officers have conditions of service which are most unsatisfactory in many ways. As long ago as February, 1967 they made a claim that their remuneration should be examined and increased. They went, as we are all asked to do, through established machinery in order to gain what they thought were their just deserts.  At all times, and particularly at times like this, the Minister and his colleagues ask various bodies to restrain themselves in regard to demands. This restraint has long been exercised by this particular body.  The claim they made in 1967 was not a claim based on the cost of living or on differentials but a claim based on a <Col N="312" /> productivity increase.  The whole claim was based on the fact that the county engineers and their staffs were able to show that they had down through the years increased the productivity of their operations.  Therefore the whole claim was essentially non-inflationary.  It was essentially a claim for a share in a contribution made to the economy, and so they claimed in February, 1967.  In July, 1967, conciliation started and dragged on for 12 months.  Conciliation failed and arbitration was invoked and, in July, 1968, the local authority engineers were given, through arbitration, by an independent chairman a substantial increase in pay.  In spite of the fact that this claim was then 16 months old, nothing was done for a further 12 months.  What was done after that time was that the Government set up a special committee and referred this claim, now over two years old, to this committee.  Shortly after the publication of Devlin Report No. 1, which has not been so speedily acted upon, Devlin Report No. 2 was issued by the committee chaired by Mr. Devlin to which the engineers' claim had been referred.  This was a setting aside of duly conciliated, duly arbitrated awards.</P>
    <P>The tardiness in regard to the implementation of Devlin Report No. 1 was not followed in regard to Devlin Report No. 2, and this award, first claimed in February, 1967, was set aside.  The immediate consequence of this was a threat of industrial action by the engineers employed in the local authorities.  Because of their sense of responsibility, because of their sense that as professional people they had a duty to the public, over and above their personal interests, they, at the last moment, refrained from such action. In an attempt to reach some agreement with the Minister for Local Government who had set aside the duly arbitrated award, the Institution of Engineers of Ireland established early in January, 1970 a committee to put before the Minister proposals in regard to the restructuring of the local government service.</P>
    <P>This working party set up by the engineering profession in an endeavour to put an end to this impasse, to avoid <Col N="313" /> the consequences of industrial action by a large body of professional people, reported in May, 1970.  Meanwhile, there had been sitting for well over six months a committee in the Department of Local Government, known commonly as the Clerkin Committee.  I am given to understand that the Clerkin Committee have as last reached the end of their deliberations, that the Minister for Local Government has received from this committee, which had the benefit of this report from the Institute of Engineers, firm proposals, though the nature of those proposals is not yet known.</P>
    <P>Confident that the Minister for Local Government will attempt at this stage to settle this long-festering problem, I would ask the present Minister, when the Minister for Local Government comes forward with his proposals for the settlement of this outstanding dispute, to ensure that the delays which are somewhat customary in the Minister's Department should not be added to the considerable delays which have already occurred.  I say this because in regard to these sums which I mentioned at the outset, these millions and millions which are devoted towards solid investment throughout the country, not merely in the conurbation here of Dublin but throughout every region of the country, these sums can be efficiently spent if they are allowed to be spent under the direction of a body of men who, first, will be allowed to exercise their talents, as they are not under the present system, and who once again can have the feeling that the work they are doing is appreciated.</P>
    <P>I do not want to argue here the merits of this case.  I do not want to parade before the Minister the very serious grievances which these local authority engineers have.  All of us know the contribution they have made and are making.  I do say to the Minister that if the Clerkin Committee have reported along the same general lines as the working party of the Institution of Civil Engineers did in the Donovan report, the Minister would be very well advised to act quickly so that he can restore self esteem to an important body of public servants and ensure that any money which he allows for capital <Col N="314" /> expenditure by the local authorities will, indeed, be spent to the best advantage and will give a real increase in economic growth and economic welfare.</P>

      <P>Coming in near the end of this debate it is difficult to cover any new ground but I could not let the opportunity go without adding my voice to the protest already made by the Members on this side of the House about the threat to reintroduce internment without trial.  I would agree with the speakers who have mentioned the necessity for law and order.  If this State is threatened we must take action but to threaten internment on the flimsiest excuse&mdash;and this is all we have been given&mdash;seems to shake the very foundation of the State.  To threaten to suspend democracy is very serious.  It heads us towards being a fascist State.  I am sure the Taoiseach has his reasons but I regret that he has not seen fit to give them to either House of the Oireachtas.  Yesterday, Senator Desmond referred to the confusion which she thought was being experienced by the electorate at large. I would go further and say that there is more than confusion.  There is very real concern and fear about what has happened in this country in the last 12 months.  I have no wish to dwell on the happenings of last May and subsequent events&mdash;the effects of them are still with us, and will be with us&mdash;but these events have rocked the very foundation of the State.  The Government should dwell seriously on this because fear is something that people cannot bear to live with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had in the last few years a succession of repressive type legislation. It started with the introduction of the rather infamous Criminal Justice Bill followed by the Trade Union Bill which was to control the trade union movement and recently, we have had the introduction of the Prices and Incomes Bill.  Instant or pressure cooker legislation is how I would describe that Bill.  I understand that in the other House tonight the Taoiseach announced he was not proceeding with the Bill.  I welcome this statement and I am sure that Members on the other side will <Col N="315" /> welcome it also.  I compliment him on his change of mind but I regret that it was ever put on the Order Paper of the House.  I regret that he panicked at a certain stage and dashed off to have this Bill printed.</P>
    <P>The Minister here present demonstrated very clearly how an agreement can be torn up.  When he appeared on television and said that the 12th round agreement has now been broken or it was intended to break it, he demonstrated to every trade unionist just how quickly any type of wage agreement can be torn up.  It is to his credit that he retracted that statement.  But he has made the job of ordered trade union negotiations much more difficult for the next ten to 20 years.  When an agreement is come to after tortuous negotiations, which as the Minister knows well went on for over a period of six months on very difficult proposals and which presented a great problem for the responsible trade union negotiators, you cannot then appear on television one night and say &ldquo;We scrapped it&rdquo; and then come back three days later and say &ldquo;No, we have not scrapped it&rdquo; and expect it not to have an effect on the normal work of this country. This I regret.  It has set back the whole concept of an incomes policy.  Anybody who has read or studied incomes policies in other countries will know the problems.  Of itself an incomes policy will never cure an inflationary situation but it is a factor which might help to control an inflationary situation.  It has never worked in any country where it has been legislated for.  The only hope lies in a voluntary arrangement.  The off-and-on of the 12th round agreement and the introduction of a Prices and Incomes Bill, which is now withdrawn, will be remembered.</P>
    <P>There are a few items to which I should like to refer on the Appropriations Bill.  Last year, speaking on local government, which is a field with which I am particularly <i>au fait</i>, I hope, we spoke about the proposed White Paper on Local Government reorganisation. It is at least three years ago since I first heard of this White Paper.  Every time we go down to the Department of Local Government we hear of it.  I <Col N="316" /> understand that it is now in its sixth version.  This may be all to the good because I know from experience that White Papers tend to become green Bills very quickly.  I have asked and I ask again that this White Paper should come out as a Green Paper, one as a basis of discussion and not necessarily the basis of legislation.  What concerns me about the non-issue of the White Paper is that reorganisation of local government is taking place and nobody is being given an opportunity or is even bothering to debate it. Regionalisation is going on.  We have regionalisation in the Industrial Development Authority, in the health boards and in development.  Perhaps this is a good idea but I object that we have had no local or national debate on this reorganisation.  Perhaps it is tied up with the Buchanan Report.  We have had a motion on the Seanad Order Paper for quite a while on that report but we have not had an opportunity to discuss it and it has not been discussed in the other House.  This is the fate of many of these reporting committees.  In 1966 the Quinn Tribunal sat but that report has not been debated in either House.</P>
    <P>An important part of this regionalisation which has to be dealt with is the question of the growth of Dublin.  Anybody who drives through Dublin must be aware of the chaos that is now Dublin and I can only describe it as chaos.  We are definitely in danger of arriving at a situation some Friday afternoon when the traffic in Dublin will snarl up and it will take a week for any of us to get to our homes.  The growth centre in this country has been the capital city and we have no positive programme of distributing population in industry.  If we had such a plan we would be in a position to say to industrialists: &ldquo;You cannot settle around Dublin but you may set up your factory in such a place.&rdquo;  But as long as there is no positive plan we will find that it is more convenient for them to set up around Dublin because of the facilities that are available&mdash;ports and so on. Within a short time we will be in an impossible position and our capital city will neither be a pleasant place for business nor a pleasant place to visit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> On this question of traffic I should like to refer to the very genuine shortage of personnel in the Garda Síochána.  I believe their numbers have been depleted severely over the last ten years.  If I am wrong I should certainly be glad to be corrected on this. In any event it is obvious that the traffic regulations are not being enforced and this is adding to the problems of traffic management in the city.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer also to the problem that is created by the lack of nursery schools and crèches in this country.  I did have an amendment down on the Health Bill which was ruled out of order.  I was told that this problem was not a function of the Department of Health and I accepted that.  I want to find out which Department is in charge of this because the Department of Local Government say that it is not their problem and the Department of Social Welfare do not seem to be concerned about it.  It is something that should concern the Government because it is a factor of Irish life that there is a change in the structure of the type of people who are now working. It was unheard of 20 years ago for married women to go to work but it is becoming quite acceptable now. Furthermore, manufacturing industries are crying out for married women to re-enter the labour force because in Dublin there is a shortage of women workers.  We are losing export orders on account of that.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to get involved in the article in the Constitution about what is the place of women in our society. All I would say is that they should have the right to choose and we should not discriminate against them.  It is a fact that married women are now staying on in employment or are re-entering the labour force and are needed in it.  Widows have always had to go out to work because we have an inadequate widows' benefit scheme.  It is unavoidable that we will have this trend in Irish life so we must make provision for children if they are not to be neglected. The Government must tackle this problem.  It is up to the local authorities to ensure that nurseries are set up and run properly.  What is happening at the moment is that the need <Col N="318" /> is there but it is not being met by the State.  Private nursery schools have been set up but there is no system for inspection or regulations as to how they are run.  It will probably take a tragedy in this sphere before the State tackles this problem.  A survey was carried out under the auspices of the University of Dublin on this problem in a Dublin housing estate and it was discovered that many married women were anxious to go back to work because of their financial position but they could not do so because of the lack of nursery schools or crèches.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Senator Desmond in her remarks on the social welfare assistance and I welcome the proposal that we should have a complete reappraisal of the system.  I would further add that the facilities in all these offices must be improved.  People who must go to these places are treated at very much less than human level.</P>
    <P>Last year we welcomed the introduction of a scheme for widows of deceased civil servants but I would like to point out an anomaly which arose on the introduction of that scheme. Many of these widows had a non-contributory widows' pension but when they went on to the Civil Service pension they lost their great facility of free travel.  Many of them at the moment would opt to have their free travel and their non-contributory pension rather than the actual pension they are receiving.  Could the Minister look at this and perhaps find some way of providing for free travel for these people?</P>
    <P>Although I am no expert on education I shall say a few words on the subject.  We have a backlog of many years neglect to make up in this field. I know there are problems involved in the capital expenditure, but no one would grudge money being spent on education because this is an investment for the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that grant payment for primary education <i>per capita</i> of pupils is too low.  This has tended to create a system whereby the only way the schools can cover their costs is by having overcrowding. Any school which is trying <Col N="319" /> to keep its numbers down to a level where the £25 grant would cover them finds it has to be supplemented by the efforts of parent-teacher organisations or otherwise.  This is not good enough because this leads to discrimination and to an imbalance in the system of education. There are cases in which the better-off parents can make an extra subscription to the school so that classes can be kept to 25, 26 or 27.  In other areas where they are depending on State grants the classes number anything from 40 to 60 pupils and this must create a discrimination in the education system.  I should like to see some investigation into the possibility of having a co-educational system. This would rule out a lot of the problems of the imbalance between the male and female population.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope we have the pleasure of meeting a little more often in 1971.  I am sure the leader of the House, whom I have no doubt is a man of great influence with the Government and with his party, will arrange that we do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has ranged over a very wide field.  Many items were touched on.  There was no scarcity of suggestions for additional expenditure.  Some that come to mind were suggestions that we should make certain grants available cast of the Shannon in the same way as they are made available west of the Shannon, and extensions to the system of relieving rates on agricultural land.  There were many other such suggestions.  It is not very difficult to put forward suggestions, which in themselves have great merit, but which entail new or increased expenditure.  In all fairness, such suggestions are carefully considered.  However, the big difficulty lies in selecting those proposals which can be met within the overall resource position of the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In seeking for extended grants and other improvements in benefits, some Senators have, at the same time, protested about the high rates of tax on certain items and particularly on motoring.  This is a basic problem that we all have to face in our own personal <Col N="320" /> lives and the State has to face it just the same as any individual.  We have got to pay for whatever benefits we desire and we cannot spend large additional amounts on the various worthwhile suggestions that have been put forward without raising the necessary money by way of taxation or by cutting out some other existing items of expenditure.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of cutting expenditure we did not get very much advice during this debate.  We may have got one or two proposals but I would not think that the Senator who made them would regard the proposals he made as drawing very hard towards cutting expenditure. The most he could hope to claim for his suggestions would be that they might create a different atmosphere. Even in the case of those suggestions I am afraid it would probably be possible to demonstrate that money is being saved by the amount that is being expended rather than by adopting the course suggested by the Senator.</P>
    <P>One of the items referred to by most people was the question of internment and the Taoiseach's recent statements in regard to internment.  Before I deal further with that there is one point that I want to make.  It was touched on by one Senator here and I have seen a number of references to this in newspaper comments, reported comments of people in this regard.  It was a suggestion that there was some particular significance, and probably sinister significance, in the announcement by the Taoiseach in regard to the possibility of internment having been made after the results of the by-elections.  It is not really clear to me what was the specially sinister significance of this but, having become reasonably practised in the art of politics now, I did speculate a little on what would have been said if it had been announced before the by-elections.  It seems to me that we would have heard furious comments to the effect that we were trying to stampede the people.  Cannot we all hear these arguments being made at every crossroads?</P>

      <P>We know what you <Col N="321" /> would say.  The fact of the matter is, of course, and something that has to be realised, is that nobody has been interned. The law has not been changed. The law is the same as it has been since 1940.  Senator Nash drew attention to this point but I think it is worth drawing attention to it again.  The existing Act has been on the Statute Book since then.  Within the period since then we have had two inter-Party Governments which consisted in the main of members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  They did not see fit, when they were in office and had a majority in the Houses of the Oireachtas, to repeal the Offences Against the State Act.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael and Labour Parties in Government were wise not to repeal that Act.  The case in this regard was put very well and very succinctly by Senator Nash and <Col N="322" /> I will not attempt to go over that ground again.  The fact is that the law has not changed in this regard in the past week, in the past year or in the past ten years.  The law is exactly the same today, in this regard, as it was ten years ago and as it was 20 years ago.  What has happened is this: the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government has given notice of the existence of a certain armed group who had certain plans of which he has given details. He has said that if the plans being made are persisted in, internment will have to be used.  I repeat, nobody has been interned and the law has not been changed.  The Government were not obliged to issue the warning which they gave.  Indeed it may be&mdash;and I think Senator Alexis FitzGerald touched on this by implication in something he said&mdash;that the Government could be criticised for having issued the warning instead of acting.</P>

      <P>I want to suggest that the actions of the Government in this regard demonstrate more clearly than anything else could, firstly, their reluctance to intern anybody and, secondly, the fact that they are prepared to go to extreme lengths to try to ensure that a situation which would call for internment does not arise.  The full details of the conspiracy in question have not been revealed and I think that anybody who has been calling on the Taoiseach to reveal the full details is either dishonest or very naïve.  He must know very well that it is not possible for the Taoiseach to do this.  However, there has been considerable clamour in regard to the announcement.  My own view on this, and it may be inaccurate, is that the clamour has in the main come from a relatively small group and that the majority of the people, while not relishing the prospect of internment, are quite prepared to accept that the Taoiseach and the Government would not lightly issue such a statement.  I will give Senator Alexis FitzGerald credit for having said here that he did not believe that it would be lightly done or done for some of the silly reasons which have been advanced by some people.  A lot <Col N="323" /> of the objections that have been made were couched in terms of talk of human rights and defending human rights.  Some people have been so clamorous that one begins to suspect they think that there is a human right to kidnap or rob banks.  There is not.</P>

      <P>This Government are at least as much concerned with the rights of the individual citizen and with individual freedom as are any of its opponents and that the threats against which the Government warning has been given spelled out clearly as to the kind of people they apply.  I also want to emphasise that no opponent of this Government or their policies, whether such opponent be orthodox or unorthodox in his views, has anything whatever to fear from this Government if he stays within the law and keeps away from arms. He is quite entitled to advocate any views whatever he likes.  I want to stress that.  People keeping within the law and keeping away from arms have nothing whatever to fear.

      <P>Maybe Senator Kelly does not think so but I do.  I should like to make my own speech in my own way.  One of the other major topics in this debate has been the question of inflation and its effects on the economy. On that occasion I said very clearly that time was running out and that unless action was taken quickly the country could face disaster.  I stressed that the Government wanted to see a voluntary agreement arrived at but that if such an agreement did not emerge they would be forced to take action. Unfortunately, the agreement that had been hoped for did not emerge and the Government were forced to take action.  The result was, among other things, the Prices and Incomes Bill.  As announced by the Taoiseach in the other House this evening, that Bill has now been withdrawn.  But it has been withdrawn, first, because we now have a voluntary agreement and we did not have one when it was introduced. Secondly, I want to make it clear that, as far as the Government are concerned, in withdrawing the Bill in so far as wages and other incomes are concerned, they are relying on the good sense of Congress and of the employer <Col N="326" /> organisations and also on the assurances they have received that this agreement will be honoured in the letter and in the spirit in which it was negotiated. If that should not be so, the Government will not and cannot hesitate to take action to deal with it.</P>

      <P>Statements were made in connection with this matter originally and before the Bill was introduced. I think I am quoting the Senator correctly when I say she said that they set the possibility of an incomes policy back ten or 20 years.  This surprises me because I assume that Senator Owens is familiar with the terms of the agreement which has recently been negotiated. If she is, I do not know how she could have made the statement which I have just quoted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing about it is this: that agreement contains items with which everybody on all sides of this House would agree and admit would have been deemed to have been inconceivable some months ago.  If it is operated in the spirit in which it was negotiated it will do an enormous amount for industrial peace in this country, although it will not reduce inflation to the extent that we would like. However, on balance, in the Government's view it is in the national interest that it should operate.  In the context of an incomes policy, the most significant thing about it is that, having achieved that situation under the agreement, it is now possible for the Employer-Labour Conference to get down truly to an incomes policy without having all the <Col N="327" /> time in front of them all the problems they have had in the past of negotiating the next wage round.  This is the view that has been expressed to the Government by some members of the Executive of Congress and it is a view with which the Government agree.  I think that, rather than say that what has happened has put back the prospect of an incomes policy by ten or 20 years, it has brought it forward&mdash;I would not like to put a time on it&mdash;very far.  Consequently, the statement by Senator Owens is contradicted by the facts which have emerged.</P>
      <P>There is a matter which was raised in the other House and elsewhere.  I am not sure if it was referred to here but I did undertake in the other House to report my findings to this House.  If the House will bear with me, I should like to mention it.  I was urged to avoid the increased rate of wholesale tax under the Finance (No. 2) Bill on mobile homes.  I have already explained in the other House that I am in agreement with the proposition but I also explained the practical difficulties involved. These difficulties I have examined in considerable detail and they are very real.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Senators will readily accept that a sales tax, such as the wholesale tax, cannot be collected or waived by reference to the purchaser's statement to the trader of the use he intends to make of the goods he has purchased.  Intention is a notoriously unsound criterion for charging or not charging tax.  However, I am loath to abandon the attempt to give relief where I think it is deserved simply because of the administrative difficulties involved.  I have, therefore, asked the Revenue Commissioners to examine the possibility of excluding from these increased rates caravans and other mobile homes which are designed to be incorporated in an immovable structure.  This would ensure that the higher rate would not apply to dwellings of this type which are designed for a fixed site and which are not made mobile after being set up on such a site.  While the words I have just used indicate the type of case in which I think relief could, in fact, be afforded, they will probably have to be <Col N="328" /> altered in the course of drafting the enabling legal instrument.  If, as I hope, it is found possible to do what I have just outlined, I propose to put the relief into effect from a current date by a Government Order under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957.  This is the most I can do at short notice.  I intend to have the position examined further to see if the relief can be extended to cover other deserving cases in this category.</P>

      <P>Senator Keery raised one or two points I want to mention.  He inquired about the delay in filling the vacancy for Assistant Librarian in the Oireachtas Library.  I am told that this post became vacant in February, 1970, on the promotion of the then Assistant Librarian to the post of Librarian.  In the past the position was filled from the grade of library assistant in the National Library.  On this occasion the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach wished that it should be filled by a university graduate.  Following discussion of the appropriate details at official level, sanction was conveyed on the 11th September last for the upgrading of the post.  It is understood that the Civil Service Commission will be in a position to announce the competition for this very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were also a number of matters raised in regard to conservation.  I do not propose to go into all the details of what was done.  I should perhaps mention to the House that the Minister <Col N="330" /> for Lands is at present working on a Bill which will deal with the conservation of fauna and flora.  The draft proposals cover the protection of important species of fauna and flora, the establishment of nature reserves and wild life sanctuaries and an improvement in the statutory provisions for the conservation of exploitable wild life resources.</P>
    <P>Air and water pollution are a major worry in the context of conservation. The Minister for Local Government is setting up a working party representing all the interested Departments to examine and report on the nature and extent of air and water pollution, different remedial measures and their cost, and the legislative authority needed to deal with pollution.</P>

      <P>Yes.  On the question of the national manpower service which is replacing the placement and guidance function of the existing employment service, this national manpower service is being developed throughout the country on a regional basis.  It is hoped to have regional offices in 11 centres, six of these have been established already and suitable premises are being sought for the remainder, including one in Dublin.  Regional directors have been selected and will take up duty on 1st January.  Placement officers are at present being selected and will take up duty early in the New Year.  These measures should, I think, provide a more effective and comprehensive service than we had hitherto and I hope they will eliminate the difficulty which has been caused by the reluctance of employers and employees to avail themselves of the facilities of the employment service in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to An Foras Talúntais and the National Science Council.  Since the National Science Council was established there has been every co-operation between these two bodies.  I should also like to say that An Foras Talúntais do a considerable amount of research in addition to the developmental work to which Senator Quinlan referred.  This research work is <Col N="331" /> recognised internationally as being of a very high standard.  I might also say that the five-year programme for agriculture prepared by an Foras Talúntais was passed by my predecessor for examination.  He referred it to the National Science Council whose function it is to advise the Minister for Finance on science and technology with particular reference to economic development.  The National Science Council decided that the programme should be considered in the light of the agricultural research undertaken by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the universities and in the context of the country's total research requirements.  This has necessitated the assembling of much aditional information over a large area of research which is nationally important from an economic and social viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Because of the broad context and the long-term nature of the issues involved, the National Science Council considered it desirable to have consultations with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and with An Foras Talúntais.  These consultations are proceeding quite actively.  I understand that the research work of An Foras Talúntais is currently proceeding along the lines set out in its programme of the five-year plan, so there is no interference with the work an An Foras Talúntais as a result of this examination.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha said the public should be told about the causes of transport fare increases.  I should like to say a word about this.  CIE have to bear added costs amounting to more than £10 million per year mainly because of the 12th round increase in wages and salaries and other additional labour costs such as the shorter working week and annual holidays.  In the current financial year CIE's deficit would have reached more than £7½ million were it not for the increase in fares.  Even with the increases and taking into account the annual grant of 2.65 million pounds there will be an estimated gap of almost £3 million between the board's revenue and expenditure in 1970-71 and this is being met by a further Exchequer grant.  The Minister for Transport and Power has <Col N="332" /> appointed a committee who are reviewing the operations of CIE as a matter of urgency.  The general attitude of the Government to this matter is that this situation cannot be allowed to continue.  There may be difficult decisions to be taken but we cannot contemplate a continuance of a situation in which CIE are running high deficits which can only be met both by substantially increased fares and increased help from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan and a number of other Senators referred to the increased tax on company profits imposed under the Finance (No. 2) Bill, especially in the current year.  This could unduly hit retaining profits thereby adversely affecting economic expansion.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald referred to it as tax on savings.  It is an increase in the rate of income tax on companies.  In the case of some companies it could attack on savings; in the case of other companies it might not.  It is an increase of 8 per cent in the rate of income tax payable by companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.  Senator McDonald can go home and think about this and he will come to the same conclusion as myself.  The real point that is being made is that its impact in <Col N="333" /> the current year would be heavy because of the way the taxation system works.  Companies are paying taxes on profits earned in their last trading year. This is true up to a point although when we hear of a company having to face a tax of 74 per cent, this is a fairly exceptional case.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I said a fairly exceptional case.  A company suffering 74 per cent must comply with a number of conditions.  Firstly, they must not be exporting at all; two, they must have their financial year back beyond a certain date and three, they must be a company which have not provided in their accounts for tax equalisation fund reserve.  Quite a number of companies have done so recently.  A contention has been made and what it amounts to is that if the income tax rate is changed at any time for companies this problem which has been adverted to in the debate always arises again.  Therefore, if one says that one should not do this because the provisions for taxation may prove inadequate, what he is saying is that this is a tax on savings which companies should not be paying.  This is a proposition that I, as Minister for Finance, cannot accept and I doubt if many Deputies or Senators would accept it when put in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not deny that for some companies it will impose difficulties.  I must in all fairness to myself point out that when a company make up their accounts and provide for tax, they are providing for tax at existing rates. They know that if there is a change in the rates, then they might have made too much or too little provision.  This is inherent in the whole situation.  A company are not entitled to say, &ldquo;We assumed that the tax rate would remain the same and because it did not we have been unduly hard hit or we are being retrospectively taxed.&rdquo;  That is not so.  Some companies are being hit harder than they might have expected. I have no evidence to suggest that the imposition of this tax will cause grave difficulty for any company or that it will cause unemployment, but I would point out that there are about 70 per <Col N="334" /> cent of all our small companies with taxable profits of up to £2,500 a year. Indeed of those companies, because of the lower rate of corporation profits tax charged&mdash;7½ per cent on the first £2,500 of taxable profits&mdash;some companies with a £2,500 taxable income would pay additional tax under this provision of £65 a year.</P>
    <P>When one hears it in those terms it does not seem to be an undue burden for those kinds of companies.  We are left then with 30 per cent of companies which are above that range and of those any of them which are engaged in the export market are, in the extent of their engagement in the export market, avoiding the liability of this tax and any of them who have prudently made provision by a tax equalisation reserve will not suffer unduly. The number of companies which will be hit to the extent of 74 per cent in this financial year is quite small. Although it exists, nevertheless I think it should be realised, to get the whole thing into perspective, that there are not many companies to whom this will happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell quoted from something which I said in this House in July last in which I referred to the fact that some Irish manufacturing companies had profits which were dangerously low and that I knew this from my experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce in dealing with price applications.  He quoted me correctly on this.  I was speaking on that occasion in relation to the containing of increases in their costs by excessive wage demands and other rises.  I want to suggest that the impact of this additional income tax on these companies is very small and is far less than the impact on them of the wage demands for wage and salary increases which they were facing and would have had to pay but for the conclusion of the national wage agreement which, clearly, arises directly out of the action of the Government in promoting the Prices and Incomes Bill.</P>
    <P>While this may not be a great consolation to those companies, they are far better off than they would be if the Government had not taken the action of which I spoke at the time in the <Col N="335" /> speech which Senator Russell quoted. One other point on that matter: it was suggested that this tax should be reviewed next year.  I could not undertake in regard to any tax to say that it would be reduced, abolished, modified, increased, in advance of doing so.  I can say that certainly the operation of the tax will be kept under very close review. If it should appear that for any reason it ought to be changed, modified or reduced, then I would certainly be prepared to take such action.  I could not undertake in advance that I would do so.</P>
    <P>If the House will bear with me for just a few minutes more, I want to deal with some things that were said by Senator Alexis FitzGerald at the conclusion of his speech.  I think he referred to some previous exchanges which had taken place in the debate regarding the delay in bringing legislation forward in the Dáil.  He asked, in response to an interjection, was it being said that the Opposition in Dáil Éireann did not have a right to discuss and debate the various events which happened in the course of the year.  No such contention would be made from this side of the House.</P>
