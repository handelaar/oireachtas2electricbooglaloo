      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask Senator Ó Maoláin a question regarding No. 6? The time limit is approaching fairly rapidly and it seems to me that, although it is a motion in the names of Senators John Kelly and Alexis FitzGerald, it is a statutory matter and I suggest that Government time be allowed either this week or next week for its discussion.  This is the motion on the coinage regulations.</P>

      <P>As the Senator is aware, the Minister dealing with this matter is unfortunately not available at the moment.  I have been trying to arrange it for some time but I cannot do anything about it at the moment. However, I shall look into the matter this evening and see if there is anything I can do to facilitate the Senator.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I should like to raise the matter of motions in general. We have had circulated to us by you, Sir, a document emanating from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and in its opening paragraph it is stated:</P>
      <P>At its meeting held on 28th January, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges decided that motions tabled by Senators should be dealt with as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It then lays out certain conditions.  I should like to draw your attention to Article 63 of our Standing Orders on page 45 which deals with the powers <Col N="1446" /> of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The first sentence of paragraph 63 on page 45 states:</P>
    <P>This Committee may consider matters of procedure generally and may recommend any additions or amendments to these Standing Orders which may be deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>It is my submission that it is the function of this Committee to recommend but not to decide and, therefore, it is for this House to decide whether to accept the recommendations of the Committee.  I should like to ask whether it is being proposed now, or will be proposed later, that we accept, or accept with amendment, those recommendations of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I think it would be a mistake procedurally for this House to accept them as decisions of that Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that it is in accordance with numerous precedents in the past for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to recommend <i>ad hoc</i> changes of this kind not on a permanent basis but on a tentative basis to see how they work out.  It is not proposed by the Committee to amend Standing Orders; as the Senator has pointed out, they have not the power.  This is an experimental arrangement and the intention of the Committee was that it should be tried for a while to see how it worked out. If the Senator has any objection&mdash;and, of course, the Committee are representative of the Seanad as a whole &mdash;it is open to him to put down a motion, but I think that on this matter the Committee have interpreted the general view of the House that the former situation was unsatisfactory and that it is worthwhile making this new experimental arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's point was that the Committee have decided to recommend, not that they have made a decision binding on the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <P>It must come before the House before I can oppose it.  It has just been circulated but it has not in any procedural sense come before the House.  It seems to me that it should at least come before the House by way of formal resolution.  I feel the recommendations are good in general but there are points which could be amended.  It is not enough to say &ldquo;We have circulated a decision of the Committee&rdquo;, particularly when it is of an experimental nature, which is not made apparent in the circular.  I do not feel quite happy about the way in which this has come before the House.</P>

      <P>It was mentioned on 15th January last in reply to Senator Sheehy Skeffington, that this matter was to be considered by the Committee.  It is a matter for the House to decide by resolution, should it so wish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was on the last day, in answer to Senator Bourke, that we were told it would be circulated.  Merely to say that the Committee have reached a decision which will be circulated is not, I feel, the proper way to deal with it.  I should therefore like to request&mdash;I cannot really suggest referring this back to the Committee since it has not been formally proposed to us&mdash;the Committee to do two things: to make recommendations for us rather than to tell us of decisions, and to indicate in their document that it is of an experimental nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out again to Senator Sheehy Skeffington that the number of motions which appeared in the Clár in the previous Seanad, and the situation which obtained as a consequence of debates <Col N="1448" /> which we had or might have had, made the whole business chaotic and made it impossible for us to deal with many of those resolutions.  It was on my initiative that the Committee considered this matter and it was agreed by all parties, by Fine Gael, the party of this side, the Labour representatives and the Independent representative, that this would be worth trying experimentally as a possible solution and that after we had tried it out if it did not work or was capable of improvement we should sit down and do something about it.  If Senator Sheehy Skeffington, who was the foremost champion in complaining that this motion or that was not taken, would only recall that this is an effort to ensure that motions will be taken and dealt with in a reasonable time, he would let us get on with the job of trying it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good effort taken in the wrong way. The Leader of the House said that all parties agreed.  He means outside the House.  I think he should seek agreement inside the House, even if only formally.  Although I realise that the aim and the general framework are good, if the House is to be guided by this circular, it must be before the House, not just before the Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to bring some finality to this matter, would the Leader of the House be willing to put down a resolution on the same terms as the recommendations of the Committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>

      <P>It is a matter for the House, if it wishes, to change the procedure at any time.  Therefore, there is no need to insert the word &ldquo;experimental&rdquo;.  In order to put an end to this matter I am suggesting to <Col N="1449" /> the Leader of the House that he put down a resolution in the terms of the recommendation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and that this matter can be debated further in the House when the Senator will be able to speak on it if he so wishes.</P>

      <P>Before we take up consideration of this Bill I should like to indicate that I have ruled amendments Nos. 10, 21 and 28 out of order.  Nos. 10 and 28 have been ruled out of order because they would involve a charge on public revenue and the reason for ruling No. 21 out of order is because it was not raised in a substantial manner on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 11, to add to subsection (2) (a) (iii) the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" />&ldquo;Such persons shall include at least one person nominated by the public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Similar amendments have been discussed at length already and the reason why I have put this down again is because the Minister agreed on Committee Stage that he would at least have another look at the proposal.  We have altered it slightly to cut down on the number of representatives since the Minister made the point that he would, perhaps, have to make the health board too large.  We have reduced the number to one and I consider this to be entirely reasonable.</P>
    <P>It is not asking very much of the Minister to accept this.  I should like to point out that the Minister's decision so far not to accept this has been deeply resented by the staff sides concerned. They believe this to be substantially discriminating against them and there is adequate representation, from other areas of the professional and ancillary grades.  They fail to understand the Minister's reason for refusing to accept that at least one member from the staff side should be on the board.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out to the Minister that if he were to accept this, it would bring tremendous goodwill from the staff side to the implementation of all proposals for the new health board.  I shall not delay the House by rehashing all the arguments put forward already in favour of this but I should just like to say that these people have a contribution to make at board level and it would be a very valuable gesture from the Government towards the idea of worker participation. There is plenty of precedent for it.  I have already given the example of the Dublin Port and Docks and I do not consider it to be too revolutionary to ask that we should have one member on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I had occasion to think a great deal about this problem when I was Minister for Transport and Power.  I find that there is a great deal of varying opinion on this even in trade <Col N="1451" /> union circles.  I shall not quote all the references but perhaps I might refer to &ldquo;The Distasteful Challenge&rdquo; by Charles McCarthy in which he put into words rather more effectively than I something that I have been trying to say to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The lack of a proposed management structure can lead to frustration among employees and to their believing that they have no effective contribution to make to the working of an organisation.  I would hope to help the new boards to develop a form of management structure which would do more to help to avoid the type of frustration which had manifested itself elsewhere than direct representation on a board without a good management structure might achieve.</P>
      <P>I say that as a kind of paraphrase of what had been said in this contribution to social and economic problems of the day by Charles McCarthy, the well-known trade unionist.  In present circumstances, unless the health boards have a management structure which enables people who are able to do so to make contributions from the various sections of the staff, they would be lacking in their duty.</P>
      <P>This is not an easy thing to do but I do not believe that someone appointed directly to represent the staff interest of 15 different grades of people could make an effective contribution. I believe the thing to do is to let the section go through as it is and then to see whether the health boards, who, apparently, judging by the general views of the Seanad, will consist of a number of people who have this kind of thing in mind, first of all, will develop this kind of management structure that will throw into prominence the kind of people who are able to make a contribution to the work of the board and then, perhaps, in a few years time, when undoubtedly there will be amendments of one kind or another to this Health Act or to the regulations framing the appointment of the health board&mdash;I can hardly concede that this could remain absolutely static in that time&mdash;the matter could be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> The first thing to do is to have the kind of management structure that would make effective what is proposed in this amendment.  I honestly do not believe that there is one among the health authorities at the present time and I should like to see them develop. It cannot be done by the Minister because this is a matter of restructuring and a willingness of people who, in respect of the actual position they occupy on the board, could be said initially not to have very much contribution to make.</P>
    <P>This kind of thing can be developed and the people who are unable to make provision for the board in the ordinary way in their capacity as individual officers can do it through the board of the consultative council.  That would be the first step in what might be a change in practice.</P>
    <P>I have read plenty of articles about this and a great many trade unionists object very much to the concept of having a trade unionist on the board of an enterprise if, in fact, the board have to act in a consultative manner and the trade union representative is not able to act effectively on behalf of his trade union.  Equally, there are arguments on the other side.  There are other people in the trade union movement who press very strongly for that kind of participation.  Others ask for far more consultation for work councils and some others ask for what might be described as a supervisory board which would not have executive authority.  It is a complex subject but there is far from being unanimity in relation to the kind of proposal made by the Senator and I quite understand her motives in making it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We readily accept, as the Minister has said, that this is a very complex problem, that is to say the thinking and indeed the philosophy represented in this amendment, and we also accept that there are naturally several points of view about it.  At the same time, it has to be stated here that the policy of worker-staff representation on boards of managements concerned with enterprises, industries and services is the policy of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions notwithstanding <Col N="1453" /> what views may or may not be expressed by other people.</P>
      <P>I very much regret the Minister has taken this very ultra-conservative view in respect of this question.  I believe if we do this in connection with the health boards, and if the same thinking is to apply universally in our community in this whole matter of staff and industrial relations, we will do no more and no less than mark time, and if we mark time in this important sensitive sector of our community we will have only ourselves to blame for undesirable consequences.</P>
      <P>I have in another place pointed out that we have certain advantages in this country.  We have a relatively large measure of public ownership and State control and it is not too much to say in relation to the health boards to be set up under this Bill when it becomes an Act that there is an analogy with public ownership and State control. The point I should like to make to the Minister is that within those areas, outside, separate and distinct from private enterprise, there exists the opportunity for us in this country, while we have the opportunity, to indulge in a form of social experimentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot say&mdash;Senator Owens and my other colleagues&mdash;that what we propose in this amendment will be the be all and end all of industrial relations but we say it is one step forward on the road to proper worker participation and consultation, and if we are to wait until developments in this particular field take place, I repeat that we may wait too long.  The Government, through the Minister for Labour, established a committee of inquiry into industrial relations in the ESB. The Minister chose the chairman and he also nominated two ordinary members of that committee.  He assented to the appointment of two assessors and, <i>inter alia</i>, that committee recommended that for the betterment of industrial relations in the ESB there should be worker participation in management and indeed worker representation on the board.  Although the Government, so far as I know, have not announced any official attitude to <Col N="1454" /> the report of that committee, the mere fact that they were a Government committee, officered and manned, as it were, by Government appointees and nominees, and taking into account the calibre of the membership of the committee the thinking and the philosophy behind that committee must engage the attention of the Government and indeed of every Minister of that Government.</P>
    <P>We have in this amendment opened an opportunity to the Government, through the Minister for Health, to take this step forward.  It is not a unique step.  There are trade union representatives serving on boards, there have been cases in which trade union representatives have served on boards, which boards have at times been in dispute with trade unions, and I am not aware that this has caused any inhibitions or embarrassment.  Rather I think one could say that it has often lent strength to that particular board or enterprise.</P>
    <P>Because my colleague Senator Owens put forward very ably and competently our arguments in support of this on Committee Stage and I do not wish to detain either the House or the Minister with a rehash of those arguments, I end as I started by saying &ldquo;Yes, we accept from the Minister that the problem is rather complex&rdquo; but we differ from the Minister to the extent that unless somebody has the courage to take the first step along the road of proper worker and staff representation then somebody else may well take that step and it may be too late for us in this House or elsewhere to bemoan the consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in some sympathy with this amendment.  I can see the Minister's point very clearly that as a method of contributing to the know-how of management of the board this may not be of very great significance. I think if you applied his arguments to every member of the board, as they will find themselves in this situation in the future, very few of us had any training in management. We have all had to just to sort of jump in at the deep end and do the best we could and hope our <Col N="1455" /> colleagues would be indulgent in their views of what we are trying to do.</P>
      <P>I think in terms of hospital boards. I serve on a number of those and in some cases the staff are there as of right and in others they are not.  In some they are excluded altogether and in some they come merely as observers, to speak when they are spoken to, to answer questions when they arise but not to vote on any questions of decision. I have seen the change take place in one hospital from the point where they were only there on sufferance to the point when they were incorporated as full members.  The reason for excluding them in the first case was that they were very similar to those whom the Minister has said he has to take into account in looking at this amendment&mdash;that they had, as it were, a kind of vested union interest in the work of the hospital and therefore they should not be in the capacity of managing at the same time, and furthermore they were not trained in any managerial way&mdash;their techniques and expertise were different.  But when we have got those colleagues in the hospitals on those boards, they can quite often be very valuable in their own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another function we must remember and that is the function of the channel of communication&mdash;that a member like this, working and serving on a board, will be expected, I suppose, to transmit to his colleagues the difficulties of the board, the reasons why all the things they want to get for their services cannot be given straight away and that they must exercise some degree of reasonableness about this.  This could be very important and certainly medical people <Col N="1456" /> working in a hospital get a lot of information from their colleagues who serve on the board which they could not get merely by having letters written to them or discussing the thing with the secretary of the board who might not clearly understand their point of view.  As I say, I can see the Minister's difficulty but I think I have sympathy with the amendment for those various reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, just to reiterate the point made by Senator Dunne about trade union policy on the matter, as the Minister pointed out there are quite rightly differences of opinion within the trade union movement although it is official Congress policy, but particularly in relation to this amendment.  This amendment, in fact, first started at the last annual general meeting of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It was adopted specifically in relation to this Health Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister is anxious to experiment with management techniques and re-structuring.  I would suggest respectfully that the Minister might find his experimenting and re-structuring easier if he accepted this amendment.  The Minister would then have this additional line of communication which would be important at the experimental stage.  To a degree the Minister accepts it, because he did suggest that we might have this representation in the future.  This is promising us cake tomorrow but no cake today.  I want my cake now and not in the 80s.  I appeal to the Minister to accept what is really a very minimum request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 15, after &ldquo;board&rdquo; to add &ldquo;by not less than 25%&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The wording of the amendment is substantially the same as the amendment moved by Senator Bourke and Senator Belton on the Committee Stage.  I have no desire to be repetitive on this matter or to hold up the passage of the Bill through the Seanad, but I have taken advantage of the Minister's statement in replying to Senator Belton when he said &ldquo;all I can say is that if I felt it would help me to get a consensus to express a particular percentage, I will look at it between now and the Report Stage.  I cannot say more than that&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that a consensus acceptable to the House might be if representatives of local authorities comprising the various health boards were to have 60 per cent of the total membership of the board, 30 per cent filled by the medical and other interests, and the Minister's nominees ten per cent.  I would suggest that in a board of say 30 members the representatives of the local authorities would have 18 members, the medical, dental, nursing and other representatives would have nine, and the Minister would have three nominees.</P>
      <P>As regards my personal views, I am very much in favour of the existing arrangement.  I should like to be clear on that, and in moving this amendment I might say that it is for me a substantial come down from what I regard as the very effective and proven working arrangement on the present health boards.  I have served on the Limerick Health Board for nine years, and although the membership of 23 was dominated by the Minister's party during the nine years, I can say without fear of contradiction that the board as a whole have worked together with an amazing degree of unity and endeavour to do their best for the people in their area.  They are now faced with becoming members of a board in which their representation will be reduced from 23 to a little more than 50 per cent, if I understand the Minister's intention from what he said on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The population served by the Limerick health board will go up roughly 100 per cent and the area will be something like 2½ times the size of the existing area.  I am sure the Minister would agree that if, as we all hope, these boards are to be effective it is essential that public representatives have adequate membership on the boards.  I do not visualise, as was suggested by some speakers on the Committee Stage, a clash of interests between the public representatives on the one side and the medical and other representatives and the Minister's nominees on the other.  What I am trying to suggest is that the public representatives should have adequate representation in view of the fact that they will be constantly in touch with the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us who have served on a county council or city council, or in the Dáil or in the Seanad, will understand that a public man is continually at the service of his constituents, and if adequate representation is not given to the local representatives I can see difficulties arising in the new boards. <Col N="1459" /> I would therefore like to suggest to the Minister as a compromise to consider this amendment.  I would suggest that it is a fair compromise and one that I think might be accepted for the reasons I suggested at the outset of my contribution.</P>

      <P>My reason for appending my name to this amendment is contained in the Committee Stage debate on the Bill at column 1096, Vol. 67, in which, as Senator Russell has quoted, the Minister said: &ldquo;I will look at it between now and the Report Stage.&rdquo;  I found that that was sufficient reason for this being put down on the Report Stage.  I am not repeating what I said on the Committee Stage, I am just giving that reason.  What I said on the Committee Stage still pertains, and the Minister, I am quite sure, heard me on Committee Stage and knows my reasons for supporting this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did look at this matter since the Seanad last met and I cannot find any way of providing for any change in the proposals that are in the Bill.  By having less than 25 per cent, which is a majority of ten per cent, it does not make much change in the size of any of the boards; I do not think it would mean anything or would be significant.</P>
      <P>I am very keen on the view that these boards should work together and I still refuse to believe that there will be a local authority <i>versus</i> professional clash on more than a very small number of occasions in the lifetime of a health board.  I imagine that an occasion on which the local authority element could be in conflict to a degree of 100 per cent with the professional element would perhaps be on the question of the proposed budget to be sent to the Minister for Finance, and I am not sure that it would happen even in such a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want the professional element to feel there is any deliberate reason for having a specific and considerable majority of local authority people.  I want these people to work together and, as the State pays 75 per cent of the entire health costs of <Col N="1460" /> the country, I think that giving the local authority representatives a majority is quite sufficient in the circumstances. As the years go by, I believe the professional and local authority groups will tend to work together; frequently there will be divisions of opinion with members of the local authority and professional groups in the case of a vote.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in the whole concept of having to ensure a very considerable majority of local authority representatives.  I think that quite a considerable number of professional men will tend to think not only in their professional capacity but also in relation to what they regard as good for the regional health board as a whole.  Some of them might feel that either too much was being spent and that there should be a more modest budget and, on the other hand, others might feel that not enough was being spent and that there should be a more liberal budget.  I do not see any division of opinion on which there would be a double grouping between the professional and local authority groups.  I am afraid on reviewing this matter I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, to some extent, repeated my own arguments in saying he cannot accept there would be any cleavage of interest between the public representatives and medical and other members of the board.  A point I made to which the Minister did not refer was that I regarded as inadequate the Minister's present numbers in regard to local authority representatives.  I cited the instance of the Limerick Health Board where 23 members represent the city and the county of Limerick; under the new set-up the Limerick Health Authority will become the Mid-Western Health Authority, comprising Limerick City and County, County Clare and North Tipperary.  The local authority members' representation will be reduced to probably 14 plus two.  As a public representative with many years experience in the working of local authority business and dealings with constituents, I regard this as inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's point with regard to <Col N="1461" /> the question of division does not arise; the local representatives and the medical and other representatives will work well together but I would point out to the Minister a fact of which I am sure he is aware&mdash;that the existing health boards have worked excellently together and I am sure the Minister would agree with me that they have done very fine and selfless work in the period of nine or ten years.  They have proved themselves, and if I were to give a personal opinion I would stick to the existing system, enlarge them where necessary or set up new boards.  The medical and other interests could be represented on consultative committees, which we have at the moment, and which are largely inoperative.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister will not accept the amendment; I do not intend to press it to a division but I would appeal to the Minister when it comes to nominating a majority&mdash;I do not ask for a substantial majority and I think that the figures I suggested, 60, 30, and 10, would not be regarded as substantial&mdash;to take into consideration the point I am emphasising, that the public representatives will have adequate representation and to ensure this the Minister would have to give them an adequate majority.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In page 7, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  A health board may, with the consent of the Minister, pay an allowance to its chairman in respect of expenses (other than expenses referred to in section 9) incurred by him in relation to the business of the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this will take very much time.  I undertook on Committee Stage that I would consider introducing an amendment to provide for making some allowances to members of a board, including the chairman and vice-chairman.  I consider in the present instance the allowance should be restricted to the chairman and the vice-chairman because of their extra duties in consulting with the chief executive officer on various matters, in preparing the agenda and in discussions and correspondence relating to meetings of the board and other miscellaneous matters.</P>
      <P>If we paid an allowance to members of the board I would be creating a precedent for vocational education committees, county committees of agriculture and corporate bodies under the aegis of my own Department, as well as corporate bodies of other Departments, and that would be going too far.</P>
      <P>The proposed allowance I would suggest would be in the nature of an allowance to cover the inevitable expenses of entertainment which the chairman or vice-chairman would have to meet.  It is also true to say that the chairman will be meeting on a number of occasions special committees of the board and this will add to his costs. This is really what was in the minds of most Senators and the Minister for Local Government is thinking on the same lines.  He has no objection to my putting forward this amendment although it does not absolutely commit him because health boards will be doing a great deal of work in their first years.  I have pleasure in commending this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said.  On Committee Stage on an amendment by Senator Desmond, which embraced more than that, I said I had sympathy with part of the amendment.  Paragraph (a) suggests that the health board may make an allowance to the chairman of the board and to the chairman of committees established under sections 7 and 8.  I could agree with part of it but not the whole and I think the Minister has met what was in my mind at that stage.</P>
      <P>For that reason I welcome the Minister's amendment and I think he is quite wise.  In my capacity as a member of the Dublin Health Authority and a past chairman I knew of a case of a person who was a chairman&mdash;unfortunately he is now deceased&mdash;who was of little means.  In the course of his duties as chairman he had to buy wreaths, do a certain amount of entertaining, <i>et cetera</i>, out of his own resources and as a result he was very badly hit financially.  I think the Minister is wise in opening up to any competent person of little means the chance to be chairman or vice-chairman of one of these boards.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for having gone so far in meeting the amendment put down by the Labour Party on Committee Stage.  However, it is a pity that this allowance cannot be extended to members because, as Senator Belton has mentioned with regard to chairmen being inhibited because of the expense they may incur as a result of being appointed, the same situation applies to wage-earners who are members of a local authority: if they get time off they lose a day's pay and their expenses are not covered.  As a result of this, you can have, perhaps, the best public representative on that local authority debarred economically because he cannot afford to sit on those committees.  While I am grateful to the Minister for going so far I hope he will take into consideration some similar payment or compensation to members.  This would be a valuable asset to those who find it economically impossible to sit on those committees at the moment.</P>

      <P>I, also, should like to join with other Senators in welcoming this amendment.  Fine Gael had an amendment on Committee Stage which was more or less along these lines, so we are naturally pleased that the Minister has had the good sense to introduce this.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister's difficulty in relation to the ordinary members of the health board but this is a step in the right direction, and it is a very important step.  To the best of my knowledge, nobody serves as a member of a local authority, and I doubt that anybody would serve as a member of the health board, with the idea of getting any financial gain or reward. This amendment will mean that the chairman will be able to devote all his talents and energies to making the activities of the board really important within their own administrative area.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment.  It is a good example of the way in which the Minister is prepared to meet the wishes of the House.  It is very important that when members or a member of the board are being removed that justice should be seen to be done and that the reasons for the removal should be stated.  That is the purport of this amendment.  It is an amendment which is good and useful but I cannot help expressing regret that when a chief executive officer finds reason for refusing the granting of a blue card to an applicant, that he, too, should not be under an obligation to state the reasons that led him to that decision.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 44, to add after &ldquo;board&rdquo; the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Within a period of six months after such temporary appointment has been made, the appropriate procedure shall be set in motion for the filling of the permanent appointment to the office of chief executive officer either under subsections (6), (7) or (8) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move amendment No. 5 for the reasons that I stated on Committee Stage.  Temporary appointments are quite prevalent in rural areas of this country and are bad for the person in office as well as for the health board in whose jurisdiction the temporary member resides.  On Committee Stage, the Minister indicated that there might <Col N="1466" /> be administrative difficulties in giving a shorter period&mdash;a period of two or three months&mdash;and it is for that reason that independently I have increased the period to six months.</P>
    <P>I notice that Senator Belton has also increased it to a like period and I cannot see that there can be any administrative difficulties which will hamper the setting in motion of procedure for a permanent appointment as it is.  I ask the Minister if he is aware of the prevalence of temporary appointments in rural areas and, particularly, in that part of Ireland from which I come, County Mayo, and if he is aware of the lack of security of tenure on the part of the person holding a temporary appointment.  That is something that ought to be discussed on this Bill. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to accept one or other of these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the reason why amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are being taken together is because their wording is practically the same. On Committee Stage I had an amendment down on behalf of Fine Gael setting the limit at two months while Senator Bourke in her amendment suggested a limit of three months but towards the end of that stage Senator Dooge suggested that the Minister might agree to our amendments if we extended them to six months.  The purpose behind these two amendments is to ensure that the appointment must be made within six months.  It may take some time after that to get a permanent holder.</P>
      <P>That is the purpose of the two amendments.  I am sure I am interpreting Senator Bourke on this.  The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would think it over before Report Stage.  He said he had a great deal of sympathy with everything said here but then he went on to list certain difficulties and he did not compromise himself in any way.  However, he said he had a great deal of sympathy with this.  The emphasis I would lay here again is not to appoint that person within that period but to ensure that the machinery to be used to appoint a permanent officer should be set up within that period of six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the two previous speakers on this matter very simply for the same reason that I think appointments which are left too long in abeyance and filled by temporary people tend to bring neither service to the country or to the individual. I realise there are difficulties in getting people sometimes but I think six months should be quite long enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention the fact that there is a section of an older Act which will apply to the health boards.  I refer to the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, section 6 subsection (2) which reads:</P>
      <P>Whenever a local authority does not, within three months after an office to which this Act applies becomes vacant or, in the case of a new office, is created, either request the Commissioners to recommend to them a person for appointment to such office or make an appointment (other than a temporary appointment) to such office under and in accordance with the provision of this Act dispensing with such request, the Minister may on behalf of such local authority request the Commissioners to recomment to such local authority a person for appointment to such office.</P>
      <P>This means that the Minister on the recommendation of the health board, or indeed acting on his own behalf, can try and speed up this procedure if there appears to be undue delay. I think this covers the views I expressed. There is so much referring back to previous Acts that I did not appreciate the information given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think having six months might in some cases indicate that such a delay was tolerable.  The difficulty of ensuring efficiency by legislation could mean that to some extent this might induce the health boards to fill the vacancies but I can see equally that as delays went on they might say: &ldquo;Well, we have six months&rdquo;.  I would prefer not to accept this amendment but the Seanad will be aware of the clause in the Local Authorities (Officers <Col N="1468" /> and Employees) Act, 1926, which enables the Minister to request the Local Appointments Commission to recommend such a local authority person for appointment.  This means the Minister has a statutory power of entering into the position three months after the position becomes vacant.  He is not obliged to do this but he may.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the important parts of both of those amendments is the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used in the second line of each of them.  I know we are getting a lot of talk about &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but surely it is clear that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is allowing the Minister whereas &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is obliging him. All I can say is it is very amusing to hear the Minister say that a six months period might be too long.  I understood him on Committee Stage to say that one of his main reasons for opposing this was that a two-month period would be too short.  I consider that what the Minister has read out of the 1926 Act does to some extent allay our fears but again there is no obligation on the Minister.  We sought that the Minister would be obliged to set this machinery in motion within the period in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not completely satisfied that the earlier Act referred to by the Minister meets the point.  It is only an enabling power at the discretion of the Minister if he wishes to make a recommendation to the health board to fill the temporary appointment.  If that power has existed for so long it does not appear to have been used.  We have a prevalence of temporary appointments of this nature in this country so this power is not obviously being used and there ought to be a limit.  I do not think it would have the effect the Minister suggests of stating that six months is an ideal period before one starts the process in motion for filling a temporary appointment. It is the outside limit for setting up legislation and we should take that outside limit and not leave it in the vague manner it is in.  As I said looking on our past record it is a rather sad one in matters of this kind.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter on Committee Stage and I would like to raise it again today.  The main reason is the actual wording of this section.  I am quite prepared to take the Minister's word that &ldquo;and the manner in which&rdquo; which is the phrase to be deleted applies to the administrative manner, that it does not interfere with medical services or the medical manner, but the Medical Association feel that this is a very dangerous clause to leave in in such a wide manner and for this reason I would like the Minister to reconsider it again.  We are particularly anxious that he would do so because as I mentioned on the Committee Stage the discussions between the Association and the officials of the Department on 5th May, 1967, reached apparent agreement on this point that this type of phraseology would not be used.  I am sure it would not be beyond the powers of the parliamentary draftsman to find some way of giving the chief executive officer all the powers from the administrative point of view and yet making it very clear that those powers did not interfere with the medical manner.  I would very much like the Minister to reconsider this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is again for the reasons which were put forward on Committee Stage, on this point that it is the function of the chief executive officer to carry out the administrative duties allotted to him in this area and that the wording, the extent to which a person will avail of services, is an administrative matter and properly within the terms of reference of the CEO, but the other wording &ldquo;and the manner in which&rdquo; is wider than that and I would submit, although it would be rare that there would be a clash between the CEO and the medical officers on this board, it could occur.  I would like to give possible examples which could give rise for difficulties.  For example I suggest if an old person receiving treatment was told by the medical officer that he wished to assign him or her to a geriatric home the executive <Col N="1470" /> officer could say &ldquo;No, the manner in which this person will be treated will be in a mental home&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is within the terms of this Act. It could happen.  A CEO might decide that the manner in which the person would be treated should be in a particular hospital whereas the doctor would prefer the person to be treated in a different one.  I am not a medical practitioner but I feel the wording could cut across what is within the professional area and not the administrative area.  In supporting Senator Alton, I emphasise that the wording &ldquo;the extent to which&rdquo; adequately covers any administrative functions which the CEO would seek to exercise.  It does not in any way hamper the scheme which we are setting up.</P>

We felt it did not make the position sufficiently clear.  Now we have used the wording derived from the City and County Management Act, 1955, which has been in operation for 14 years.  Section 1 (a) refers to individual health functions, meaning functions with respect to decisions whether a particular person should be able to avail of a particular service, including a service for the payment of grants or allowances made available under the Health Acts of 1947 and 1954 and the Mental Treatment Act of 1945 and 1954, or as to the extent to which and the manner in which a person should receive treatment or otherwise avail himself of any such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in fact, were copying a section <Col N="1471" /> from a previous Act which never gave rise to any complaint or caused any scandal or resulted in very important representations from the Medical Association. We altered the section to the way in which it appears in the present Bill.  There is no intention to interfere with treatment.  This refers to administrative arrangements which are to be made for the treatment of persons availing themselves of services under the Health Act.  Many administrative arrangements have to be made by the CEO of a kind which have no relation to the manner in which the patient can be treated.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the section I have quoted in the previous Act never gave rise to trouble, no one can object to the way in which the section has been amended.  No one with commonsense could object to it, particularly when I have explained it twice in the Seanad.  Having explained it twice in the Seanad, the Members of this House could imagine what would happen if the CEO started to use this section in such a way as to conflict with the independence of the judgment of members of the IMA.</P>

      <P>I have heard the Minister explain twice why those words are not necessary at all: if they were used it would cause such a scandal that the CEO would have to change his mind.  The Minister told us there never was any row in the past about this.  They never caused a scandal. The Minister did not give us a single example of positive value coming from this or a way in which this could be used.  The Minister said if it were used in a bad way it would cause an enormous row.  The Minister did not give an example of a good way in which it might be used.  It sounded to me that the only way in which it could be used would be a way which would cause an enormous row and therefore, it would not be used in this way and would not be used at all.  This could be useless or dangerous.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I fully accept the Minister's explanation.  I have no doubt the Minister would act in this reasonable <Col N="1472" /> and fair manner.  The associations have pressed this one point for months past and have regarded it as extremely serious. I fail to understand why, if there is not some tremendous importance to the draftsman behind these words, and if they are not of significance, the amendment cannot be accepted.  I do not like quibbling over small points, but the associations regarded this as a very important point.  Since the last meeting of the Seanad I have been approached by them on this score.  I would not have brought up an amendment again on the same terms as before if they did not consider it important. The Minister says no case has come before him.  The associations are conscious of decisions made by county managers in the past which the doctors have found difficult to live with.  There is strong feeling about this matter.  I am sorry that the Minister could not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 12 and 13 to delete &ldquo;or for continuing as an officer&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a repetition of an amendment put in on Committee Stage.  I have chosen to move it again because I was not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister.  I am not satisfied with the fact that we appear to be continuing, in this new Health Bill, a practice which is part of local government appointments in this country, and that the only explanation I can pin on the wording &ldquo;for continuing as an officer&rdquo; is that once a woman marries she will no longer be employed in a permanent capacity by the board. Therefore, in many cases now the position is that a married woman will be re-employed in a temporary capacity.  This would be greatly to her disadvantage.  On Committee Stage, the Minister mentioned the wonderful Commission on the Status of Women which would look into the whole question of the employment of women.  I welcome the fact that the Commission are being set up.  We must not continue malpractice in our legislation, particularly legislation on a large-scale social <Col N="1473" /> question like this, pending the findings of this Commission when they are eventually set up.  They will report and presumably a long period will elapse before the report is implemented. I think that now in the beginning of 1970 we ought to eliminate from future legislation what I see hidden here, and that is discrimination against married women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanAlton" hpid="Dr. Alton Dr. Alton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Bourke on this amendment both for the reasons she has given and also because we have been informed that in the section there is a sentence referring to a woman continuing as an officer in a temporary capacity if she had married, and this certainly is against the spirit of the age.  More important, I cannot see any reason for the phrase at all, because surely the conditions of appointment can be written into the initial conditions and these would be fixed and could include things like continuing good health and continuing single.  One might interpret this phrase as saying that some time in the future there might be a change in conditions for qualification for appointment which could be to the detriment of a person holding the position, and I would therefore very strongly support Senator Bourke in asking for the deletion of this phrase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1970 we are still apparently prepared to victimise women civil servants for the crime of marriage.  I do not know whether the Minister sees where this will ultimately lead.  It could be an encouragement for women civil servants to live in sin, which apparently is the basic result of this, and to use the fact of marriage against a woman as if it were some crime against the community or some cardinal sin surprises me in the Seventies.  I am also surprised that the <Col N="1474" /> present Minister before us should support such a retrograde attitude, and I am disappointed that he cannot accept this amendment.  I am disappointed, too, that he has not had better thoughts since the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 12 between lines 16 and 17 to insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The Minister shall not approve or direct any qualification specifying that any woman holding office be either unmarried or a widow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, this amendment was down on the Committee Stage and what has been said on the previous amendment applies to it with the difference that the Minister replied to this amendment on the Committee Stage and did point out&mdash;and very rightly&mdash;that this, of course, would be a Cabinet decision and that we could not expect him to take this decision on his own.  I did, however, point out that perhaps between it and the Report Stage he could consult with the Cabinet, and though he did not undertake to have a Cabinet decision I think he gave some sort of an indication that he would consult with the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>I was also rather hopeful that he would accept it, having discussed it with his Cabinet, because there are many members of the Cabinet who are on public record as being in favour of improving the status of women in the community.  This qualification seems to apply only in the public sector.  I have never come across it anywhere in the industrial sector and in fact at the moment in the industrial sector they are positively encouraging women to stay on after marriage. They are probably becoming an economic necessity now, and recent statements from the FII and the FUE would seem to indicate that this is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has made some very true comments about what it might encourage women in the Civil Service to do.  I think that perhaps we <Col N="1475" /> might refer the Minister to the famous case of the French air hostess who tried to sue the airline for encouraging concubinage because they had a similar regulation there.  I presume that the Minister would not fancy having a future member of the staff of a health board having to take a similar action.</P>
    <P>I understand there are provisions in the 1941 Act which cover this point about which there is some doubt as to whether it is contrary to the Constitution. I have had some legal advice on it.  Again I am asking the Minister to at least give an assurance that he will not bring in any qualification.  The Bill as it stands gives the Minister power to bring in any qualification.  If the Minister would give a personal assurance that he would not, in fact, bring in any such qualification specifying that a woman health officer should have to be either unmarried or a widow I would be prepared to accept the Minister's assurance and not press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I sympathise with a lot of what is being said in relation to the status of women, I cannot initiate a precedent in this matter until there is a general consensus of the whole community expressed through a Government decision and a Dáil decision on the question of the position of women in our society.  The Bill does not prevent married women from being employed by health boards if the qualifications are changed.  This Bill does not deal with the position of married women in employment, but qualifications are declared, and it is a fact at the moment that qualifications are declared which do not admit married persons becoming candidates for certain positions.  I simply cannot create this kind of innovation.  I honestly think that it would create chaos in the administrative world and indeed in the political world if a Minister could quite suddenly introduce a completely novel concept in advance of any other Minister or in advance of a general consideration by the community at large.  I think that it is asking too much of me to take this step, so I am afraid that I have to refuse this amendment.  Might I say again that <Col N="1476" /> there is nothing in the Bill which prevents qualifications providing for the rights of married women to apply for certain positions.</P>

      <P>This is a very good enunciation of conservative policy, that nothing should ever be done for the first time.  I think that something should be done for the first time, and occasionally some Ministers should be in advance of their colleagues&mdash;and Senator Belton has given us one example.  I see no reason why the present Minister should not set a good example.  I have indicated the horrible effect that might result from encouraging women civil servants to remain unmarried, but even worse probably could result, since it could be regarded as encouraging them to take positive steps to become widows.  This is a disturbing aspect of the matter. In all sincerity I believed that the Minister would go further in theory on this road, but in practice he has continued to be so reluctant to be in advance of any of his colleagues, and that is a pretty grim admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, to sum up, I am disappointed because the Minister in his reply has not indicated whether he did discuss it with the Cabinet.  I do not know whether he had time to do so, and perhaps it was rather short to look for a decision by the Cabinet, but I fail to understand why the Cabinet as such would not accept this as at least a start to bringing the women of Ireland into the 1970s.  I think it is very retrograde that we have to wait for a commission to put things right, and that until the commission tell us that a thing is wrong we cannot accept an amendment to put it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I think that the existence of <Col N="1477" /> this type of regulation in the public sector is discriminating against a particular class of person, and the nursing profession is one that has suffered terribly from this.  I recently heard an example of a nurse who was taken back into a local hospital when she returned from her honeymoon.  She could only work night duty and she could only do a certain number of hours and she was given pay at the day rate.  This is absolutely ridiculous, and it is not a thing that we should like to continue.</P>
    <P>I would have thought we would have got better from the Cabinet, because there seems to be some forward thinking now among Ministers.  The Minister referred to their recent Ard Fheis at which they adopted at least two resolutions which have been put forward.  I do not think that this amendment is anything away out of <Col N="1478" /> line at all.  I do not think we are asking too much for the Minister to accept it or to give a personal assurance. He has pointed out that there is nothing in the Bill at the moment, but it was to anticipate that which has happened in the Civil Service and the local government service would not be brought into the health boards I put this amendment down.  If I got an assurance from the Minister that he would not introduce any qualification, then I would withdraw the amendment. Otherwise, I shall have to press for a division.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) a decision either on the termination of such suspension or the removal of such suspended officer shall be taken within three months of the notification of the suspension to the Minister by the chief executive officer, as provided within the procedures set out in section 22 and section 23&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment which has just been put forward by the Government and agreed by the House meets some of the dangers of the procedure under which we were going ahead under section 21 of this Act as regards the suspension of an officer.  The amendment that is being put forward here would complete that process in setting a maximum period within which the suspension would last before there was a decision on it.  In a sense, it is in accordance with the principle of natural justice that a person has a right to know within a fairly short period what is his status and whether his suspension will last.  It is important that there be a time limit on the suspension and in this case three months is more than adequate because the position for a suspended person would be an invidious one.  If one is wrongly suspended there ought to be a right to a hearing within a short time.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Bourke that the previous amendment covered most of the problems concerning this section.  However, there still remains the case of a person who would suffer undue hardship because of the section.  I can understand the Minister telling us in his reply the last day of the hitch there might be in the case of personnel who might be waiting for trial on a criminal offence, in which case it would not be possible to go ahead with the proceedings for suspension in a certain fixed limit, but very many cases that come up would not fall into these categories and could be disposed of fairly quickly.  At the same time, there would be many cases in which there was no question of criminal proceedings or of illness and it is for that reason that I should like the Minister to try to see his way to putting in some further clauses which would mitigate hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is another case of my examining proposals made on the Committee Stage.  The purpose of the amendment is to enable the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Local Government to specify the fact as to the person making the determination in regard to the nature of allocating contributions by the local authorities.  It was Senator Alexis FitzGerald who first mooted this, not Senator Alton.  The sort of factors which might be taken into account are the present proportion in which local authorities meet local expenditure the previous system for division of costs, for example on a valuation basis, or in the case of numbers of patients.  Instead of reading down a list, I think I should say that the person appointed by the Minister to arbitrate on the division of the allocation of costs will have regard to such matters as I will specify after consulting the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House knows, the Rating Committee have been sitting examining the whole question of valuations. <Col N="1482" /> The Minister for Local Government has said he will do something with regard to some measure of equalisation in regard to the rates proposed as between one county and another. There has recently been a very interesting report by the Economic and Research Council in regard to county incomes but this only relates to county incomes in 1960 and 1965 and the increase of incomes which has taken place between those two periods. There may be other studies which will be useful and for which the consent of the Minister for Local Government might be forthcoming, so I think it is best to put it in as I have in a general way: &ldquo;such matters as may be specified&rdquo;. I think the Minister for Local Government would naturally try to conclude whatever seemed relevant in the prevailing circumstances.</P>

This would appear to remove the protection of those Acts from officers of health authorities or other authorities which will be transferred to the health boards. Many of those officers came into local government service under the various Local Government Acts and it is felt the Health Bill should ensure by positive statement, not by implication, that the existing conditions which will apply to those officers under the Local Government Acts should continue to apply on the establishment of the health boards.</P>

      <P>I think the main worry of the various people who have been in touch with Senator Belton in regard to this was that there were certain provisions in the various Acts from 1925 onwards which the officials at present working for health authorities more or less took as their charter and they felt they had a certain amount of protection from various sections of those enactments.  They do not seem to be too clear now as to whether they will have the same sort of protection as they had heretofore.  They feel if this charter is being removed their conditions of service are being worsened and it is because of this we have suggested that this amendment might be accepted so as to make it quite clear to those officials that their position is not in any way being damaged.  This is the main reason we have tabled this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have made it clear the position of officers who are transferred will not be worsened.  There will be a joint consultative council.  I understand the rights officers have in regard to superannuation and all essential matters will remain the same under this Bill.  I have a very long statement I could read out and it goes through all the sections of the Local Government <Col N="1484" /> Act, 1945, which apply and the extent to which they are applied in this Bill.  However, I think the best way is as I have done already.  If I were to accept this amendment I would be applying law relating to local government officers to some officers of health boards and not to others and this would lead to complexity and uncertainty in regard to the legal positions The Local Government provisions and those in the Bill are sufficiently similar for me to be able to give a guarantee to the House that no person who is transferred to a health board will suffer because of a failure on my part to have the Bill amended by applying the various provisions of earlier Acts to any greater degree than they have already been applied.  I do not think the House need worry about this.</P>

      <P>I know that this is difficult but what I was trying to get at was if there was any provision in local Government Acts up to this that on the transfer of those officers authority would be taken away from the transferees, that is under the health boards when the transferees are transferred from one health board to another.  If the Minister can assure me that those people will not suffer I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>The provisions of section 22 are modelled on sections of the 1941 Act.  They are in fact an improvement on them in so far as they provide a more democratic procedure where it is proposed to remove an officer because of misconduct or unfitness. The Committee investigating the removal under section 23 will include persons selected from a panel of persons nominated by his representative organisation.  I understand that is the only difference regarding the privileges of officers.  All the others remain the same.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but I still feel that I should like to put forward the amendment because at the Committee Stage I described the clause as it stands as being the type of blank cheque which ought not allow functions to be delegated to any body which we set up.  It is out of tune with other functions of the section.  The <Col N="1486" /> amendment which I brought in at Committee Stage was not the proper amendment.  It purported to delete the phrase.  As the Minister and other speakers pointed out, this regional hospital council are a new body which require certain flexibility.  By deleting that phrase entirely this was giving away the necessary flexibility in the regional council.  The amendment which the Government put forward will now insert the word &ldquo;cognate&rdquo;. If the Minister would accept &ldquo;by regulation of the Minister&rdquo; following that I would accept that amendment simply because further on in the section it says that such regulations have to be laid in draft before the House.  The House would know what cognate functions relating to the existing functions were being given to this new regional council.  If the Minister would consent to add on the words &ldquo;prescribed by regulation of the Minister&rdquo; I would accept it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has taken an important step in suggesting that this should read &ldquo;other cognate functions&rdquo;.  I would feel happier if there could be a combination of these two amendments.  Senator Miss Bourke is right when she says that the paragraph should not end on the words &ldquo;as may be prescribed&rdquo;.  It is important that the manner of prescription and the person of the prescriber should be quite clear.  As at present drafted it reads &ldquo;as may be prescribed&rdquo; by any body.  The manner of prescription is not given either.  The word &ldquo;other&rdquo; certainly improves the paragraph. Senator Miss Bourke is right in asking that the words &ldquo;by regulation of the Minister&rdquo; be incorporated in it.</P>

      <P>This is another of those questions.  I am learning more in relation to precise definitions.  In section 2 of the Health Act, 1947, there is an expression which has not been repealed. It says that &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister under the Act.  So long as the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; is in it it covers what the Senator suggests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for recommitting this amendment. I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 22, line 48, to delete &ldquo;one-half&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two-thirds&rdquo;; in line 51 to delete &ldquo;one-half&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one-third&rdquo; and to add after &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; in line 56 &ldquo;: provided, however, that a majority of members on the board shall consist of persons who are members of a council or of a county borough or of the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the composition of the hospital boards will be in line with the composition of the health boards.  As I read the Bill, it could happen that a substantial majority of the hospital boards could be non-local authority members.  I do not know whether that was the Minister's intention in this section of the Bill.  He has accepted in principle that the health boards should contain a majority of elected representatives&mdash;the nominees of the local authorities.  The same principle should apply in regard to the hospital boards for the same good reasons put forward when the House argued on the composition of the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into it in great detail.  The amendment may not be the correct way of achieving this purpose. <Col N="1488" /> I am prepared to agree with the alternative wording the Minister suggests. I suggest strongly that in the interests of working together as a unified body the same principle should apply in regard to the larger hospital boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Russell on this.  Although the argument for a preponderance of local authorities on the regional hospital boards is not as strong to me as on the regional health boards, I feel that local representatives would take issue with us who are councillors if we did not press their case to have adequate representation, and by adequate I would say at least equal or more than equal representation on regional hospital boards.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister may have very cogent reasons why he did not include this in the concession he gave on the regional health board.  I can see that he might have, and we are putting this amendment forward to bring these out and to get his reasons, if they are valid, why he cannot accept this amendment.  We are very strong in our advocacy of local representation being preponderant on the regional health boards.  We may not be as strong in our advocacy here, but we felt at the same time that in order to allay the fears of local representatives throughout the country we had to put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that I had dealt with this matter sufficiently on a previous occasion.  The regional health boards will be planning bodies with very important co-ordinating functions and they will be doing some of the work being done by my Department in relation to future hospital planning.  They will be working towards the greater integration and/or co-ordination of the voluntary and the health board hospitals, but some 44 per cent, I think it is, of the patients who go from the local authorities go to voluntary hospitals for treatment, and in relation to this regional planning we have also to think of the hospitals which have a teaching function, and as the State pays about 75 per cent of the total cost of the health services I want to be very certain that the whole of this planning is carried out <Col N="1489" /> on a basis of considering the positions of the hospitals themselves; so in connection with the regional hospital boards I do not think there should be a majority of regional board representation thereon.  I think that I should have a considerable part to play in the appointment of those people.  They will be planning bodies, and I am quite certain that the representatives from the health boards will be well able to play their part through the present arrangements under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I can see Senator Belton's point of view about this, but I think that I have gone far enough in giving local authority representatives a majority on the health boards.  I hope that the representatives nominated to the regional hospital boards from the health boards will consist of local authority health board members who have a very wide view of this whole subject and who have the capacity of thinking collectively as well as being representatives at the same time of their own health board area, because this is a very complex question of how far we provide ambulant consultants for a health board area, how far we agree to the provision of certain superspecialities being undertaken in a regional hospital board area, and other complex matters, on which I want the advice of everyone that I can get including the medical consultants employed in both types of hospitals&mdash;voluntary hospitals and health board hospitals&mdash;and consultants interested in the teaching side on this question which is inevitably linked with it.  I do not think that anybody would say I was wrong in insisting on the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will forgive me saying that I think he is wrong.  The position is that in certain circumstances the local authority representation could be as low as 25 per cent, because the Minister is aware that these health boards will consist of nominees of local authorities, possibly just more than 50 per cent, and representatives of the medical and other interests.  When it comes to electing the personnel on the regional hospital boards, the same proportions may very well ensue, and with all due <Col N="1490" /> respect to the Minister I think that in order to have adequate planning and the forward-looking boards that he hopes to achieve, it will be necessary to have adequate representation for men who have given long years on local authorities and in some cases on the existing health boards.</P>
      <P>As this section of the Bill stands it is quite possible, in fact it is almost certain, that they would not be represented, and there might be an inclination on the part of the health boards to exclude representatives other than members of local authorities from the hospital boards.  I think that this would be a detrimental step, and in order to ensure that the temptation to do this will not arise, I am suggesting&mdash;I am prepared to give way on the question of the majority but&mdash;that the Minister should in principle accept that the local authority representation should be adequately represented on the hospital board.  I think this is vitally necessary for the Minister's hopes, and that public representatives have an important part to play in the planning and other work of these boards.  I hope that the Minister will find some method of ensuring adequate representation for local authority representatives.  As it stands at present they need not be adequately represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Russell on this.  The Minister is placing great importance, and rightly so, on these new hospital boards and on the fact that they will be engaged in long-term planning and rationalisation of the hospital services.  I know that the Minister would like as much as possible to have the views of all the people concerned in the hospital service adequately represented, and, as Senator Russell pointed out, the number of local authority representatives on the new hospital boards could well be as low as 25 per cent if the health boards wanted to appoint an equal number of non-politicians as well as of local authority representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Russell has pointed out, if the health board members are obsessed by this idea of their small representation they might conceivably use their slight overall majority to see <Col N="1491" /> that all their appointees to the hospital boards are elected representatives and exclude the professional representatives from the health boards.  You could also have a point that if a hospital board were comprised of 30 members, only seven or eight of those, that is about one-quarter, being public representatives, the viewpoint of any one of the political parties might not adequately be expressed at that hospital board meetings.</P>
    <P>I know, as I said, that the Minister very sincerely feels that these boards will play an important part and that he will want to hear the views, and probably the contrary views, of everybody in a sincere effort to bring about the proper planning of the hospital services.  In this I assume that the views and attitudes and policies of each <Col N="1492" /> political party would be represented, but it could be that there might be only one or two representatives from one of the major political parties serving on these boards and their real contribution which could be made would consequently be lost.  The Minister might think out this whole problem in the light of this suggestion, which we have made not in any political sense but in the sincere effort to see these hospital boards working as well as possible.</P>

      <P>(2)  Where in the opinion of the responsible officer of a health board an emergency exists and services under this chapter can more expeditiously be provided by an adjoining health board he shall forthwith requistion such services as he deems to be urgently necessary.</P>
      <P>(3)  The cost of providing services under subsections (1) or (2) shall be recouped by the board which provided such service from the board which availed of that service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is phrased exactly as one of the two amendments coming out of Committee <Col N="1495" /> Stage and it is put down, because, after some discussion, and because the Minister said that he would have a look at it before Report Stage and because he assured the House that this can be done very easily.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that he said this I have put down the same amendment. The reasons I gave on Committee Stage were that they are two separate parts and the third is a part concerning methods of recruitment.  The first is where a semi-emergency would occur and in which case a board could meet. The second part of this amendment is to ensure that when an emergency arises, the CEO can request services from a neighbouring board&mdash;in other words, that the borders of the eight boards can be crossed for emergency services.  It can be done by the chief executive officer.  This is different.  The Minister made the point on Committee Stage that this could be done by arrangement between boards but supposing no arrangement exists between boards, supposing boards do not agree.  Then I want this amendment to go in so that in those cases the CEO would have the power in semi-emergencies to ask permission, and so that in emergencies the services would be requisitioned from the neighbouring health board, that is, emergency services like ambulances, resuscitation and other services of that nature.  The point is self-evident.</P>

      <P>All right.  I will not be long.  The amendment is self-evident. The argument the Minister made on the Committee Stage was that the boards could get together, and I know there are provisions for the boards to come together to deal with certain services, but there are two points which may <Col N="1496" /> invalidate his argument.  They may not come together because the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is not used in that section. The boards do not meet that often and some power should be given to the CEO or the responsible officer of the board at the time in the case of a semi-emergency where expedition might be of value that he could ask the neighbouring health board to give him the services required and when an emergency occurs that he requisition the emergency services from the neighbouring health board.  The recoupment is set out there and it is quite obvious what it will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined this argument and the legal officer advises me there are adequate provisions under section 25 (2) for two health boards to carry out an arrangement by which one can cross the border to the area of the other and obtain the services required under the various Health Acts. In regard to emergency services, there are really two ways of doing it.  When the health boards first meet one of their first ordinary resolutions will be to instruct the chief executive officer to take advantage of this section of the Bill for the conducting of emergency services as between two neighbouring health boards.  Secondly, if they did not do that or if they were lax in their obligation I could at any time under section 16, subsection (4) (e) give to the chief executive officers of health boards sanction to take the decision themselves in regard to health boards collaborating on emergency services or indeed on any such services where there ought to be a permanent arrangement.  The legal officer advises me that there is no need for this amendment.</P>

Section 25, subsection (2) states that: &ldquo;Two health boards may&rdquo;. There are two points in that.  Those are health boards.  When do they meet to carry that out?

That, of course, should be the case but I think it is worthy of being embraced within the Bill and that is the reason I have put down this amendment.  It is a very important point and it also goes beyond the power allocated to the chief executive officer at certain stages.  I am going beyond that in this amendment.  I appreciate what the Minister says.  I appreciate also that if he sees a failure in this he will rectify it, but I feel it is of such great importance that neighbouring boards should be made to cooperate in such a manner as I have said and also that a board should relinquish the chief executive officer in certain cases of semi-emergency or emergency.  Roughly, that is the whole purpose of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 37, line 37, before &ldquo;terminate&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for good and sufficient reasons stated in writing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> The amendment is self-explanatory.  Its purpose is to add after the words in subsection (13) where it states that the Minister may at any time terminate the appointment of a member of the board who is appointed by him, the words, or the equivalent wording to &ldquo;for good and sufficient reasons stated in writing&rdquo;. The reasons are self-explanatory. I hope the Minister will accept them. The Minister himself in section 11 (2) inserted his own amendment to the effect that where the Minister makes an order under subsection (1) he will notify the persons who have been removed from office as members of the board of the making of the order and of his reasons for the removal.  It seems to me the same principle should apply in regard to his own nominees on this board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely agree with this.  The Minister may feel his appointee is involved in this but I still think that the same rule should apply here as applied in the case Senator Russell has spoken of.  The reason should be given.  This is a fair request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction between removal of members of the board where there are not personal reasons for the removal and the removal of members of the board appointed by the Minister, although it has very rarely happened.  There are circumstances in which I do not think it would be desirable for the Minister to give his reasons.  I have got advice on this and I think I am right in saying that if, for example, somebody appointed by the Minister was becoming a psychiatric case or indisposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it would be much better not to have to give the reason. There are other circumstances which could arise like that and I think it had better be left to the Minister in charge, who very rarely has used this power. It has been in the Nurses Authority Act, 1960 and the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957, all of which have similar provisions.  In State company <Col N="1501" /> appointments where directors are appointed by the Minister he can dismiss them without stating a reason. That, I think, has been rather rare, but nevertheless there are definite circumstances where he would not like to have to give a reason.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all be quite satisfied that the present Minister would certaintly not be guilty of any excess under this section, but, as Senator Belton pointed out, supposing that there was a change of Government and the new Minister did not particularly like the nominees of his predecessor there is nothing to stop him terminating their membership without giving any reason whatsoever. The Minister has quoted a number of reasons why he should not state the reason, and I would accept that, but I think we can also quote plenty of reasons why it should be stated&mdash;in fact I do not see why the principle applied in the case of members of the board should not be applied in the case of the Minister's own nominees. It seems to me that it is a good principle. After all, speaking as one who has some experience of what a Minister can do in certain circumstances, I think that anybody who is removed by Ministerial Order is entitled to know why he is being removed.  This is only fair and just, and I am rather surprised that the Minister would not accept it, if necessary in his own wording under section 11.  I would be quite prepared to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill which prevents a Minister giving a reason for the dismissal of a person, and I think that the House will appreciate that if a Minister chooses to remove appointees made by the Minister of another Government it would be perfectly obvious that he was doing it perhaps for political reasons.  He would not have to tell this to people at all.  Looking back on a long experience in what are now five different Departments, although there are exceptions to this there is general <Col N="1502" /> continuity of appointment in relation to appointments to boards.  A great number of people continue to be appointed until they reach an advanced age.</P>
      <P>Certainly in the case of the eight State companies over which I had supervision, I did not remove people when their term of office expired if they were appointed for three or five years.  There were two cases of people between 70 and 80 who were not reappointed. On the whole, there is a general tradition of continuity, and again I may say that if a Minister chooses on political grounds, and perhaps rightly, to change appointees because they were incapable of representing his point of view on the board, it would be perfectly obvious to the public why he was doing so.  It would be more than evident.</P>
      <P>There might be some instances in which the Minister would be entitled to do this if some Ministerial appointees of a previous Government were people who had very definite viewpoints about the health services which they had expressed&mdash;entirely party political views. Then the Minister for Health of the day might feel that it would be better balanced by appointing other people, but certainly he would not need to give a reason in those circumstances.  Again, this is a pragmatic matter.  I think myself that should a Minister decide to remove one of these representatives then the situation would arise which would be one that will be apparent to everybody, unless it is a case of a delicate kind such as I mentioned&mdash;somebody who he knows is in such grave trouble that it would be better if he were out of it, or somebody psychologically indisposed, or something of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanAlton" hpid="Dr. Alton Dr. Alton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister because he had assured me that when the representatives chosen from the medical group were appointed by him they would be given the same status as the county councillors in the health boards, and when we were talking about the regional hospital boards he told me that, being extensions of his Department, he would have to maintain the right to terminate their appointments.</P>
      <P>We are very concerned that such good relations which exist between the present Minister and the medical profession might not continue and we might revert to a stage some years ago where we had very severe and unpleasant relations with a former Minister.  We are concerned, therefore, that we would have representatives who could speak out their minds and be straightforward about things without running the risk of losing their seats on whichever of our boards they worked. This is very important because we hope that under this Bill there will be a much greater degree of co-operation between the medical profession, the local authorities and the Department of Health.  This is the first time in the history of Ireland or England when the medical profession have been given seats on executive boards on the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regard this as an important advance. Ireland and England are the only two countries that did not up to now give doctors seats on such boards and, therefore, we regard this Bill as acceptance of the maturity of medical and professional opinion and we hope to have a long period of working in harmony with the Department of Health and the local authorities.  We think an essential for this harmony is that our representatives, even though appointed by the Minister, would have security of tenure and would not be liable to dismissal at a moment's notice by a Minister who might not perhaps be as far-sighted and just as the present Minister.  I am anxious that this amendment should go through so that these people would be given security of <Col N="1504" /> tenure and a guarantee that they would not be dismissed without good reason and that reason stated in writing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Alton has enunciated it very clearly.  This amounts to a &ldquo;hire and fire section&rdquo; without any stated reasons for terminating membership of one of the Minister's own nominees and this is bad in principle. It is accepted in common justice where a man's services are terminated in any code that a reason is given and he has the protection of a trade union. I have had experience of this and I know what it can mean.  The Minister and I have given perhaps two extreme examples but in between there could be good and sufficient reason why a member should have an opportunity of hearing his case or seeing it stated in writing and I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision.</P>
      <P>The success of these boards will depend on the amicable and united efforts of the members concerned and they would like to know, even the Minister's nominees, that they have security of tenure even for five years. The Minister is going to be very selective in appointing his nominees and I find it difficult to believe that in a period of a few years they will suddenly suffer from psychiatric or other troubles.  I think the Minister is being unreasonable in this and I say this with some temerity because he has been most co-operative and receptive both in the Dáil and the Seanad.  I would appeal to him to reconsider his attitude in regard to this and not to be so adamant about a point I regard as being contrary to common justice and fair play.</P>

      <P>In page 38, line 14, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and shall be an annual meeting&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> The wording of amendment No. 37 is slightly different to the 1960 Act which already allowed 14 days.  It is in actual fact practically a facsimile of what came out of the 1960 Act with slight variations.  The section goes on to state:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( )  The Board shall at their first meeting appoint a day of the year not earlier than the 1st day of July nor later than the 21st day of July for the holding of annual meetings and may at any subsequent annual meeting alter the day so appointed.</P>
    <P>( )  The Board shall hold an annual meeting in each year and the meeting shall be held on the day which is for the time being appointed for the holding of annual meetings under these rules, unless that day falls on a Sunday or bank holiday, when the meeting shall be held on the next following day which is neither a Sunday nor a bank holiday.</P>
    <P>( )  If the first or any other annual meeting of the board is for any reason (including a quorum not being present) not held on the day appointed for the holding thereof under these rules, the secretary of the board shall as soon as may be summon a meeting of the Board for a convenient hour on a day which appears to him to be the earliest convenient date for the purpose, and the meeting held in pursuance of that summons shall be for all purposes an annual meeting held on the date appointed under these rules&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What we are trying to get at here, and this is in conjunction with amendment No. 35, is that we want the health boards to have annual meetings.  This was contained in the 1960 Act and we want it brought in here for the regional health boards.  It is contained in the First Schedule of the 1960 Health Act. For these two amendments our purpose is that annual meetings would be held and that at these annual meetings there would be rotation of chairmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that annual meetings are held and that a new chairman and vice-chairman are appointed at these meetings is very important from the point of view of having a new person coming into the position of chairman and benefiting from the 12 months' experience.  I have seen in the two or three years I have been in the Dublin Health Authority the changes in the attitude, in the knowledge and experience of the several people who were chairmen of the authority.  I am thinking particularly of the fantastic increase in experience and interest in the health services which Deputy Richie Ryan had after spending 12 months as chairman of the health authority and realising the intricacies and problems which officials, trying to provide a comprehensive and modern service, come up against.</P>
      <P>It is also of interest from the point of view of the general public that if a new chairman is appointed annually the public are more inclined to take an interest in the health board whereas if a chairman were to be appointed for a five-year period he might be very much &ldquo;old hat&rdquo; at the end of that period; people might not want to have him come to speak to them, or open some new service they were providing. From this point of view it is bringing the health boards more into the mind of the general public and affording to five members rather than to one the opportunity of learning considerably about all the intricacies of the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> For this reason I ask the Minister seriously to consider accepting this amendment.  It is more or less a verbatim copy of rules 10 to 14 of the First Schedule to the Health Authority Acts of 1960 with slight modifications to the date within which the annual meeting can be held and there is a reference in Rule 38 to the fact that an officer or servant of the board cannot be chairman or vice-chairman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We could argue about this for a very long time.  It is obvious that there are different points of view about this question of annual meetings and about how often the chairman is replaced.  I put in amendment No. 36 which provides for 12 meetings during the year of each health board but not by the regional hospital board or Comhairle na nOspidéal.  It will be open to each health board if they so desire to make standing orders providing for the holding of annual meetings.</P>
      <P>The board are rather different from a health authority in some senses and each board should be given some discretion in deciding how best to order their affairs.  I do not propose to restrict them except by insisting that they meet 12 times each year.  Members also have plenty of time to consider how they wish to order their affairs and whether they wish to have their chairman elected annually or otherwise.  I prefer a sort of pragmatic touch relying on the intelligence of the board to order their affairs in respect of matters like this and my compromise is amendment No. 36 in which I insure that they meet 12 times each year.  It is up to them to decide whether they wish to appoint a new chairman or vice-chairman each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been occasions in the past history of local authorities where quite evidently chairmen, although most dedicated people, have been allowed to remain in office for too long because no one wanted to offend them by removing them.  Incidentally, one can also think of chairmen who have been extremely active right up to a very advanced age and who were better than any other chairmen who might have been appointed to the particular <Col N="1508" /> local authority.  The situation varies from place to place and we have reached the stage in the modern world with young people taking more interest in these affairs and a lot of the older generation retiring where we ought to leave it to the health board to make their decision as to whether they wish to change their chairman every year. They can do that under the Bill and amendment No. 36 insures that they meet often enough to take a lively interest in their affairs.  I could not accept amendments Nos. 35 and 37.</P>

      <P>The whole purpose of amendments Nos. 35 and 37 is to enable a change of chairman so that we could have these annual general meetings.  I do not mean a change of chairman <i>per se</i> but that there could be a re-election of chairman who held office up to the time of the election. However, if the Minister is not prepared to accept Nos. 35 and 37 I do not know what I shall do as regards No. 38.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's word that that is what he has in mind, and, therefore, there is no need to proceed further on amendments Nos. 35 or 37.  That is that annual general meetings can be held and business that is normal to be conducted can be conducted at such a meeting.  That does not refer in any way to amendment No. 38.  It was not my intention in these two amendments to infringe on the regional health boards and since I have a guarantee from the Minister that there is provision within this Bill <Col N="1509" /> for annual meetings where normal business can be conducted, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have made it clear that as a concession to a point raised by Senator Alexis FitzGerald and others during Committee Stage, I do not think the board should hold a meeting each month as has been suggested because there might be some periods, for example, July or August, when it would not be convenient.  As we have directed, the board ought to hold at least 12 meetings in each year and it is up to them to make arrangements for the conduct of their business in so far as it is not specified in the Bill.  It seems to me to be a reasonable compromise.</P>

      <P>In page 38, to delete lines 27 to 33 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17 (1)  At every annual meeting of the Board the Board shall elect one of their members (not being a member who is an officer or servant of the Board) to be chairman of the Board and another of their members (not being a member who is an officer or servant of the Board) to be vice-chairman of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Whenever the office of chairman or vice-chairman of the Board becomes vacant otherwise than by the termination of the ordinary <Col N="1510" /> term of office, the Board shall at their next meeting after the vacancy occurs or, in the case of a resignation of office, at the meeting at which the resignation becomes effective, elect one of their members to be chairman or vice-chairman of the Board.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person elected to be chairman or vice-chairman of the Board shall, unless he sooner resigns the office of chairman or vice-chairman, or sooner ceases to be, or becomes disqualified for being, a member of the Board, hold office as chairman or vice-chairman until his successor has been appointed.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whenever the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board ceases to be, or becomes disqualified for being, a member of the Board, he shall forthwith cease to be chairman or vice-chairman of the Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This of course is cognate to amendments Nos. 35 and 37 and this really is the purpose of bringing this in, that we want an annual election of a chairman and vice-chairman.  We want an annual general meeting to be held for the purpose of electing a chairman and vice-chairman.  I do not want to go over all the points again.  Everybody has seen the amendment and I do not propose to read it out.

The amendment makes it clear that the chairman cannot be removed from his office save by resolution of the board of which not less than two-thirds of the members are present.  This should make the position of chairman more certain and it avoids any difficulty which might arise regarding the casting vote of a chairman should the election of his position depend on a simple majority. I will refer the House to Rule 29 and this amendment arises out of a number of points made on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I do not think those amendments are particularly essential but nevertheless I agree with some Members of the House who spoke that we should give the vice-chairmen of those boards some very definite functions and spell them out.  The vice-chairman is frequently ignored or neglected in legislation.  He is a very important man and can become chairman, so those amendments are perfectly evident for that purpose.  The purport of those amendments was discussed on Committee Stage and I should like to move a purely minor amendment of a drafting kind to amendment No. 42:</P>

      <P>As I said this relates to the last amendment &ldquo;save with the consent of the necessary majority of the members present as defined by standing orders of the board.&rdquo;  This is this famous paragraph 23 which states:</P>
      <P>No business shall be transacted at a meeting of the board other than that specified in the summons relating thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> The addition to it would make &ldquo;save with the consent of the necessary majority present as defined by standing orders of the board&rdquo;.  As I said this is cognate to the last amendment, which is a Government amendment.  The Minister provides the Standing Orders in the last one and if he does this you cannot go through with paragraph 23 because they are not reconcilable.  If you are going to introduce Standing Orders this one cannot stand up and therefore in line 29 we have proposed &ldquo;save with the consent of the necessary majority of members present as defined by the Standing Orders of that Board&rdquo;.  I think this is self-explanatory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we have not seen the full implication of this amendment.  It leaves it open to the board with the consent of the specific majority to transact business other than that specified and relating to it.  Rule 23 can in fact be amended by the Minister on the request of the health board and I think the desirability of a change such as this should be left to each health board.  The amendment as it is presented to the House would mean that two-thirds of a bare quorum, say a quorum is nine, could bring in something, which would be a far-reaching decision, without the adequate notice being given to the other members.  If the health board wanted to make some arrangement to discuss matters which are not literally on the agenda, which were not actually on the agenda, they could do that but I certainly could not possibly accept an amendment which would have this effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to have small groups of health boards springing far-reaching decisions by this amendment.  It is only the necessary majority of members present which is required and therefore that is the diktat put forward by the quorum, which might only be nine out of a board of 30, and that majority could spring something on the board and make far-reaching decisions without adequate notice to the other members. I hope Rule 23 can be used in an intelligent way not in order that this kind of position could take place but to make any reasonable rules in regard <Col N="1514" /> to the way business is transacted which will prevent the springing of far-reaching decisions by what could be a very small number of members of the board.  I hope the House will realise the commonsense of what I am saying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am terribly disappointed especially when this is the last amendment which we had in on this whole Bill.  I expected the Minister to accept it.  It arose originally out of the discussion on the Committee Stage.  We realised this was a copy of one of the rules in the First Schedule of the 1960 Act.  It meant that certain health authorities had operated over the last nine years illegally because they had suspended Standing Orders to discuss matters of importance.  It seems to me that if a CEO or some other official of a new health board had been reading the debates on this Bill in the Dáil and in this House he might point out to his board that they were absolutely and utterly restricted to discussing only matters arising on the agenda and no matter how urgent a matter was they had no right to suspend Standing Orders to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the only reason for entering this particular amendment.  We have to apologise that the word was &ldquo;delete&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;add to&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister and his advisers knew what we were getting at.  The Minister has pleaded his pragmatism. In fact, I might say now we were trying to be nothing more than pragmatic about this.  Bearing in mind the fact that members of a health board were not likely to spring some outlandish decision on the board without due notice, we wanted to allow for a matter of urgency to be discussed if a member had informed his colleagues of it and had the necessary majority to have that discussion take place.  This is certainly something which operates in all local authorities at the moment.  It has operated in the Dublin Health Authority. Reading the First Schedule of the Act I discovered this was illegal.  It was to prevent boards acting illegally we sought to have this rule amended, and we did so completely out of a sense of pragmatism and confidence in the <Col N="1515" /> new members of the board, which the Minister has referred to here.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not see his way to accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude entirely on one point that has been made by Senator Boland.  It is of vital importance if this is to work efficiently. It is important to consider it in relation to an emergency situation arising. It would certainly not be the Minister's intention to hamstring the boards in such a situation which he would unintentionally be doing if he leaves this rule unaltered and unamended.  None of us can foresee the type of emergency that might arise to make it essential for a board to give urgent consideration to some problem arising in emergency conditions.  Unless there is an alteration on the lines suggested in this amendment it would seem that that simply cannot be done.  It cannot be done no matter how the standing orders of the board might be drafted. They must be drafted subject to the statutory requirements.  If this rule remains unaltered in the legislation which permits the establishment of the boards and permits standing orders to be drafted, it seems to me no matter what is in the standing orders rule 23 must take priority and standing orders must be subject to that.  The Minister would be imposing a rigid requirement that in most cases would be unnecessary and in some cases might be disastrous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in appearing not to favour this amendment stated he feared a minimum quorum obtainable on a health board might spring far-reaching decisions on the rest of the board in their absence. I should like to know where this power of coming to far-reaching decisions could come from?  Under various sections things are done with the consent and approval of the Minister.  The Minister is informed in advance of any decisions of any consequence which the boards make.  Therefore it would be impossible for a small quorum of people to spring far-reaching <Col N="1516" /> decisions on the health boards. This amendment is giving certain flexibility under the standing orders which the Minister gives the boards power to draw up.  Something could arise at a meeting of a health board which might not be discussed for another month or two.  I support this amendment and think the Minister's objection to it is unrealistic in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>The worst meetings I have been at were the ones at which the agenda includes that well-known and final item &ldquo;any other business&rdquo;. Dr. Belton's amendment is a safeguard against this soul-destroying item on any agenda.  It is a common item on most local authority meeting agendas.  The Minister is being a little pessimistic and certainly seems to take the opposite view to his wishes for the health boards when he assumes that nine out of 32 members will attend and that the nine members will come for the purpose of springing something unforewarned on the meeting.  That is unlikely.  It is not going to happen. These boards will be very well attended.  This is a safeguard to any chairman who will know that at the end of the meeting no one is going to jump up and propose some resolution or discussion on some subject under the heading of &ldquo;any other business&rdquo;. This is a most dangerous subject as I know, speaking as a chairman of a local authority.  I am sure other Senators will agree with me.  It is a safeguard which puts it to the commonsense of the members present to refuse to allow discussion or else to allow discussion only on a realistic and sensible subject.  I think it is very necessary if the boards are going to operate in the manner in which the Minister and all of us hope they will.</P>

      <P>I was listening to Senator Bourke and I find myself in agreement with her up to a point. Surely if Senator Bourke is right that the functions of the health board are subject to the prior consent of the Minister, the kind of ruling suggested would be <i>ultra vires</i> the statute itself. In other words, the health boards may not discuss business and are precluded <Col N="1517" /> from discussing anything except the Minister's consent had been given.  It is all very well to say that these things do not happen, that you will not get cliques to turn up, but everyone who has been in local government knows that as in the Letterkenny case, all these things can happen with regard to membership and can happen in other places besides Letterkenny.  There was one famous case in Letterkenny.  Most people know what happened there.  I can see no virtue in the amendment in this way.  I would foresee a type of emergency which would require it.</P>

I do not think that there is any doubt whatsoever that if the Minister leaves the Bill as it stands now in fact the health boards, when they come to operate, will have on their agenda &ldquo;other business&rdquo;. <Col N="1518" /> They will have a deal of discussion under &ldquo;other business&rdquo; and they might even follow some universities in not only having &ldquo;other business&rdquo; at the end but in having &ldquo;chairman's business&rdquo; No. 2 on the agenda, so that you can have unnotified discussion at both the beginning and the end of the agenda.  What this amendment seeks to do is to control in some fashion discussion of a matter of which notice has not been given.</P>
      <P>I think it is far better that this should be controlled under the standing orders, because there is no doubt whatsoever that the health boards will require from time to time to discuss certain matters.  If they are not permitted to do it under their standing orders, as they would not be if we are to allow the regulations stand and refuse this amendment, they will use their own devices.  They will, in fact, go month after month there, when there will be blanket items on the agenda just in case anything should arise at the last moment.</P>
      <P>I think that it is far preferable that we should adopt an amendment such as we have here, making it a regulation so that the standing orders would have to provide for a certain majority&mdash;the very fact that we mention a majority prescribed in standing orders in this amendment indicates that it would have to be greater than a simple majority&mdash; if this amendment were adopted then we would be in the position of guaranteeing that only serious matters, only matters of true emergency nature, which a substantial number of members of the board present agreed were worthy of discussion, could be discussed.</P>
      <P>If we reject the amendment I am very much afraid that we would find ourselves in a position that in case a real emergency were to arise the board would have to put down an omnibus agenda item&mdash;if we like to be pedantic we should use the word &ldquo;agendum&rdquo;&mdash;under which these matters could arise and there would be no means of preventing other matters arising once that had been done.  This is the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we rule out an amendment of this sort we are not ruling out discussions <Col N="1519" /> of any type, we are not ruling out people raising without notice, we are in fact almost ruling it in, because boards, in order to provide against a genuine emergency, will have to have an item &ldquo;chairman's business&rdquo;, &ldquo;chief executive officer's report&rdquo;, or &ldquo;other business&rdquo;.  They will have to put an item on the agenda in case something comes up.  Once an item is in the whole thing will be wide open.  It is far better to put in a control suggested here under standing orders and have this measure of ensuring by adopting it that standing orders will allow matters to be raised without notice under prescribed conditions and with the consent of the prescribed majority.  Then, in fact, we will confine these discussions on points without notice to matters of real importance.</P>

      <P>On this amendment which we have put down everything that I would like to say has been said. Senator Russell said that you can get over this business by putting down an item &ldquo;any other business&rdquo;.  As he said this, of course, leaves the thing too wide open for discussion.  Our amendment allows the suspension of standing orders by a certain majority, and, as I said, in the last amendment of the Minister, he has provided for standing orders being suspended, but section 23 will over-rule that unless you accept our amendment.  This is in every local body, every body that I know.  Every body I know has standing <Col N="1520" /> orders, and this is recognised by the Minister himself in the last amendment here, amendment 45, and all I want is to allow the suspension of standing orders with a certain majority of the board and to cut out this idea of an omnibus item &ldquo;any other business &ldquo;which, of course, makes a farce of the whole proceedings.</P>

      <P>I have explained the position, and I would just like to add that there is nothing to prevent other business being discussed under this Bill.  I cannot prevent other business being discussed.  This is a question of decisions being taken by a small number. The other point I have not mentioned is that it would be recommended to all health boards that they pass a sort of omnibus resolution giving the chief executive officer power to deal with an emergency of any kind.  If they want to discuss an emergency they can under &ldquo;any other business&rdquo;, and there certainly would be discussion under &ldquo;any other business&rdquo; and I could not prevent that.  They can have omnibus powers given to the chief executive officer and can say to him &ldquo;Go ahead with your omnibus powers&rdquo; if there is a flood of smallpox or very serious conditions in a certain area of the health board.  My point is that there is plenty of provision for dealing with an emergency.</P>

    <P>Amendment, as amended, declared lost.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 44:</P>
    <P>In page 39, after Rule 29, to insert the following new Rule:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(30)  A member of the board who has&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any interest in any company or concern with which the board proposes to make any contract, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any interest in any contract which the board proposes to make,</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is obvious.  A very valid point was made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald during Committee Stage and we have now inserted this Rule, No. 30.  I would hope that these health boards under Standing Orders would make such arrangements but it is just as well to enshrine these amendments in the Bill.  This is a great improvement and I am glad to introduce the amendment at this stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In page 40, before Rule 30, to insert the following new Rule:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  A health board may make standing orders for the regulation of its proceedings, other than proceedings the regulation of which is provided for by or under statute (including this Act), and may amend or revoke such standing orders.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This, again, arises out of an undertaking that I gave on Committee Stage.  The amendment makes it clear that health boards will have power to make standing orders governing their procedure.  I should like to introduce another minor drafting amendment.  Apparently, it is better at this stage that it be &ldquo;the board&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;a health board&rdquo; so that it conforms with the rest of the rules.</P>
      <P>We do not wish to start a debate on this because we have already had a very helpful debate on it.  One of the things one learns after many years of pressing Bills through the Dáil is that the position with regard to these rules is that a health board may do anything in the way of standing orders that is not specifically forbidden in the Bill but I am putting this in to make sure that they can make the standing orders for miscellaneous matters in regard to times of meetings and so on. I have put this in at the request of the people who raised the matter.</P>
      <P>Amendment, as amended, agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House but there are some points that I would like to clear up.  Firstly, I must say that the Minister has a very good Bill and one which will give him the power to bring us into line with Europe and the Seventies. The medical profession has been very pleased with the amount of consultation that took place before the Bill was drafted and it opens many areas in consultation between the Department and the profession.</P>
      <P>The proposals for the larger units by the health boards and regional hospital boards will make an enormous difference to the future.  What a pity we did not take the advice given to us in 1928 and again in 1936 when these hospitals were originally proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the fee per service and choice of doctor systems will be a remarkable improvement on <Col N="1523" /> the dispensary doctor system even though that system was very good. However, I would point out to the Minister that when he is implementing this there is grave danger that the choice of doctor will break down very badly if, at a very early stage, there is not a full implementation of outpatient services, domiciliary visits, home nursing and so on.  I am sorry that in many of his pronouncements the Minister did not touch on the question of the finance that will have to be provided to back this Bill.</P>

      <P>I must warn the Senator that he is not entitled to discuss what the Minister did not say or do.  On the Fifth Stage he is only entitled to discuss what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanAlton" hpid="Dr. Alton Dr. Alton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>Finance must be provided for a health service and may I suggest to the Minister that with health rapidly replacing education in other countries as the major employer, there will be a tremendous financial problem with regard to the introduction of a public health service to this country.  With our low per capita income I cannot see how it can be done without placing an intolerable burden on the tax-paying public.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might consider that the services be broken up into hospitalisation services which would not last more than one month&mdash; that is, acute illness not lasting more than one month in hospital.  This is one of the largest expenses that we face and is one that could be covered by some form of contribution or insurance factor while the remaining services&mdash;the Cinderella services, psychiatric and so on&mdash;could take advantage of the money saved.  In this way there might be some reduction on rates and taxes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanAlton" hpid="Dr. Alton Dr. Alton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can cover the fact by saying that we would hope the Minister would introduce, as he has done in the other Ministries he has held, some crisp and businesslike machinery to cover the administration of the hospital services because in many services there could be greater efficiency and economy.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that cutting down the number of physicians, surgeons, laboratory staff and clerical administrative staff may appear to be economy and the Minister must correct this error.  There are hospitals in this country whose efficiency could be doubled by increasing the staff.  For example, the biggest hospitals in Dublin are taking twice as long to produce tests as they did ten years ago and they are keeping patients in hospital for twice as long due to lack of staff.  Another example is that 2½ years ago we were asked at the Mater Hospital to provide accident services. We decided that we would like to have a radiologist, a biochemist and a technician on the premises all the time so that we could have a 24-hour service.</P>
      <P>This was thought to be very good and agreement was reached.  We put three newly built rooms at their disposal and now 2½ years later we still cannot get those people living-in 24 hours.  Agreement has not been reached and when emergency cases come we have to send taxis out to bring in the people. This is not a good service and it is an example of poor staff.  For the future as well I do not think the rural services can be implemented properly unless there is a change in the approach to remuneration of doctors.  This is a point I do not like to bring up because we are supposed to be dedicated to healing but I make no apology for it now.  The day of medical mystique is over and we only ask now to be remunerated commensurate with our capacity to provide a vital service in a proper and efficient manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> The Minister knows that many young doctors come back here to this country every year but leave immediately or shortly afterwards because they will not stand the conditions of service.  In Wexford, one of the most thriving counties, 14 doctors set up practice in the last ten years, of which seven have gone away.  Wexford has now three fewer doctors than ten years ago and its population has increased considerably.  This is because of conditions of service.</P>
    <P>We are very pleased the Minister is introducing fee-per-service and we think this is a step in the right direction but it brings no joy to our doctors to think that domiciliary business is going to be increased to repair the main fuse at the expense of a TV set. It brings no joy to them either to realise that the value of American services has been worked out by the rather unusual method of deciding what a doctor should earn in the eyes of officialdom and dividing his estimated number of visits per year into that and that is the value of his fee-per-service. This is a bad approach and this will keep doctors away, the service will run down and I do not think this is the right approach.</P>
    <P>It is the same way in the hospitals; unless our young men are encouraged to come back the service will not improve. We want them to go more into hospitals and we do not want them to go into private practice.  The hospitals need them but it is no good bringing a youngster back who does good work and then because he cannot get a living wage in the hospital he has to go out into private practice and he is lost to the hospital.  The hospitals are getting better value but they are still not getting the service from the younger doctors they should get.  We do not want to bring them up to a proper standard of efficiency and patient turnover and all the things which make a hospital great and then find we have not a sufficient number of doctors.  This can only be done if there is a proper, almost wholetime hospital service, limited private practice and a proper reasonable scale of fees for whose employed in them.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na nOispidéal represent <Col N="1526" /> quite a break-through and I hope this will work in great harmony with the Department and do an enormous amount to give a decent distribution of specialist services throughout the country.  I hope the Minister, the Department and the Local Appointments Commission between them work out a formula which allows the selection of doctors to different appointments but on a system which combines the best features of the Local Appointments Commission, and this system has many features, but still allows for the flexibility of certain particular work which is necessary when you are appointing medical personnel.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage of the Bill the Minister assured me that domiciliary visits were covered under section 55.  The more I look at that section the more I feel it covers only institutional work.  While I am sure that somewhere in the Bill the Minister has power&mdash;he seems to have powers in most things&mdash;to permit and encourage domiciliary visits I think this is one of the key points in the future.  If the Minister wants to keep patients out of hospital, and I feel this must be one of the most important things in the future because we just cannot afford to keep 7.2 beds per thousand in this country, the third highest ratio in the world, we want to get away from that and the only thing to do is is to encourage good domiciliary service and to make sure that local practitioners use it.</P>
    <P>There are two last points I want to make.  Medical education in the hospitals has been in an extraordinary position for years.  As far as the undergraduate is concerned, the university course supplies this.  The facilities are there, they will supply the staff but they cannot supply the classrooms, the desks, the blackboards, the cleaners, the lights, the personnel to look after it.  When you ask them for this money they say the Department of Education will not give it because it is a hospital and the Department of Health say they cannot do it because it is Department of Education work.</P>
    <P>The FitzGerald Report has suggested a standing committee through the Department of Education and the <Col N="1527" /> Department of Health on this matter and I think this will be a most valuable step forward because in the future medical education in the hospitals, for which the regional hospital boards will be responsible, will not be confined to under-graduates.  Education where doctors are concerned is a continuing process and the regional hospital boards will be responsible for this.  I hope the Minister will make sure when he is outlining the functions of the regional hospital boards, that medical education, the provision of facilities, equipment, the wherewithal for conferences and all this will be properly looked after.  At the present moment it is not possible in our hospital to give a visiting lecturer or a visiting group a meal without having to pay for it from private means.  This must all be changed.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I could not leave this without asking the Minister to take a more positive approach towards the problem of our nursing profession.  I feel every nurse in this country, whether she works in a private hospital, a public hospital or is a public health nurse, no matter what job she does, she does a job which is invaluable to the State because if girls are going to work in private nursing or even in private hospitals, patients who require nursing care will have to go to institutions which are a burden on the State financially to get nursing care. Therefore any nurse helps to keep patients out of hospital.</P>
    <P>Those girls should be allowed to change from any branch in the service, public health, public hospital, private hospital, private nursing, in and out as the need arises or their circumstances permit, so that they can go in or out without losing anything on the salary or promotion scale.  If you did this you would have the whole nursing profession welded together and you would have it as one unit of great value to the country.  Furthermore, you would then be in a position to give pensions to all nurses who did a certain number of years service in nursing, regardless of what type of work they did.  This to my mind is essential if we are to keep nurses in this country. <Col N="1528" /> It is all very well to talk about adequate remuneration, promotion, expectation of jobs and all the rest of it unless you can keep those girls here, give them freedom of movement in and out of the different branches.  If you do not, you will not keep them and you are not going to be able to save the tremendous load of patients going into hospitals to get institutional nursing.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to do so.  First of all, our greatest disappointment is the method of financing of this Bill.  The Minister knew at the outset of course that we could make an issue of it and I am quite sure he was not disappointed when we did make that issue.  After having said that there are points I want to make.  There is one point I will take issue with Senator Alton on.  I rather feel he is laying too much emphasis on the hospitalisation of patients.  The general practitioner is the corner-stone of medicine.  The fact that there is to be more co-operation between general practitioners, hospitals and consultants is very welcome.  The extension of domiciliary nursing services and aid is also excellent.  It was supposed to have been there before but did not exist to any great extent.  This will save bed occupancy.  We had amendments about nurses and one was ruled out of order.  We tried to provide certain increases for nurses but the amendment was ruled out of order because it involved a charge on central funds.  We had two other amendments which we discussed in detail.  I am not sure what Senator Alton's attitude was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We were disappointed that certain amendments were not accepted <Col N="1529" /> by the Minister.  The general reception we got as an Opposition was very good.  I would like to compliment the Minister on the way he received us and even on the way he received us when we differed in opinion.  I thank the Minister for the concessions he made to us at the various stages.  This has been a long, a difficult Bill for him.  The Minister was present at all times; he had no lieutenant to take his place.  I compliment him on the responsible manner which he has shown.  This is an example to other people.</P>

As a new member of the House the whole manner in which this Bill has been dealt with has been very instructive and useful to me.  I have learned more than I ever expected to from the way in which the Minister dealt with the Bill.</P>
      <P>If I expressed some doubts it is only because I accept that everything in the Health Bill is not as we would wish.  I have some doubts about the concept of regionalisation.  Between now and 1971 when the Bill becomes operative I hope there will be time for a full debate on this concept of regionalisation from an administrative point of view.  We have everything to gain and nothing to lose from such a debate and from consultation.  We welcome this Bill not necessarily because it contains everything we want but as a breakthrough in social legislation. We are pleased at the concept of free choice of doctor which is included in this Bill.  We are not completely happy that everything is in it.  I would like to have it on record that we welcome the Bill for what it attempts to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill which has now been put through Committee Stage and Report Stage, I should like to say that I have been struck forcibly at this later stage by the contrast in composition of the health boards and the regional boards which are being set up under it.  At the Committee Stage the Minister explained why he felt we must retain the power to appoint the chairman and <Col N="1530" /> vice-chairman and to terminate the appointment of the chairman and vice-chairman of these regional boards.</P>
      <P>I still think it would have been an opportunity for true regionalisation which is what this Bill purports to do but which it falls short of.  The Bill leaves a great deal of discretionary power in the hands of the Minister. It is a Bill which must be in the form of a skeleton Act to be implemented by delegated legislation.  It goes as far as I would like any Bill to go in this direction.  The Minister has reassured the House even if the particular amendment was not accepted, and I believe these reassurances will be carried on by his successor.</P>
      <P>With reference to the section which relates to the provision of consultants I would like to say that at the Committee Stage I said I felt these provisions might lead to two types of consultants.  One would be the consultant to the local health board hospital and the other the consultant to the voluntary hospital.  The reason for this may not be clear here.  It seems the consultant to the health board hospital will come under the CEO as his administrative officer whereas the voluntary consultant will continue to come under the authority of the voluntary hospital.</P>
      <P>Realistically, it is not hard to see how this would be difficult for many consultants to accept.  If this is so I would feel this might perpetrate a division and an idea in the minds of the people that the consultants to the voluntary hospitals were better than the consultants to the health board hospitals.  Consultants might wish to belong to the voluntary hospitals because they would not be under the control of the CEO.  I do not know whether I can ask for clarification on the Fifth Reading.  I may be under a misapprehension but I am not satisfied with the Minister's remarks on this subject.  I regret we have not seen fit to initiate the type of reforms and structures in this Bill which I would like to see in relation to eligibility.  We have not seen fit to set up an independent tribunal instead of officers of a board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister's argument that this would involve new thinking and consultation with other departments is not valid.  One can imagine we could have been braver than we have been.</P>
      <P>Apart from these remarks, especially on the point of clarification regarding consultants, I welcome this Bill as a substantial piece of social legislation which I hope will improve health services in this country.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank all the Members of the House for the way they received this Bill.  The debate has been extremely constructive.  In so far as I am concerned I do not think all the complaints are deserved.  I welcome them but regard them as exaggerated. I want to be quite frank.</P>
      <P>I have been to the Seanad before with Bills of an intensely controversial nature on which there was inevitably a Party battle between my side of the House and the other side of the House on matters of very great importance.  It so happens that we have had a considerable measure of agreement that this Health Bill is a good Bill and that even if it is not perfect it has good features, that we are making progress in the development of the health services. I say therefore that the discussion has been a very helpful and constructive one, and I have been able to accept a great number of amendments or to introduce amendments based on suggestions made by the Opposition&mdash;to do this in a constructive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does, I think, rather give proof of the fact that the public in general do believe that our health services have been progressively getting better that we were able to have a debate in such a very constructive way.  Nevertheless I do want to thank everybody for their courtesy to me and for the way the debate has been taken.  I hope that we will have many debates of this kind, and I hope that even if we have to <Col N="1532" /> have really corrosive criticism of Government policy we still could conduct a debate on the highest possible basis of discussion.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I just want to mention one or two of the things that arose during the examination of the Bill.  A number of people have pointed out that when the Eastern Health Board is appointed the sole representative on the Eastern Health Board, if there is no change in the present position, of Dublin Corporation will be Mr. Garvin, the Commissioner, and he will have only one vote.  I want to say that I am going to discuss with the Minister for Local Government the question of providing adequate representation for Dublin Corporation on the board when the Eastern Health Board is formed.  I cannot do anything about it till then, for very obvious reasons.  I am not going to arouse new controversy on that question, about which there are very divided opinions.</P>
    <P>We hold very strongly to our own opinion on this matter, but I will listen to the representations made by the various Senators in regard to this and will draw the attention of the Minister for Local Government to this difficulty of the position of the Commissioner, and will consult with him as to whether he could not make some alternative arrangement of whatever kind he thinks desirable which I can approve which can give greater numerical representation for Dublin Corporation if, at the same time, we still have the present position of the suspension of Dublin Corporation.  That is the most that I can do in regard to that.</P>
    <P>There were some other matters that were raised during the debate.  Senator Belton asked me in relation to section 43 whether my attention had been drawn to a memorandum prepared by the chief psychiatrist of the Dublin Health Authority which related to the procedures for admission to and transfer from the Dundrum Central Mental Hospital.  It would be quite impossible to include any legislative changes that may be required in mental illness legislation in this Bill, and we are going to have a separate Bill dealing with a number of recommendations made by the Commission on Mental Illness <Col N="1533" /> which will include the procedures for admission to and transfer from Dundrum Central Mental Hospital.</P>
    <P>Again I think I said that I would look at the question of whether there was anything sinister in having two separate sections in the Bill, one dealing with dental, ophthalmic and aural services in section 66, and another section dealing with other services, section 55.  This is simply regarded as necessary to classify the services in this way.  Then the Seanad, I think, will be amused to hear that the legal adviser has been consulted on the question whether the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; includes a tree standing on it, and it does.</P>

      <P>In order to reassure the medical profession, Senator Alton asked me to look at Rule 13 of the Second Schedule with a view to introducing an amendment to prevent the Minister for Health from removing from a board any persons appointed by him on nomination under section 4, subsection (2) (c).  These are the first appointments of professional members which will be made by me, but I will not select them.  They will be made by a preliminary procedure in which the medical associations concerned will be asked to nominate their selection to me and I will then make them.  I have examined the question of whether I could introduce a suitable amendment to make it quite sure that they cannot be dismissed at any time by me since I actually appoint them.</P>
      <P>An amendment would have to cover all sorts of situations such as the procedures to be followed if a medical member of the board nominated in this way and appointed by me was removed from the register of medical practitioners or had been found guilty of unethical professional practice.  This is unlikely to happen, but nevertheless as the board will last for two years until the elections take place in June, 1972, and if I undertook that I would not remove from the board a person nominated under section 4 subsection (2) (c) save in the type of circumstances I have mentioned, the medical profession should accept this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say anything more about the rules.  I have done my best <Col N="1534" /> and have adopted a number of suggestions put forward for changes, but I could not change any more of them. I am still fascinated by the thought that these boards can do an awful lot as long as it is quite clear that they are not actually disobeying the clear indication given&mdash;that they can do a lot of arrangement in their own procedure without necessarily themselves having to be expressed in actual words in the Bill.</P>
    <P>These are the only points that I thought I should mention arising from the previous debate.  Then as far as Senator Alton is concerned he has made a very helpful, constructive speech.  I agree with him that an extension of domiciliary visits and domiciliary care is an essential contribution to the growth of the health services.  I am not going to say anything more about a contributory insurance scheme because that does not arise in connection with this Bill.  We do intend to develop work study and consultancy.  There is a special unit being created in my Department to help hospitals to improve their efficiency and make life easier for the staffs so that they can do perhaps more work efficiently and with less strain.  This is a very difficult job because there are so many of the hospitals ancient in construction and the amount of work study that can be done effectively is limited, but we are going to do that, and we have at the moment undertaken a study of nursepatient ratio to see if there is any way whereby we can make use of the wonderful nurses we have more effectively and without placing any unnecessary burden upon them.  I agree with him that we must try to reduce the amount of time people spend in hospital, and we will have to reorganise the service so that there would be a shorter time for diagnosis.</P>
    <P>We will have to consider, perhaps, changing the system, and the medical profession are well aware of this, from the position whereby consultants on a certain basis depend for their income on the number of days patients are kept in bed and they ought to be on a better basis which will inevitably lead to more economy.  We will have to develop the mechanical equipment of our hospitals and help to speed up the <Col N="1535" /> time for diagnosis.  Obviously there can be improvements in accountancy procedures in some hospitals.  Things like the development of pathological facilities must be considered on the basis that the pathological analysis is used in the most economic way.  Obviously we must develop the out-patient service on a greater scale in order to try to get people out of hospital.</P>
    <P>Senator Alton referred to the pay of doctors; it does not arise on this Bill, but I would remind him and the House that quite fairly liberal status increases of pay have been awarded to district medical officers.  I have not got the increased percentage since 1964 with me&mdash;I think Senator Alton should be aware of that.  In regard to medical education I intend to have a permanent Standing Committee of officers of my Department and officers of the Department of Education in order that we can have much closer co-ordination than heretofore on the whole question of medical education.  I think I have answered the main points raised by Senator Alton as a person experienced in hospital and medical work.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Belton for his observations and also Senator Owens and Senator Bourke.  I think I did accept a good number of amendments. Much of the discussion here was based on the question of how much liberty you would give to people, how much discipline there must be in the operation of a health authority.  I think the final result is a reasonable one that will be accepted by the country at large.  Within the next five years it is inevitable that amendments will have to be made; you could not possibly alter the whole pattern of health administration and do it perfectly the first time.  This Bill will allow us to make a reasonably good start and I look forward to bringing in regulations for the setting up of individual health boards, regional hospital boards and Comhairle na hOspidéal about next June.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section after section 13:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;13A.  Where rates or portion thereof are waived in any year or part of a year in accordance with any scheme made and carried out under the Local Government (Rates) (No. 2) Act, 1969, the word &ldquo;rates&rdquo; appearing in section 10 (2) of the Principal Act shall be construed as meaning the rates as reduced by the amount of any such waiver&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the time of the House in repeating views I have already expressed with regard to amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  Very briefly, I will say that these three amendments were designed to exclude difficulties arising on the application of existing legislation, in particular the Rent Restrictions Code about which I spoke at some length on Committee Stage.  As the word &ldquo;rates&rdquo; is defined in the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, <Col N="1537" /> the definition therein excludes from the construction of rates any rates which would be waived under this Act.  This gave rise to considerable doubts in my mind as to the position of tenants and their rights to recover rates which they might have paid at a time when a waiver had not then been made but was being made in their favour.</P>
    <P>The difficulties amendments Nos. 1 and 3 were designed to overcome for the benefit of affected persons would be almost completely overcome if amendment No. 3 (a) were acceptable to the House.  The additional amendment is more comprehensive and takes in the case where rates are paid by persons without statutory rights but rights under contract.  I am not absolutely satisfied about it, but I think it eliminates the difficulties under statute as well as contract.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 2, I will not press this although I think, in principle, I probably should do so. It is designed to protect a tenant regarding the minimum compensation he would get in the case where under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, a court would be entitled to put him out of premises.  The point was made in this House that this ought not to concern us a great deal because, as the section is operated, judges do not ever give the minimum compensation but always exceed it.  However, having made the point, if the Minister after having sought and taken advice does not want to accept this amendment I shall not press it although I think it is desirable.  I shall be content if amendment No. 3 (a) is accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator FitzGerald fears happening is something that none of us wishes to see occurring, but my advice is that the amendment is not necessary and that the Bill is adequate as it stands.  Nevertheless, I do not object to the principle of making assurance doubly sure.  So far as amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are concerned, there are some objections to doing the job in that way in that it does not seem appropriate to amend the Rent Restrictions Act in a Bill of this kind.  Amendment No. 3 (a) is not open to the same objections on these <Col N="1538" /> grounds and it may well achieve in a broader and more general way the same effect as those amendments were intended to achieve in a more limited and specific way.  I do not accept that it is necessary from a strictly legal point of view but if it will be of any help in removing any doubts or otherwise ensuring that the Bill becomes effective, then the amendment will have been well worthwhile and, on that basis, I am prepared to accept amendment No. 3 (a).</P>
