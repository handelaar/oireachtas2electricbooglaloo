      <P>I have notice from Senator Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to give an up-to-date report on his reason for granting a permit for salmon following cages in the Annagh Bay area north of Achill Island.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Sullivan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to proceed with the next phase of building at Limerick Regional Technical College following the completion of phase 1A scheduled for the end of June 1993.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to include in its regulation on health and safety in the Army, the regulation agreed between PDFORRA and the Health and Safety Authority in place of the wording included by the Minister which is totally unacceptable to Army representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> I also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matters:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to state if she intends to purchase a site for a second level school in Dunboyne, County Meath; and if funds will be made available in 1993 for the commencement of this work.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Marine to investigate the oil spillage along the east coast with the resultant harm to wildlife and beaches.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Burke, O'Sullivan, Neville, Farrelly and Cosgrave as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Burke and O'Sullivan's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Neville, Farrelly and Cosgrave may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to make time available to debate the annual report of the Ombudsman, published yesterday, before the end of this session if possible.  The Ombudsman has pointed out that there are a number of matters arising in his report which, if they are to be tackled properly, would require changes in the law.  He was specific as to which laws need to be changed. I also ask the Leader of the House to indicate which legislation he expects to present to the House between now and the end of the session to give Members a chance to prepare properly for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  I propose that we take Item 14 first.  I am not trying <Col N="811" /> to be obstructive, but simply to exert pressure to improve our office accommodation. It is wrong that this matter has not been resolved.  It is impossible for us as Independent Senators to perform our duties properly when we are working in conditions which break the Factory Acts and a number of European Community regulations.  I cannot continue to give the impression that I can serve the electorate in the post to which they have elected me.</P>
      <P>I understand that appeals have been made to various people to regularise this situation.  That is not the way to proceed. We are elected Members.  We are entitled to certain basic condition under the Factories Acts.  We should get them, and those who are in charge should be directed to service us, since they are at our disposal and not the other way around.  I am sorry to speak so strongly but as you know, a Chathaoirligh, our situation is intolerable.  I would like to pay tribute to your attempts to satisfy us in this regard.  If we were not people who tried to do our work, then we might be happy with unsatisfactory, inadequate conditions, but we really do try to work, and we should be facilitated in this matter.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to one other matter which shows the way in which this House is treated with complete contempt. This Chamber is taken over from time to time for committees and the report is produced almost instantaneously, whereas it is weeks before the Official Report of Seanad Éireann is produced. We had an extremely important debate on AIDS in this House which was not covered in any newspaper.  Groups such as Family Solidarity are still telling dangerous lies about AIDS, yet the authoritative debate that took place in this House was not reported in one newspaper, in one organ or the broadcast media&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support Senator Norris's amendment.  I am working in a semi-secretarial capacity for which I have not been trained, in unsuitable offices.  There is no ventilation and insufficient daylight in our office.  The lights must be turned on in the office during the day.  I appreciate that you, a Chathaoirligh, have tried to do something about this, but even if we used the office on a rota basis our conditions would be totally unsatisfactory. I said when I moved into those offices first that putting a fan on the floor to make the air circulate was very dangerous. After an hour in the room I was compelled to use the fan because it is impossible to stay in the room without it. I do not know whether any other Senators have come down to see the conditions in which we are existing.  I realise you have tried to get something done, a Chathaoirligh, but it has been three months since we raised this matter and absolutely nothing has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>What inquiries have gone on in relation to staff?  The Minister mentioned that probably some of his Department's staff would be transferred to the Roads Authority.  I was wondering if local authorities are to hand over staff. Speaking from the point of view of Dublin, many of the authorities have not <Col N="815" /> had men replaced recently.  The Minister might clarify the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> As I said previously, some of the staff will be transferred from the Department of the Environment.  Discussions are about to commence in relation to local authority staff and I appreciate what the Senator is saying with regard to some local authorities.  We envisage that many of the works authorised by the National Roads Authority will be done by local authorities and there should be no change.  The local authorities have their structures, engineers and draftsmen and so on.  I would not see a major problem but it is early days yet.  Discussions are ongoing and it will be some time before they are concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Many questions arise in relation to this Bill.  Here is a section which relates to public authorities.  I am a member of a public authority, as are many other Members.  This section states that &ldquo;a public authority may designate for employment by the Authority, any person employed by that public authority.&rdquo; Could the Minister define &ldquo;public authority&rdquo;?  Is it the management of the public authority or the elected members of the public authority?  This should be more clearly defined as it could have a significant effect on the whole structure of the local authority.  In 1987, there was a big scare about the system of public finances and the local authority.  A large number of people within the local authority system, at engineering level and otherwise, took redundancy and opted out.  The result is that local authorities do not have the staff and design teams which they had in the late 1980s.  The Minister should be more specific as to what is envisaged by way of local authority staff being designated and assigned to the National Roads Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept what the Minister has said, I concur with Senator Sherlock.  At the moment, there is a reorganisation <Col N="816" /> process in Dublin and it appears from what I have heard on the grapevine that many of the parks department people are being laid off or are certainly being told to reapply.  I am concerned that no-one's present status should be reduced.  Can the Minister assure us that no-one will be worse off after this and also that a person will not be suddenly taken from either his department or local authority and transferred to some totally different area?  We hope that people will give of their best and that this authority will be workable and produce ready answers, solutions, plans and so on.  I would be concerned that there might not be adequate consultation with unions or, particularly, with any person designated.  The section states that: a public authority shall not designate an employee under this subsection, without having notified in writing the employee and any recognised trade unions or staff associations concerned.  I wonder if they will go further than that and just give written notice that from Monday week a person is on his way and that is that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> In reply to Senator Sherlock, I do not envisage many transfers of staff from local authorities to the National Roads Authority.  The local authorities will be implementers of National Roads Authority schemes and on the odd occasion there may be secondment of expertise from local authorities if the National Roads Authority feels it so requires.  Section 31 of the Bill provides enabling power for the transfer to the National Roads Authority of staff from the Department of the Environment, local authorities or other public bodies where their principal duties relate to functions of the National Roads Authority. All this will take place with consultation. There will be provision for prior notification of consultation with employees and their trade unions where transfers are proposed.  The Minister stated quite clearly in the Dáil that there will be full consultation with staff interests before any final decisions are taken in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> Subsection (4) protects the terms and conditions of tenure of any person transferred to the National Roads Authority from a public authority.  They cannot be made less favourable except by way of a collective agreement negotiated with the person's trade union.  A further provision was added in the special committee that should there be any dispute concerning the terms and conditions relating to the tenure of any person being transferred, such a dispute will be decided on by the Minister for Finance, following consultation with the Minister for the Environment. The Bill gives protection for employees who may be transferred to the National Roads Authority and provides for full consultation with the Department and with the trade unions and, if an agreement is not reached, further consultations with the Minister for Finance and Minister for the Environment.  Staff, no matter where they are transferred, will be totally protected and will not be moved or downgraded to a lesser position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, but that is not the main point of my argument.  The staffs of the local authorities will be further depleted and consequently when issues come before the local authority, where the design team is needed to design a scheme of one kind or another, they will be over the line with the roads authority.  That is the problem we are going to face on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I would see very little transfer of staff from the local authorities as they are at present constituted. From experience in my area, there are already design teams in place and building roads and ring roads, as well as providing plans and scales.  They will continue to do that on behalf of the National Roads Authority in future.  We would not see the National Roads Authority going completely over to private enterprise and saying that it no longer needs the local authorities.  Throughout the Bill there is reference to the National Roads Authority availing of the staff and <Col N="818" /> expertise that is already in local authorities. I would certainly hope that the downgrading of local authorities would not happen.  I have the utmost respect for local authorities and I am concerned that they would be mainly responsible for implementing National Roads Authority policy for the future.</P>

      <P>Section 35 (1) (b) states:</P>
      <P>Subject to paragraph (c), no person shall be employed by the Authority while he is a member of a local authority.</P>
      <P>I can understand that, but I would ask the Minister of State to clarify a point? In certain circumstances a member of a local authority could have machinery contracted to local authorities.  Would this section of the Bill prohibit that happening with the National Roads Authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is related to that and concerns section 35 (1) (c) which, notwithstanding what is in (1) (b), goes on to state that the Minister may order that certain types of people may be exempt. In what sort of circumstances can the Minister of State envisage that happening? It would seem to me that section 35 (1)(b) is adequate when it states that no person shall be employed by the Authority while he is a member of a local authority.</P>
      <P>Why go on to allow a loophole where the Minister at his discretion can do something contrary to what is the intention of paragraph (b)?  I wonder about the circumstances in which section 35(1)(c) might be invoked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> In relation to Senator Finneran's point, if a councillor <Col N="819" /> happens to have a business and machinery or equipment is already contracted to the local authority, then certainly this Bill will not prevent him from doing that. What he would be expected to do, however, would be to declare his interests in a particular project that he might be tendering for.  The Bill will not prevent such a person from becoming involved in that contract or from carrying out works for the National Roads Authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 35(1)(b) would exclude people from becoming members of the National Roads Authority while they are members of a local authority, but paragraph (c) allows a loophole.  Are we creating a pals network whereby if we regard certain people as desirable or politically correct we can give them an exemption that might not apply to people who are not politically correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> It certainly has to apply to a grade and not to individuals. In the past some grades were exempted. They consisted of employees of local authorities who were not officers, clerical staff up to and including officers and vocational education committee teachers.  Civil servants below clerical grades may also become local authority members.  The Minister is complying with provisions in related areas in the past.  It is a continuation of ministerial functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal course of events when the authority looks at plans or schemes it will be able to take into account representations made.  If one knew a member of the board one might be able to express concern at what was being done or not done with certain <Col N="820" /> roads.  Could the Minister of State elaborate on how he sees this section operating? Normally, I would make representations to the secretary of An Bord Pleanála, which I presume would be in order, on behalf of constituents. The local authority may take a certain view and may want to push it home, particularly if there is an oral hearing.  I would hope that the Minister of State would not block genuine representations made either by public representatives or individuals.  Can the Minister of State expand on section 39?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I would certainly hope that the democratic process would be allowed to continue in this area, and that the National Roads Authority would not be above this.  I would hope also that local authority members, politicians and the general public would be entitled to make representations to the National Roads Authority on an issue if they so wished.  The emphasis of this section is on improper influence, such as attempts to blackmail, bribe, threaten or coerce somebody.  It does not prohibit normal lobbying and other legitimate attempts to influence decisions.  That should allay Senator Cosgrave's fears about that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>A motorway means a public road or proposed public road specified to be a motorway in a motorway scheme approved by the Minister under section 49.  Section 43 states that persons in charge of, or having control over, animals shall not permit them to be on a motorway.  We must clarify what is meant by that.  Does that mean that every motorway on the national primary and secondary routes will need an underpass?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain areas people find it difficult <Col N="821" /> to get approval from the local authority to have their cattle herded across the road.  A few years ago it was easy to get approval but it is now a major problem. This section specifically says people in charge of or having control over animals shall not permit them to be on a motorway. I would like clarification on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> There are only 150 to 200 kilometres of motorway in the country.  That is a small amount of roadway.  There would have to be underpasses for motorways if animals had to be transported from one side to the other. They would not be allowed on the motorway itself and since we have such a small number of motorways I think underpasses will be the order of the day.  I see no other solution.</P>

My understanding is fencing on motorways is the responsibility of the local authority or the road authority rather than the landowner.  If a motorcar leaves the motorway and goes through my fence leaving a hole in it, and the animals go on to the motorway from my land, that is the authority's responsibility rather than mine.  It is its responsibility to maintain the fence on the perimeter of my land and the motorway.  There may be reference to this elsewhere in the Bill.  Can the Minister clarify the position?</P>
      <P>During the course of construction animals frequently get on to motorways. Farmers who concentrate on tillage rather than livestock wish to keep animals off their land rather than keep them enclosed on it.  That can also cause problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us on this side of the House and perhaps other Members also would like to see fewer toll roads on a point of principle.  We are far too heavily taxed on motoring, whether it be on the purchase of a car, taxation and insurance of same or other items.  I ask the Minister where or how he envisages tolls being established.  There may be some justification for tolls where private enterprise develops networks such as the East Link and West Link bridges.</P>
      <P>Motoring is an expensive necessity for many people.  The cost of insurance is astronomical, the price of cars is expensive in comparison with the UK and there are regular increases in road tax and the cost of repairs.  Those who have company cars are hit for benefit in kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of these factors, perhaps the Minister will outline how the tolling of roads will operate.  Will it be an easy target like the 1 per cent income levy and the 2 per cent probate tax?  Will you, a Chathaoirligh, when driving to your constituency, or will many of the Members when travelling home, be subject to tolls on an intermittent basis from one county to another?  It is possible that tolls could be used as a revenue raising method adopted by local authorities to make up for lack of funding.  We would be opposed to the tolling of roads in <Col N="824" /> principle, especially when public funding is already used to build such roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The scope for private toll-based investment is very limited. We do not have the traffic volumes or the motorway mileage suitable for tolling. The East Link and the West Link are the only tolling facilities to date and as a regular commuter on the East Link I am sympathetic to Senator Cosgrave's concerns on the cost to the motorist.</P>
      <P>Toll proposals for the Dublin ring road proved unacceptable to Dublin County Council.  Negotiations were in place at an earlier stage in relation to the by-passes at Newbridge and Kilcullen.  These did not reach a satisfactory conclusion as the likely level of private funding available was small when compared with the total cost and the probable diversion of traffic to secondary roads.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the tolling of roads is a double taxation.  It has been the policy of successive Governments to seek toll-based investment in roads, with moneys raised passed on to develop further road structures throughout the country.  Ultimately there will probably be very few toll roads.  There will not be sufficient motorway mileage and I am not convinced that tolling is a major way of raising revenue to fund further road construction.</P>

      <P>There has been substantial motorway development in the part of the country where I come from and the issue of tolls has been highly controversial.  I agree with Senator Cosgrave that as a society we are reluctant to pay tolls. Given the level of taxation on cars tolls should not be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 57 (6) of the Bill states: &ldquo;The making of a toll scheme in relation to a regional road or a local road shall be a reserved function.&rdquo;  The national road network is to be under the care of the National Roads Authority.  However, if a proposal was put to the National Roads Authority to have a toll on a national road, such as a motorway going through Kildare, it would be the members of the local authority in Kildare who would get <Col N="825" /> the heat rather than the members of the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>I would be reluctant to relinquish local authority control on the issue of applying a toll to a national road.  How can the Minister reassure me, as a member of Kildare County Council, that I will not find myself taking the heat for a decision taken by the National Roads Authority rather than the county council?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> If the National Roads Authority considers tolling, it is obliged to consult fully with the appropriate local authority and consider any views expressed by the authority.  In addition, there is a public consultation process.  The Minister must hold a public inquiry into any objections and tolls cannot be levied without ministerial approval.  The scope for tolling in this country is very limited.  There are no projects on national roads which could be fully funded by toll-based private investment.</P>
      <P>Members of local authorities have expressed reservations similar to those expressed by Senator Dardis.  Because of these reservations the Minister has made clear provision in the Bill for the procedures to be fulfilled before any toll is introduced.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Senator Cosgrave's amendment No. 16, referring to &ldquo;road users with special needs&rdquo; is, I believe, too vague to form the basis of an exemption from tolls.  The private investor would need to be clear as to what classes of road users or vehicles were exempt as this would have an impact on revenue.</P>
      <P>I am sympathetic with the thinking behind Senator Cosgrave's amendment. Present exemptions include pedestrians, pedal cycles, invalid carriages, vehicles specially adapted for use by physically handicapped persons and vehicles providing public passenger transport services. Perhaps Senator Cosgrave wishes to propose some defined exemptions. The Minister has further powers under regulation to extend the list of exemptions under section 62.</P>
      <P>I am involved with the handicapped and there are exemptions I would wish the Minister to include.  I will discuss this with the Minister when consideration is given to increasing the exemptions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>So many sections of this Bill refer to toll roads that I believe there is more than just a suggestion of introducing them.  Could the Minister clarify the circumstances under which toll charges could be imposed on users of regional roads by local authorities which are also roads authorities?  The Bill provides for this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the points made by the Minister.  If my amendment is accepted, a list would be drawn up of road users with special needs.  As the Minister indicated, this amendment is particularly relevant to the disabled who should be uppermost in our minds and who should be given priority.  Even though my amendment is vague, the Government's amendment is not specific either.  It refers to &ldquo;such other classes of vehicles or road users as the Minister may prescribe in relation to toll roads generally, specified classes of toll roads or specified toll roads.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authority regulations concerning the payment of toll charges by disabled <Col N="827" /> people who travel the East and West Link bridges led me to put down this amendment.  They are exempt from paying these charges when crossing the East Link bridge but must pay them on the West Link bridge.  I kept the wording of the amendment simple while making clear the category of persons I wish to benefit.</P>
    <P>Some Senators suggested that toll roads will be very much part of our lives in the next century.  Will the Minister clarify whether the disabled will be exempt from paying charges on toll roads operated either by local authorities or private concerns?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the reason for the Minister's amendment but I cannot see why it is framed in the way it is.  Section 57 (2) states that:</P>
      <P>In making a toll scheme, a road authority shall give special consideration to the question of exempting from tolls under the scheme pedestrians, pedal cycles, invalid carriages vehicles specially adapted for use by physically handicapped persons and vehicles providing public passenger transport services.</P>
      <P>Since this seems to be also appropriate to section 62, is there any need for it to be included in section 57 rather than in section 62?  I am confused as to why such vehicles and persons should be exempt when they do not come within section 62.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave's amendment refers to &ldquo;road users with special needs&rdquo;.  I can think of all sorts of special needs which would be unlikely to qualify for exemption if the amendment is accepted.  The need to transport my grain along a certain section of road may be special to me but I cannot imagine the Minister agreeing that I should be exempt from paying a toll.  The words &ldquo;special needs&rdquo; are very broad and need to be restricted by words such as those in section 57.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be accepted in principle that the disadvantaged should not suffer and the disabled should be exempt from paying toll charges.  I am sure the Minister <Col N="828" /> would not quibble with this.  We should devise a formula of words which would give expression to this principle and take it outside the realm of discretion. The formula should include the words &ldquo;the following shall be exempt&rdquo; which are contained in section 62 rather than &ldquo;given special consideration&rdquo; which are in section 57.  My central question is: why is the subsection I quoted included in section 57 rather than in section 62 which is more appropriate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>We all appreciate that the intent of Senator Cosgrave's amendment is to provide for the special needs of the disabled and others.  However, it has been pointed out that it is too broad. If it were accepted it would be difficult to classify those with special needs, and I can understand why the Minister has difficulty accepting it.  I have no doubt that the amendment intends to give the Minister discretion in deciding the category of vehicles or road users which are to be exempt.  The Government's amendment, however, provides for this broad discretion.  When this Bill becomes law, requests for exemptions may be made to the Minister on behalf of individuals or groups and he will have discretion when making his decisions.</P>

      <P>In a recent court case involving a child in Cork who was seeking the right to be educated, the judge, in a landmark judgment, strongly criticised the poor quality of care given to people with special needs.  I strongly support Senator Cosgrave's amendment.  Groups which help the physically and mentally handicapped clearly understand the meaning of the term &ldquo;special needs&rdquo;.  The Minister should not allow legislation to be enacted which imposes additional taxation on those who are handicapped or have special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under current legislation disabled drivers are entitled to rebates of VAT and excise duty on the purchase price of new cars and excise duty on petrol.  This legislation, if enacted, will impose additional costs on motorists without any exemptions for disabled drivers.  It is not much <Col N="829" /> to ask the Minister to accept this amendment. It shows a degree of caring.</P>
    <P>Local people have special needs. Throughout Europe &mdash; and in Ireland &mdash; transport companies and road and rail owners have to make special arrangements for people in local areas who use the road and rail networks.  It is appropriate that we legislate for people with special needs who conduct business in the service industry.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Garda, the Army, the ambulance service and the fire brigade are exempt from paying tolls. This logic can be extended.  No one is against the idea of exemptions.  However, why should Army personnel have rights which are not extended to handicapped people?  The answer is simple: because it would be a tax collected by the State to be paid to the State.  This would signify an administrative blunder of the highest order.</P>
    <P>We make every effort to support and make life easier for disabled or handicapped drivers who are on a low income and are supported by the State. However, we are now saying that we will impose an additional tax on them.  Surely, we should make life easier for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation should specifically state that vehicles used by handicapped people are exempt from paying tolls.  There are different circumstances where such vehicles can be used.  Ambulances have been mentioned. The local handicapped organisations have their own ambulances, but this would not meet the criteria set out in this section.  It is necessary that this legislation state specifically that handicapped people are exempt from paying tolls.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Senator Dardis has a &ldquo;special need&rdquo; in relation to his grain truck and his colleagues in Kildare County Council might be able to include that in another <Col N="830" /> subsection.  However, I did not have his grain truck in mind when I was tabling this amendment.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I respect the views expressed.  They show the need to define the areas which should and should not be exempt.  Under section 57(2), the National Roads Authority or a local authority will be obliged to give special consideration to exempting certain categories of vehicles and road users when preparing a toll scheme.  They are only obliged to give special consideration because their powers are discretionary.</P>
      <P>I was responding to Senator Cosgrave's amendment in a positive way because the Government tabled an amendment which allows the Minister for the Environment to make regulations.  In future, regulations made by the Minister will be mandatory.  At the moment, certain persons are exempt from paying the toll on the East Link bridge but no one is exempt on the West Link bridge.  In future, the Minister can make a regulation which will exempt the West Link bridge and the local authority or the National Roads Authority will have to implement the Minister's decision.  This is responding to Senator Cosgrave's amendment.</P>
      <P>We must clearly define what or who is exempt.  We do not want people arriving at the toll bridge and debating for up to an hour about whether they are exempt from paying tolls.  I ask Senators on all sides to accept section 62 which gives the Minister power to make regulations.  In future, these regulations will not be discretionary but will be mandatory.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senators' views, I am not too happy about some of the areas which are not exempt at present.  I will encourage the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, to include the views and ideas which have been put forward from all sides of the House when making regulations in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sherlock made a point about toll roads.  The Government does not <Col N="831" /> intend to have toll roads throughout the country.  As I said, there is little scope for toll roads in this country.  We have taken the 1979 legislation and put it into the National Roads Authority Bill but we have introduced a power to revoke toll roads.  In other words, it is the 1979 legislation with that one change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's good faith on the question of the regulations and who should be exempt but the amendment does not meet the case Senator Cosgrave was making.  What the Minister is saying in essence, is &ldquo;trust me and trust the Department&rdquo;, and when the regulations are being made they will take into account all our worries.  That is one of the most dangerous things that has happened in parliament over many years. Instead of us doing the work, we would be asking the Minister and the Department to do the work for us.  It is important that we have a guarantee on the concerns which Senator Cosgrave, Senator O'Toole and others expressed on this issue.  This House is the place where we can frame and decide issues rather than leaving it to the good will, or otherwise, of the officials in the Department where they may publish regulations which might lie in the Library and become law almost by stealth.</P>
      <P>A few years ago one of the worst examples of this occurred in relation to the licensing of restaurants.  Both Houses agreed in principle that restaurants should be licensed to sell alcoholic drink, and that ministerial order would decide the definition of a restaurant.  However, when the orders &mdash; which we could not vote on, they had to be accepted &mdash; came to this House they ruled out a large number of what most of us considered bona fide restaurants.  Clearly, the publicans lobby had persuaded the Minister of the day and the eventual regulations went contrary to the spirit expressed in both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> I accept the spirit what the Minister of State says, and if he was the Minister I would have no great problem.  However, Ministers come and Ministers go, and for that reason we cannot accept the assurances given to us unless we have a guarantee that on Report Stage he would take on board the case Senator Cosgrave and others so strongly argued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">

      <P>(a)  ambulances and fire brigade vehicles, (b) vehicles used by members of the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces in the performance of their duties as such members.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment is, to say the least, vague where it states: &ldquo;such other classes of vehicles or road users as the Minister may prescribe.&rdquo;  We are talking about a specific class of person covered by the Senator Cosgrave's amendment which states: &ldquo;road users with special needs.&rdquo;  A person with a trailer of wheat going to the granary would not be considered a person with special needs.  Generally, we know what constitutes a person with special needs, but more precise, most specific wording should be put into the legislation to cover such people.  I support Senator Cosgrave's amendment for that reason.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 60, before section 67, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;67.&mdash;The owner of a horse found straying or unsupervised on any road shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of £200 and to a further fine of £2,000 for each subsequent offence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> Most Senators would be aware of the increasing number of stray horses and the problems they cause in urban and rural areas.  I know of many who have been badly injured in accidents caused by these animals.  We should not let horses wander about unattended in urban or rural areas. We should also consider the imposition of a heavy penalty on the owners of such animals.  I acknowledge there is great difficulty ascertaining the ownership of such animals, but there might be an improvement in the situation if their owners knew they would have to pay heavy fines if they did not control their horses.  I ask the Minister to consider this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Senator Cosgrave's amendment but it should not be limited to horses or the imposition of a fine.  The law, as I understand it, already provides a strict liability on landowners for the escape of any animal from their property and for any damage they might do as a consequence. It also covers many circumstances in a much stronger fashion than would be provided for in this amendment.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on that further. It puzzles me that section 67 is there at all because I always understood there was a duty of care there, whether it was specified in the legislation or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> In relation to Senator Cosgrave's amendment, the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1851, amended by the Animals Act, 1985, makes it an offence to turn loose any horse on a public road or to let any horse wander upon any public road or street.  There are fines of up to £150 for first offences and £350 for subsequent offences.  At present, the Minister for the Environment has no responsibility in relation to stray horses. The Animals Act, 1985, introduced by the then Minister for Justice, updated and improved the law in relation to wandering animals.  This Act gave new wide ranging powers to local authorities and the Garda to impound wandering animals found on public roads, parks and other open spaces.  It also gave new powers <Col N="836" /> to local authorities regarding the sale, disposal or destruction of impounded animals and also provides for increased fines for offences, such as allowing animals to wander on public property.  The Act also abolished the then existing immunity of occupiers of land adjoining the public road in relation to damage caused by animals straying onto the road.  Any strengthening of this law would be a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the speakers; wandering horses are an ongoing problem in my constituency.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has general responsibility in relation to animal cruelty under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and the Minister of Justice has some responsibilities in relation to wandering animals under the 1985 Animals Act.</P>
      <P>There seems to be considerable problems with wandering horses in many urban areas and the local authorities and the Garda are finding it difficult to enforce the legislation.  The Garda are also aware of allegations and problems arising from the sale of horses and ponies, and they are trying to resolve them.  The new section introduced to the Bill codifies the existing common law duty of care imposed on road users to take reasonable care for their own safety and the safety of other users.  Road users will also be obliged to take all reasonable measures to avoid injury to themselves or other road users and to avoid damage to their own, or other people's, property.</P>
      <P>In relation to stray animals, I would like to see this problem resolved.  I spend much of my time in my constituency meeting groups concerned about this issue.  This is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, and I am not passing the buck.  The Act was updated in 1985 but it does not seem to have worked.  The Minister for Justice will have to look at this to see how it can be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has broadly met the point made by Senator Cosgrave and is aware of the extent of the problem.  It was interesting to hear the Minister agree with views expressed <Col N="837" /> here that the Animals Act, 1985, is lacking in the extent of the fines imposed and in its application.  The Garda do not have the resources or the time to properly implement the Act and it would be no harm for the Minister to report back to the Department of Justice the feeling on all sides that this section of the Act needs to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>As regards the amendment, Senator Gallagher asked about the purpose of this section.  As it stands, it is an exhortation; there is no definition of what people should do or what might be an offence, and there are no penalties involved.  It says that we all have a duty to be careful on the road.  We all agree, but, apart from this provision, what is the point of having this section in the Bill?  I may be wrong, but it seems there is neither definition nor sanction involved for those who might be guilty of not being careful on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Any provision to increase protection from wandering animals on public roads is to be welcomed.  When animals are impounded under the wandering animals Act, the registrar of the court is involved and the person claiming ownership has to prove they have an alternative site for the horses &mdash; it is generally horses that are involved.  This calls for a stiff penalty, and it is appropriate that we do more in this area so that we can eliminate this widespread problem.  I know of one local authority that had to engage contractors to deal with this problem as their employees refused to do it because they were afraid.  Once the animals appear in a certain area the contractors were called in to take them to the pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 67 of the Bill states that it &ldquo;shall be the duty of a person using a public road to take reasonable care...&rdquo;. If this section is law, could it be used against a person who has a legitmate claim because he or she was injured while using a road?  There are many hazards on our roads today which did not exist years ago.  Some people using the public highways, and others who have to do work on the roads, have no regard for the <Col N="838" /> general public &mdash; they leave craters on the roads, tar barrels, etc., if roads are being repaired.  Some people seem to totally disregard public safety.  If this section becomes law, could it be used against a person who has a legitimate case and who may have suffered injury?</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Senator Sherlock spoke about proving ownership. From experience I know it is very difficult to prove ownership of animals.  When one thinks one has found the owner it transpires that the animal belongs to someone else.</P>
      <P>This section is inserting what is already stated in civil law.  Breach of statutory duty is not being made an offence but the courts will have discretion when considering civil actions for damages against the road authority.  The rules for contributory negligence are set out in Chapters 3 and 4 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, and these are unaffected by the provisions of this section.  Under the existing law, if a local authority, Telecom Éireann, the ESB or others, dig up a road but do not restore it properly, and if a person or a vehicle is damaged, the injured party is entitled to claim, and that will not be affected under this section.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned one of the biggest hazards of urban life at present, and that is the constant opening of roads by the local authorities, state corporations, etc.  My point is probably not relevant to this discussion, but one of the greatest frustrations of public representatives in urban areas &mdash; and I am sure it is the same throughout the country &mdash; is trying to get satisfaction from the public utilities who frequently have work ongoing for weeks.  From personal experience I have had great difficulty in getting satisfactory responses on many occasions from these public utilities.</P>

      <P>There are some points in this section which require clarification. Subsection (1) (a) states that a person &ldquo;who without lawful authority erects, places or retains a temporary dwelling on a national road, motorway...&rdquo;.  Temporary dwellings which are erected or provided are a common problem in many areas.  According to a High Court judgment, if a person is in occupation of a temporary dwelling and a local authority seeks an injunction to prevent the person continuing to do so, it now must provide an alternative for the family or person or persons occupying the temporary dwelling at the time.  I assume this will now apply to the roads over which the National Roads Authority will have jurisdiction. Will this jurisdiction extend to regional roads or what will now be known as local roads?</P>

      <P>All Members are aware of the problem of people dumping cars in the countryside.  Some beauty spots have been spoiled by this practice which is becoming more common.  We should do something in law to prevent it and to make the people who do it liable.  It should be reasonably easy to trace the ownership of some of these vehicles.  I note that a temporary dwelling is defined under section 69, line 44, page 61, as a &ldquo;tent, caravan, mobile home, vehicle or other structure or thing (whether on wheels or not) which is capable of being moved from one place to another.. .&rdquo;.

There is a tradition in this country that farmers and others sell potatoes, apples or strawberries on the side of the road.  i do not want that type of local endeavour to supplement a farm income to be excluded.  It has been a tradition in the farming community that people would have an opportunity to sell direct to the public for limited periods and that system of sale should be allowed to operate.</P>

      <P>In relation to abandoned vehicles, I do not know if my point would be more appropriate to section 71 but perhaps the Minister will reply.  A common complaint I receive is about vehicles left in urban areas.  However a big difficulty at times is to decide if the vehicles have been abandoned or if they are just dilapidated.  In some built up areas where there are many flats, people may only use their cars occasionally.  Perhaps the Minister could consider the question of abandoned vehicles which create a problem in built-up areas.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Temporary dwellings will be prohibited.  It will be an offence to retain a temporary dwelling on a national road, motorway, busway or protected road.  In total, this represents only about 6 per cent of road mileage in this country, but in addition to these roads, the Minister has the power under <Col N="841" /> subsection (1)(b) &mdash; and this was inserted on Committee Stage at the request of Members from all sides of the House &mdash; to proscribe the placing or retention of a temporary dwelling on any other road. In Dublin and in rural areas there are major problems with temporary dwellings which are not confined to national primary roads or motorways.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court decision in McDonald <i>v.</i> Dublin City and County Managers, etc., which oblige the local authority to have regard to its obligations as a housing authority before removing a temporary dwelling from a public road, will not be affected by the provisions of section 66.  If somebody illegally places a temporary dwelling on a national road, the road authority will still have to take into account its obligations as a housing authority before removing the dwelling. The person who places the temporary dwelling on the national road will be guilty of an offence, but that Supreme Court decision will be taken into account before any decision is made to remove it.</P>
      <P>Abandoned cars are another problem around the country.  There is a responsibility under the Litter Act, 1982, to remove abandoned cars.  This is national clean-up week and I would hope that a number of abandoned cars around the country would be collected by the local authorities and recycled or disposed of in another manner.  I agree that this is a problem and there is a further problem in defining an abandoned car, particularly in urban areas.  A car may appear to be abandoned but after a few weeks a person may claim ownership.  I would say to Senator Cosgrave and Senator Dardis that the responsibility for removing abandoned cars comes under the Litter Act, 1982.</P>
      <P>This roadside sale of strawberries, potatoes and other produce, which may provide people with a seasonal income, comes under section 71.  This will not be affected under this Bill and people will be allowed to continue trading in these areas.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I have ensured in discussions with the Minister, Deputy Smith, that this area would not be affected because many small farmers, not only in Wexford and Carlow, supplement their income during the summer months by selling potatoes and other vegetables on the roadside.  We should not bring into legislation measures which might adversely affect their livelihood.  I am happy to say it is clear in section 71 of the Bill that these people will not be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point that abandoned cars come under the Litter Act, 1982, but, I think it is a reasonable point to make that cars are related to roads &mdash; or at least they should be.  If we make provision in the legislation for tents, caravans, mobile homes, and so on, it would seem logical to include abandoned cars.  I must admit that I have difficulty visualising cars as litter, but that is mostly a matter of semantics.  They probably go to the great scrapyard in the sky after they have eventually decayed.</P>
      <P>With regard to roadside trading, it is reasonable that people should continue trading in traditional places.  I would ask the Minister to make a distinction between motorways and other roads because, as one who travels almost daily on the Naas motorway, it is astonishing to see what people get up to on that stretch of road.  I have seen people picnicking, doing U-turns across the central reservation and all sorts of weird and wonderful wildlife.  Cars travel on that road at such speed that it would be extremely dangerous to allow any type of casual trading there.</P>
      <P>Legally, one cannot stop a car on that road.  In the event of a breakdown one is meant to telephone and have the car towed away.  I imagine the Minister accepts that point.  While it would be important to allow traditional places be used as trading areas, it would not be appropriate to allow anything of that nature on a motorway given that drivers cannot stop on the motorway.</P>

The Litter Act, 1982, gives wide ranging powers in this area.  The local authorities may not be able to finance the collection and removal of cars, as happened in the past, but I do not see any need to duplicate that provision.  I agree with the Senator, and it is clearly defined in the Bill, that trading or similar activities should not be allowed on motorways in the interests of the safety of traders and motorists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to one's experience and knowledge, one can see the anomalies between what is proposed in this legislation and what exists in the other area.  One must agree that the legislation in regard to dangerous trees and the power to compel people to remove them is archaic, and this has been the experience in recent years.  It appears that if the local authority was to bring the person <Col N="844" /> who owned the property to court, it would have to prove that the trees were affecting the condition of the road, and might prove to be dangerous.  I want to know if this legislation will make it easier for people to get the relevant authority, whether it is the National Roads Authority or the local authority, to deal with this common problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some queries about the section particularly with regard to the felling of trees.  Local authorities have established a practice of issuing preservation orders on trees, some of which are located on road sides.  I am aware of a case where a local authority issued a preservation order about four or five years ago to prevent a landowner from cutting down trees on the side of the roads, yet the same local authority cut those trees down in 1993 in the course of road widening work.  There seems to be little consistency in the process.  It would have been illegal if the farmer had cut down the trees when developing his land but the council could do so, without consultation with other bodies, when developing the national secondary road.</P>
      <P>Another area that concerns me is forestry. The planning laws have little control over the planting of forests.  In some cases trees are planted very close to the edge of the forest which can interfere with visibility at, for example, a road junction.  I hope regulations can be introduced to deal with such problems as it would appear that the local authority does not have the power to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There appears to be some confusion about hedge cutting orders, particularly at local authority level.  The law does not seem to be clear on the subject.  It allows the local authority to issue hedge cutting orders but people are confused about whether hedge cutting on road sides is the responsibility of the landowner or the local authority.  Indeed, it is often a matter of argument between the local authority and the landowner with the public representative regularly drawn into the debate.  I have been drawn into such debates on numerous occasions and I would welcome clarification of the <Col N="845" /> issue.  When a hedge cutting order is issued, are the trees at the roadsides the responsibility of the landowner and the weeds and overgrowth the responsibility of the local authority?  Will the National Roads Authority or the local authority be charged with responsibility for such matters in future?  It is a difficult problem to deal with through legislation but, in recent times, it has caused controversy and debate at local authority level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I appreciate that the removal of hedges or trees is a difficult issue.  Although local authorities could, in the past, issue orders to landowners to cut down and remove hedges and trees, they were not successful in implementing those orders.</P>
      <P>This Bill, in section 70 (1) and (2), improves the ability of road authorities to deal with hazards and potential hazards. Previously the road authorities could not deal with dangerous structures along public roads and could only order owners or occupiers to carry out remedial work on trees or other vegetation in a limited number of situations.  For example, if the authority ordered a landowner or occupier to remove a dead tree from a roadside &mdash; if the tree shaded or obstructed the view of the road &mdash; no effective action could be taken if the person refused to comply.</P>
      <P>Under the new legislation the National Roads Authority can, in certain circumstances, remove dangerous trees or hedging and try to recoup the costs from the owner or occupiers of the structures or the land concerned, which is sometimes difficult.  The structure must not be a hazard or a potential hazard, it must not interfere with or obstruct the safe use of public roadway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately, the cutting of hedges or the maintenance of fencing beside roads is the responsibility of the landowner. The local authority or the National Roads Authority can take action against landowners if they refuse to comply with notices to remove trees or hedging. However, I have found that serving such notices usually results in an argument about whether the trees are in a formal <Col N="846" /> state of decay, with the landowner arguing that the local authority must prove that the trees should be cut down and this can develop into a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority and the local authorities have the power to take cases to court and their powers will be strengthened under this legislation.  I hope the powers relating to this matter under section 70 will be used more effectively by the local authorities in future. Trees can be a great danger to motorists and pedestrians, particularly when they are planted at bad bends.  Owner occupiers may not always comply with regulations on the location and planting of trees under the planning laws.  It is a difficult problem but I hope this section will enable local authorities to enforce stricter controls in future.</P>

The gardaí in the area should be notified about where and when a skip will be in use.  I appreciate business premises must dispose of their rubbish but at times skips are parked on the path or road as if this were legitimate.  In certain areas skips cause congestion problems, and delays for ambulances and fire tenders.  There must be a firmer attitude to the operation of skips, particularly with regard to badly lit skips which constitute a danger to motorists and cyclists.

Public safety must be taken into consideration and in particular those members of the public who have special needs.

One has a certain sympathy with those who operate bona fide waste removal companies which provide an important service, generally at very reasonable prices and most of the companies I have dealt with have been well run.  My problem is whether this section will make any difference to the way in <Col N="848" /> which skips are operated at present. Under this section the authority may provide by-laws.  I wonder how many local authorities will actually provide these by-laws. If by-laws are put in place they need to be enforced.  It might be better to license companies subject to periodic spot checks; I do not believe what is proposed in this section will be a reality within three or four years.  If the authorities actually pass the by-laws I will be concerned about their enforcement, so while I welcome the principle behind this section I do not believe it will make any difference.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Section 72 was not part of the original draft Bill.  It was inserted in the Bill by the special committee and represents the kind of provision the local authorities have been requesting for quite some time.  Its purpose is to regulate and control the use of rubbish skips on public roads.  I agree the way in which skips are parked at random with no regard for the safety of the public causes problems in our towns and cities; we have had frequent complaints about the dangers posed to road users by these skips.  This section allows for a flexible approach by local authorities when making by-laws regulating these skips, to tie in with the different levels of control which may be appropriate to major urban centres or to smaller towns, and between urban and rural areas.  The power to make these by-laws will devolve entirely on local authorities, and ministerial approval will not be required, although local authorities will be obliged to consult with the gardaí when drafting them.  This is appropriate in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power in subsections 1 and 2 to make by-laws will include the power to introduce a licensing system if required, and to specify requirements as to the siting, lighting and removal of skips. Under subsections (7) and (12) it also gives local authorities and the gardaí power to remove and store skips which are in breach of by-laws which may be introduced by local authorities, where these skips are causing a serious and immediate hazard to road users.  In <Col N="849" /> response to Senator Manning, the officials had discussions with local authorities, and this is exactly what they looked for.  The Special Committee and Members on all sides of the House asked for the inclusion of this provision, and the Minister has agreed to devolve the making of by-laws on local authorities without any need to return the proposed by-laws to him for approval.  That should give the local authorities wide ranging powers to deal with this problem.  There are, as Senator Manning has said, some very responsible skip operators in the country, but there are also a number of cowboys who cause serious problems in towns and cities with no regard whatsoever for the safety of the public.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 19:</P>
      <P>In page 68, before section 73, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;73.&mdash;(1) It shall be the responsibility of each roads authority to provide secure parking areas for articulated trucks in each area where it thinks necessary.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a parking area referred to in subsection (1) is provided by a roads authority it shall be an offence on the part of the owner to park an articulated truck on a public road except when he is engaged in delivery or some other activity connected with his business.</P>
      <P>(3)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) it shall also be an offence on the part of the owner of any truck over 25 feet in length to park such truck on any private road or any road within a housing estate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section follows our previous discussion but is probably more serious in one way.  The parking of articulated trucks is a bone of contention, in both rural and urban areas.  I have the utmost sympathy <Col N="850" /> for truck drivers who work long hours, having to meet strict deadlines in a stressful job.  However, in some areas lorries and articulated trucks are parked in ways which cause a hazard to other motorists.  Because of their size it is difficult to drive around them, especially in residential areas.  The road authorities should come up with a scheme to avoid this problem.  Perhaps each local authority could designate an area where such trucks can be parked.  This is not a simple problem and I appreciate that while some authorities may find a solution easily, other local authorities will have to consider the problem in depth.  I hope the Minister of State will see the point in providing such areas.  Articulated trucks parked in very awkward places can lead to accidents.  We must ensure the proper lighting of such trucks so that they can be seen when parked.  I ask the Minister to respond positively to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Section 54 of the Bill will empower the National Roads Authority and local authorities to provide service areas on motorways and protected roads which will serve as places where heavy vehicles can park.  Local authorities also have a general power under the Road Traffic Acts to provide parking facilities themselves or support the provision of private facilities.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the parking of heavy vehicles is a problem that is not confined to Dublin but also affects towns and areas where there is a heavy volume of traffic. As one who lives on the Rosslare route I have seen many problems caused by trucks parked in towns and residential areas.  If, for example, fridges have to be left running all night it causes nuisance to residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment has been in consultation with the Garda in relation to proposals by the Garda Commissioner to apply specific controls on the parking of heavy vehicles in the Dublin area.  These Garda proposals have been submitted to the Attorney General's Office for consideration.  It is expected that further discussions between the Attorney General's Office, <Col N="851" /> the Garda and the Department in relation to these proposals will continue for some time.</P>
    <P>In May of last year the Minister for the Environment gave approval to Dublin Corporation to spend £3 million out of capital receipts accumulated from parking charges in Dublin city to improve traffic controls.  He specifically asked that the corporation should consider earmarking some parking fees income to provide parking facilities for heavy goods vehicles and buses and coaches.  He did that with a view to the elimination of the problems caused by heavy goods vehicles being parked overnight in residential areas and the problem of illegal parking of buses and coaches in busy areas, which can affect traffic flows and also cause problems in residential areas.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have taken the view that private interests, including the commercial haulage sector, oil companies etc., should take a leading role in providing facilities for truck parking, either on their own or in co-operation with local authorities.  This has happened in some cases but I suppose that commercial interests will only get involved if it is viable and there is money to be made.</P>
    <P>The problem might not be solved by Senator Cosgrave's amendment.  I hope, however, that the discussions my Department is having with the Garda and with Dublin Corporation in relation to the fees from parking charges will result in some solution to the problem, at least in Dublin.  It will be more difficult to solve the problem in the smaller towns.  It will not be viable from a commercial point of view or even for local authorities to build parking bases for trucks and buses.  With the co-operation of the Department of the Environment, the Garda Síochána, Dublin Corporation and, perhaps, some commercial interests, we should be able to resolve some of the problems in Dublin city.  We all have first hand experience of the problems here and I sympathise with people living in built up areas and housing estates.</P>
    <P>We must find a balance.  Truck drivers work long and unsocial hours and <Col N="852" /> because of regulations laid down by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications they have to stop for specified times.  We have a duty to provide services for those people.  I ask the Senator to take account of the ongoing negotiations and perhaps together we can devise a solution to this problem sooner rather than later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he accepts fully the case made by Senator Cosgrave about the nature and the extent of the problem.  As I understand it, his solution is that, if left to their own devices, the procedures and processes in place at present will bring together the corporation, the Garda authorities and the Attorney General's office and the problem will be resolved.  It is not as simple as that.  This amendment is not intended in any way as an attack on the drivers of these trucks, for whom we all have the utmost sympathy.  They work long and unsocial hours and, generally, they are more courteous to other road users than may be the ordinary motorist.</P>
      <P>The problems in certain suburban areas in Dublin can be quite appalling. Large refrigerated trucks are frequently left in side streets.  They are dangerous and a hazard to other cars because of the obstructions caused.  It is often a question of might is right and there is no comeback for the ordinary citizen.  Those of us who go to residents association meetings on a regular basis will find that this problem is frequently discussed.</P>
      <P>I do not think that we can agree to drop this amendment.  We would like to see it included as an indication of a stronger resolve to tackle this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While I note what the Minister said and I hope that progress will be made, we are here setting up a roads authority who will have to take a lead in the matter.  If the authority is given a certain direction, they will be better able to tackle the problems.  I <Col N="853" /> appreciate that it would be unrealistic to expect parking areas in every little town or village where someone has an articulated truck, but some local authorities, particularly in Dublin, Cork and Galway, could provide these parks.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority is being set up to improve the whole road and travel network.  The authority should examine this area because a number of fatalities have been caused.  One Member of the other House was seriously injured having driven into a parked truck.  We have to look at this with a view to preventing further carnage and accidents on the road and, accordingly, we will be pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to Senator Cosgrave and I realise that this is a serious problem which must be addressed.  However, having thought about it and recognised the Minister's point, I think it would be dangerous to put the responsibility for solving this problem on each road authority. Responsibility must ultimately lie with the owners of the trucks.  It seems dangerous to force each road authority always to have spaces available for parking articulated trucks.  It would present an almost impossible task.  The onus has to be placed on the owners of those trucks. This is clearly a very serious matter but the answer does not lie in the solution recommended by Senator Cosgrave.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The experience in towns is that people who drive articulated trucks are away all day, come back and park outside in a built up area.  They are out again at five o'clock in the morning and they have the whole neighbourhood awake and listening to an articulated truck being revved up.  It is a common problem which cannot be rectified by parking by-laws.  The situation can be rectified by what is proposed in the amendment.  It is worth considering and I support it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> To specify local authorities would cause problems because of lack of funding.  The solution <Col N="854" /> can be found in a combination of factors. There can be local authority involvement, commercial involvement and truck owner involvement.  The National Roads Authority can be involved under section 19 (1) (e) which states quite specifically that one of its functions is to &ldquo;secure the provision of facilities for the parking of vehicles&rdquo;.  There are small local authorities that could not afford to provide such facilities.  We should look at a combination of factors to try to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>I accept that this is not an attack on truck drivers.  Truck drivers have come to me and to every other Senator and Deputy requesting that we provide facilities for them.  I would like to help them because I know that they do not want to be a nuisance to built up areas, either in Dublin or in other parts of the country. I cannot accept the amendment because I would see a better chance of reaching a solution to the problem if one could marry the interested parties and try to come up with funding, rather than specifying that the local authorities are responsible. I do not think that would work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to what was said before the Minister's contribution. I was interested in the intervention of Senator Quinn and the emphasis he put on the responsibility of the private sector, the industry itself, to help resolve this problem.  I would be interested to know from the Minister if specific proposals have been made by the interests involved to help alleviate this problem.  From what I know of the subject, the industry itself &mdash; although perhaps it is too much to speak in terms of a homogeneous industry &mdash; has been reluctant to foot portion of the bill or to speak in a unified way. Could the Minister tell me what the position is?</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I am already aware of one development in Blanchardstown which is a commercial, private enterprise.  There is talk of other such developments around the country. I am sure we could initiate discussions with the representatives of the transport <Col N="855" /> industry to see if we could bring about a solution.  It has been the policy of successive Governments to encourage commercial developments in this area.  As Senator Manning said, they have been reluctant and the process has been slow, but maybe the Department of the Environment can initiate talks in conjunction with local authorities.  We may be able to initiate a policy to resolve the problem based on the suggestions that the Minister made to Dublin Corporation in the past year in relation to income from parking charges.</P>
      <P>Having been a member of a reasonably small local authority for a number of years, I could not see how they would be in a position to fund it on their own without adequate support from the Exchequer.  Considering the Exchequer position, I do not see that happening in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been my experience, particularly abroad, that this is quite a common development.  It is not required of a local authority to build or create a new facility.  Most of the local authorities in the London area, in providing secure parking areas for large vehicles, normally use facilities attached to sporting arenas such as greyhound tracks and football grounds.  These have secure parking areas within them, and similar facilities could be provided in many parts of this country.  There is a number of such facilities in Dublin.  Blanchardstown was mentioned, and there is one on the North Road in Finglas. Providing secure, supervised overnight parking for trucks is the only way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two aspects to this matter. It is not just a question of protecting local estates by saying we do not want trucks parked there because of the effect on the quality of life of the residents.  That is important, but for a truck driver or owner, that might be the only safe place where there is at least some sort of visual supervision.  A local park would relieve a lot of pressure both for the driver and <Col N="856" /> the truck company.  There must be movement in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did not mean to give the impression that I would be taking away responsibilities from truck drivers.  We have to provide some of these car parks but at the end of the day truck drivers have responsibility.  We have to address this problem, particularly in built up areas, but realistically we will not be able to provide sites or bays all over the country.  If we could reduce on street parking it would be a good thing as it is a danger to other motorists, not to mention the noise levels involved.</P>
      <P>People sometimes cycle or drive into one of these lorries, particularly if it is badly lit.  These parking bays are a cheap option in comparison to the cost of damage done.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> We can take on board Senator O'Toole's suggestions. Most road hauliers will make the point that parking facilities must be secure, with an element of activity around them, so that trucks will not be damaged or interfered with.</P>
      <P>The Department will have discussions with road hauliers as well as taking on board the views outlined in the House. In the past there has been a stand-off position, with road hauliers asking the Government to provide these facilities. The Government has not provided them, but the Department of the Environment has gone part of the way by saying it would look at the facilities to see what can be done as a joint venture with local authorities and commercial interests. That is the only way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will ask the officials to initiate talks with the road hauliers association to see how we can bring about a resolution of the problem.  I accept that it is a difficult one to solve but I also appreciate that we have to start somewhere.  This debate will be a help when we meet the different interested parties.  We will also put Senator O'Toole's suggestions to those involved.  There may be opportunities for people with stadiums and other secure <Col N="857" /> areas to make money out of this suggestion. It can be a two-way system.</P>
    <P>The amendment moved by Senator Cosgrave ties the hands of local authorities too much.  If they have not got the <Col N="858" /> wherewithal to provide the services I do not think there is much point in asking them to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 82, line 39, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to add &ldquo;within 90 days of the end of the most recent financial year of the Authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to force the publication of the annual accounts of the National Roads Authority. Following an amendment in the Dáil, the National Roads Authority is compelled to submit its annual accounts to the Minister by the 30 June each year. However, what I am seeking is the speedy publication of the reports and accounts of all State bodies.  This amendment is an opportunity to start that process.</P>
      <P>Speedy publication means within three months and this is another instance of what can be learnt from the private sector.  If a company is quoted on the Stock Exchange, then it is bound by the rules of the Stock Exchange to report speedily.  This is for a good reason.  Shareholders know time is of the essence and if there is bad news it is important to know it early.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> On the issue of speedy reporting the record is quite bad.  In some cases State bodies publish annual reports and accounts years after the period to which they refer.</P>
    <P>These delays are not always the fault of the State body.  Sometimes the body submits its report to its sponsoring Department and then has to wait many months for approval to publish while the civil servants debate and procrastinate.</P>
    <P>For this reason it is insufficient to compel the State body, in this instance the National Roads Authority, to report to the Minister by a specific date.  I suggest that it is necessary for the legislation to impose on the entire system &mdash; the State body, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the sponsoring Department &mdash; an obligation to publish the report and accounts within a period of three months. From my own experience with An Post this is not an impossible time frame if the will is there.  This amendment should help create that will.</P>
    <P>This amendment introduces an important element of accountability.  Speed, an essential element of such accountability, has too often been neglected.  I urge the Minister to give his consideration to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to Senator Quinn, who has wide business experience, the general principle of his amendment is valid but it could not apply to a local authority body.  There is so much overlapping and incompletion of work in such organisations that it would be impossible to adhere to the accounting practices required by the amendment.</P>
      <P>I would welcome the publication of annual accounts and reports by all public bodies.  In my experience of seeking such reports, it is often not possible to obtain them.  For example, it is difficult in the middle of 1993 to obtain the 1992 report of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
      <P>It is impractical in the context of this Roads Bill to have reports and accounts published under the terms of this proposed amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I dispute the position taken by Senator McGowan on this amendment.  There is a specific requirement that the National Roads Authority shall, &ldquo;Not later than the 30th day of June in each year submit to the Minister a report&rdquo;... The Bill then goes on to specify the requirements in relation to account keeping.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand why the strictures imposed on private enterprise should not apply equally to public bodies and authorities where public money is being spent.  We are accountable for the spending of such moneys.</P>
      <P>It is improper that the publication of accounts by these organisations should be deferred indefinitely.  There have been several cases recently where matters were debated without adequate access to accounts.  An example is the National Stud, where the accounts were several years in arrears.  This is unacceptable as it can lead to sloppiness in the way moneys are spent.  It is for this reason I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I also support the amendment.  The 30 day requirement under section 4 of the Third Schedule to the Bill appears to relate to the performance and functions of the National Roads Authority under the proposed Act rather than the financial report.</P>
      <P>There will be substantial finance involved in the National Roads Authority &mdash; there is provision under the Bill to raise up to £500 million in loans.  There will also be a large input of EC Structural Funds in which the State will have an interest.  I believe it is reasonable to require such a report within 90 days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I sympathise with the motives behind this amendment. The Bill as drafted allows the Minister to direct the National Roads Authority to submit its accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit on or before such date as may be specified by the Minister.  Immediately upon completion of the audit, a copy of the accounts must be presented to the Minister <Col N="861" /> who is obliged to present them to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>To specify a time limit of 90 days for the submission of accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General and for those accounts to be fully audited would be problematic, restrictive and impracticable.  The end of the financial year for all Government departments and most semi-State bodies is 31 December in each year.  Most of the semi-State bodies are then required by the responsible Ministers to submit their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General by the 30 April of the following year.</P>
      <P>This may be one of the reasons why Senator Quinn's amendment is impracticable. There is a build up of accounts around 30 April each year and it is not feasible to audit all the various accounts at one time.  In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General is now obliged by law to have the Government accounts finalised by the end of March in each year and these must be given precedence.</P>
      <P>It is also important to have the workload of the Comptroller and Auditor General spread over a year rather than have it accumulate at a given time each year.  It is not practicable to second staff to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General mainly due to lack of experienced auditors elsewhere in the Government Departments and State agencies and the fact that such transfers would disrupt the work of the parent organisations.</P>
      <P>The Bill as drafted gives flexibility to the Minister to specify when the accounts must be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In the National Road Authority's initial period of operations delays may be experienced while new accounting systems are being put in place.  This would require the Minister to afford the Authority extra time before presenting its initial accounts.  However, it is hoped that as soon as the Authority has a system fully operational and running smoothly the Minister will be able to specify a date early in the year for the submission of such accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the <Col N="862" /> Minister's reply.  It is necessary that there be a distinction between reporting to the Minister and publishing accounts.  I urge that the publication of accounts be adopted as standard practice.  I am disappointed that my other amendment was not considered, although I understand why.  A quality audit as well as a financial audit should be undertaken each year, or at least on a regular basis.  A financial audit examines an organisation's financial performance; a quality audit looks at how it runs its business, whether its procedures are appropriate for the work it does and if they are being followed.</P>
      <P>Quality audits should be undertaken in the public sector for a number of reasons. First, our future prosperity will depend more and more on our ability to deliver quality.  We must learn to compete on international markets on quality as well as on price.  This principle should permeate all aspects of national life.  What we need is the conviction that constantly improving the quality of what we do is an important central task of all activity, whether in the private or the public sector.</P>
      <P>Second, quality is now recognised as being as vital to the service sector as it has been for many years to manufacturing. When the quality movement began 20 or 30 years ago, it was concentrated almost entirely on manufacturing.  Within the last 15 to 20 years the measurement and systematisation of quality has moved into the service sector and the National Roads Authority will be part of that service sector.  The principle of quality assurance should apply to all service businesses, including State bodies.</P>
      <P>State boards should be obliged under legislation to account for their quality performance as well as their financial performance. One does not necessarily flow from the other.  The figures of a State company could be in order but it could be providing a poor quality service.  Thus a company's performance could be deteriorating without anybody at any level being aware of it and we, the representatives of the taxpayers who own the company, would not be aware of it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> Introducing quality into the area of accountability would be an important step forward in how we oversee our State bodies.  It is a practical step because the mechanisms are already in place to do this.  I urge the Minister to set a standard by seriously considering introducing quality assessment to the annual accounts of the National Roads Authority rather than confining the accounts to financial statements.</P>

      <P>This amendment would impose hardship on road authorities. In Donegal at the end of last year we had 90 days of inclement weather during which it was impossible to construct and repair roads.  Local authorities in such difficulties would, if this amendment were carried, have to return to the Exchequer any money allocated for road development as their acounts would have to be completed within 90 days.  The principle behind this amendment may be practical and desirable in the business world, but it is impractical in the context of this Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>: While I do not wish to include a 90 day time limit in the Bill, I hope it may become a reality with the development of technology and new accounting procedures.  Speaking in Dáil Éireann on 18 May the Taoiseach acknowledged the importance making those reports available as early as possible and has issued instructions to various State bodies in this regard.  Senator Quinn has been very insistent that quality audits should be undertaken.  We all hope that quality will be a major consideration of the Authority's operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, goes a long way towards meeting the Senators concerns. Section 17 places a statutory obligation on the Authority &ldquo;to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.&rdquo;  Section 19 (2) provides for the functions of road maintenance, construction and improvement to be performed or arranged to be performed by local authorities.  However, &ldquo;in any case where the Authority considers that it <Col N="864" /> would be more convenient, more expeditious, more effective or more economical that the functions concerned should be performed by it, it may decide accordingly.&rdquo;  These legislative provisions oblige the Authority to ensure that taxpayers' money is well spent.  The NRA can also set standards for construction and maintenance works under section 19 and these are subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Senator Quinn's contributions and am aware of his views on this subject.  Section 18 deals with the preparation by the Authority of its medium-term plan.  I propose to put down an amendment to this section on Report Stage which will oblige the Authority to have regard to the need for efficiency, economy and quality in the construction and maintenance of national roads and will also require it to include an assessment of these matters in its medium-term plan which must be prepared at least once every five years and reviewed annually.  Perhaps we could insert the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; immediately prior to the word &ldquo;assessment&rdquo;. This may not fully comply with what Senator Quinn has in mind but would go a long way towards meeting his concerns. When I was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food for ten months last year I saw the emphasis that was put on quality in the food area.  It is important that quality be an important consideration of all State operations in future.  I would like to go some way towards accommodating Senator Quinn's views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the Government's achievements under the Programme for Government in responding effectively to housing needs through the expansion of the local authority housing programme; full implementation of the social housing plan measures; increased funding to the voluntary housing sector to supplement local authority effort and to deal with marginal groups; and further notes the commitment of additional resources to the remedial work scheme to improve local authority tenants' living conditions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, to the House.  As a fellow Kildare man, I appreciate his work and his enthusiasm for the job, particularly in relation to housing.  The need for housing has been clearly indicated throughout the country and the enthusiasm in the matter which the Minister of State has shown will be warmly welcomed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the motion because it allows the House an opportunity to convey to Government its approval and support for measures which have been taken in the housing area.  It also gives Senators an opportunity to support and encourage the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, to implement the housing measures set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The Programme states:</P>
      <P>We will speed up the implementation of the Plan for Social Housing published in February 1991, making a much more substantial provision for new local authority housing, as well as deploying a wide range of other housing options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of all our policies will be to reduce the pressure of waiting lists to the greatest extent possible over the life of the Government, to give <Col N="867" /> renewed hope to those families in need of housing.</P>
    <P>While canvassing during the last general election, I was disturbed to see the number of families who were living in dreadful conditions.  People were living in caravans and in flats and houses which were overcrowded.  Governments should not allow this situation to continue.  I am delighted the present Government is atempting to eliminate the despair which many Senators saw throughout Ireland, as well as in my constituency of Kildare.</P>
    <P>Many people regard Government efforts to build 3,500 local authority houses this year as a humane gesture. The Government would like to ensure that those who have suffered in the past will now benefit.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has already had an excellent start in 1993.</P>
    <P>In 1993 for the first time in many years new local authority housing has been provided for in every local authority area which is a record for any Government.  I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, for the energy and enthusiasm which he has shown in the implementation of the programme. Since his appointment, he has written to every county manager to ensure that they are aware of the aims for housing.  Red tape has often restricted efforts to increase the number of houses built. Therefore, I hope the work which the Minister initiated will be implemented in rural and urban areas.</P>
    <P>If the housing programme is implemented, jobs will be created and that will reduce the unemployment figure.  Two jobs will be created for every house built.  As a result trades such as carpentry, will benefit.  In Athy, County Kildare, the Tegral factory manufactures slates generating employment in that area.  Tegral and the foundry in Athy will benefit from house starts.  We must ensure that housing becomes a top priority so that employment may be created.</P>
    <P>Unsightly areas in towns will be improved as a result of a directive given <Col N="868" /> to local authorities to build new houses in such areas.  It is important that the planners assess these areas to see if urban housing can be developed there.  It is also important that a directive has been given to develop small urban areas for housing, rather than the large green field estates which have caused trouble in the past.  It is vital that we work upon an area where the development is of a small nature, be it 20 or 24 houses but no more.  That is vital in helping communities to develop and for neighbourliness to become an important factor once more.  This should be developed and the respective authorities, be they county councils or urban councils, must see it as one of their priorities.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government attaches a high priority to social housing needs.  The expansion of the building programme is complemented by the various schemes for social housing.  The shared ownership scheme has been well received and in my short time as a Senator I have seen numerous cases of people wanting to be involved in the shared ownership scheme to ensure they have their own house. I am informed by the Department that under this scheme 500 individuals or families took up occupation of their houses in 1992.  It is practical scheme which helps people who are not able to afford full ownership of a house immediately, enabling them to buy a half share now and the remainder at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In addition to shared ownership the other schemes in the plan have an important part to play in meeting housing needs. The scheme of improvement works, mortgage allowances, the provision of subsidised housing sites and the rent subsidy scheme all have the potential to make an increased contribution to the housing requirements of many households. They are well thought out schemes which cater variously for local authority tenants, tenant purchasers and applicants for local authority houses.  These schemes enable the most appropriate response to be made to the circumstances of individial households.</P>
    <P>Besides the local authority housing <Col N="869" /> programme and the plan for social housing, the Programme for a Partnership Government gives a high priority to the carrying out of remedial works, especially in inner city flat complexes. We are all aware of the need for such remedial work.  The flats and housing estates in many urban areas badly need an injection of hope to dispel the despair which exists at present due to the condition of the dwellings.  I hope that remedial works will be one of the priorities of the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and his Department.  We have seen social hardship in many such areas. There is a lack of pride caused by the conditions the residents live in, giving rise to many of the social problems which development in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is also to be commended for his efforts on behalf of the elderly and the disabled.  I welcome his recent announcement of increases in the cash limits affecting disabled persons' grants and grants for essential repairs to older houses in rural areas.  This is a measure to improve society and is one of the Labour Party's inputs to the Government partnership.  The implementation of policy has been most important in the political career of the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg.  The social factor is important to him and to the Labour Party, and it indicates that we care, particularly for the people most in need.  I greatly appreciate the effort and time being put in to ensure that the old, the disabled and people in rural areas will be looked after. When people grow old they must be cared for.  The Labour Party as a partner in Government will ensure that will happen.</P>
    <P>Since the implementation of the Housing Act, 1988, greater assistance has been available to voluntary and co-operative housing organisations who provide accommodation for disadvantaged groups, such as the elderly and the disabled. The Government has also given greater encouragement to people to own their own houses.  In the budget the first-time buyer's grant was increased to £3,000.  This, allied to the reduction in mortgage rates, has ensured that houses <Col N="870" /> are no longer too costly and can be within the reach of people in the PAYE sector. I hope that we will see an increase in house ownership in 1993 and over the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent references by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, regarding the imminent introduction of a new tenant purchase scheme.  This will enable people to experience the pride of owning one's own house.  In the past this was seen as a development of society.  If one looks at a housing estate where tenant purchasers have their own houses one sees the pride in the area.  The whole estate benefits.</P>
    <P>Such estates are an indication that tenant purchase schemes were successful in the past and I welcome the reintroduction of such a scheme in the not too distant future.  I hope the local authorities and all others involved will ensure that it is carried out with a minimum of fuss. One of the things that can kill a scheme like this is a lengthy application process. I hope there will be a minimum amount of administrative fuss involved in the new tenant purchase scheme.  That is vital in ensuring its success.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline some of the effects of the new housing plan in my constituency.  In County Kildare 120 new starts have been authorised, which is a six-fold increase on 1992.  There is also a shared ownership scheme, a rent subsidy scheme and a home refurbishment scheme.  I appreciate the efforts and the ability of the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and I wish him and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, every success in ensuring that not alone will we see 3,500 housing starts in 1993 but that this process will continue for the duration of this Government, so that the despair which I saw during the general election campaign will be greatly reduced at the end of its term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion with pleasure and I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Wall.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, on his commitment to the housing <Col N="871" /> programme.  He has gone beyond the Programme for a Partnership Government. This is remarkable in such a short time.</P>
      <P>As a student I worked with Focus Point, an organisation which caters for the homeless in Dublin.  I can see the need for equality in housing.  We have a high standard of housing, but one often visits houses which lack basic facilities. Housing is a basic right and I am glad the Department of the Environment is tackling this problem.</P>
      <P>Despite budgetary constraints we have seen the commencement of 3,500 housing starts this year.  It is evidence of the Department's commitment in that regard.  These figures compare well to those of last year.  Some 1,000 housing starts were authorised in 1992 and only 800 were commenced.  Great progress has been made under the Programme for a Partnership Government, particularly under the Minister of State's guidance.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat Senator Wall's comprehensive remarks.  However, it should be emphasised that the type of work created by these housing projects is labour-intensive.  It is estimated that approximately 4,000 jobs will be created, 2,000 directly in the building industry and 2,000 in related industries, including the manufacture and supply of roof tiles, mirrors, carpets, etc.  I have calculated that 15 or 16 related industries will benefit.</P>
      <P>I note that the housing programme has regard for environmental issues.  In Dublin city in-fill sites will be used.  Areas which have degenerated will be rehabilitated and green areas will remain free from interference.  I welcome this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants have been made available to disabled persons and to voluntary organisations. In my area, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has received money to build flats for the elderly in Cavan town. It is something which has not previously happened and it is cost effective.  The shared ownership scheme provides people with a means whereby they may own their own home.  Given our historical experience of the landlord system, it is <Col N="872" /> important that we own our homes.  I am glad that the Government seeks to facilitate people who wish to do so.  From a practical point of view, this scheme works well in my area.</P>
    <P>It pleases me to receive letters from the Department of the Environment announcing the initiation of remedial works in a number of areas.  I refer to Eoghan Roe Terrace in Cavan town, where repair work was badly needed. Recently we received a letter saying that work is going out to tender and I thank the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's work has been wide-ranging and comprehensive, not only in the area of public housing.  Those wishing to purchase houses have also been facilitated.  I refer to the first-time buyer's grant which has been increased to £3,000 and the stamp duty exemption on new houses.  It relieves those on low incomes of initial expenditure and it enables people to obtain a reasonable mortgage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the plans to complete the charter of tenants rights.  As a tenant during my student years, I was aware that I did not have many rights.  We must ensure that tenants are given certain basic rights and information.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a section dealing with the needs of the homeless and that issue has been addressed by the provision of grants.  In Castleblayney, County Monaghan, a voluntary group is building flats for the homeless.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has impressed upon the elected members and officials of local authorities the importance this Government places on the successful completion of the housing measures contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I am advised that he will carry out a review of the progress of each local authority and the prospects for achieving the authorised number of starts for 1993.  Each local authority must respond in a positive way to these measures.</P>
    <P>Given the Minister of State's commitment to the housing programme, we will at last see a reduction in waiting lists. <Col N="873" /> People continue to live in poor conditions but there is light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House and I congratulate the Minister of State on his excellent work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this House for the first time.  The motion refers to the Government's achievements in responding effectively to housing needs across a wide range of areas, including the local authority and voluntary housing programmes, the plan for social housing and the remedial works scheme in order to improve the living conditions of local authority tenants.</P>
      <P>The additional resources which the Government has provided for housing across a wide range of initiatives is a remarkable achievement.  The Government has, for example, committed sufficient resources to increase the number of local authority housing starts from the authorised 1,000 in 1992 to the authorised 3,500 this year.  This is a considerable achievement, but it is just the beginning. We now must ensure that the 3,500 starts are achieved in 1993.</P>
      <P>I am continually impressing upon local authorities that if they fail to commence the authorised number of starts this year, they will not be allowed carry them forward to 1994.  Some local authorities were carrying forward up to 50 per cent of the authorised number of starts from one year to the next.  This year they must build or lose the authorisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the overall context in which housing policy will be framed over the next four years and, I hope, into the next century.  The Programme for a Partnership Government sets out the high priority that will be afforded to housing and the Government's commitment to increase the level of response to social housing needs.  The programme commits the Government to reducing the pressure <Col N="874" /> on local authority waiting lists by speeding up the implementation of the various aspects of the social housing plan and making substantial provision for new local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The social housing plan recognises the need for a range of responses to tackle appropriately the wide range of housing needs and to give low income households, for the first time, a range of housing choices.  The measures in the plan were designed to encourage and assist people, as individuals or working together in groups, to help themselves. Some of these measures have been successful. Over 2,000 applicants have been approved in principle under the shared ownership scheme.  In the first three months of this year 700 applicants were received for the shared ownership scheme, a scheme which only two years ago was novel to this country.</P>
    <P>The social housing plan is a radical departure in Irish social housing.  As the motion acknowledges, much has been achieved under the plan, but we must ensure that the various schemes operate to their full potential in halting and reversing the numbers on the waiting list. The measures contained in the plan are being reviewed to ensure that they make the maximum contribution to meeting social housing needs.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, both parties to the Programme for a Partnership Government, recognising the serious housing need situation, agreed to jump the local authority housing programme from an authorised 1,000 new starts to 3,500 in this year.  This represents an unprecedented expansion of a large construction progrmme in one year and is a major challenge to local authorities, to me and my Department.  One of the Government's achievements in the housing area this year is that every county council, borough corporation and district council in the country received an allocation of new starts.  I hope every local authority will achieve their allocated numbers of starts, and if it is necessary for starts to be reallocated between authorities to ensure that overall targets are achieved, I will not hesitate to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> Preliminary indications for the March 1993 assessment of needs suggest that the number of households on the waiting list has risen significantly since the March 1991 assessment.  In March 1991, 23,400 households were approved for inclusion on local authority waiting lists.  I am on record as saying that the numbers on the waiting lists may well now be of the order of 30,000 households and the returns to date support this view.  However, I am concerned that returns are still outstanding from a number of local authorities. My Department is now endeavouring to ensure that this vital information for the planning of the overall social household programme is obtained from each local authority without further delay.  The Programme for a Partnership Government clearly recognises that our total response to social housing needs comprises both the traditional local authority housing programme and the range of measures in the plan for social housing.  Taking account of output from all sources, the housing needs of up to 7,000 households will be catered for in 1993.  By 1994, when the measures announced in the programme are fully on stream, I hope we will meet the needs of over 9,000 families per year.</P>
    <P>In the massive three and a half-fold expansion this year of the local authority housing programme, we must take care to avoid the mistakes associated with crash programmes in the past.  We have seen the great social and economic costs of the low cost housing projects in the early 1970s.  Last week, I visited the north side of Cork city, where many millions have now to be spent under the Remedial Works Programme to remedy the experiments with low pitched roofs, prefabricated wall panels and poor insulation standards.  The standard of local authority housing we are now providing is greatly improved compared to that, but a high standard of individual dwelling does not necessarily guarantee that the overall estate will be an acceptable or desirable place to live, or to raise a family.  We all know of estates of high quality and well finished local authority <Col N="876" /> housing, but factors such as scale, location and remoteness of the estate from other vital community supports can all combine to produce a problem estate.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to expand the Local Authority Housing Programme.  We must, in addition, work consistently to integrate as far as possible, local authority, voluntary and private housing and to integrate all housing with existing community facilities and supports.  The Programme for a Partnership Government specifically states that, in the expansion of the local authority housing programme, there will be a special emphasis on in-fill housing developments and on avoiding the building of new large green field estates on green field sites.  Even our small rural towns and villages can experience the phenomenon of growth at the edges and decay in the centre.  The expanded programme presents local authorities with a great opportunity to reintegrate local authority housing back into the hearts of our towns and villages and at the same time, to tackle the problem of decaying and under-utilised land and sites, which are sadly a feature of many of our towns and villages.  New local authority housing can, and should, also play a vital role in the maintenance of smaller rural communities and assist the viability of local shops and schools. Our housing should also reflect the changes in society and therefore, the make up of our needs list.  A variety of housing should therefore, be provided to reflect the various needs of families on the waiting lists of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The terms of a new tenant purchase scheme will be circulated to local authorities in the next fortnight.  The scheme will differ from previous ones in a number of key ways.  First, the scheme will not involve a closing date.  The arrangements for the scheme have been designed to ensure that the option of tenant purchase will be available to tenants on a continuing basis.  Tenants should be informed that there will be no need to rush in an application and they may, in their own time, decide when they are able to undertake home ownership.  The basis of financing the new scheme will be <Col N="877" /> designed to ensure that the proceeds of the sales of dwellings to tenants are immediately available to local authorities for reinvestment in their housing programme and will not, as in the past, accrue as a flow of income over a period of up to thirty years.  A conscious effort has, therefore, been made to strike a fair balance between the interests of existing tenants wishing to own their own homes, and the needs of those on the waiting lists currently waiting for decent housing.</P>
    <P>Disabled persons and essential repairs grants have been referred to and they play an important role in improving the housing conditions of key disadvantaged groups in Irish society.  The levels of these grants are set by reference to the level of recoupment available from my Department to local authorities.  I am pleased, therefore, to approve significant increases in the level of recoupment by my Department of local authority expenditure under these schemes.  The maximum recoupment under the disabled person's grant has been increased from £2,500 to £4,000, for works commenced after March 1, 1993.  On the essential repairs scheme, which is available in county council areas, the maximum recoupment is being increased from £600 to £900, with effect from the same date.  The Department's recoupment, in any case, is set at 50 per cent of the grant expenditure by the local authority, subject to the limits I have referred to.  Local authorities will, therefore, increase their maximum grants to at least £8,000, in the case of disabled persons' grants, and at least £1,800, in the case of the essential repairs grant.  The significant improvements in the terms of disabled persons' and essential repairs grants represent another positive achievement in the housing area and should be widely welcomed as such.</P>
    <P>Since the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme was first introduced in 1984, voluntary housing organisations have been extremely active in meeting special category housing needs, such as those of the elderly and more recently, the homeless. There was however, a need to harness the voluntary housing effort <Col N="878" /> to meet the more general housing needs represented on local authority waiting lists.  The rental subsidy scheme was specifically introduced to assist and encourage the voluntary sector to provide for the needs of family-type households. I am glad to say the level of activity under this scheme is extremely encouraging and many of these schemes have now been successfully provided in cooperation with local authorities throughout the country.  At present, seven rental subsidy scheme projects, involving 133 dwellings, are in progress, and a further 36 projects involving over 680 dwellings are planned.  Between both schemes, I expect voluntary housing organisations to provide some 700 additional dwellings in 1993, which by any standard is a significant and welcome addition to our response to social housing needs.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary gap between the widespread welcome for the improvements works in lieu scheme and the clear lack of progress in getting projects under way in many local authorities.  It makes sense to me if someone's existing accommodation can be made suitable to their needs at less cost than providing them with a local authority house, that we should try to adapt and improve their existing accommodation.  Last year's Housing Act provided for a relatively simple charging order arrangement, which makes it easier for local authorities to deal with cases under this scheme. Although there has been some increase in activity recently, progress to date under this scheme must still be regarded as disappointing.  I am taking account of suggestions made by local authorities, in the context of the review of the measures in the plan, with a view to securing greater levels of activity under this scheme.</P>
    <P>The sale of sites scheme is an important element in the overall thrust of the measures in the plan.  Indeed, the provision of housing sites on favourable terms by local authorities can help to bring other measures into action, such as the Rental Subsidy Scheme or share ownership housing.  Local authorities should re-examine the scope for greater <Col N="879" /> use of this scheme in their own areas and if suitable land is not already in the ownership of the local authorities, they should consider acquiring some for the purpose of this scheme.  I will be having regard to how local authorities operate this and the other schemes in the plan for social housing when the time comes to make the 1994 allocations for new starts.</P>
    <P>Despite considerable progress over recent years on upgrading substandard local authority dwellings, many tenants are still living in unacceptable housing conditions.  Since the introduction of the remedial work scheme in 1984, almost £100 million has been allocated by my Department for the modernisation and upgrading of older substandard local authority housing and the more recently provided low cost housing of the 1960s and 1970s.  The experience of these estates and the costs involved, both social and economic, remain an object lesson for us on the need to ensure that any major expansion of local authority house building is carried out to high standards and within a properly planned framework. The 1993 provision for remedial works is, in fact, the highest ever at £17.2 million.</P>
    <P>Apart from the remedial works scheme, the Government are conscious of the need to directly target those local authority dwellings which, though structurally sound, lack bathroom facilities and the Programme for a Partnership Government emphasises the need for greater progress in this area.  Again the Programme for a Partnership Government emphasised the need for greater progress in this area and resources for it have been increased in 1993 to £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office I have made, and will continue to make, major efforts to bring about real and lasting improvements in the area of local authority housing management and maintenance.  The present situation is unsatisfactory and local authorities must develop new systems of management and maintenance and provide better value for the £80 million spent each year on these services.  I <Col N="880" /> want to make it very clear that I am opposed to the privatisation of local services, including the management and maintenance of local authority housing but I am determined that services must be organised in such a way that the management systems employed do not account for the lion's share of the finances available.  The management systems now in place are not effective, are wasteful of the resources available and must be replaced by cost effective systems that give value for money and a better service to the tenants who provide most of the finance for the services in the first place.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of certain restrictive practices operated by trade union members that have developed over the years and these also have to end.  In a recent meeting with the local authorities craft group of unions, I was very pleased by the positive attitude of the representatives and their willingness to meet the challenge of the required changes.  It must be clearly stated however that if all restrictive practices were to end immediately no great change would occur unless efficient management systems were put in place at the same time.  Management and unions therefore need to act together to ensure effective change is put in place and thereby eliminate the otherwise inevitability of private contract work.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved in the relatively short time since the Government took office.  The housing prospects of many thousands of families have been transformed.  Much remains to be done and I give this House an assurance of my unstinting dedication to improving housing conditions throughout the country over the next four years.  Social housing needs will be comprehensibly analysed by my Department on the basis of results of the March assessment carried out by local authorities.  The measures in the plan are being reviewed to make them more effective having regard to the many helpful and positive suggestions made by public representatives, local authorities, voluntary organisations and other interests.  The local authority housing programme is being expanded dramatically.  Extra resources have been <Col N="881" /> provided for the voluntary housing sector for remedial work and for the bathroom sub-programme.  I am pleased therefore to commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House on his first visit and I wish him well in his area of responsibility.  This is a very important motion encompassing the local authority housing programme and various other matters which affect people applying for a house for the first time, seeking a transfer from the house they are in or seeking basic repairs to an older and run-down house.  The Minister's initial announcement of an increased allocation for house starts this year is to be welcomed.  The Minister would be the first to admit he is starting from a low base but it is a step in the right direction.  I appreciate the present Minister is only several months in office and that while some criticisms may be levelled at his Department he cannot be held personally responsible for all shortcomings. I hope he will consider some of my suggestions in relation to future progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that housing starts had reached a critically low level and while 3,500 start-ups is welcome it must be considered in the context of current housing needs.  I am aware of the situation pertaining to housing in Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation areas and how the housing lists there have escalated. The Dún Laoghaire Corporation housing committee April-May report shows the number of applicants for housing rose from 602 to 625 between February and March which emphasises the difficulties.  There are 625 people on the list in Dún Laoghaire and there is a total combined allocation of house starts for the Dublin area for this year of 500 for Dublin Corporation, 110 for the Dún Laoghaire area, 75 for Dublin-Fingal and 85 for Dublin South.  Those statistics demonstrate the difficulties of trying to tackle the problem.  There are many people seeking housing and we have to deal with the problem as best we can.  I appreciate we have to be realistic and I <Col N="882" /> am fully aware that funds are in short supply.</P>
    <P>The Minister must maintain this momentum for house starts over the coming years.  He made a pertinent point that houses should not be built just to fulfil the requirement; we must ensure the required infrastructure and facilities are provided.  We must give priority to well designed schemes that will rehabilitate run-down areas, reduce dereliction and achieve a good mix of house types and sizes.</P>
    <P>In older areas around Dublin city and county there is a good blend of established local authority areas and adjoining private housing.  We lost our way in recent years when we were concerned with increasing the number of houses only.  Standards dropped and the fact that people need shops, community centres, churches and other facilities was forgotten. I ask the Minister to avoid the pitfall of simply striving to have a target number of houses built.  We must aim at a target but with a more critical approach to area development.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his statement that at times local authorities have been slow to make progress after receiving a housing allocation.  Part of the problem in Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council is that schemes have been submitted to the Minister's Department over the years but approval took a long time.  Most of these schemes were submitted before the present Minister took office but perhaps he could tell the officials in the Department to try in future to get back to the authorities either with an answer or with further queries within a reasonable period.  Sanction may not be possible but at least projects will not be held up for lack of sufficient information.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of examples in Dún Laoghaire.  There is an urban renewal scheme in Mountwood and the housing officer's report two months ago stated that his proposal was sent to the Department for initial comment in February 1988.  A pilot scheme for one block, which was submitted by the consultant architect and presented to the members <Col N="883" /> at the January 1990 meeting, was forwarded to the Department for approval in February 1990.  Three years have elapsed and something seems to be delaying matters.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there was not much money available, but the danger is that money has been allocated but the Department has not been responding positively.  The proposals for the Fitzgerald Park project were sent to the Department for initial comment in March 1989.  I would ask the Minister of State to ensure that local authorities who submit schemes receive a positive response, as far as possible.  I appreciate that there are various schemes coming in from all parts of the country, that many aspects must be taken into account and that it is not just a rubber stamp process, but I think the Minister of State must have an in-depth look at progress in his Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tenant purchase scheme and I hope that it will be launched in the next couple of weeks.  It is better to avoid delays and red tape, and make the scheme as simple as possible.  I am glad that there is not a closing date because I have experience of people who considered purchasing and were delayed along the way.</P>
    <P>The other proposal which I welcome is the scheme to improve local authority estates.  In some areas there is old housing stock which needs refurbishment and renovation, and other places need smaller repairs.  Particular attention should be paid to the houses of older tenants.</P>
    <P>While we cannot support the motion in full, we wish the Minister of State well. I ask him to take into account what I have said about getting things done, ensuring that people get a better deal in the future and that we get a greater return for the money we are spending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, to the Seanad and congratulate him on his appointment.  He is obviously very determined and has very straightforward views on matters pertinent to housing.  I must also compliment <Col N="884" /> you, a Chathaoirligh, because you seem to be better at sums than Senator O'Toole.  I would have thought that given the profession which he represents, sums would be a very high priority for him but obviously they are not.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  I was impressed by the social housing measures which were put on the Statute Book.  It was important that these measures corresponded with new social structures.  I understand that in Dublin and in the larger cities, the type of application being received for rehousing had changed dramatically.  It was imperative that new structures were brought in to accommodate such applications.</P>
      <P>We have one of the highest rates of private home ownership in Europe, which is something of which we should be proud.  It would be fair to say that the standard of housing around the country is very high.  For the most part, people go to great lengths to keep their homes in good condition, which should be admired.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new tenant purchase scheme proposed by the Minister of State and the Department.  In recent times numerous resolutions have been passed at local authority level requesting such a measure.  I am not in favour of schemes which are aimed at moving local authority tenants from the area in which they have been living.  That can break up the structure of an area and develop a ghetto mentality.  We had such a scheme in the past and I do not think it is in our best interests.</P>
      <P>I hope that in the future a large part of local authority schemes will be in private ownership, giving a blend of private and public.  People will become conscious of the fact that it is their property and their responsibility to maintain it.  I welcome the fact that the scheme will not have a closing date.  People may not be in a position to buy their property now, but they may be able to do so in a year or two and that opportunity should be available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times, the question of disabled persons grants and essential repair grants has come up for debate at local <Col N="885" /> authority level and I welcome the increase.  In my local authority we do not confine the amount to £1,000, £1,600 or £2,000; we often spend up to £3,000, which must be paid out of our own resources.  We have developed that tradition over the year and it is very important. It saves the Government money in that if we did not maintain an elderly person's house the responsibility for housing them would fall to the Department. I favour reasonable flexibility in any scheme where spending £1,000 or £2,000 may save the Department up to £20,000.  County managers and housing officers in some counties are very conscious of what can be done.  I would like these people to be given as much leeway as possible to implement such schemes to the benefit of everybody.</P>
    <P>There is a poor response to the new scheme for upgrading property.  The interest rate on the loan for refurbishment is so low that it could almost be termed a grant.  Through this scheme a house can be refurbished for £10,000, which is provided by the local council if it has sufficient funds.  If additional funding is required the council can apply to the Department of the Environment.  A house can be refurbished for up to £15,000.  As a result the family has suitable housing in the area where they live and there is a saving for the Department and the taxpayer of up to £20,000.  Such schemes are important and are flexibly structured.  Perhaps the Minister would encourage wider participation in the scheme by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I support the shared ownership scheme, although many people oppose it on the grounds that there is only a limited opportunity for the occupier to own the house in the future.  That aspect is not important.  What is important is the fact that the person can take pride in having 50 per cent ownership of the property. The housing officers in local authorities should be told to promote this scheme among people on their housing lists.</P>
    <P>Some county plans envisage moving people, where possible, from rural cottages into villages.  That is not the best <Col N="886" /> interest of rural areas.  People are being removed from areas where close relatives, such as parents or sons or daughters, live.  In addition children may be removed from the local national school which may result, eventually, in the school losing a teacher or closing down. There are many disadvantages in such a policy.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to emphasise a local authority officials that rural areas must not be denuded of their populations. Rural areas must be supported by providing cottages and other dwellings and by maintaining the structures and fabric of the community.  We have a responsibility to those areas.  There is no point in talking about regionalisation in the context of Europe if we do not practise it in our own country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of this importnat motion.  The Government's programme for housing is a good one and will result in great improvements.  I hope the necessary funds will be available to implement the programme.  As local representatives, we have responsibility for many matters but I have always considered it a priority that housing be provided by the local authorities for those who need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is most important as there appears to be an impression that the housing problem in Ireland has been solved.  I am glad that this Government has recognised and is attempting to solve the serious problems we have with regard to housing and the homeless.</P>
      <P>I view the matter in the light of its impact on health.  Many people who have attended my clinics over the years would not have been obliged to attend if they had lived in better housing conditions. Housing is an extremely important factor in public health.  Housing does not simply mean providing adequate sanitation, shelter, lighting and heating; it also means providing properly organised and developed housing schemes.  I am pleased that the Minister has a commitment to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The World Health Organisation describes health as a positive feeling of <Col N="887" /> physical and mental wellbeing.  How can one have a positive feeling of good health if one lives in an area where one feels terrorised and insecure or where the condition of housing stock has deteriorated below what would be considered the norm?  These problems impinge on the health of everyone and I am glad that problems which were getting out of control are now being tackled.</P>
    <P>Enormous savings can be made by improving housing schemes and the condition of houses.  One of the first lessons taught to junior doctors when discharging a patient from hospital is the importance of the patient's housing conditions.  If they are good the child is allowed home with the parents; if they are bad the child is kept in hospital for another week.  The same policy applies to adult patients.  If the doctor is aware that patients, particularly elderly patients, are returning to an area where they feel vulnerable, the patients will be kept in hospital for a longer period.  I cannot over-stress the fact that improvements in housing will be cost effective in numerous ways.  This is also an important consideration when treating patients in an outpatient clinic in hospital.  One cannot have people attending the hospital, receiving treatment and being sent home to appalling housing conditions.  As a result people remain in hospital although they need not be there. The Minister could make that point to the Minister for Finance when he seeks funding for his housing proposals.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss housing schemes for the elderly.  The elderly are often seen as a marginal group but this is the fastest growing group in this country.  We should be very considerate of them as we would hope to be members of that group some day.  Any proposed housing schemes must include the elderly; they cannot be left in isolation.  We talk about the importance of the extended family for the young but it is possibly more important for the elderly.  As many of the elderly are immobile, their health will deteriorate rapidly if they live where there is no contact with their family, friends and a small community.  This is well known.  It <Col N="888" /> also causes great expense if they have to be admitted to, for example, a nursing home ten years earlier than would be the case if they had the necessary support and care within their homes.  Not only can admission to nursing homes have a terrible social impact on the elderly but it is also well known that when they do not have the mental stimulation of dealing with the ESB bill, the gas bill and the other annoyances of life their health rapidly deteriorates.  It is desperately important to keep the elderly in their own homes.  Housing for the elderly should be built within their own communities or in new areas where they will be in contact with their families and friends.</P>
    <P>There are other matters of importance to the people who live in housing schemes &mdash; lighting, gardaí, bus and other services. Housing authority schemes do not stand on their own.  We hear much talk about infrastructure and the Structural Funds.  Perhaps the Minister could acquire some of those funds to pay for lighting and gardaí.  Ramps to prevent joyriding in housing schemes would also be useful.</P>
    <P>It is important that we build schemes that people want and not schemes we consider suitable.  We should talk to the people who will live in those schemes and find out what they want.  There is not enough customer consultation when housing schemes are set up.  I have visited people in major housing schemes around Dublin who were desolate because they were sent to certain areas.  I understood their feelings when I saw where they were living.  Schemes were built near Lucan ten or 15 years ago and women had to walk miles to and from the shops, often carrying heavy shopping bags because no bus service was provided.  There are schemes in this city which have what amount to motorways running through them.  It is impossible to control joyriding on those roads.  No private developer would such build roads through a housing estate.  It is most important that the Minister consult with those who will live in the schemes he builds.</P>
    <P>There are other small sectors of the community who also need to be convidia <Col N="889" /> sidered.  I found the Mespil flats incident interesting.  Many of those flats were occupied by single people, especially single women, who had retired from what seemed like very good jobs but they were not in a position to buy a home of their own.  We should provide houses for such people.  It is everybody's ambition to own their own home, particularly in this country where home ownership is so high.  I would like to think we will take account of people who may be in special positions and try to accommodate them.  Versatility is the most important aspect of all the Minister's schemes, and I recommend all he is doing and he should be given every penny he needs by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach seo.  I congratulate him on the good news &mdash; that the number of authorised housing starts has increased from 1,000 to 3,500, a significant increase, and it should be welcomed by all of us.  The Minister said that administration was slow in some places.  If councils were allocated a certain amount of money and told to make the best use of it, I believe it would cut out a lot of administration costs.  A lot of the delay in administration occurs when the council is waiting for departmental sanction of a scheme.  If the council were given more authority we could cut out a lot of unnecessary administration. Council engineers are as good as the engineers employed by the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the joint ownership scheme. This scheme is very good and it has been under-sold.  Some solicitors say that if you sell a house through the joint ownership scheme, the local authority is very slow to grant the loan.  I do not know if that is true, but I would like the Minister to look into it, because there is no reason a purchaser who gets a loan under the joint ownership scheme should wait longer than they would have to for an ordinary local authority loan.  It is very important for people to know that one day they will own their own house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor, now Commissioner <Col N="890" /> Flynn, started the last purchase scheme and encouraged people to buy their houses by selling them at a very reasonable rate.  When people buy their own houses, they put their stamp on the house; the gardens are tended and the occupants become more environmentally friendly.  It is easy to pick out the house that is rented because usually the garden is neglected.  However, where the house has been bought, the garden is tended and the lawn is cut because the owner lives in that house.  Every Irish man and woman would love to own their own home.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister's new purchase scheme will be open, because, in some cases, by the time people have calculated how much it would cost them to buy their own home, and have decided to apply for a loan, they have missed the closing date.  I would like to see a scheme where people could buy at any time.</P>
    <P>Sligo County Council started a pilot scheme where people bought paint and painted their own houses and the council reduced the rent to help pay for the work done.  It worked out very cheaply for both the council and the tenants and everybody was happy.  We have many problems dealing with housing repairs.  If the council let tenants make the repairs and reduced the rent to pay for the work, the time it takes to repair houses would be reduced and people would be encouraged to do some of the repairs themselves.  We should encourage self-help.  If you can get people to do something for themselves, they will work longer because they have an interest in what they are doing.  The people working in the local authorities keep to the letter of the law.  Each job takes a long time because the men have to go to the stores to get the materials they will need.  They have to account for all the materials used and more time is spent keeping accounts than doing the job.  However, if a contractor did the same job, he would buy the materials and get the men working on it.  Local authorities spend too much time on keeping accounts.  I know it has to be done, but the system is wrong.  We should let <Col N="891" /> people do the job themselves for an agreed figure, or contract these jobs out.</P>
    <P>I would not like local authorities to build low cost houses, as they have done in the past.  Many members of county councils opposed that move at the time, but the engineers and architects said it was the answer.  It was a rough and ready suggestion, anything to put a roof over people's heads and it proved very costly. Anyone with experience of building, as I had, knew those houses should never have been built.  A house should be a thing of beauty and a joy forever.  It should be well constructed.  The low cost, rough and ready attitude is not the answer.  In our county we give a grant of £1,500 under the local improvement scheme, which is very successful.  This scheme keeps people in their homes by paying for new roofs, new doors and windows, etc., in fact it will do everything possible to ensure homes are habitable for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities should be more flexible if a son or daughter wants to build a house on the home farm.  Often they are told they cannot build because they are living in a high amenity area or it will need an entrance to a national primary route.  If we want to keep the extended family together, we will have to relax these conditions.  We should keep communities together because if people are moved into villages and housing estates, or if a school or a shop is closed, the fabric of rural life will be spoiled.  People must be kept in the community.  It is a healthier, more wholesome and a happier place for them to live.  We should try our utmost to allow families who want to do so to build near the home farm.</P>
    <P>I welcome everything the Minister of State said in his speech.  I know housing is a major problem and with the Minister's progressive outlook, we will see an end to this problem in the near future.  I also welcome the fact that someone who wants to buy a private house can do so now with the assistance of a council loan.</P>
    <P>There are vested cottages lying derelict around the country which the councils cannot take back.  Their owners are not <Col N="892" /> interested in them, but they are good stone structures which could be made into nice houses had local authorities power to buy them back.  I would love those houses to be occupied by families again as they were in the past.</P>
    <P>Congratulations again to the Minister of State on his progressive outlook; I have no doubt he will put an end to the housing crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important matter, because I have been, not just speaking but howling about housing in North Cork.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.</P>
      <P>If I were in the Minister of State's shoes I would be a worried man because there is &mdash; and the sooner the Government faces up to it the better &mdash; a serious national housing crisis.  Senator Henry referred to the medical aspect of it; I will refer to the overcrowding which causes marriages to breakdown &mdash; I have seen this in my own area.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State allocated £104.93 million for housing for this year, 1993.  In 1984 the allocation was £206.9 million. How can the Government boast about providing £105 million in 1993?  In the same year, 1984, there were 101 local authority houses built in the area of north Cork I represent &mdash; that is in the Mallow and Kanturk electoral areas alone.  In 1993 there will be eight houses built there.  There is a population of 73,000 people in north Cork &mdash; as many as in County Limerick.</P>
      <P>The report for the end of April 1993, says ten schemes are with the Department. What of the devolved housing we were told about some years ago?  These schemes consist of 47 houses the tenders for which have been accepted but which have gone back to and are still with the Department.  There will only be eight houses finished in North Cork in 1993. There will be new starts, but those houses will come under the programme for 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise again that overcrowding and insecurity of tenure is causing major problems for families and even family <Col N="893" /> breakdown.  I am surprised and disappointed that the Minister of State has not &mdash; I thought it would be the first thing he would do &mdash; introduced a home improvments grant.  The Minister of State referred to the grants for physically and mentally disabled people.  I suggest if the Minister of State introduces a home improvement grant he will find that many people on the housing list, especially single parents, could build an extension on to their family homes providing adequate accommodation for themselves and enabling them to continue living with elderly relatives.</P>
    <P>A home improvement grant is urgently needed because the special housing aid for the elderly scheme is not meeting their needs.  It is meeting some of their needs in so far as windows and doors can be provided.  Yet, some of those people who get aid can still see the stars in the wintertime through their roofs.  The housing aid for the elderly scheme will not provide the finance needed by people to improve their homes.  The social housing programme is not the great success in my area, at least, that it is purported to be in other areas.</P>
    <P>On the question of the tenant purchase scheme the fact that 60 per cent of the proceeds are used for capital works must be changed and the Minister of State could do this.  In 1993 £39 million of the capital allocation for housing will come from house purchases from local authorities. That should not be the case; the Minister of State should provide the capital from central funds and allow local authorities more flexibility.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister of State has not seen fit to increase the special grant to physically and mentally disabled persons to 100 per cent.  The Minister of State spoke very well on this matter previously and on the homeless.</P>
    <P>If someone who has no bathroom, toilet or shower goes to a local authority, and is assessed as in need on the basis of a medical report presented, they are then told they can only be given &mdash; by regulation &mdash; two thirds of the money required.  That is the truth.  If £6,000 is the overall cost only two thirds of that <Col N="894" /> can be provided.  In many instances one has to go to the health board to make up the difference &mdash; the balance is taken from the special housing aid for the elderly which is a very small fund that has to be spread over a large number of cases. If the health board cannot make up the shortfall the work is not carried out.</P>
    <P>We have 550 people in north Cork without piped water and there is no grant available to any of them to install piped water or to sink a pump.  Of course, those in the agricultural community can get grants to sink pumps.  Such grants have been provided when group schemes would have solved the problem had there been co-operation.  Since 1986 the figure has altered only slightly; there are still around 550 people in north Cork &mdash; and that is only one division of Cork county &mdash; without piped water.  Such a situation in this day and age is pathetic.</P>
    <P>When the Department is allocating funds for physically or mentally disabled persons certified by the local or county medical officer, it is outrageous to give the same grant to the wealthiest person in townland or town as to the poorest person.  I have seen it happen.  Two weeks ago a person with a large farm received the two-thirds grant.  The remaining one third was no problem to that person.  It was, however, a problem to a woman crippled by arthritis who went to the health board for the grant.  The difference was £2,000 and all she could get was £800. She had to say that she just could not do it.  That is the pathetic picture that I have to paint for the Minister.  I am not exaggerating.</P>
    <P>On the question of travelling families the Department's attitude is to give a 100 per cent grant for whatever is proposed and then there is no financial loss to the local authority.  It is going to take more than that.  It is not right that people are being deprived and little children are going to school out of filthy caravans.  We have experience of it at the moment in a couple of areas of north Cork and it is a disgrace.  Something else will have to be done.  The Minister says it is matter for the elected members.  Relying on the elected members of the local authorities <Col N="895" /> will not solve the problem.  I appeal to the Minister to be radical in his approach to the provision of housing, housing improvement grants and piped water for those that do not have it.  If the Minister decides to put an income limit on those applying for the grants, nobody will say a word to him for that.  We must make improvement in situations where people cannot afford to do it.</P>

      <P>Housing is not an area where this Government could come under legitimate attack.  It has been one of the great achievements of the Programme for a Partnership Government that the Government has begun to reverse the trend of cutting the capital programme which became evident over the last number of years.  That was the easy way out.  Governments could get away with it because the problem was downstream and the political fallout would not reach them if they ran fast enough.  By the time the truth was known they were not around to deal with it.  That has been happening down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has decided to address the problem as we addressed it in the past.  Mr. Tully, when Minister for Local Government, was one of those Ministers who prioritised housing.  He got the backing of his Government and built a record number of houses in this State. More importantly, he built houses of <Col N="896" /> decent quality.  Let us have no more Ballymuns and no more NBA fixes.  He built houses in which people could actually live.  I believe that under the direction of the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, standard and pace will be maintained. This is about getting the job done and there is no better Minister of State to keep this programme going.  We were heading back into a situation where sons and daughters were getting married and becoming part of the extended family living in the one house.  This is a situation which I thought we had moved away from in the late 1950s and 1960s.  Suddenly, Mary is getting married and Johnny is moving in with the mother and this creates many social problems.  The programme will alleviate that problem in a real way.  I wish the programme well.</P>
    <P>Too much of Irish politics is about opposition for opposition's sake.  This is a good programme and the money has been provided.  It should be welcomed on all sides because it will affect people in every constituency, including Senator Sherlock's constituency.  It will provide houses for newly weds and for people in substandard accommodation and will also make extra provision for people who are living in hostel accommodation. Nobody liked the opening of an Army barracks to accommodate the homeless of Dublin but it was better than leaving them on the streets.  It is not enough to talk about problems; one must respond and do something about them.  The reality now is that sufficient money is being provided in traditional hostel accommodation to obviate the need for an emergency Army response.  That response was attacked at the time.  There was much sneering at the Taoiseach asking the Army to take charge of this emergency operation.  The substantial number of people who used the accommodation were obviously grateful and they were not sneering.  The people who were sneering went home to their comfortable beds.  As Churchill used to say, it is a wonderful position from which to conduct a war.</P>
    <P>At the end of this Government's term in office, there will not just be 3,500 more <Col N="897" /> houses.  This is a rolling programme to last throughout the lifetime of the Government.  If we do not solve the housing problem in Ireland, we will certainly go a long way towards alleviating housing needs.  Shelter is the most basic need after food.  I have every confidence that when the Minister leaves his Department, he will share the limelight with Jimmy Tully in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Magner for sharing his time with me.  In Ireland, most people wish to own their own home and that wish should be supported. For that reason I welcome the shared ownership scheme, the new tenant purchase scheme and increased grants for first-time buyers.  It is the responsibility of the Government and the local authorities to provide for those people who cannot provide housing for themselves.  I welcome the 300 per cent increase in the provision for local authority housing.  This Government intends to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.</P>
      <P>There was a huge housing problem in Dublin in the mid-1970s.  The response of the Government of the day was a house building programme which moved large numbers of people from the inner city to the western suburbs.  The programme satisfied their immediate need for shelter. In the mid-1980s the £5,000 surrender grant was introduced.  The reality was that we depopulated the local authority housing estates of those who were working. In the early 1980s, there were housing estates in west county Dublin with 60 and 70 per cent unemployment.  That is still the case.  We solved an immediate crisis in housing needs but we created unprecedented social problems.  For the first time ever, a task force on urban crime was set up in the Clondalkin area. This was a direct response to bad housing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority response to any housing problem is to build three-bedroomed, semi-detached or terraced houses on green field sites.  That is not <Col N="898" /> the solution to the housing problem of which I have had experience since I was elected in 1985, and neither is it the solution to the problem of those on housing waiting lists.  My experience in Dublin County Council is that the profile of people on housing waiting lists has completely changed even since the early 1970s.</P>
    <P>Approximately 80 per cent of people on the waiting list in the area I represent are single parent applicants with one child.  If we accepted the suggestions made by some Senators on the other side of the House, we would continue to build more and more three-bedroomed houses and put single parents in them.  These are the kind of people who came to my clinics six months ago and all they wanted was a house.  They now have a house which they cannot furnish or heat, and in which they feel completely isolated.  Part of the plan for social housing provides for a £5,000 grant to build an extension to the family home.  It has not been utilised and that poses a different problem.  Mothers and fathers seem to be saying to their children, once they have their own children, that they are no longer part of that family, and the extended family seems to be disappearing completely.</P>
    <P>There is a need for sheltered housing, and the co-op housing agencies are addressing that need.  The Minister of State has responded favourably to any housing co-op that has applied for finance, and I hope he will continue to do so.  There are no simple solutions to housing.  If someone does not have a roof over their head, the automatic response seems to be that the local authority should provide one.  The plan for social housing is a recognition of the need to increase the house building programme. I welcome the fact that this is being done. We also need to do other things, however.</P>
    <P>I met the Minister recently and was severely critical of the fact that we have not got enough money to commence house starts, as they are called.  The Minister very astutely brought to my attention the fact that the local authority which I represent was given authorisation for 91 <Col N="899" /> house starts in 1992.  I was criticising the Government for the fact that we had been given 300 house starts in 1993 and that it was not enough.  He drew to my attention the fact that my local authority has built only two of those 91 houses.  We have to accept some criticism ourselves.</P>
    <P>Housing is a complex area, embracing all aspects of life.  The plan for social housing recognises that we do not only have a responsibility to put bricks and mortar together but we also have a responsibility to build communities.  I believe that is what the plan for social housing will accomplish.</P>

      <P>Senator Sherlock mentioned the amount of money that was allocated in the 1970s and early 1980s for house building. I remember it well because I was then chairman of Dublin Corporation's housing committee and 1,700 houses a year were being built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We were building houses both in the inner city and in the suburbs.  At that time, people with large families were rehoused from flats into new houses in the inner city.  The flats then went to a husband and wife with one child.  No houses have been built over the last five or six years and the families in the flats have three or four children, or more in some cases.  Recent figures from Dublin Corporation show that there is covercrowding in 3,000 flats in the inner city, and that 1,000 flat have serious overcrowding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always argued that there should be an on-going programme for building local authority houses.  The Lord Mayor's commission on housing recently rejected that proposition, but I support it.  I am pleased that the Minister of State agrees <Col N="900" /> and that he is making money available this year for a house building programme. I do not expect a programme such as we had in the 1970s and 1980s but a number of houses should be built and added on to the housing stock each year to relieve overcrowding in flats.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see more houses being built for senior citizens.  Those dwellings are much appreciated by elderly people.  A number of people now living in Mespil flats would like to obtain senior citizens' housing from the local authority and I do not think the fact that they already have accommodation should be held against them.  The crucial issue is that they do not now have the means to pay for that accommodation.</P>
    <P>The shared ownership scheme is a good one, and offers the solution to a number of housing problems.  The Minister of State should ask his officials to remove some of the restrictions attached to it and encourage local authority officials to promote the scheme.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Sherlock that local authorities should be allowed to hold onto some of the money they are obliged to give back to central Government when they sell houses.  Local authorities should have that kind of funding for refurbishing their housing stock.  There is a refurbishment programme in Dublin at present for some blocks of flats, but unfortunately there are many other blocks that require refurbished roofs, plumbing and windows. If the repairs were undertaken now the flats would not be such a liability in ten years' time when the work will cost three times as much under the general refurbishment programme.  I would ask the Minister of State to make that kind of money available to local authorities to carry out a minor programme of necessary refurbishment.  I hope that the ongoing housing programme both for senior citizens and in general will help to alleviate the housing problem in the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Doyle for sharing his time with me.  We met the Minister of State at Cork Corporation last Thursday and had a frank discussion. Cork Corporation has 1,300 applicants <Col N="901" /> for housing while only 125 houses are being built.  Unlike other authorities, we will build as fast as we can, but I do not think the 125 houses will be finished this year.  We must not give the impression that, because there are 3,500 housing starts this year, the problem is being solved.  The Minister of State readily admitted that it will take time to solve, and certainly more than four years, unless he gets extra allocations from the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I was disturbed by the Minister of State's figures for March 1991 showing 944 applicants on Cork Corporation's housing list.  The figures I obtained from officials for the December 1990 period, showed 1,140 applicants, 324 of whom were on the waiting list.  I am dumbfounded as to how the figure could be reduced to 944 in March 1991.  The Minister of State told me that if our figures were up we would have received an increase for housing.  It might not have been a marvellous increase, but at least we would have been building more homes.  I would like to have that point clarified.  The up to date, factual situation is that there are 1,300 applications on our housing list, involving an average of 3.5 people per application.  There are 700 further applicants waiting to be assessed and since 90 per cent of applicants are approved on average, that will mean 600 to 650 more.  That means we are talking about 2,000 applicants on Cork Corporation's housing list while we are building 125 houses.  Irrespective of who is in Government, that is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the establishment of a housing authority.  I do not believe in local authority housing. I believe in everyone being equal.  I am opposed to building massive local authority estates in green fields.</P>
      <P>I supported the £5,000 grant scheme. That scheme was, perhaps, too good, in that a very large number applied.  That is the sort of scheme we should introduce, instead of providing accommodation for people who, with a little help, could obtain it for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shared ownership scheme is excellent. People should be given the opportunity <Col N="902" /> to provide for themselves.  Under no circumstances in the future can we put unmarried mothers into three-bedroomed accommodation, as has been done in my city.  Mistakes have been made.  Now two-bedroomed accommodation is built and if a family increases extensions can be built on top of a kitchen.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said the problem will be solved by building 3,500 houses every year over the next four or five years. It is getting worse.  Every week Cork Corporation has 25 applicants.  That is 100 a month or 1,200 a year.  I do not believe in building 1,200 houses.  Something else must be done and ideas must be brought forward.</P>
    <P>Private landlords should not be made richer, as is being done.  The Minister cannot deny it.  He admitted to me last Thursday private landlords are raising rent because local authorities cannot accommodate these people.  Why should health boards hand out money?  Local authorities should be given power to assist people to accommodate themselves. The position would be much better then but the Government is not prepared to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to close this debate.  It has been positive and constructive and has been supportive of the Minister, Deputy Stagg.  All sides of the House have supported his housing plan for the next four years.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress that it is a four year plan.  It is not just a plan to build 3,500 houses this year.  The Minister hopes to house 9,000 people each year for the next four years under the plan for social housing, the house building programme and other schemes such as shared ownership.  That answers the concerns expressed by Senator Cregan in his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, 23,400 people were on the 1991 waiting list.  The figure for 1993 is probably much higher.  In my own local authority area in Limerick city the figures would have risen considerably. It is essential the problem be tackled and I congratulate the Minister <Col N="903" /> on the efficiency with which that is being done.  He has cut through the red tape by making the contact between the Department of the Environment and the local authorities more immediate and direct. Letters need no longer be sent between the two bodies and problems arising can be ironed out quickly.  That was obviously necessary.  Many speakers referred to the numbers of housing starts authorised at various times but never completed.  The bureaucracy had to be dealt with in order to approach the matter properly and build houses where they are needed.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis and others said the wrong kinds of houses had been built in the wrong places.  I concur with that.  The policy of the Minister and the Government is no longer to build large estates on green field sites.  The approach now is to build infills, much smaller schemes in cities, towns and the country.  These smaller schemes would add to the environment rather than building enormous housing estates in fields without any facilities and with many social problems. That mistake was made in the past.  The majority of housing starts in Limerick will be two-bedroomed accommodation because that meets the requirements of those on the waiting list.  Other speakers have said single parent families, smaller families, single people and elderly people outnumber larger families on the housing lists.  We are building according to need.</P>
    <P>I support what has been said about refurbishment.  It is important these schemes be pursued.  The Minister has seen the Watergate flat complex in my area which would have similar problems to the Dublin flats mentioned.  A refurbishment scheme has begun there and it is to be hoped it will continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister said £2.5 million was to be spent this year to put bathrooms in houses.  This is a basic necessity.  That scheme must go ahead and by the end of this four-year programme there should be no houses without bathrooms.  The increased funding for that is certainly welcome.</P>
    <P>The last building programme Senator Sherlock referred to was that in 1984.  He <Col N="904" /> neglected to mention that Governments in the past few years did not involve the Labour Party.  Since Labour joined Government there has been a large increase in the allocation to housing development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I wish to raise the introduction of fish cages off the coast of Achill, north of Blacksod.  Initially, there was an application for a licence to rear <Col N="907" /> 300,000 smolts but this was revised downwards to 30,000 smolts.  The Minister recently granted the licence despite the strong opposition of local organisations, Erris Tourism Organisation and the North-Western Fisheries Board.</P>
      <P>These are virgin waters.  The people of the area are very annoyed because the Owenwee river is probably one of the finest salmon rivers in the world and attracts fishermen from all parts of Europe.  The Erris area relies heavily on tourism and fishing, particularly trout and salmon fishing.  It would be a pity if the granting of a licence to rear smolts on the mouth of Blacksod Bay were in any way to endanger the livelihoods of people who are totally reliant on tourism in what is one of the most remote areas of the EC.  They would very much appreciate a visit by the Minister to see for himself its unspoilt waters.  Only a few years ago a major lice infestation destroyed other waters not far from the area.  Local people will fight all the way against the granting of this licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan) Gerry O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify the background to this particular proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that Clare Island Seafarm Limited, Cloghmore, Achill, County Mayo, applied in August 1992 for the licensing of a long term fallowing site at Annagh Bay, Achill Sound, County Mayo.  The proposed site would be used to locate the company's annual intake of smolts from March to October each year and is an integral part of the company's overall strategy to maintain its high quality of production and to minimise the risk of disease.  Fallowing techniques and the use of separate sites for each generation of fish are now internationally accepted fishfarm management strategies for improved husbandry and survival rates.  The scientific sea trout working group in its report published earlier this year recommended that following strategies should be encouraged as part of the efforts to <Col N="908" /> reduce and eliminate sea lice levels on salmon farms.</P>
    <P>An expert working group on fallowing was subsequently set up under the aegis of the Department to recommend on fallowing policy and guidelines for implementation of following proposals. The work of this group, which will report to the Minister shortly, will be complemented by regional assessments of concrete proposals for fallowing sites in specific locations in 1994 and beyond. This assessment process will bring together local fisheries interests, fishery boards and local fish farmers, as well as scientific and administrative personnel of the Department.  The objective is to ensure that each proposed fallowing site is assessed for its suitability from all relevant perspectives and that the consultative process takes full account of local factors and concerns.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this approach will be critical to the process of identifying and agreeing selected locations for fallowing sites, in other words, that the acknowledged consensus in relation to the principle of fallowing can be translated into consensus on practical implementation of that strategy at local level.</P>
    <P>I can advise the Senator that decisions in relation to the Annagh Bay fallowing proposal for 1994 and beyond will be contingent upon the findings of the fallowing group.  The proposal will also be assessed further as part of the localised process for agreeing fallowing sites, which I have outlined.  The company has been so advised as has the fishery board and other local interests.</P>
    <P>Implementation of a comprehensive fallowing strategy by Clare Island Seafarm is obviously dependent on identifying a suitable site at which to locate smolt intake for a portion of the year prior to transfer to the company's main production site for on growing.  As part, therefore, of the fallowing site assessment process, the company has sought permission to locate a single cage containing no more than 10,000 smolts at the site during the summer and autumn months of this year.  The practical experience <Col N="909" /> gained from this pilot project and the results of ongoing monitoring of performance on site could be used to inform the fallowing group's assessment of the longer term suitability of the site.</P>
    <P>The proposal for a small scale pilot project was considered by the Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee.  All aquaculture proposals are examined by the Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee &mdash; ALVC &mdash; a multi-disciplinary committee representing the scientific, technical and marine survey areas of the Department as well as the Central Fisheries Board.  The task of the committee includes the assessment of the potential effects of proposals on the water body and on the fish and shellfish life in the area on the basis of environmental data furnished.  The ALVC recommended in favour of granting permissions for a small scale pilot project over the coming months, subject to rigorous environmental and fish husbandry monitoring requirements.</P>
    <P>The company was subsequently advised that temporary permissions for the pilot project had been approved and would be subject to the following conditions: the permissions will expire on 30 November 1993, at which date the cage and any stock are to be removed from site; the permissions will be subject to ongoing water quality testing and monitoring of general performance at the site; independent monitoring of sea lice levels at the site will be undertaken by the Salmon Research Agency.  The parameters and frequency of monitoring will be laid down by the Department.  This monitoring will have particular regard to lice loadings at the site and in the event of unacceptable lice loadings occurring the cage and stock will be removed from the site; the cage and stock will be removed in the event of water quality results or general performance at the site not meeting with the conditions and standards set by the Department; and all instructions issued by the Department at any stage of the rearing trial must be complied with.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the contribution which aquaculture, both finfish <Col N="910" /> and shellfish husbandry, has made to local and national economies, particularly in the crucial area of job creation. At present, in excess of 2,600 people are directly employed in aquaculture.  This represents a five fold increase since 1982 and highlights the great potential for substantial jobs in this young industry.  In employment terms, this represents only part of the picture as many more employment opportunities are created in downstream activities such as processing, marketing, transport and services.</P>
    <P>The bulk of aquaculture operations are located on the west coast where there are few alternative sources of employment. The Clare Island operation is a particularly good example of the way in which aquaculture enterprise can contribute to the renewal of local communities.  In this context the House will appreciate the contribution Clare Island Seafarm is making in terms of jobs to the local economy of the island providing, as it does, full-time employment for up to 25 people.</P>
    <P>I would stress that neither the pilot project nor the longer term fallowing proposal involves any increase in the licensed level of production for the salmon farm operation.</P>
    <P>I would also stress that to date the permissions have not been issued, and no cage or smolts have been placed in Annagh Bay, pending the company's formal acceptance of the conditions and finalisation of the monitoring arrangements. A cage with no smolts in it is being placed in the bay to test the water type.</P>
    <P>I accept the Senator's invitation to visit that area.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the critical problem of accommodation in Limerick regional technical college.  The school of engineering is located in Moylish, County Limerick.  However, two other parts of the college, the School of Arts and Design and the School of Professional and Management Studies, are located in different areas.  Separate accommodation is needed for the School of Art and Design.</P>
      <P>I am talking specifically about the Moylish complex.  The intention is that the School of Professional and Management Studies will also be in the Moylish complex. The complex was designed for 510 students.  It was built in 1974 with World Bank funding.  It now has 1,309 full-time students, plus several hundred night students and 300 staff.  The accommodation is inadequate for the needs of the students and staff.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, saw the situation recently and is aware of the serious accommodation problems in the college.</P>
      <P>The only capital funding given to the college since it was built was for the recovering of the roof and phase 1 (A) of the building, which is due to be completed at the end of June 1993.  The purpose of raising this matter on the Adjournment is to highlight the need for immediate progress on the next phase of the building.  This would provide classroom accommodation because the phase which is being built at present is only providing library facilities and computer accommodation.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need for classroom accommodation.  Given the number of students at the college, the available accommodation represents only one third of the requirements set out by the Department of Education.  It has the worst accommodation problems of all the regional technical colleges.  Some of the accommodation is in second hand prefabricated buildings which were bought from Aughinish Alumina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> The total cost to implement the rest of the plan is £8 million.  The next phase, which would not cost £8 million, needs to be initiated.  Capital funding should be made available as soon as possible so that the college can proceed from phase 1 (A) to the next phase of building.</P>
    <P>The college has an excellent record.  It has won 17 City and Guilds first prize medals and numerous awards in the fashion design area, including the Satzenbrau Fashion Award for Party Wear and the Smirnoff Young Designer Award.  It has also won other awards from the Society of Designers in Ireland and The Royals Institute of the Architects of Ireland.  It is a college with a high reputation.</P>
    <P>The physical standard of the building is totally inadequate to meet the needs of staff and students.  Therefore, I urge that capital funding be made available as soon as possible.  The Minister for Education has said she is committed to this area of third level education.  The regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology &mdash; which accounts for 52 per cent of third level entry.  However, it has been under-funded in comparison to the universities in terms of both capital and revenue in the past.  There are more students from different socio-economic backgrounds in these colleges than in the universities.  I urge that funds be made available as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I support the case for Limerick regional technical college in Moylish Park.  Senator O'Sullivan, Senator R. Kiely and I visited the college last Monday.  I was there on a number of occasions in the past but I was amazed at the primitive conditions prevailing in the college.  In certain areas &mdash; the laboratories, for example &mdash; the conditions are not up to the standard in second level schools, never mind third level.  There is an urgent need to improve the facilities to bring the college near the level of other regional technical colleges.  It is the most neglected regional technical college in the country.  One of the reasons for that may have been that it was not given the <Col N="913" /> same attention as the others, despite representations over the years, because of the presence and growth of the university.</P>
      <P>The regional technical college has a special role in the region.  It complements the industrial development and there are now 700 to 800 adult students attending the college at night.  As Senator O'Sullivan said, the accommodation at Moylish Park was designed to cater for 510 students and now there are over 1,300 students in the complex.  It is unfair on the students and on the staff, and the Government should take the opportunity to correct the imbalance in the allocation of funds to the regional technical college. It has the opportunity to put in place a fantastic plan, which we saw last Monday, that would enhance the service and the facilities of the college and bring them up to the level of its sister colleges throughout the country.  I urge the Government to look seriously at this.</P>
      <P>This is a new Government with an opportunity to do something for this college which has needed this type of improvement for some years.  I think it was Mr. Paddy Lane, MEP, who said last Monday that sections of the college were not suitable accommodation for farm animals, never mind students.  There is all party support in the mid-west for the case for Moylish Park and I urge the Government to bring it in line with its sister regional technical colleges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Neville in urging the Minister for Education to allow the progress of phase 2 of this building plan.  As the other Senators mentioned, we visited the college last Monday and were amazed at the primitive conditions the staff and students have to work under.  There are prefabricated buildings which were bought second hand from Aughinish Alumina ten years ago; that is not good enough in this day and age.  In my profession, farming, if I want a licence to produce milk I would have to provide a higher standard of accommodation for the cows than the students and staff have in the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> Technological education is essential and it is important that colleges can offer their students and staff an appropriate quality of accommodation, equipment and support resources to ensure graduates meet the increasing standards and requirements of modern manufacturing and service industries.  The regional technical college in Limerick is in urgent need of funding.  It stands to reason, as Senator O'Sullivan mentioned, that a college which was designed for 510 students and now accommodates 1,309 students, must be bursting at the seams.  The various sections of the college are housed around the city and make it difficult to manage, control and co-ordinate the activities of all the students and teachers.</P>
    <P>The regional technical college in Limerick has been a renowned success.  It structure has grown through the expertise and enlightened guidance of its lecturers. I know the Minister has committed herself to the less well off in our society and it is not unknown to her that access to the college from the lower socio-economic groups is vital in Limerick.  The regional technical college plays a major role in educating and training young people from areas of high unemployment in Limerick. It is important, therefore, that for meaningful employment the work of the college should be continued, and I would urge that current applications for European Regional Development Fund funding, for example, would be a priority when Ireland's submission for funds goes to Europe.</P>
    <P>Of all the regional technical colleges, Limerick regional technical college has the worst standard of accommodation, and I urge the Minister &mdash; especially as the regional technical college is in the native city of the late Donagh O'Malley, who was concerned about educating the youth for whom the colleges are designed &mdash; to ensure that we have a college in Limerick on a par with other regional technical colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I apologise for the Minister of Education's <Col N="915" /> absence this evening.  Due to a previous engagement she cannot attend.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to be given the opportunity to report to the House on both the building programme which is in progress and on the future phases which are proposed at Limerick regional technical college. First, I would like to outline to the House some details with regard to the college.  The regional technical college, Limerick &mdash; previously the College of Art, Commerce and Technology &mdash; was under the aegis of the City of Limerick Vocational Education Committee up to 31 December 1992.  Responsibility for the operation of the college transferred to a governing body on 1 January 1993 under the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992.</P>
      <P>The college comprises the following three schools: the School of Engineering of Moylish Park, the School of Professional and Management Studies at O'Connell Avenue, the School of Art and Design which is housed in five separate locations &mdash; Georges Quay, O'Connell Avenue, The Granary, Bruce House and The Technical Institute &mdash; the old vocational school.</P>
      <P>The college caters for a total of 2,000 third level students.  Following consultation with the college authorities, the Department of Education is proceeding with a comprehensive programme of building works in order to improve facilities at the college.  This consists of a four stage development programme as follows: phase 1 (A) a library-information technology facility, phase 1 (B) the provision of a computer centre, lecture theatres and an administration block, phase 2 classrooms, lecture theatres and a restaurant and phase 3 the School of Art and Design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase 1 (A) of the programme has been included within the current European Regional Development Fund programme <Col N="916" /> 1990-1993.  The contract for this project is in progress at present and is due to completion in July 1993 at a cost of £1.4 million approximately.  The project, when completed, will provide the college with greatly improved library-information technology facilities.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the Department, in consultation with the college authorities, has agreed to proceed with the further phases of the development programme.  In this connection, the college authorities were authorised in March 1993 to proceed with the planning of phase 1 (B) and phase 2 with a view to inviting tenders late in 1993 and to awarding a contract in 1994 in the context of the next European Regional Development Fund Programme 1994-1999.  The initial reports and drawings for the project have recently been submitted to the Department by the college authorities and are being examined at present.</P>
    <P>The Department has decided to proceed with a much larger building programme at this stage rather than proceed with the next phase of development only as it will ensure that the college will have modern and comprehensive facilities at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>While I am confident that funding will be provided for the college under the next European Regional Development Fund Programme, it would be premature at this stage to anticipate the total amount of funds to be allocated to the Department or indeed to the regional technical college Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education indicated that she was firmly committed to the building programme in this college when she visited it, and has said she will honour those commitments.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 June 1993.</P>
