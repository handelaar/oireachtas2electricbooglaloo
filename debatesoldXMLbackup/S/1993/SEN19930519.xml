      <P>I have notice from Senator Cashin that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to request the British National Monuments Trust to return, as a gift to the people, Kanturk Castle; and if the Government would then set about restoring it.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide the necessary funding for adequate staffing levels at Manorhamilton Hospital, County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the proposal to close the casualty department of Ennis General Hospital from 1 a.m. to 8 a.m. from June 1993 and on the proposed closure of a ward and a theatre in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to extend the urban renewal scheme to Wicklow town and to further parts of Bray, County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Government to honour a specific commitment given on behalf of the Government to provide quality third level courses, by way of regional college development in Castlebar, County Mayo, and the need for the Minister for Education to authorise such courses in 1993.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cashin, Reynolds, Taylor-Quinn, Ross and Burke as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Cashin's and Reynolds' matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Taylor-Quinn, Ross and Burke may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to allow time to discuss the Kilkenny Incest Investigation report and this would be an opportune occasion for this House to compliment the Chairman of the investigation, Ms. Catherine McGuinness, a former Member of the Seanad, on reporting so expeditiously and presenting such a fine set of recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House to allow time to discuss the increased telecommunications charges, particularly the VAT increases on those charges.  I hope <Col N="431" /> he will accommodate us this week on this matter.</P>
    <P>On a social note, may I take this opportunity to compliment Ms Niamh Kavanagh and Mr. Jimmy Walsh on the tremendous performance in Millstreet, County Cork last Saturday.  I compliment RTE for their fine technical production of this event.  They did great work for Ireland and it is important that we extend our good wishes to them.</P>

      <P>Discussions are ongoing between the main Government party and the main Opposition party regarding accommodation for the Independent Senators.  I am led to believe that this matter will be concluded by 7 o'clock this evening when I hope to receive the key to adequate accommodation for the Members of the Independent group. That will be an end to this matter with which we need not bore ourselves, <i>ad nauseam</i>, each week from now on.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House to advise us of proposed legislation.  I am concerned that legislation is being sent from one House to the other and while there is a long term legislation plan, there is no short term plan.  We do not know what legislation is due to be introduced in either House.</P>

      <P>Like other Senators, I would like time to be made available to discuss the implications of the Kilkenny incest report.  I commend the committee on their recommendations.  I share concerns expressed by the ISPCC and others about the content and the conclusions of the report regarding the handling, by professionals, of that particular case.</P>
      <P>Is there an appropriate manner in which we could raise today's decision of the High Court in London to dismiss charges against four policemen, charged with cooking evidence in the Guilford Four case.  Obviously we must accept the judgment but British commentators today would differentiate between the innocence of these four men and the conclusion that the other four were simply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with the Order of Business as presented by the Leader of the House.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach and the other Senators would agree it is important to record our satisfaction with the result of the Danish referendum vote yesterday.  It opens up new horizons for the Community and I ask the Leader to make time soon for a formal debate on developments within the EC.  I support the remarks made concerning the Kilkenny incest case but Senator Honan will comment further on that.</P>

      <P>May I bring to the notice of the Leader of the House the serious situation concerning the Area Aid Scheme.  We warned the Minister earlier about this possibility and newspaper reports this morning suggest that at least 2,500 applicants have not managed to get their application forms in before the deadline.  May I also ask the Leader of the House to ask the Minister for Agriculture to attend here as soon as possible because we cannot eliminate that number of people from the scheme as it would wipe out their farms and incomes at a stroke.</P>

      <P>I support the call made by Senator Taylor-Quinn for time in this House to debate the increases in telephone charges.  Although the Minister for <Col N="433" /> Communications, Deputy Cowen, said that there was no real increase, a 10 per cent increase in VAT has been imposed on phone bills for all including old age pensioners and businesses who are not in a position to benefit from cheaper call charges at the weekend because they do not usually operate then.</P>

I would also like to record, on behalf of the House, our congratulations to the Chairperson and the committee for their speed in formulating this report and also compliment the Minister and the Government for their response.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Government Chief Whip for the legislative programme from now until the summer and I understand the Animals Remedies Bill and the Broadcasting Bill will be included, but there will be two, or possibly three other Bills initiated in this House between now and the summer and this will require three day sittings during June and July.</P>
      <P>I also wish to record my welcome to the results of the Danish referendum and I will ask the Minister to take part in a debate here on changes within the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator McGowan's issue, I understand the Common Agricultural Policy debate will resume next week.  I am sure the Whips would agree, <Col N="434" /> that the fishing industry merits time for debate in this House.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(b) the insertion of the following paragraph in subsection (2):</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has already been discussed at some length. The issue here is whether the private lives of employees should impact on the stability and security of their employment. Employees might find themselves in a position which would be in conflict with their jobs and I was attempting to clarify this in the amendment.  When I proposed the motion, I gave the example that if someone working in the office of the headquarters of a political party was found to be an activist in a different party, then there would be a conflict of interests. Similarly, if an employee in a certain business opened a similar business close by that would also be a direct conflict of interest.  Obviously, those are clear <Col N="435" /> examples, but what I am trying to address here is a situation where something in a person's private life, which has no impact on their competency or ability to discharge their work function, could lead to their dismissal and the Minister of State last week referred to a teaching case that occurred some years ago.  I do not want to labour the point any further.  The Minister of State indicated that she had some sympathy with the point and perhaps she could indicate whether she will deal with it on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are resuming on the amendment proposed by Senator O'Toole and I recollect the background to the case.  These amendments to the Unfair Dismissals Bill have come about, as Senator O'Toole and other Senators realise, through much consultation with interested parties.  The Legislature provides for views to be put forward and listened to and commented on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senator O'Toole spoke last week and again, today, he clearly recognised that there were cases where an employee's private life could impinge on job performance and in that case the Senator said that he would not wish to condone that.  However he also said that there appears to be cases where one's private life should not be construed as infringing on work performance.  The complex background to this amendment shows that the Senator recognises this issue requires a case by case examination. I know the House will be aware that the case I referred to earlier went through &mdash; I do not know about the rights commissioner &mdash; the tribunal, the Circuit Court and the High Court and on each occasion, it was reflected on professionally and a decision made.  While we would all agree that one's private life should not be taken into account by an employer, we recognise that there are certain cases where job performance would be affected.  I suggest to the Senator and the House that this issue requires a case by case analysis by the <Col N="436" /> tribunal or the rights commissioner or other adjudicator.</P>
    <P>The tribunal was set up to deal with cases of alleged unfair dismissal in an impartial manner.  Our amendments seek to clear up many issues which have arisen since 1977.  I gave much thought to the case which has given rise to the amendment as did the Department officials.  I am convinced that an employee's best interests will be served by the amendments we have put forward and by the various conduits of redress available in rights commissioners, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and if necessary, the Circuit and higher courts.  This is the best way to proceed.  The complexity of the issue has been recognised by Senator O'Toole but a blanket amendment such as this is not the best way to deal with complex issues that require individual scrutiny.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister said is not in conflict with my proposal and I will try to balance both points of view.  I agree with the Minister about case by case assessments.  For example a person in a small town may be involved in a relationship which is unacceptable to the people of the town.  The person may have a job where the employer does not approve of the relationship and dismisses the person for that reason.  The case goes to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and, as the Minister said, at every stage of the appeal the people on the tribunal or in the court have to assess and judge whether the person's private life arrangement impacts on the employee's competency to do the job or whether it affected the reputation of the employer's firm.  I do not disagree with any of the points the Minister made as that decision has to be made every time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment I am trying to redress the present legislation under which a member of the tribunal could decide that an arrangement or relationship was not good for the community and for that reason decide that the employer was correct to dismiss the person.  That approach could be taken at the moment. <Col N="437" /> That is what happened in the case which occurred in New Ross.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to achieve in legislation is provision for a person on a tribunal while not approving of an arrangement to take into account that under the Act it would be wrong to have a person dismissed for that reason alone. That is the difference between the two points.  A member of the tribunal acting as a jurist in determining a case must decide what is at issue.  Is the person doing the job adequately or is it a question of accepting the person's right to a private life?  Is the person's private life arrangements impacting on job performance or is it the tribunal member who does not approve?  The amendment makes that distinction.  I acknowledge the Minister has given it much thought and I recognise the comprehensive nature of her response.  There is not much between us and there will be another opportunity to discuss it before a final decision is reached.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that there is a difference between the current situation and what I am trying to achieve in my amendment which is an indication to people on the tribunal that disapproval of a person's private life arrangements is not a sufficient reason for dismissal even if that person's private arrangement is totally at variance with the ethos of the firm or whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was considered when the legislation was being prepared according to the White Paper.  An amendment was sought which would provide that a person's behaviour in private life may not be used as grounds for dismissal. The White Paper stated that such an amendment was fraught with difficulties and this is the situation we are in now.  It also mentions certain charges that might be brought against a person outside work and a situation where a person might be found not guilty on a technicality. These difficulties arise; the Minister is correct.  We have to take each case on its merit and let the tribunal judge it on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the points made by Senator O'Toole and Senator Doyle.  It is a complex matter and we want to be fair.  The best way to be impartial is to allow rights commissioners or the tribunal to deal with cases individually as they were set up to do.  The Government's amendment is the best way to deal with this issue.  The tribunal reads the Oireachtas reports and takes note of them.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(b) in subsection (3)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  by the deletion of &lsquo;either&rsquo;,</P>
      <P>(ii)  by the deletion in paragraph (a) of &lsquo;or&rsquo; where it lastly occurs,</P>
      <P>(iii)  by the insertion in paragraph (b) of &lsquo;or&rsquo; after &lsquo;procedure,&rsquo;</P>
      <P>(iv)  by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (b):</P>
      <P>(c) having regard to all the circumstances the procedure adopted by the employer in the selection of workers for dismissal was unfair.</P>
      <P>The arguments used by the Minister and the Members of the House regarding dismissal should also be used when a person is being selected for redundancy.  As in unfair dismissals a person should not be discriminated against on the grounds of race, colour, creed or sexual orientation if they are to be made redundant.  This amendment brings redundancy arrangements into line with the other protections in this Bill for unfair dismissal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is <Col N="439" /> aware of the Protection of Employment Act and there is no need for me to go into detail on it.  In the Programme for a Partnership Government a review of that Act is promised and I suggest that Senator O'Toole's two amendments would be appropriate to that review.  I will be bringing that review to this House and to the Dáil and we will be prepared to examine those points then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's good faith.  It seems to me that the Programme for a Partnership Government is slowing down legislation.  Last week we had two or three clear clashes on issues which were apparently being dealt with by the Department of Equality and Law Reform which is more pertinent in my view to this legislation.  Legislation is being slowed down because of decisions of Government which should be dealt with elsewhere.  Cabinet needs to be told that this practice is ludicrous.  I would be happy if the Minister is indicating that it will be covered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 6, paragraph (b) to delete lines 41 to 47.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding is this section seeks to increase the role of the tribunal in looking at the procedures involved in the dismissal of a person.  At present the tribunal looks at procedures but does not necessarily always decide a dismissal is unfair if an employer does not fully comply with normal procedures.  There <Col N="440" /> may be cases where, although the proper procedures are not followed, a dismissal can be found to be fair because of the gravity of the action taken by the employee.  Natural justice would suggest the tribunal should take into account proper procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Neville seeks to delete lines 41 to 47 which are part of the changes to the existing legislation. This provision of the Bill gives support to the general practice of the tribunal in relation to failure by an employer to comply with the terms of the agreed dismissal procedures.  In other words, the Department believes this provision will strengthen agreed fair procedures.  I am sure Senator Neville does not intend this, but the removal of lines 41 to 47 would lead to a dilution of the agreed fair procedures. It is a worthwhile addition to the 1977 Act and the House will agree that removing it would affect an employee's right or ability to receive fair procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to agreed fair procedures but as she is probably aware, in at least 70 per cent of dismissals there are no agreed procedures outside employer/employee union agreements. Where there are union agreements employers are always conscious of the agreement on procedures.  My worry is that where there are no agreed procedures and an employer does not comply with an acceptable procedure or custom and practice in industry or commerce in general, the tribunal would now decide that the dismissal would always be found unfair, despite the action of the employee.  For example, if there is a case of extreme violence in the workplace, the tribunal might find that a summary dismissal without going through procedures was fair because of the nature of the employee's action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear the tribunal now would become more legalistic about procedures. Regardless of the action taken by an employee and the justice of the case for dismissal, the tribunal would say procedures <Col N="441" /> were not carried out, the employee did not receive natural justice and did not have an opportunity to defend himself.  If the procedures were not carried out, no matter what the employee did, even if somebody was severely injured, the employer would be found to have unfairly dismissed the employee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The deletion involved in Senator Neville's amendment would not help the employee with his or her case.  We mentioned legalism last week in this House and I said I was prepared to take steps to deal with the perceived creeping legalism of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>I think the provision the Senator seeks to delete gives support to the general practice of the tribunal in relation to failure by an employer to comply with the terms of agreed dismissal procedures.  I think it is a worthwhile addition to the legislation.  This matter was discussed at length and it seemed necessary to insert this provision into the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is the practice of the tribunal in 90 per cent of the cases to consider the procedures.  However, in some cases the tribunal has found, despite a total absence of procedures, that the incident that activated the dismissal made the dismissal fair.  No matter what procedures were complied with the dismissal would still take place.</P>
      <P>Many small employers, such as sole traders, farmers or shopkeepers are not aware of these procedures.  They should be but they are not.  If there was an act of violence or serious theft from an employer, because procedures are not complied with, under this section the dismissal must be found unfair regardless of the justice of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the validity of both sides of this argument.  If somebody is in employment there is a due process or a domestic process, as it is called, to be followed for dismissal.  Senator Neville made the point that in cases of violence, sexual abuse or a threat, an employer <Col N="442" /> may decide he did not want the relevant employee on his premises any longer. The Senator says the provision in the Bill would require the tribunal to say due process was not being followed.  Senator Neville has more experience in this area than any of us in this House.</P>
      <P>My reading is that the tribunal would not be obliged to follow that line.  The Bill says: &ldquo;the Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, considers it appropriate to do so&rdquo;.  I am not certain of what that means.  It appears the tribunal could say that although an employer did not include in the procedure for dismissal the fact that one single incident of theft or serious violence would lead to a dismissal, nevertheless it could see the employer acted reasonably and the tribunal would not be prepared to say the dismissal was unfair.  Under section 5 (b), lines 35 to 37 the tribunal has discretion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, in determining if a dismissal is an unfair dismissal, regard may be had, if the rights commissioner, the Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, considers it appropriate to do so... to the extent (if any) of the compliance or failure to comply by the employer...</P>
      <P>rather than the fact that procedures were not followed.</P>
      <P>I asked the question of Senator Neville because he is an expert on the tribunal. He made a valid point.  I represent workers and I would not favour a system where an employer would be required to hold in employment somebody who is patently a danger to others and not just whose working in the business.  Senator Neville's case is unanswerable.  Can his point be met within the existing words of the Bill?</P>

      <P>I was not going to comment until the argument had been developed further.  However, it is now <Col N="443" /> my clear view that the protection in the new section 6 (7) of the Principal Act provided for in section 5 of this Bill should be made available.  The necessity for an employer to take action against an employee need not result in dismissal as the employee can be suspended until an investigation into the matter has been concluded.  That would be a solution to the problem.</P>

      <P>Senator Sherlock is right. One would expect that fair procedures are applied in all circumstances.  This is true of companies in which unions are organised and have agreement with the employers.  However, this does not always happen in the case of sole traders who are not fully informed about good employment practices and do not have personnel expertise available to them. For example, a dismissal by a farmer, without following fair procedures, of an employee for sexually assaulting a member of his family may, under section 5 of the Bill, be found to be unfair.  First, the tribunal would find either that the employee's conduct merited dismissal or that the dismissal was unfair but was contributed to by the employee.  Second if the tribunal found that fair procedures were not followed, this would result in the dismissal being declared unfair because the employer who lacked knowledge of good industrial relations and practices, did not adopt the proper dismissal procedures.</P>

      <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for a new section 6 (7) of the Principal Act the purpose of which is to strengthen the original Act.  I suggest that the points put forward by Senator Neville deal with paragraph 7 (6) of the new section whereas paragraph 7 (a) is the pertinent one.  This states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, in determining if a dismissal is an unfair dismissal, regard may be had, if the <Col N="444" /> rights commissioner, the Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, considers it appropriate to do so&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to the reasonableness or otherwise of the conduct (whether by act or omission) of the employer in relation to the dismissal.</P>
    <P>The Senator is concentrating on paragraph (b) to the effect that paragraph (a) is not being considered and I believe the deletion proposed by him in amendment No. 11 would work to the detriment of the employee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  At present both the reasonableness and conduct of the employer and the procedures which were followed are examined by the tribunal.  The relative importance of procedures is now being strengthened. Dismissals which are not in accordance with fair procedures are at present only deemed to be fair if the employee's conduct is extreme and the tribunal is satisfied that had the correct procedures been applied the employer would still have dismissed the employee and this dismissal would have been fair.  I do not want a situation to develop where the tribunal will now look at procedures in isolation from an employee's action.</P>
      <P>An employee may be dismissed rather than suspended while he is being investigated without being given the opportunity to give his side of the case.  Such summary action may be taken without any consultation with the employee because of the seriousness of the employee's action.  This section will restrict the tribunal in such cases as it will have to consider in isolation the procedures adopted and find such dismissals unfair because proper dismissal procedures, as distinct from disciplinary procedures, were not adopted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 6, paragraph (b), line 47, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; where it secondly occurs, to insert &ldquo;or any statutory rules for the time being in force governing the dismissal of persons employed by way of apprenticeship, including dismissal for reasons of redundancy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I proposed this amendment after consultation with ICTU who expressed concern that the statutory provisions regarding people in apprenticeship were not covered in this legislation.  I am trying to secure adequate protection for apprentices and I will be satisfied if the Minister can indicate that such protection is either implicitly offered in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is an important issue and I cannot see where it is covered in the legislation. Legisation should not be silent on such a fundamental issue.  At a time when we are encouraging people into training and apprenticeships we should protect them through legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the intent of this amendment particularly as apprenticeships are being promoted with new schemes.  Further designated areas for apprenticeship training will be nominated within the next few months; it is an area in which I have a particular interest.</P>
      <P>The Senator has asked if apprenticeship is covered under existing legislation. Under the apprenticeship rules of the Labour Services Act, 1987 &mdash; which was the statutory instrument of the training and employment authority &mdash; no employer can dismiss an apprentice except in strict accordance with the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, and the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1990. There are statutory rules and related penalties for failure to observe them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their consideration of the fairness of the dismissal of an apprentice the rights commissioners or the Employment <Col N="447" /> Appeals Tribunal would consider all the circumstances surrounding the dismissal. It is quite explicit under the various Acts that employers cannot unfairly dismiss an apprentice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;The Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after section 6 of the following new section:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;7.&mdash;(a)  The dismissal of an employee shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be an unfair dismissal if it results wholly or mainly from the election of the employee to membership of either of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(b)  Where an employee is elected as a member of either of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the employee shall be entitled to unpaid leave of absence for the period of such membership.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect the support of the Minister and the Members for this amendment.  First I thank the Minister for the information <Col N="448" /> she gave me regarding the question I raised last week about another section.</P>
    <P>In support of this amendment I cite the experience in 1982 of my colleague, Deputy Paddy Gallagher, who was elected to the Dáil.  He understood that he had an agreement with his employer to unpaid leave of absence.  When he later lost his seat the employer did not honour that agreement and Mr. Gallagher was dismissed from his post.  That was a traumatic experience.  He had no protection under the 1977 Act and, unfortunately, it took him a long time to secure alternative employment.</P>
    <P>Later my colleagues Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Gilmore, arrived home after their first day in the Dáil to find notice from their employers that their employment was terminated.  I thought that was an anti-political action by the employers, especially as those Deputies, in the course of their duties, negotiated leave of absence for people employed in the private sector.  I worked in a semi-State body and had no such problem.  The semi-State bodies give leave of absence to employees who are elected to either House of the Oireachtas and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Under the 1977 Act dismissal is unfair where it is as a result of the following: (a) the employee's trade union membership or activities either outside working hours or at those times during working hours when permitted by the employer; (b) religious or political opinions; (c) race or colour; (d) legal proceedings against the employer where the employee is a party or is a witness and (e) unfair selection for redundancy. Employees in such circumstances are well protected.  However, it is unreasonable that persons in employment who are elected to either House of the Oireachtas are not entitled to unpaid leave of absence.  That is what is being sought in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>As a public sector employee in the Department of Health I support this amendment.  I am not the only Member of the Oireachtas employed in that Department who has <Col N="449" /> this serious problem.  It is serious because it precludes many people with experience and qualifications from securing a seat in either House.  In the medical profession if clinics cannot be arranged to facilitate Oireachtas sittings, commitments cannot be fulfilled.  It is almost impossible to facilitate Dáil sittings, but it is possible to do so in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I know this Government will continue in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I resent the fact that I had to give up a major public clinic and that my public patients are suffering as a result. However, I have been able to rearrange my private practice.  I know another Member of the Oireachtas who has this problem.  It is important that consideration is given to our replacement by locums during Oireachtas sittings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. There is a section of society which is not involved in the political process.  There are many people employed in industry and commerce outside the public sector, for example, the ordinary PAYE workers in a factory, who do not have the opportunity to become involved in politics at local level because there is no facility for leave of absence.  The ordinary worker is not represented in the Houses of the Oireachtas or on county councils in proportion to their numbers in the community because they cannot obtain leave of absence.  If a person is unfairly dismissed because he has taken leave of absence to attend the Houses of the Oireachtas, he may not receive compensation because he has not suffered a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions today I spoke about the protection of teachers in employment. Throughout the afternoon, many school tours came into the House.  Last year I carried out a survey of 100 post-primary students and asked them how many <Col N="450" /> would like politics as a full-time career. One or two students were interested. There is a fundamental flaw in a democracy which does not see politics as a career to which people would aspire.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister of State and I were teachers when we were elected to the Oireachtas.  Teaching is well organised because teachers can take leave of absence for a specific period.  Senator Sherlock's amendment reiterates the conditions of service by which the Minister of State and I were able to participate in parliamentary democracy.</P>
      <P>People have a poor perception of politics. I do not know how many of the young people in the Visitors' Gallery would like to be TDs or Senators when they grow up.  Fewer people will become involved in politics if it means losing a job.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by Senator Sherlock is important.  I recall attending a fund raising function for Senator Sherlock's two colleagues to fight a court case against their dismissal.  The emphasis in a democracy should be to encourage people to become involved in the decision-making process of democracy. Senator Sherlock's amendment attempts to establish a principle.  A basic democratic point is being made and it should be protected.  It is a poor reflection on the operation of parliamentary democracy if a person is sacked because of election to either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental principle involved here.  Nothing should impede a citizen from becoming a Member of either House.  We take democracy for granted and it is regrettable that people who wish to participate in democracy are excluded by an action of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is reluctant to quote personal examples, but I agree with Senator Neville.  I have personal experience of the penalties imposed on people in private employment who wish to become a Member of either House.  As far as I can recall, there is provision in the Principal <Col N="451" /> Act which says that political affiliation is not grounds for dismissal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>If political affiliation is not grounds for dismissal, then membership of the House should not be grounds for dismissal.  The State has facilitated certain sections of the public service in terms of what they can do, and they can return to their jobs.  One famous Deputy in County Kildare took leave of absence from his teaching post for his entire career.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard that as undesirable.  A teacher or anyone else should be able to become a Member of the Oireachtas without fear of penalty. PAYE taxpayers are as vulnerable as people in the public sector and they need to be protected.</P>
      <P>One could sue for constructive dismissal if an employer makes it impossible to retain employment or to get leave of absence.  I have known of cases where employers wanted to dismiss employees. The people who want to dismiss employees are the same people who pontificate around dinner tables about the need to have people of merit in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not accept that there are no people of merit in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, people will argue about it, but they will not put their money where their mouth is.</P>
      <P>We have a profession of which we should be proud.  It is important to participate in State institutions and to participate in political events.  However, I fear the alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for a fine discussion.  When I was teaching, the students and I often spoke about politics in the context of the modern history <Col N="452" /> course, 1850-1970.  We would discuss the political systems in different countries.  I always urged them to become involved in the political process.  It did not matter what political party they represented, as long as they became interested and involved.  They could then decide which party to join and how they could contribute to it.</P>
      <P>We all know young people who got four As, two Bs and three Cs in the leaving certificate.  However, they would not know where the town hall was, the county manager's name, political parties' representation on the local council, the Members of the Dáil in their political area, or the vocational panels in the Seanad.  This is information we know but which many young people, and people of all ages, do not know or want to know.</P>
      <P>It is demeaning to pontificate about politicians.  I often ask people who criticise politicians why they do not stand for election.  The usual reply is that they would not knock on people's doors.  The essence of democracy is that you present yourself to somebody from whom you are seeking a vote and ask for their support on the basis of what you are willing to say about yourself or your party.  What Senator Dardis said struck a chord with me because when you ask people who are criticising us if they would consider joining a party and going forward for election, they reply that they would not dirty their hands by knocking on doors. That would be demeaning for them. Democracy loses a lot of its gloss when you put it like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us, whether in the Seanad or the Dáil, are here <i>pro bono publico.</i>  The more varied the nature of people represented in both Houses, the greater the scrutiny of legislation or the input into debates will be, with a wider variety of views being expressed.  In fact, the Seanad was established so that the vocational &mdash; in the correct meaning of the word &mdash; element could put their view which would be acted upon.  I have always found the Seanad remarkable for that as well as being remarkably efficient.  We are being avidly listened to by a great <Col N="453" /> number of young people in the Public Gallery.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Unfair Dismissals Act was, and remains, to provide machinery for the resolution of dismissal disputes between employers and employees.  In my view, a matter of this nature should be addressed in the relevant electoral legislation and resolved through discussion.  The Electoral Acts which govern elections to the Dáil or Seanad include the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1990, and the Electoral Act, 1992.  For Seanad elections there is the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Acts of 1947 and 1954, and as amended in 1972 and 1992.</P>
    <P>The thrust of what has been said in this House today is correct in that there is an acceptance that public work should be recognised in the same way as employment. It is not strictly an employer/ employee situation, but relates to the contract entered into when you are elected to either House of the Oireachtas, which is, of course, at the pleasure of the electorate.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice who would not accept the Bill and then withdrew a Bill.  We were not encouraged to go down that road.  Senator Sherlock's argument must be taken into consideration. In real life, if somebody wants to run for public office they approach their employer and ask for leave of absence.  It is at that stage that a decision is taken.  An employer should be aware that by not allowing such persons, if elected, leave of absence to carry out their official duties &mdash; there would be a case for extending that principal to county councils as well &mdash; such employees would be found to have been unfairly dismissed under the unfair dismissals legislation.  Since many employers, particularly big employers, and personnel management are more conscious <Col N="456" /> of labour legislation than the Electoral Acts the appropriate area to deal with dismissals is, surely, the Unfair Dismissals Act.  Senator Sherlock's amendment stands on its merits and should be included in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make an attempt to advance the debate.  If I interpret what the Minister of State said correctly, and I am reluctant to interpret it in view of the dialogue which has taken place between the Minister and Senator Sherlock, there is general agreement that nothing should disqualify a person from becoming a Member of the Oireachtas by reason of their employment.  This means we must decide whether the employment protection afforded to a person becoming a Member of the Oireachtas lies more appropriately with the Electoral Act or this legislation.</P>
      <P>When we debated the last Electoral Act we discussed in detail how people might or might not be disqualified from being Members of the Oireachtas. One aspect I remember clearly was that if one was convicted of a criminal offence one would be disqualified.  There was also, however, an inference that people who protested on the streets about a particular civil matter, and were then jailed, would be disqualified from becoming Members of the Oireachtas.  That situation appropriately lies with the Electoral Act, but the matter currently under debate lies with the arrangement between an employer and employee. Where else is it to be dealt with if not in this legislation?  To do otherwise is to avoid responsibility.  We should deal with it where it properly belongs which is in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect this is where the process of enacting legislation runs into a quagmire.  There is no difference of opinion on this issue between the Minister and Senators on both sides of the House.  There is a consensus on what we are attempting to achieve.  The Minister's response is that this is not the appropriate legislation.  I <Col N="457" /> disagree.  Her statement defies logic and I would like to hear her justify it.</P>
      <P>The Bill says that a dismissal is unfair if it arises wholly or mainly as a result of the religious or political affiliation of the employee.  The Act states that such affiliations cannot be used as a reason for dismissal.  That is the situation at present. Surely it is a small step from there to saying that a person who is elected because of his or her political opinions to a House of the Oireachtas should therefore be protected.  We want to encourage people to become involved in politics. The Minister and I would not be in politics were it not for such an arrangement. When the Minister and I were elected we were each replaced by a temporary teacher on an official basis.  Many people in the private sector cannot arrange a replacement and that has been outlined clearly here today.  It would have been a loss to the country if the Minister and I were not to have made our contributions to national politics.</P>
      <P>When the Electoral Bill was debated, Members were told what it was not the appropriate Bill to deal with this issue. This amendment was not introduced then although this issue was discussed.  The Minister and I know that her advisers are of the opinion that this amendment should not be accepted for some reason. To say that this is not the appropriate legislation to deal with this issue is incorrect. This is about unfair dismissal.  The Bill already deals with political opinions. Surely political affiliation or election on the basis of political commitment is the same thing.</P>

      <P>I come to debates as well informed as I can.  I think Members will accept that.  This advice has been given to me.  I do not mind Members disagreeing with it if they accept that I took advice.  The advice available to me from informed people is that Members should wait for redress of this situation. Let me be quite clear.  I am saying that I have been advised that the best means for redressing this is by way of the Electoral Acts.  I am dismayed to find that the <Col N="458" /> Senators did not table an amendment to the 1992 Electoral Act.</P>

      <P>The Senator has now agreed with me that no amendment was tabled at that time.  In case members seek to say that I am obscuring the matter I am stating quite clearly that the advice given to me is that the channel for redress of this issue is an Electoral Act in one form or another.  Let the Senators pontificate as long as they like.  The remedy lies in their own hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not.  I have read most of the Electoral Acts and there is no section suitable for this kind of legislation.  If a person is elected to either House of the Oireachtas and discovers that their employment has been terminated as a result does the Minister regard that as being unfair?  Is this the most appropriate legislation under which to protect the rights of that person?  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>For the reason I stated already I accept the very reasoned way in which Senator Sherlock has put forward his case.  I respect the continuous fear as to whether one will regain one's seat and whether one will have employment to return to.  People who are elected to public office are in very tenuous employment.  One works always to make it more permanent although this is difficult. <Col N="459" /> I hold fast to the advice which I have been given.  I look forward to the day when Senators will do something about this matter.  Senators speak about wanting to initiate legislation.  I have come here with this Bill and I hope to have further legislation ready shortly. Why do Senators from all parties not come together and put down this amendment? Senators obviously feel very strongly about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 7, paragraph (a), line 14, to delete &ldquo;him&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the employee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, I referred to the language of legislation.  As stated in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government's position on this matter is clear.  It is accepted that language influences attitudes.  The use of the words &ldquo;him&rdquo; and &ldquo;he&rdquo; in legislation reflects the attitude of society, the Government, and, dare I say, the Minister who introduces legislation containing sexist language.</P>
      <P>I am replacing the word &ldquo;him&rdquo; with the word the &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  So it will read &ldquo;if the employee incurred no such financial loss, payment to the employee by the employer...&rdquo; I am replacing a pronoun with a noun.  It does not change the meaning of section 6.  I am moving this amendment on a point of principle. There are other areas in this legislation where similar measures need to be taken.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a test for a Government who established a Department of Equality and held a reception in Dublin Castle for the launch of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It is a test for a Government who indicated the need for equality and has shown a commitment to gender proofing and the elimination of sexist language.</P>
      <P>This legislation contains old-fashioned sexist language reflecting a time when men worked and women remained in the home.  It is contrary to what the Minister of State believes and to the kind of society we are trying to portray.  It is contrary to the need for women's participation in the work force and the demands of the Culliton report that women should have the opportunity to return to the work force.  It re-establishes the role model of the old-fashioned male provider, it takes us back to the last century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have dealt with this matter on previous occasions and other Ministers have accepted similar changes to legislation. On one occasion the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;<Col N="462" /> was changed to &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo; and on another occasion it was changed to &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.  I moved a similar amendment to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and it was accepted.</P>
    <P>This issue extends beyond words. Recently I represented a group of women at the Labour Court.  I referred to the Chair of the proceedings as either Chairperson or Cathaoirleach.  I was reprimanded and told that legislation stated that this person was the Chairman of the Labour Court, not Chairperson, Cathaoirleach or Chair.  We have had enough macho legislation.</P>
    <P>This amendment will not involve a charge on the revenue.  It is in the context for the Programme for a Partnership Government and the progressive nature of the Minister of State's attitude towards such matters.  Let us dispose of this matter quickly.</P>
    <P>For a full year between 1991-92 on the Independent benches week after week Senator Norris, in the names of the Independent Senators, raised the question of altering the current practice of using &ldquo;he&rdquo; exclusively in legislation.  We could have a discussion about semantics, what does &ldquo;he&rdquo; or &ldquo;she&rdquo; mean or should we say &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chairwoman&rdquo;, but that is not the issue.  The use of these words reflects an attitude.  The person who introduces such legislation, must expect to be, and will be, challenged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything the Senator said with such force is accurate. May I read from the Interpretation Act, 1937, which would make the hair stand on your head?  Part III, section 11 (b) of the Interpretation Act, 1937 reads: &ldquo;Masculine and feminine.  Every word importing the masculine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if also imported the feminine gender.&rdquo;  This was written in 1937, the year of de Valera's Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women recommends the elimination of sexism from Acts of the Oireachtas and official forms.  Paragraph 1.10.1 reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Amendment of Interpretation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> The Interpretation Act, passed in 1937, defines the meaning and construction of words and expressions used in Bills and Acts of the Oireachtas and in the instruments made under these Acts.</P>
    <P>Section II (b) of the Acts reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Masculine and Feminine Every word importing the masculine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the feminine gender.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The converse of this does not apply, however.  There is no provision in the Act for being able to construe the feminine gender as also importing to the masculine.</P>
    <P>The consequences of this is that it is not possible at present to use the feminine gender in Acts or instruments of the Oireachtas which will primarily affect women.</P>
    <P>The Commission recommends that the Interpretation Act, 1937 should be redrafted with a view to:</P>
    <P>(a)  ending discriminatory and unnecessary gender-specific language in Bills, Acts and instruments of the Oireachtas, for example, by using s/he and chairperson;</P>
    <P>(b)  enabling the adoption of the feminine gender in legislative measures clearly and primarily addressed at women.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Legislation establishing the two new universities contained the words &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;she&rdquo;.  However, we replaced both words with &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;the student&rdquo;, words which could apply to either gender.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole is right when he says that many might say we are getting hung up on he and she and chairman and chairperson but that is not the point, and no doubt some journalists will say this is due to pressure from feminists.  I agree with Senator O'Toole.  First, the mind of the person drafting the legislation is imbued <Col N="464" /> with the idea that the male is the only human subject and that comes through in the legislation.  It raises the question of role models.  Every provision in legislation uses &ldquo;he&rdquo;, never &ldquo;she&rdquo;, constantly reinforcing the male as the superior being.  I feel very strongly about the Interpretation Act.  If we are to begin to improve the status of women, the Interpretation Act, 1937, should be re-examined; the Second Commission on the Status of Women referred to it in their report and considered it very important. We were in contact with the Office of the Attorney General to see if the linguistic situation had improved, but I have to report that it is progressing slowly; it does not seem to be an item of great urgency with that office.</P>
    <P>When Senator O'Tooke spoke on Second Stage, he complimented those who drafted this legislation in non-sexist language.  We tried to eliminate sexist language as much as possible, but we were still left with some cases where it would be too convoluted to use &ldquo;she&rdquo; and &ldquo;he&rdquo;.  In this case, I would be willing to accept the amendment but it should be coupled with something else.  There is no point in just replacing &ldquo;he&rdquo; with &ldquo;she&rdquo; in this case because it will come up again and will be contingent on how the Minister of the day regards the matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to get a clear proposal from this House and I would then speak with, or write to, the Taoiseach &mdash; the Office of the Attorney General is under his jurisdiction &mdash; and say that, in the course of introducing this legislation, all Members of this House were of the opinion that the Interpretation Act, 1937 should be immediately addressed and an amendment should be introduced as per the Second Commission for the Status of Women, to end the practice of using the masculine gender exclusively in legislation. We are talking about human rights.  Half of our population are women and I do not know why the Act cannot be changed.  I suggest that Senator O'Toole, as proposer of the amendment &mdash; I know he is adroit at getting publicity &mdash; should make a strong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (1):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1A)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), re-engagement or compensation should only be considered where reinstatement is not practicable having regard to all the circumstances.&rsquo; .&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I try hard to understand the conventions involved in the writing of Bills and also to recognise that amending legislation is even more difficult.  Although we have sections, subsections, paragraphs and sub paragraphs, I have no name to call what I have written down as (1A).  The Minister of State and her advisers could facilitate me by indicating how (1A) is categorised because it is neither a section, subsection, paragraph or subparagraph. I have asked that it be deleted in other parts of the Bill because I find it difficult to deal with.</P>
      <P>I am putting forward a straightforward and reasonable proposal that re-engagement is completely different to reinstatement and often, re-engagement in similar employment is fair and may be the only fair compensation.</P>
      <P>I want to be clear that somebody found to have been unfairly dismissed should be reinstated.  I recall dealing with such a situation when the Minister was in the Department of Education.  A case was taken not under the unfair dismissals legislation but under a domestic appeal tribunal and the person was reinstated.  Reinstatement in those cases can be very difficult because a job can be filled following a dismissal even if it is later found that the dismissal was unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> In the case I mentioned, a teacher was dismissed and was later found to have been dismissed unfairly.  In the meantime the position was filled and it created a very serious problem.  In teaching that problem can be easily dealt with by redeploying both teachers on a panel system.  There may be an element of compensation involved but one recognises that in many other areas there is not that homogenous type of employment and it could be quite difficult.  A teacher who is unfairly dismissed should be reinstated in the same position and should only be reengaged in another school or area as a last resort.  That problem should be cleared up in the legislation and the Tribunal should be aware of it when making their final decision.  Those of us who have dealt with tribunals know that it is often difficult to recommend a person's reinstatement in the same position because it causes a domino effect within the employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  Nevertheless in the course of a hearing the employee or the employee's representatives will indicate the desired form of redress.  I know of cases where a teacher did not, under any circumstances, want to go back to the same school.  I am not saying that a person must accept reinstatement but there should be a clear understanding that the first option for a person who it has been found was unfairly dismissed is reinstatement in precisely the same position.  Re-engagement or compensation should be subsidiary and should only be considered if reinstatement is not an option.  It is a fair point and I ask the Minister to concede it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole on this issue but the reality is that in almost all cases the desired option is compensation.  Due to the fact that a case has been brought to the tribunal the relationship between the employer and <Col N="469" /> employee has deteriorated to the extent that neither want reinstatement or re-engagement. It is significant that Ireland has the lowest level of reinstatement of any country in Europe and that is unfortunate. I agree wholeheartedly that the first redress should be reinstatement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person is unfairly dismissed they should get their job back but, unfortunately, there is a culture problem with regard to taking an issue such as this to tribunals.  Any remaining relationship between the employer and the employee breaks down except in big organisations that can cope with such cases.  Approximately 99 per cent of cases that go to the tribunal are from smaller companies where there is a close relationship between the chief executive and the employee.  It is unfortunate that in almost all cases the preferred option of both employer and employee is compensation. Anything which would encourage a move away from that and towards re-engagement and, if possible, reinstatement, should be done.  If this amendment does that it will have my full support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the three main options.  The question of its appropriateness in the circumstances does arise as Senator Neville said.  Regrettably relationships deteriorate to the point where reinstatement may not be a feasible option.  To an extent this relates to voluntary arrangements which characterise Irish industrial relations.  If a case goes as far as the tribunal it is an extreme situation in Irish terms whereas it might be normal practice in the United States or elsewhere where they are more accustomed <Col N="470" /> to using legal mechanisms to resolve a dispute.  It should be left to the discretion of the tribunal, as Senator Neville said, to consider reinstatement as the first option but not necessarily to impose it in the amended legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, one keeps learning.  The three methods of redress are reinstatement, re-engagement and compensation.  As Senator Neville said the tribunal will first consider reinstatement. Our culture and the voluntary arrangements that Senator Hillery mentioned, as distinct from the rigid application of labour law in other countries are part of the reason the option of reinstatement is rarely taken.  As the Senator said, it is usually employees of smaller firms who take unfair dismissal cases.  Perhaps the employee is from a small town or village where everybody knows everybody and what took place in a small firm would be widely known.</P>
      <P>Before I came into this job and knew the technicalities of redress under labour law &mdash; and I have much to learn yet &mdash; I met people who told me that they would not go back to their job even if they had the option of reinstatement.</P>

      <P>Unfair, I said.  Our culture and the fact that we know one another's business so well militates against reinstatement in many cases even though, as Senator Neville said, it would be the tribunal's first consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> The impetus for the amendment probably arises from concern at the small number of reinstatements, and this was expressed by many Senators on Second Stage.  I admit that at first glance the number of reinstatements or re-engagements awarded relative to the number of determinations may appear low.  With regard to reinstatements, Senators will appreciate that the events leading up to a dismissal and the act of dismissal itself often damage beyond repair the employer/employee relationship.  The destruction of a good working relationship often militates against reinstatement, a fact which is often recognised by both sides in a dismissal when expressing their preferred form of redress.  Given the small size of firms and the nature of relationships between people, which can often work very well, in the breakdown of a working relationship it is often the employee who does not wish to be reinstated.  We may rail against that and we may say it is different in larger corporations but that is the reality.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 8, paragraph (c), line 3, to delete &ldquo;disregarded&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;deducted, but the said amounts shall be payable by the employer to the State as part of the judgment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to save the State money and to establish fairness between the parties involved.  If the new Bill is not amended, it will replace one anomaly with another and perpetuate unfairness at the expense of the State. At present, if someone is judged to be unfairly dismissed and fails to find work immediately, that person will normally become entitled to social welfare payments and, possibly, to a refund of income tax as well.  These payments reduce the financial cost to the employee of the unfair dismissal.  The 1977 legislation provided these payments by the State could be taken into account in calculating <Col N="472" /> the financial loss to the employee.</P>
    <P>From the employee's point of view that seemed fair.  However, it was unfair to the State and unduly generous to the employer.  Under the present system the State pays for part of the loss to the employee.  In other words, the employer's liability for the employee's financial loss is reduced by the amount the State pays.  Clearly this is crazy.  This is not what was intended or what should happen.  The State should not subsidise the cost to an employer of an unfair dismissal. Therefore, it is right that the new legislation removes this anomaly.  I congratulate the Minister for doing so.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill, as drafted does so in the wrong way.  This Bill suggests these payments from the State be &ldquo;disregarded&rdquo; in assessing the financial loss to the employee.  This means that the employer will pay more, and that is right; I do not think anybody has any quarrel with that.  However, the present Bill will make the State subsidise the employee. The employee will get fully compensated for the financial loss and the State will pay part of the loss twice.</P>
    <P>This is just as crazy a system as that it sets out to replace.  The State is an innocent party in this relationship.  There is no reason for the State to be at any loss. When an unfair dismissal takes place the employer should pay the whole cost.  The amendment I propose would put that correct.</P>
    <P>I suggest the employer pay the employee the same amount as he would pay under the present legislation &mdash; the amount of the financial loss &mdash; less the amount the employee got from the State in social welfare payments and in tax refunds.  In addition, I propose this change.  The employer would then recompense the State for these payments which would never have been made but for the unfair dismissal in the first place.</P>
    <P>In this way there would be fairness. The employee would be fully compensated but would not get paid twice, the employer would pay the full cost of the unfair dismissal and not be subsidised by the State, as is the case at the moment, <Col N="473" /> and the State would not have to pay for something in which it was not involved. By comparison with the present arrangement and the one proposed in this new Bill, my proposal would save the State money.</P>
    <P>I realised my scheme might be cumbersome, so I have given some thought to making it easy to administer.  The employer should make two payments instead of one, the first to the employee and the other to the State.  The latter could perhaps be made to the Department of Enterprise and Employment which would then allocate the sums appropriately to the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners. The basis of the proposal is to save the State money and to establish fairness between all the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>I commend this amendment to the House and to the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn. I welcome this section because there was confusion and endless arguments within the tribunal as to whether social welfare payments and tax refunds should be taken into consideration when calculating loss.  Opinion is divided in the tribunal and there is no consistency of approach in that area.  This will tidy up that problem.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that although the dismissed employee is in receipt of social welfare payments during the period of the calculation of loss, his or her loss is calculated on the basis of what he or she would have earned if in employment.  Therefore, during the period of loss there is a net gain to the dismissed employee under the Minister's proposal.  I understand in other jurisdictions what Senator Quinn has suggested is followed.  The State is refunded the amount of social welfare paid to the employee during the period of calculation of loss which can last up to two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Senators for their acclaim of that section of the Bill.  Senator Quinn said in his view it <Col N="474" /> gives rise to another anomaly.  The purpose of this section is to give legislative effect to an existing practice of some divisions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal in disregarding social welfare payments or income tax rebates made to an unfairly dismissed employee when assessing the employee's financial loss in that period.  One of the reasons behind my proposal is that I find it unacceptable that employees' awards should be reduced by the amount of the social welfare payments to which the employee was statutorily entitled while the employer's wrong doing in unfairly dismissing the employee is effectively subsidised by the employee and the State.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that Senator Quinn's amendment goes some way to addressing the problem.  I believe it is unnecessarily bureaucratic and inflexible, although he presented it in good faith as being a matter of two payments instead of one.  I think it is unnecessarily inflexible and bureaucratic in directing the repayment of these moneys in all cases.</P>
      <P>Compensation is awarded only to an unfairly dismissed employee who may be facing into a period of unemployment of unknown duration.  In relation to the earlier amendment, we saw how few of those cases result in reinstatement for one reason or another.  The employee during that period will involuntarily lose valuable social welfare credits for which he or she has paid.  That point is effective. I do not think the various adjudicative bodies under this legislation should be charged with the responsibility of deciding what, if any, portion of those payments should be repaid.</P>
      <P>Nothing in my proposal prevents the Department of Social Welfare from recouping the moneys to which it may be statutorily entitled.  I believe it to be the appropriate body to assess what, if any, amount should be repaid by the employee.  I recognise the principle and thrust of Senator Quinn's amendment but it does not allow for that flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, I believe the repayment of income tax rebates should be decided by the Revenue Commissioners.  Awards <Col N="475" /> under this legislation in excess of £6,000 are liable to taxation under the income tax code.  Reducing an award by the amount of rebate received could amount to a double taxation on the employee. Senator Quinn's amendment seeks to remove from the State the liability for those double payments.  However, we must take into account that the Employment Appeals Tribunal decided against the employers and in favour of the employees in these cases, thus it is the employers who were at fault.  I feel, as champion of the employee, that we should consider the stress, period of unemployment and uncertainty as to their future experienced by employees. It is open to the Department of Social Welfare to seek repayment of social welfare payments already received and to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to recoup any taxes for which those payments were liable.  The purpose of this legislation should not be to make us responsible for recovering these moneys.</P>

      <P>Continuity is very difficult to maintain when there is a lapse of some weeks, but I will try not to repeat the points I made on the previous occasion.  There was much criticism of the amount of money spent in Dublin but I made the point, very graphically, about the population of Dublin and the need to provide proper infrastructure there. There are other points I wish to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to financial uncertainty we were unable to plan for the medium and long term needs of the national roads.  This task was left to local authorities.  It seems a little unfortunate to say the least that when we now have a guaranteed source of funding through the Structural Funds, we are setting up the National Roads <Col N="476" /> Authority.  I know the Minister will reassure me that there is no implied criticism of the role of local authorities or their ability to perform magnificently given sufficient finance.  I have no doubt of the need for the National Roads Authority. We need to draw up plans and secure finance so that the road structure throughout the Republic can be improved dramatically.</P>
    <P>There is a major need to upgrade the public transport system, particularly in Dublin.  I know, and am sure the Minister will reassure me, that roads will not be upgraded at the expense of public transport. A National Roads Authority which will draw up plans and identify finance for them is fine but I wish to point out that the Department of the Environment refused an application by Dublin County Council to continue construction of a roundabout which had already started on the Western Parkway, a major motorway and part of the ring road which will bypass Dublin city and county.  The council took the initiative in applying for this sanction because, although the project did not form part of the link, it was a sensible one as the completion of the Navan Road bypass would involve ripping up part of a new road.  Unfortunately, the Department of the Environment refused to allow the local authority to proceed with this small section of the Western Parkway which would have resulted in the integration of two major pieces of road infrastructure. Over the last few months part of a £36 million road has been torn up to enable the construction of the second leg of the ring road around the county to begin.</P>
    <P>I hope that the National Roads Authority will not be hindered in its work as my local authority was and that its establishment will ensure that this waste of taxpayers' money will not happen again.</P>
    <P>I do not know who the members of the National Roads Authority will be but I hope there will be some women among them.  From my experience of the area in which I live and my membership of a local authority I know that national, primary and, particularly, district distributor <Col N="477" /> roads cannot be described as &ldquo;people friendly&rdquo;.  The Minister spoke of the need for a central, single-minded, independent and far-seeing body.  I hope the authority is extremely open-minded because I would love to make my own submissions on the provision of safe pedestrian facilities, cycle ways and pedestrian underpasses which are a major concern of mine.  These existing underpasses are not safe.  In my parish there are two within a few hundred yards of one another but to walk through them late at night when the public lighting may be out of order is highly undesirable.</P>
    <P>Roads are constructed through housing estates.  Roads are necessary to enable traffic to move in and out of an area and there is a clear need for national roads of a standard which will encourage industry to invest.  I have been told by industrialists that they were attracted to an area by the road network to the industrial sites.  However, we must ensure that we do not overlook the needs of people who live in these areas.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the members of the National Roads Authority bear in mind the needs of pedestrians, those who push buggies and those who, at present, feel unsafe on many roads which, by and large, have been designed and constructed by men.</P>

      <P>I welcome many of the Bill's provisions but am concerned about others.  Irish motorists and the operators <Col N="478" /> of commercial road vehicles have to pay heavy insurance and taxation costs but they are getting a bad return for their money when road conditions are taken into account.  I welcome the improvements to the national primary roads but many more such improvements are needed on the roads the Chairman and I have to travel.</P>
      <P>In my own county there have been improvements to the national primary routes.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, recently opened the Rathkeale bypass.  One should give the positive aspects as well as the negative aspects.  However, the main area of concern is our county roads.  Having completed a Seanad campaign one is conscious of the progressive deterioration in the condition of our county roads over the last 15 years.  It is time to halt that deterioration.</P>
      <P>In my own county the county engineer made it clear that it would cost £25 million to bring the county roads of County Limerick up to the condition they were in 15 years ago.  It is frightening to contemplate that £25 million would not raise the roads above the standard of 15 years ago.  The roads in parts of our county are in extremely bad condition and in need of urgent repair; finance should be allocated for that.  Every year due to the financial position of councils less and less money is going towards county roads.  This situation must be changed.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker spoke eloquently about the roads in Dublin and the condition of many urban roads is to be praised. Surely the person in rural Ireland who is paying the same road taxes deserves at least a standard of roads &mdash; maybe not as good as in town areas &mdash; suitable for normal transportation.  Every public representative, whether a local representative, a TD or a Minister is conscious when out canvassing that one issue which arises in every area is the condition of the roads.  The roads have become progressively worse in the last 15 years, and certainly since I became a member of a local authority in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Government to allocate money for the improvement of county <Col N="479" /> roads.  Mr. Ray McSharry, when he was EC Commissioner, spoke on this subject and, at the time, argued that Structural Funds be allocated for the improvement of county roads.  I would like the Minister's response to Mr. MacSharry's suggestion at that time that a percentage of Structural Funding be dedicated towards county roads.  Urgent action is needed. The Government should be more conscious of the demand of rural people for improved county roads.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider increased allocations of funds to the local improvements scheme.  There has been a reduction in the allocation in County Limerick for the scheme over a period of years.  It is a good scheme which helps people living in remote areas not serviced directly by a public roadway.  With funds under this scheme combined with a contribution from the people themselves, access roads can be improved.  I know the Minister is keen to maintain rural Ireland.  However, to do so we must give people access to rural Ireland and to their homes.  Money allocated to the local improvement scheme to improve cul de sacs, passages where there is more than one premises, and to allow improvements in country areas, is money well spent.  It is a vote of confidence in the people of rural areas who have been the backbone of our nation.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to an issue of great concern to the public representatives of all parties in County Limerick and that is the condition of N69, the road between Limerick city and Tarbert, which is extremely bad.  It is a national secondary route but is one of the worst national secondary routes in the country.  The Government and the Taoiseach have identified the Shannon area as one of special importance for the development of industry, heavy industry in particular, and Dr. Con Power, the Taoiseach's adviser, is doing his best to attract industry. There is no doubt that the condition of the roadway I refer to is a turn off for any industrialist coming into the region.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly can bear me out on these two issues.  We have an excellent airport <Col N="480" /> at Shannon to service industry and we have an excellent port at Foynes to service the shipping industry.  The Minister for the Marine will be opening some new extensions there next Monday.  However, we have a roadway that negates these advantages.  There is a stretch of 30 miles where one could hardly overtake another vehicle, except near Askeaton where the road has been improved.</P>
    <P>We have had discussions on Limerick County Council and motions have been passed by all sides on the council &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; on this issue; we all support each other.  We have discussed the issue of upgrading the road to a national primary but that is not really our concern.  We want money to improve the road; the status of the road does not make any diffence to us.  We are afraid of spending the next ten years arguing whether it should be a national primary or national secondary road.  The former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley announced at one stage that money would be allocated to that road and it would be upgraded.  At this stage we are not interested in upgrading. We are interested in the allocation of funds to improve one of the key routes for the development of industry in the mid-west region.  We want to make it attractive to come to areas like Foynes or to the 200 acre industrial estate available for development in Askeaton.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment and his Department to look seriously at this request.  We need a comprehensive plan of improvement &mdash; an overall plan, not a plan to take a bend off here and a bend there, as has happened heretofore &mdash; immediately for the development of that road.  The plan should be drawn up and implemented.  Limerick County Council has the expertise to develop such a plan very quickly.  Let the Department cost it and then allow the funds to come through.  I ask the Minister to ask the Government to look seriously at this issue and take it off our agenda in County Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the <Col N="481" /> Minister of State to the House as it is my first occasion seeing him here.  Being from Kildare I can say that shortly my county will be known as the bypass county.  All the Senators present, except Senator McGennis, will appreciate the bypasses of Kildare.  Newbridge, Kilcullen, Naas and Maynooth in the north of the county will soon be bypassed.  Construction of those major bypasses is of great importance to the country and the people in surrounding areas greatly appreciate the amount of work done to ensure that all interest groups were treated fairly.</P>
      <P>In the south of the county, Athy will be the first town on the national section of roadway to the south.  That could be a major problem.  The Department should commence work on the inner road in Athy.  That road has been planned for many years and is considered to be of vital importance to the improvement of the road infrastructure in Kildare.  Work on intersections on the Naas dual carriageway at Rathcoole, Johnstown and Kill is due to commence and I ask the Minister to consult with interested groups in those areas regarding the location of flyovers or tunnel passes to ensure that the best possible advantage is obtained from them.  I attended a meeting of the Kill group and discovered that many of its communities believed the design and location of the intersection would not be of benefit to them.  I hope the authorities will ensure that some of the problems expressed by the different organisations at that meeting will be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing roads, Senators agree that the national roads are maintained in good condition.  It is the non-primary roads that are the problem.  Kildare, like other counties, has problems with its non-primary roads.  The Department, through the local authorities, should ensure that the rural population is not forgotten in the development of the national carriageways. County roads leading away from the national primaries should be maintained to a high standard to integrate the rural population with that of the towns and cities.  Rural populations <Col N="482" /> believe they are ignored due to the condition of the roads.</P>
    <P>When carrying out improvements to various roads the Department should allocate responsibility for their maintenance to local authorities.  Comprehensive analysis of the sites for bypasses or intersections should be carried out so we will avoid the conditions sometimes seen at laybys when used or scrap cars and other items are dumped there. Landscaping should be included in the improvements to roads.  Attention should also be given to road signs in rural areas where small communities border crossroads. Road signs there are as important as those elsewhere.  Those communities should not be deprived of the basic necessity of adequate road signs.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for attending and I hope that some of the ideas expressed in this House will bear fruit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  What I have to say on this Bill may appear parochial in some instances but there are also national issues involved.</P>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers and with the former EC Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, that 10 per cent of the funds for national primary routes should be allocated to county road structures.  The Minister would agree that the county roads structure throughout the country is falling apart.  Major funding is necessary to restore it.</P>
      <P>There are major problems in some counties with Iarnród Éireann and unattended level crossings.  When stretches of road are being widened, one usually discovers that the last section to be completed is an area where there is contention with Iarnród Éireann.  That issue should be addressed.  It amazes me that the local authority can, in most instances, deal with all local landowners but has problems with Iarnród Éireann.  I would also like to see more attention paid to level crossings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national primary route, N5, finishes in Castlebar and people in County Mayo would like to see the continuation of that road from Castlebar to Westport <Col N="483" /> upgraded to national primary route status.  The road from Swinford to Ballina should also be upgraded to national primary route status.  Ballina is the third largest town in Connacht and it is a sad state of affairs that the national primary route does not reach the town.  There is a campaign to have the road upgraded to national primary route status.  Westport is a major tourist centre and the Chamber of Commerce, Mayo County Council, Westport Urban Council and other agencies are seeking to have the road from Castlebar to Westport upgraded.</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for the imposition of national speed limits?  There is a 30 miles per hour speed limit within urban boundaries.  In exceptional cases decisions may be taken by local authorities to change the speed limit on a national route inside that boundary.  Who is responsible for imposing speed limits on national primary routes or, indeed, on other routes?  The road from Castlebar to Ballinrobe is a national secondary route and is probably one of the most dangerous roads in the country.  We are thankful to the previous Minister for the Environment Mr. Flynn, who allocated specific funding for this route.  However, we would appreciate funding for the removal of bad bends on other roads.  I wait anxiously for the Minister of State's reply.</P>

      <P>I hope the new National Roads Authority will ensure that EC funding for the development of our roads is properly spent.  The duplication and bad planning which occurred during the construction of our bypasses is a national scandal.  Some people may suggest that <Col N="484" /> this does not matter because the project is funded by the EC.</P>
      <P>A sum of £5 million was allocated for the construction of a bypass around my local town.  However, it cost almost double that amount and its design is a disgrace.  The local authority members blamed the Department of the Environment and the Department of the Environment blamed the local authority. I hope the lines of responsibility are clearly defined in this Bill and that road construction will be carried out more effectively and efficiently.</P>
      <P>People involved in the construction of roads should learn from their mistakes. Throughout the country, bypasses are badly designed and constructed and they are endangering people's lives.  This scandal should not be repeated.</P>
      <P>Considerable waste is involved in the construction of a bypass over four or five years.  As a small country we need money to develop our resources and our main roads are important.  Therefore, when we receive money we have an obligation to spend it properly.  Officials from the Department of the Environment, designers, architects and county council staff should learn from their mistakes because they have built many bad bypasses.  I say that as a person who has been a public representative for 26 years.  This practice must not continue in the interest of public safety.</P>
      <P>The bypass around my town is a continuous hazard on the road to Cork.  On average, there are three crashes a day as a result of its poor design.  A child in second class in national school would have designed it better.  I hope this mistake will not be repeated.</P>
      <P>This Bill ensures that temporary dwellings will no longer be a problem on our main roads.  However, temporary dwellings could become a problem on county roads.  I appeal for enlightened planning in this area also because when temporary dwellings are removed, weeds and dirt accumulate on the vacant land.  This land could be leased so as to reduce the maintenance cost for the local authority and to prevent the erection of temporary dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> Our spendthrift attitude to road development must be changed.  Otherwise, EC officials will say that we received money to develop our roads and to build bypasses, but we did not spend it properly.  I hope the mistakes which have been made in the last ten or 15 years will not be repeated and that the National Roads Authority will act more responsibility and be an example to the people who wish to question how the authorities spend money.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority should examine the operations of Coillte which has created many problems along main roads, particularly on the road between Cahir and Mitchelstown.  Coillte removed timber from the Galtee Mountains and damaged the water drains.  As a result, the main road became flooded. There have been many fatal accidents on that road.  Coillte damaged the road surface, but did not repair it.</P>
    <P>One Department does not care what another Department is doing.  That damage to water drains is only the tip of the iceberg, compared to the damage Coillte has done to our county roads. Subcontractors are removing the timber, without any regard for the countryside. They seem to be responsible to nobody. As a result, the money which has been allocated for the development of our county roads must be spent on repairing damage to roads.  Flooding never occurred on that road until Coillte removed the timber from the side of the Galtee mountains.  The high priests in Coillte do not seem to worry about people in rural Ireland as long as Coillte acquires its supply of timber.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority must ensure that we are not obliged to spend money unnecessarily on public roads because of the actions of an irresponsible body.  Local authorities have little money.  Therefore, our problems should not be added to by this type of activity. I hope Coillte will be reprimanded by the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>I wish the National Roads Authority every success and I hope we see better planning, management and greater value for money in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank the Senators for the enlightened and diverse views, from Senator McGennis who represents Dublin, and from Senators representing rural areas.  There certainly was much evidence of parochialism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The reason the National Roads Authority is being established is to provide an independent organisation to undertake the task of developing the national road network. These roads are a vital part of our national infrastructure and carry out 37 per cent of total road traffic.  Two thirds of this traffic is work related.  We need to spend over £3 billion to improve these roads as part of the overall effort to improve the competitiveness of the Irish economy and reduce the impact of our peripheral location in the European Community.  The National Roads Authority will co-ordinate and provide a single focus for over 30 national authorities who currently have responsibility for national roads.  Senator Cosgrave raised the issue of the independence of the National Roads Authority.  I assure the Senator that it will be an independent body with substantial functions.  It will not be a talking-shop.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority will take over all the functions currently exercised by the Department of the Environment in managing the development of the national road system.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, will continue to exercise overall policy supervision and certain judicial functions.  I assure the House that there will be no interference by the Minister or the Department in the day to day operations of the National Roads Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's role is clearly set out in the Bill.  It relates principally to the approval of the National Roads Authority's medium-term plan.  Most importantly, Exchequer funding for national roads will be in the form of a block grant <Col N="487" /> paid to the National Roads Authority. Allocation of that money to individual projects will be the prerogative of the National Roads Authority only.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis made the point about the National Roads Authority's single-mindedness and said she hoped it would be prepared to listen.  I also hope it will be prepared to listen.  It will have to publish draft plans of what it intends doing as well as inviting and considering submissions from the public.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave asked how long it would take to upgrade the national primary road network.  A target of 12 to 15 years has been set to achieve this task. Our capacity to achieve it will depend on the availability of EC funding and the capacity of the Exchequer to provide matching funds.  It is intended to have the National Roads Authority in full operation from 1 January, 1994.  Staffing will be drawn from experienced personnel in the Department's road division.</P>
    <P>The question of tolling powers was raised by a number of Senators.  Some of them expressed concern about the cost of tolls on motorists.  It has been the policy of successive Governments, drawn from virtually all parties in this House, to seek toll-based investment in roads.  It has been the consistent policy of these Governments that revenue obtained through tolling should be used for road development.  In my view logic dictates that tolling powers should be available to the National Roads Authority as part of its overall financial powers which include the power to allocate State grants, borrow money and promote EC investment in national roads.  I would remind the House, however, that this is not an unfettered power.  The authority is obliged to consult fully with the appropriate local authority and consider any views expressed by it.  There is a public consultation process.  The Minister must hold a public local inquiry into any objections and tolls cannot be levied without ministerial approval.  Senators should also note that the scope for tolling in this country is very limited and that there are no projects on national roads which could <Col N="488" /> be fully funded by toll-based private investment.  All would need a contribution from Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn made a number of points about the importance of roads for industrial competitiveness and suggested that we need to accelerate our development programme partly by generating private funding.  When looking at private funding there are two possible options: toll-financed private investment or some form of loan finance.  As I mentioned already, the scope of private toll-based investment is very limited for two reasons: we do not have the traffic volumes or the mileage of motorway type roads suitable for tolling.  East Link and West Link are the only toll facilities we have to date.  Indeed, motorists coming from Wexford have to pay substantial sums when they cross the East Link bridge as they do when going to Croke Park.  Toll proposals for the Dublin ring road proved unacceptable to Dublin County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> While negotiations on possible toll-based investment in the Newbridge and Kilcullen by-passes did not reach a satisfactory conclusion, mainly because the likely level of private funding available was small compared to the total cost and the likely diversion of traffic onto secondary roads.</P>
      <P>Regarding loan finance, the major concern is the cost of borrowing.  Private money is, of course, available, but should we borrow it at a cost greater than direct Exchequer borrowing?  Our investment programme is also influenced by the availability of funding to match EC finance. The National Roads Authority will have both tolling and borrowing powers and will be able to look afresh at the question of funding.  I hope when the Authority considers the possibility of tolling it will have full consultation with the local authorities involved and that the Minister can also intercede if he so wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Quinn, Daly and others commented on the role of the executive chairman. <Col N="489" /> We might be in a position to return to that on Committee Stage when they can outline their views more clearly. Annual reports were also referred to and I would point out that the National Roads Authority will be duty bound to present its annual report not later than 30 June each year.  That answers Senator Quinn's question.  Senator Finneran expressed a concern that the west and midlands would not be ignored in developing the national road network.  I can assure him this is not the case, and that when the next road programme is published he will find substantial investment proposed in those areas.  I want to assure Senator McGowan that I share his call for a balanced approach to road development. We do, of course, have to start somewhere and that means concentrating first on the roads with the worst traffic capacity problems and bottlenecks.  Generally, one would expect the National Roads Authority to develop the road network on a fair and equitable basis and to ensure that all sectors of the country are suitably serviced.</P>
    <P>As regards representation on the National Roads Authority, the Bill provides that members must have had wide experience of roads, transport, industrial, commercial, financial, or environmental matters, local government, the organisation of workers, or administration. Members will be chosen for their personal skills and not as representatives of particular organisations or interests or indeed political parties.  It is very important that we have a range of expertise and experience on the Authority, and that it will not be made up of political hacks.  When the board is set up Senators will see that the National Roads Authority will comprise people suitably qualified to perform the duties involved.</P>
    <P>There were many calls during the debate for increased assistance for regional and county roads, including pleas from Senator Gallagher about the roads in Cavan, Senator Cotter in relation to roads in Monaghan and Senator McGowan in relation to roads in Donegal.  In addition to increased funding for national roads and notwithstanding <Col N="490" /> the constraints on Government since 1987 in our efforts to restore balance to the public finances, substantial extra funding has been provided for non-national roads.  Total grants to local authorities for the maintenance and improvement of regional and county roads were increased from £40.5 million in 1986 to over £75.3 million in 1993, an increase of over 85 per cent and well ahead of the rate of price increases.  The discretionary grant allocation to local authorities of £182.4 million provided for non-national roads in the three years 1989-91 was significantly ahead of the target of £150 million which the Government had initially promised for that period.  In 1993 funding is again being provided for non-national roads which is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to the improvement of the road network considering the Exchequer constraints.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a particular point in relation to Cavan/Monaghan.  Some £5 million is being provided this year in the form of a supplementary grant for improvement works on non-national roads of which over 20 per cent is being allocated to Cavan and Monaghan county councils, so they are obviously getting priority.  Other politicians around the country may not be happy about that but, because of the serious road situation in those countries it was important to provide an increased allocation to help bring local road standards up to those of the rest of the country.  There is also a special provision for pilot projects in this year's allocation.  The provision, which is over and above the normal rate of grants for non-national roads, is intended for pilot projects in counties Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan which will evaluate and implement new mechanisms and work practices designed to enhance the output from funds available for regional and county roads.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of comment about EC Structural Funds.  This is an area in which both the Minister and the Taoiseach have taken a keen interest.  Much has been said about the former EC Commissioner Mr. MacSharry's comments that 10 per cent of European funding <Col N="491" /> should be made available for county roads.  The Minister has been involved in discussions in Brussels in relation to this proposal.  There is a tendency in Brussels to provide moneys directly for primary roads and not county roads.  The Senator can rest assured that the Minister is doing his utmost to secure funding for county roads to ensure that their current standard is improved.  This is important when there is so much emphasis on the development of tourism as part of our economic development.</P>
    <P>The question of reclassifying roads to national status was raised by Senator McGowan.  Before formally establishing the National Roads Authority, there will be a complete review of national roads classification.  Roads serving the State airports and the designated key commercial seaports will be classified as national if they are not classified as such already. The review will also look at what other changes are required to take account of new road construction, changed traffic management arrangements and changed traffic patterns.  Requests for reclassification are regularly received and are carefully examined.  However, there is already an extensive network of national primary and secondary roads, so reclassifications will be made on a selective basis only to carry out works.  Urban authorities have powers to control the activities of the ESB, Telecom Éireann and An Bord Gáis.  I would like to see them implementing the powers they have on a more regular basis to ensure that roads are kept up to standard, and to avoid wastage of funds on road openings three or four times a year by different State bodies.  There should be co-ordination in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell made a number of valuable points in relation to using the valuable expertise of the local authorities, the VAT treatment of local authority work, the importance of increased investment in non-national roads and the problem associated with getting planning permission on certain roads.  The 1982 guidelines from the Department suggest a very restrictive approach to development <Col N="492" /> along national roads, especially national primary roads.  This restrictive approach does not apply to regional or local roads.</P>
    <P>Most county councils allow for certain exceptions to the departmental guidelines in accordance with criteria which they have built into the county development plan.  It is important that where major roads are leading to ports and airports this will be seriously considered. Adding roads willy nilly would also dilute the available funding for the network and would not be in the long term interests of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised a number of issues in relation to the contracting of work.  Many county councils have begun to contract out road improvement works on national roads.  In many cases some of the work is contracted out and the local authority also carries out some of the work because they already have the manpower and the machinery, and it is important that a balance be struck in that area.</P>
    <P>Road openings were mentioned by a number of Senators.  This area becomes very contenious when Telecom Éireann, the ESB and An Bord Gáis all open the roads at different times.  This should continue because people want to live in their own area and build on their own land.  It is important to define situations in the county development plans to ensure that this can continue.</P>
    <P>The problem of temporary dwellings was mentioned.  All the powers in sections 69 to 71 in the National Roads Authority Bill can be exercised by local authorities and by the gardaí to remove people from temporary dwellings. Unauthorised trading and dangerous trees are also a major cause of concern.  I assure Senator Sherlock that the National Safety Council dealing with roads, fire and water safety is very active in this area.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that each county should keep its own motor tax collection. That would not be in the best interests of local authorities in the long term because local authorities get substantially more in State road grants than they collect in road tax.  This year less than £2 million will be <Col N="493" /> collected in motor tax while State road grants amount to £340 million.</P>
    <P>Questions in regard to speed limits, land acquisition and sign posting have been raised and we will take the points made back to the Department which will communicate directly with the Senators who raised them.  Iarnród Éireann was mentioned.  I have a lot of problems with Iarnród Éireann in my own county. Iarnród Éireann seems to think that the Government is loaded with money while they maintain that they do not have any. The area of level crossings and warning signs needs to be examined.  I will discuss this issue and the question of speed limits with my officials.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have expressed concern about the role local authorities will play when the National Road Authority is set up.  I assure Senators that the local authorities will continue to play a major role in the development of the national roads.  They have the expertise and the experience, and the National Roads Authority will continue to call on their staff to design roads, prepare contract documents, supervise construction and carry out maintenance.  The mandate of the National Roads Authority will extend to the ongoing maintenance of national networks.  There is no point spending money on new roads if we fail to maintain those already built.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly raised the questions of lay-bys, picnic facilities and landscaping. Picnic sites might be used for temporary dwellings and roadside trading.  Around the country designated picnic sites or caravan sites seem to be taken over by roadside traders and this is not in the best interests of the local areas.  That is the only reservation I have on this issue.</P>
    <P>The possibility of advertising in local papers was also raised.  This was discussed in great detail in the Dáil and it is something I will consider when framing regulations to implement the Bill.  The suggestion was also made that a non-driver should be appointed to the National Roads Authority.  It is now Government policy that 40 per cent of the board members of State bodies should be <Col N="494" /> women.  We hope the National Roads Authority will adhere to this policy.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan made a number of comments on the importance of by-passes and signposting in highlighting special features of by-passed towns which would encourage visitors to come to these towns.  Senator Wall spoke about Kildare becoming a by-passed county.  The Department will have to seriously consider this issue when by-passes are being built.  There are a number of these by-passes in Wexford and some of the towns seem to suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>The question of overlap of functions was also raised.  I hope there will be no overlap of functions.  The National Roads Authority will take over the management functions currently exercised by the Department of the Environment.  It will also have the power to ensure that road planning and other policy areas are properly co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly mentioned travellers camping on the new Bunratty by-pass. The encampment of travellers on our main high speed roads has long been recognised as a problem.  Section 69 of this Bill gives local authorities and the Garda effective powers to remove temporary dwellings from motorways, protected roads and national roads, and I think this provision should go a long way towards eliminating the problem from the high speed roads.  I speak from personal experience when I say that it may take a little more than a section of the Bill to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the subject of the Limerick by-pass and said that this road had been constructed on extremely poor, boggy ground.  It is expected that some sections of the road will deteriorate after a number of years.  Works are to be carried out this year on the sections of the Ennis dual carriageway which should eliminate the problems which Senator Daly raised.  I do not understand why a recently constructed by-pass should have to be resurfaced so soon after construction, even allowing for the extremely boggy ground.  This should have been taken into account at the time of construction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> Facilities for cyclists and effective action on roadside vegetation were discussed. Section 68 of the Bill gives local authorities powers to provide cycleways while section 70 gives them improved powers to deal with roadside trees and vegetation.  A number of Senators, including Senator McGennis, raised the issue of cyclists and I would like to see this area improved because we have not done enough to make our roads safe for cyclists.</P>
    <P>I have responded as best I can to the issues raised by Senators.  I hope that on Committee Stage Senators will introduce amendments and we can discuss them fully to see how we can improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>Many of the points raised by Senator McGennis about improved public transport, better facilities for cyclists and pedestrians, concerns about personal security and so on are being dealt with by the Dublin Transport Initiative.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Senator Neville that the condition of the N69 road will not be allowed become an impediment to the future development of the Shannon Estuary.  The local issues raised by Senators will be considered by the Department and I hope they will get a response.  The points raised by Senator Wall about Athy and the location of the Naas Road interchanges and the comments made by other speakers will also be considered by the Department.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to Border roads and trans-European routes and, with other Senators, he made a strong case for county road investment.  He particularly referred to the Border roads and, as he said, funding is available under the EC Interreg initiative.  I expect that this initiative will continue in the next round of Structural Funds.  As I mentioned earlier, general funding for county roads has increased substantially in the Border counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney also argued for the improvement of the Belfast-Dublin-Rosslare route and I have to support that as the route ends in Rosslare.  It is one of <Col N="496" /> our highest priorities for investment and the Minister for the Environment recently announced approval for the Balbriggan section of the route.  He also referred to the inclusion of the N16 in the trans-European network proposals.  This route will be part of the finally approved trans-European network and thereby eligible for Cohesion Fund assistance.  The N16 will be upgraded in due course but probably not to motorway standard.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat that Senators put much thought, effort and work into the Bill. The Department of the Environment would incur a large expenditure bill if we were to spend all the money requested by the Senators, especially in relation to rural Ireland.  It is important that the National Roads Authority and the Department strike a balance to ensure that the roads not only in Dublin but in rural areas are upgraded and developed, giving easier access to this country and allowing people in industry to transport their goods to the European market of 320 million people as quickly as possible. I hope we can continue to work on this Bill and get Committee Stage through the Seanad as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann condemns the proposed 2 per cent probate tax believing it to be unfair, unjust and inequitable; and calls upon the Minister for Finance to withdraw this proposal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Ahern, to Seanad Eireann.  This is my first opportunity to do so since I was <Col N="497" /> elected to the Seanad and he was reappointed to the Department of Finance. I wish him every success in a very difficult task.</P>
    <P>To demonstrate the seriousness with which we in Fine Gael view this proposed 2 per cent probate tax, every member of our group in the Seanad has put their names to this motion, to which Senator Wright has tabled an amendment.  Any tax imposed by the Oireachtas must be and must be seen to be equitable and fair. It must also take into account a person's ability to pay.  The proposed 2 per cent probate tax fails to meet these criteria in every respect.  To exacerbate the situation, it hits people when they are most vulnerable, following the death of a family member.</P>
    <P>The intent of this motion is to alert the Minister and the Government to the dangers inherent in the direction in which they are headed.  The probate tax is a matter of concern in itself but the wording of the amendment tabled on behalf of the Government is alarming.  The amendment confirms that the members of Fianna Fáil and Labour approve the introduction of this tax.  The amendment broadens the existing narrow base for taxing inheritances.  Its implications are far-reaching and appear to go further than originally contemplated by the Minister. Is the amendment to be taken as an indication of the Government's intention to further increase the already substantial tax liabilities arising on death?</P>
    <P>Inheritance tax is currently levied on estates at a rate commencing at 20 per cent and rising to 55 per cent.  The thresholds vary from £11,450 for a stranger in blood to £171,750 for a son or daughter. This can be a severe tax burden on a family property.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the following amounts were paid in capital taxes: capital acquisitions tax, £49.9 million; capital gains tax, £49.1 million and residential property tax, £5.7 million.  A total of £103.07 million was received in capital taxes in 1991.  Capital taxes as a percentage of total taxes in that year amounted to 1.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the percentage of estate, inheritance and gift <Col N="498" /> taxes for 1990 in the following countries: Australia, nil; Canada, nil; France, I per cent; Japan, 1.4 per cent; New Zealand, 0.3 per cent; Sweden, 0.2 per cent; Britain 0.7 per cent and the United States 1 per cent.  Compared to those countries Ireland has the highest rate of capital taxes and it will rise considerably with the proposed 2 per cent probate tax.</P>
    <P>The Government has gone to great lengths to create the impression that the probate tax will affect those with substantial wealth only.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This tax will affect people of modest means and on low incomes.  An estate, at death, worth more than £10,000 will be liable for this tax.</P>
    <P>The tax will affect all sections of the community, from owners of local authority houses to owners of large properties and it may affect people drawing social welfare benefits.  In small estates, where until now no liability arose, probate tax will become payable.  For example, on the death of a widowed person, a married son with two children residing in the family home.  and drawing an invalidity pension of £125.60 per week will become liable for probate tax if the estate is worth over £10,000.  Only where there is a surviving spouse is the family resident exempt.  However, where there is no surviving spouse, probate tax becomes payable where the income of a son or daughter exceeds £3,877 per annum.  An individual who comes within the income tax net will be liable for probate tax in almost all instances.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter carefully because I do not believe it was intended that a son or daughter, residing in the family home, would be liable for this probate tax.  It is unfair that people on low incomes should be liable for this tax.</P>
    <P>Significant progress was made in the 1970s with the abolition of death duties. The Government is now proposing to reintroduce a death tax in addition to existing capital taxes.  Under the proposed tax regulations payment of the tax must be made at a time of filing the Revenue Commissioner's affidavit, prior to the issue of the grant of probate or the grant of letters of administration.  In <Col N="499" /> effect, this amounts to payment of tax on an asset not yet in the possession of the intended beneficiary.  The assets of a deceased person are frozen until the grant of probate or administration has issued from the Probate Office.  In most cases, payment of the tax by the due date will require the intended beneficiary to borrow from a financial institution.  If a bank grants such a loan then interest must be paid to the bank.  The beneficiaries, therefore, pay tax and accumulate interest perhaps on an asset from which they have not yet received benefit.</P>
    <P>Discounts are provided for people in a position to make an early payment. However, the penalty for late payment of an interest rate of 15 per cent, is severe.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern offers some consolation by way of postponement in cases of illiquidity.</P>
    <P>This probate tax takes no account of the ability of the surviving members of a family to discharge their liabilities.  At present, there is no inheritance tax on benefits between husband and wife, but a surviving spouse now becomes liable to probate tax on all property passing, except a family home.  This is a regrettable and retrograde move and shows how wrong this tax is.</P>
    <P>May I outline two examples of how this tax would affect people.  A wife may receive the full benefit on the death of her husband on assets as follows: a house worth £40,000; a farm worth £150,000; a milk quota worth £45,000; stock worth £32,000; farm machinery worth £10,000; and a motor car worth £8,000, totalling £285,000.  Liabilities may be as follows: a term loan £15,000; an overdraft of £10,000; funeral expenses of £5,000, totalling £30,000.  The net estate, excluding the house, would be worth £215,000.  The widow will be liable for probate tax of £4,300 according to the new regulations.</P>
    <P>At present, a son or daughter receiving the full benefit of a family farm on the death of a father may inherit assets as follows: a house worth £40,000; farm worth £400,000; milk cows worth £64,000; dry stock worth £40,000, farm machinery worth £20,000; and a motor <Col N="500" /> car worth £10,000, totalling assets of £574,000 and liabilities as follows: a term loan of £40,000; an overdraft £20,000; and funeral expenses of £5,000 totalling £65,000.  The net estate including the house would amount to £509,000.  The inheritance tax chargeable on that farm would amount to £44,000.  That is a lot of money to borrow against a business and a farm is a business.  Stock or assets may have to be sold.</P>
    <P>This is a blanket tax.  It is using a hammer where there is no need to do so. In the interest of fair play, justice and equity, I ask the Minister to reconsider this tax because the Government did not understand its full implications when adopting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  After listening to the proposer of the motion, who gave some good examples towards the end of his speech of some of the effects this tax would have, I hope the Minister will agree that it is unjust, unfair and inequitable and will remove it from the Finance Bill.  It is a particularly mean measure.  After much consultation, the capital acquisitions tax applying to gifts and inheritances was reorganised by the current Taoiseach in 1990.  The thresholds were index-linked and it was then reckoned to be a fair measure.  Now the Government is trying to wipe out this fairness by introducing a 2 per cent probate tax.  It is an insensitive tax and we are convinced that it is also unfair and inequitable.  This proposal indicates that this Government intends to be a high spending Government and therefore, a high tax Government.  This is a good example of reaching into empty pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are aware that in many cases, the value of family inheritances exists on paper only.  There is often no liquidity and the business or farm transferred is only worth what it can produce in terms of a decent wage.  In many cases there are heavy debts attached.  More pressure is being put on the business sector by this tax because most large paper-valued inheritances emanate from there.  In many cases, this will make it impossible for the person who receives the inheritances <Col N="501" /> to continue the business and will force them to sell the inheritance in order to pay the tax because the Revenue Commissioners will not waive liability in these cases.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister take a back door and a sleight of hand approach towards inheritance tax?  If he interfered with the percentage and thresholds set in 1990 by the Taoiseach, there would probably be an uproar.  There is much discontent out there, but it is not organised. I know, from talking to people that it is regarded as a bad and poorly judged tax.  I have not seen any organised body of people protesting outside Leinster House over this tax, but there was discontent over the inheritance tax in 1990, which was reckoned initially to be valid and that is why it was changed.  Now the Government are wiping out whatever benefits introduced at that time in order to get extra revenue from this sensitive area.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that this tax is being imposed and it seems that the Minister intends to go ahead with it.  This gives us an indication of what this Government may do over the next three years.  It has increased taxation this year by imposing a 1 per cent income levy on workers and has already sold State assets and intends to put the proceeds into the current account, which is like someone with a business selling off a piece of it to pay the wage bill.  It seems that this Government is operating without any logical base and will go to any lengths to get extra revenue &mdash; no matter what source it comes from &mdash; in order to increase its expenditure.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago &mdash; I am not sure of the date &mdash; the Taoiseach refused to consider reform of the taxation system.  I forget the exact phrase he used, but he decided that reorganising the tax system and examining the relationship between high taxation and unemployment was unworthy of discussion.  If that is to be the approach of this Government to the economy, we are going to have a bad three years.  I hope the strong indications we have received this year from the Finance Bill and the budget will not be borne out.</P>
    <P>I am happy to second this motion and <Col N="502" /> I hope the Minister will carefully examine the examples given by the proposer, look at the inequity of the proposal and see that this tax is a backdoor approach to changing the capital acquisitions tax which was reorganised in 1990.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves of the introduction of the probate tax, as announced in the Budget and as provided for in the Finance Bill, 1993, on the grounds that it will broaden in a socially responsible way the existing narrow base for taxing inheritances and will contribute towards the maintenance and improvement of the Government's social and other programmes within prudent budgetary parameters.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I took time to read this amendment because its wording is well balanced and it indicates &mdash; it is hardly necessary, given the paucity of some of the arguments we have heard &mdash; just how much publicity there has been about this proposal and how ill-founded are some of the comments.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is proposing the introduction of an additional tax and in one sense, I agree with them.  Like most people, I have a near pathological dislike of paying tax.  I understand income tax was introduced as a temporary measure to pay for the Napoleonic wars in another administration. I am not enamoured with VAT, the road excise tax or the other levies placed on my income.  When I look at my modest Senator's salary at the end of every month having toiled as a hardworking legislator, I know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Roche should come over to this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;why I feel aggrieved about tax.  Tax is the price we pay for living in a civilised society.  That phrase almost brings a smile to Irish lips.  It is emblazoned across the headquarters of <Col N="503" /> the IRS in Washington DC.  The reality is that Ireland still has a tax base which is much too narrow.  Privately we accept that position but publicly we posture that we do not accept it.  It is particularly narrow on the capital side.  Privately we know that is the case.</P>
      <P>This proposal will increase, in a modest way, the total yield from capital taxes. A relatively modest 2 per cent charge subject to some fairly wide ranging exemptions, will be introduced and it will yield approximately £10-11 million in a full year.  That is a measure of the relatively low level of impact of that tax.  For example, in relation to the family home, the tax will deal appropriately with intergenerational wealth transfers which are not currently dealt with in the tax system and there is a very generous threshold of £171,000 per child per parent for inheritance tax.</P>
      <P>The tax arrangements being proposed by the Minister cannot be regarded as regressive.  They are directly related to wealth transfer.  They cannot be portrayed as having a disincentive effect as Senator Cotter and Senator Enright have suggested.  There has been a great deal of pleading about this particular measure in contributions in this House and elsewhere. It has been argued that the exemptions from inheritance tax should be applied in probate tax.  That bankrupt proposition has not been put forward by either of the speakers to this motion but it has been put forward by some of their colleagues.  On the surface that proposition seems to have some superficial merit but if one analysed it one would realise that it would not mean any broadening of the capital tax system.  Rather it would increase the level of capital tax and it would be no more than a <i>de facto</i> increase in the level of inheritance tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been made of the impact of probate tax and a lurid and inaccurate picture has been put forward here tonight in some of the examples.  If I were taking those viewpoints I would not put forward those examples.  The argument that it is an extraordinary imposition on somebody who receives an inheritance of £0.25 <Col N="504" /> million and has to pay £4,000 in tax does not stand up.  Coming as I do from a very modest background I do not accept that argument on the basis of justice or equity in relation to somebody who inherits £600,000 and has to pay £44,000 in tax.</P>
    <P>A great deal of political trumpeting regarding exemptions has been downright dishonest.  One can expect politicians to make political capital when the opportunity presents itself.  However there remains a fundamental responsibility on politicians dealing with an issue such as this to be honest with themselves and with the wider constituency and to deal with the considerations in a balanced way.  This has not happened.  Much of the political hype which has attended this relatively modest taxation proposal has not been fair or reasonable.  This annoys me because it has caused undue alarm in sections of the community which are weak and should not be misinformed.</P>
    <P>It is also important that politicans are conscious of the impact that comment will have on people at a sensitive time. The hysterical claims of the Opposition are shown for what they are when the full range of exemptions is considered.  These will ensure a much fairer distribution of the tax burden.  There is, for example, full exemption for the family home where the deceased is survived by a spouse, irrespective of whether the home is left to the spouse.  Where there is no surviving spouse the share of the home that passes to the dependent child or the relatives is also exempt.  That is hardly an unfair imposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are empowered to arrange payment by instalment in cases of lack of liquidity.  Senator Cotter made a valid point about the liquidity aspect but there is provision in these arrangements that will allow for cases of illiquidity to be dealt with at the discretion of Revenue Commissioners.  This is a good way to do it because this kind of discretion is being introduced.  It is appropriate that it should be handled in a non-political way and outside the partisan <i>mêlée</i> of politics. In cases of illiquidity or hardship interest due on late payments can also be waived where it is deemed appropriate by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is unfair and untrue to suggest that the imposition will be as it has been portrayed.</P>
      <P>Where deferred payments are allowed early payment of the tax will give rise to a discount on the tax liability and this compensates for the small interest cost in bridging finance needed to pay the tax. That is a reasonable point that has not been dealt with.  There will be exemptions for pension benefits, charitable bequests, heritage property and the proceeds of section 60 insurance policies, which can be used to pay inheritance or probate tax.  That was a concern which was validly raised when the issue first arose in the course of the budget.  Probate tax will be allowed as an expense in calculating inheritance tax so there is a write off element.  There will be special relief to exempt estates from a double charge of probate tax where both spouses die in quick succession and that is a particularly sensible provision.</P>
      <P>The total imposition of this tax will yield £11 million per year.  I wish, in common with all politicians, that we could improve services and provide all that public administration should provide without some imposition.  The reality, that we all know to be the truth, is that there is an extremely narrow tax base in this country and that is also true of capital and other areas of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This tax is not the thin end of the wedge.  Senator Enright expressed concern in that regard and I know it is a concern felt in the community.  I will <Col N="506" /> leave this for the Minister to deal with but I do not believe that is correct.  Senator Enright exaggerated his concern and the impact of the tax.  For example, he mentioned the case of a person inheriting £100,000.  After exemptions the total tax burden would be £2,000 and by no standard can that be regarded as excessive.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter made a specific point when he spoke about the impact of the tax on business.  Transfers within the business community are generally lifetime transfers and they are not included in the proposal.  There has been a series of misinformation and disinformation about this relatively narrow taxation proposal. It is the kind of politics in which we all engage to our discredit.  There is no such things as a free lunch or a free service.  The reality is that all the services provided by the State have to be financed.  Senator Cotter used the old Thatcherite phrase, high tax, high spending.  He should be honest and indicate the services that he would cut because until he is prepared to do so he is not entitled to make that claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Senator Roche's contribution one would almost be convinced of the merit of this proposal. I do not dispute Senator Roche's hypothesis that the State must levy tax to pay for services and that it most provide for its citizens.  That is not in dispute but what is in dispute is the method of doing it and if this is the most appropriate way. In my view this is not the most appropriate method.  This proposal reintroduces estate duty and some of us remember what was done to families in former days and the measures they had to take in order to minimise their liability under a previous estate duty.  People of a particular age will remember people losing their houses as a result of that legislation.  Because it was so inequitable it was abolished and a different system, the capital acquisition tax, was put in place in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having instituted a system of capital taxation, it is proposed to add another tax to that already there.  Estate duty never was an appropriate way of dealing <Col N="507" /> with capital taxes and that is why it was abolished.  In these circumstances one most be conscious of the vulnerability of families at times of great distress.</P>
    <P>Even if one accepted the principle of the tax and I do not, an exemption of £10,000 is derisory.  If a person has a reasonable car, some furniture and a little money in the bank, he will have this tax levied on him.  It is contrary to all good practice and the philosophy of encouraging people to generate wealth for the good of their country.</P>
    <P>If what my colleague, Deputy Cox, said in the Dáil is correct the level of taxation would go up by a factor of 560 per cent.  Today £10,000 is not a great deal of money.  Even if one accepts the principle of the tax, which I do not, the threshold at which it becomes operable is far too low.</P>
    <P>In the present circumstances, given the rhetoric from the Government, one could intellectually decide one was not going to pay the tax and see what the Revenue Commissioners would say.  &ldquo;Intellectualism&rdquo; seems to be an in-phrase at the moment.  One can intellectually commit oneself to various actions but in practice one will not have to follow through.</P>
    <P>The Minister has instituted a system of discount for early payment, and that is welcome but that principle could be more widely applied.  County councils have used it to good effect when it came to water rates and refuse charges.  Instituting a discount system has helped to collect the money.  We must give credit to the Minister for that.</P>
    <P>Farmers have particular difficulties under this tax system.  The land is part of a farmer's stock-in-trade; without it one cannot farm.  It is inequitable to levy tax on part of the assets of the business.  The effect of this and the capital acquisitions tax has been, and will be, to divide farms. That is totally contrary to all good practice and the national interest.  It is revisiting upon us a system which operated during the famine and penal times.  A civilised society should not bring back such a tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> From where will the cash come for these taxes?  A person with a large bank account will not have any difficulty paying this tax but the majority of those subject to this tax will have to raise the money from their banks.  At present banks are not prepared to advance money.  That has added to the distress of the bereaved families.</P>
    <P>When it comes to probate tax on farm land, I urge the Minister, when determining the capital value of the estate, to give the same relief as operates for capital acquisitions tax.  I also recommend a transfer to a spouse be exempt under probate tax as it is under capital acquisitions tax.  If a tax must be paid it should be deferred until the property has passed to the next generation.  Many people have made joint ownership arrangements and in those circumstances I do not imagine that tax will arise.  Nevertheless where that has not happened it is a good principle that a transfer from spouse to spouse be exempt.</P>
    <P>The question of indexation arises.  A thought struck me during Senator Roche's contribution.  I can imagine the First Lord of the Treasury when he proposed the introduction of income tax, saying this would be forever and a day at a low rate of 1, 2 or 3 per cent.  I am sure he said it in good faith as I am sure the Minister is saying this tax will never be higher than 2 per cent.  However, we all know real life does not work like that. A 2 per cent rate progressively becomes 3 per cent or 4 per cent and soon it will be 10 per cent.  That is another reason for being prudent and cautious about this tax.</P>
    <P>The probate tax should be taken as a full tax credit against inheritance tax and there should be no double taxation.  In his budget address the Minister said it remained the position that many inheritances passed from one generation to the next without incurring any tax liability. While full taxation of these inheritances may not be warranted, it is certainly true in current economic circumstances that a small charge can easily be justified but the inference was that there should not be double taxation on estates passing by <Col N="509" /> way of inheritance.  In the Finance Bill, probate tax charged on an estate is allowed as an expense in computing inheritance tax.  I argue that to prevent double taxation of estates it is essential that the probate tax charged on an estate is allowed as a full tax credit against any inheritance tax liability.</P>
    <P>A difficulty of taxes of this nature is they have the effect of running down the assets of the business.  Parts of the business will have to be sold and eventually it will not be sustainable.  That is the logic of this tax.  The State should not be party to anything which leads to assets being dissipated in this way.  We should be encouraging people to accumulate wealth because in doing so they will be providing the jobs and the energy to make the economy grow, which will be to the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the wording of the amendment.  Even if one were to approve of the introduction of the tax, to say that it would broaden in a socially responsible way the existing narrow base for taxing inheritances flies in the face of logic.  It is not socially responsible.  Quite the contrary, it will lead to hardship for people who should not be subject to such problems. We should look at other means of levying the taxes required to run the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I formally second the amendment proposed by Senator Roche.</P>
      <P>This year's budget and Finance Bill work towards the tax reform target set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government by improving the position of the low paid through increases in exemption limits and allowances.  The 2 per cent probate tax is in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody likes any tax.  In history when the dreaded sheriffs came around people tried to hide their money.  Increases in health, social welfare and other benefits must be paid for by taxation as neither the Minister nor the Department of Finance receives manna from heaven.  Senator Roche spoke about the probate tax and the exemptions that apply to it.  I am <Col N="510" /> concerned that the budget be balanced. If sources of revenue are removed from the budget, what items of expenditure will be removed or curtailed to balance this?  Will the increase in children's allowance be paid and will extra houses be built?  If the probate tax is removed money will have to be found elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The probate tax is fair.  Many inheritances have passed from one generation to another without incurring any tax liability due to the generous exemption threholds for capital acquisitions tax which amount to £171,750 for a transfer from parent to child.  The probate tax takes due account of ability to pay.  In the case of estates which may be regarded as non-liquid assets, no interest will accrue on unpaid tax until nine months after the date of death.  In cases of real hardship the postponement of payment may include the total waiver of interest.  The Bill allows the Revenue Commissioners considerable discretion in adjusting the terms of payment to take account of the circumstances of each estate paying an inheritance.</P>
    <P>Property transferred before death will be exempt from probate tax.  This encourages lifetime transfers of farms and there are positive measures in the budget and in this Bill which will enhance this objective. Farms and businesses should be transferred by parents during their lifetime. However it is often not practicable for two people to co-manage a holding as they may have conflicting ideas.  Lifetime transfers, which will not be liable for probate tax, should be encouraged so that younger people can assume responsibility for the development of the farm or business.</P>
    <P>I am glad full exemption in respect of the family home is allowed where the deceased is survived by a spouse irrespective of whether the spouse inherits the house.  Where there is no surviving spouse the share of the family home that passes to dependent children or relatives will also be exempt from probate tax. Any debts outstanding on the family home may be deducted from payments of tax due on other assets of the estate. Senator Roche mentioned already that <Col N="511" /> probate tax is not levied on the death of a person whose spouse has died within the previous five years.</P>
    <P>This tax, like any other tax, will be resisted by many people but do people like paying PAYE at a rate of 48p in the pound or a 1 per cent levy?  People do not like paying tax but taxes are needed to run the country.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the reliefs and exemptions, the very modest rate of tax and the special arrangements for problems with payments, I am satisfied that the provisions of the probate tax suitably balance the need to protect people from hardship with the need to ensure a fair distribution of the inheritance tax burden.  For the great majority of estates probate tax will involve a charge of less than £1,000 and for over half of all estates the amount payable will be less than £500.  I second the amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I support the amendment to the motion put forward by Senator Enright and Senator Cotter. Where the deceased was domiciled in the State all assets left in a will or in intestacy are liable to probate tax.  Where the deceased was not domiciled in the State only assets situated in the State are liable for tax.  Debts owing at the time of death such as funeral expenses are allowed against tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a farmer and am well aware of the problems that were associated with inheritance tax and capital acquisitions tax.  These taxes stifled agriculture in the early 1980s because the inevitable transfer of land was delayed in the hope that the Government would deal with the situation or that the tax problem would go away.  It took us far too long to realise the seriousness of the problem.  People who owned land or a business were older and less energetic usually than young <Col N="512" /> people who generally had a better standard of education.  This problem was alleviated in 1990 with changes in the inheritance and capital acquisition taxes.</P>
    <P>The former estate tax has been mentioned. The highest rate at which this tax was charged was 55 per cent whereas probate tax is charged at a rate of 2 per cent.  The exemptions are clear and have been mentioned by my two colleagues. I support this amendment because the probate tax broadens the tax base.  A broader tax base is important and was recommended in the Culliton report and is an integral part of the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress.</i>  The changes in the inheritance and capital acquisitions taxes gave some leeway to the Department of Finance.  The targeted yield from the probate tax is £10 million or £11 million.  The number of house transfers at any one time shows that the amount of tax levied on any one individual will not be large.</P>

      <P>That is not relevant to this issue.  We will discuss that another day.  An example on the back page of the probate self-assessment form shows that a £97,000 estate passing under will or intestacy is only liable for £314.50 in probate tax.  It is not every day that houses are transferred on the death of the owner. The probate tax will encourage lifetime transfers of property.  This tax is fair and equitable because it broadens the tax base.</P>
      <P>As a farmer, I had to take out an insurance policy in 1990.  I was worried that my father might die before I was able to take out the policy as I would then have been left with a heavy financial burden. Since then this problem has been resolved.  The alleviation is not wholly due to changes in the thresholds but also to a decline in the value of property. Every tax is unwelcome and it is essential that this tax is reasonably fair and equitable. I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their welcome to the House and I appreciate their comments. I want to thank Senator Enright for giving me the opportunity to address some of these important issues.</P>
      <P>The introduction of any new tax is bound to give rise to some questions among the tax paying public.  Regrettably, since this tax is the only new one in this budget, there have been misinformed statements emanating from certain politicians and, particularly, exaggerated claims about the effects of the probate tax on family businesses and farmers.  These only serve to cause unnecessary fears and anxieties in the minds of many taxpayers.  I would like to thank Senator Enright for giving me the opportunity to dispel some of the misconceptions that have been generated, and to explain why the probate tax is being introduced and how it will impact on those benefiting from inheritances.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the probate tax must be viewed in the context of the current low yield from inheritance tax which represents less than 0.5 per cent of total tax revenue &mdash; an extraordinary figure in OECD or international comparisons. It is almost unbelievable that any country in the modern world could have such a low yield from inheritance tax as 0.5 per cent of the total tax revenue of the State.  This mainly reflects the relative narrowness of the inheritance tax base.  As I mentioned in my budget speech, many inheritances pass from one generation to another without incurring any tax liability at all.  This is due to the generous exemption thresholds for capital acquisitions tax, which for a transfer from parent to child is £171,750.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that inheritances generally confer greater independence and better living standards on those receiving them and the majority of inheritances should be able to bear a relatively small charge in recognition of this fact.  It is not an unusual proposition to make.  I am sure Deputy Enright would even accept that in the cases we mentioned, where people were lucky enough to inherit <Col N="514" /> almost £0.5 million of property or machinery, it would not be unreasonable for them to pay £4,000 or £5,000.  Somebody who did not benefit from a transfer of that kind would be happy to pay.  I do not know anybody who, if they got £0.5 million worth of property, would not pay £5,000.  Frankly, I would pay £50,000, although it is unlikely that anybody will give me £0.5 million worth of property.</P>

      <P>I was told in my constituency today that the gentleman who won the lotto last week, and is a constituent of mine, spent more than that on the night out with his friends.  He was not taxed on it and he went out to spend it anyway.</P>
      <P>It is only reasonable that at a time when overall economic circumstances required additional revenues, and other tax heads were called upon to contribute, the Government should seek to widen the base for capital taxation.  Further base broadening has been a consistent recommendation of many commentators and there is no good reason capital taxes should be excluded.  In increasing revenues thereform, the Government is fulfilling a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> With regard to the recent debates on the Culliton report everybody in the country, every editorial writer and leading article outlines that what we must have is tax reform and to broaden the tax base.  When people say they want tax reform they mean they want to pay less taxes.  I agree with that but, unfortunately, it is not always possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> The provisions of the probate tax are outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the Finance Bill.  I can see that Senators were well briefed on the issue so there is no point in my repeating them in detail here.  The tax will be a 2 per cent on the net value of estates over £10,000 passing under will or on intestacy. Liabilities of the estate at the time of death, and funeral expenses, will in general be allowed for the purposes of calculating the net value of the estate.</P>
    <P>I have been particularly concerned to lessen the impact of the probate tax on families.  I have decided to allow a full exemption in respect of the family residence where the deceased is survived by a spouse, irrespective of whether the spouse inherits the residence.  Where there is no surviving spouse, the share of the family residence that passes to dependent children or dependent relatives will be exempt from any charge to probate tax.  Moreover, any debts outstanding on the family residence may be deducted against other assets of the estate for the purposes of determining the taxable value of the estate.</P>
    <P>The situation where both parents have died in quick succession is also provided for.  Where both spouses die within five years of one another and are survived by a dependent child, no probate tax in respect of the second death will apply on property which bore probate tax on the death of the first spouse.  Where both spouses die within a year of one another, this relief applies irrespective of whether there is a surviving dependent child.</P>
    <P>There will also be exemptions, <i>inter alia</i>, for pension benefits and the proceeds of insurance policies used to pay inheritance and/or probate tax.  Moreover, exempt property will be deducted in determining the taxable value of the estate so that if, for example, the estate passing to the deceased's spouse consists of the family home plus taxable assets not exceeding £10,000, no probate tax will be payable.</P>
    <P>An aspect that will be of particular significance to families is, of course, that property in joint ownership which passes <Col N="516" /> by survivorship will not attract any probate tax charge.  That point was made by Senator Kelleher.</P>
    <P>In framing the legislative provisions relating to the probate tax, I have been very careful to ensure, contrary to the impression given by some critics, that due account is taken of ability to pay.  For example, payment of the tax may be postponed where an estate consists largely or wholly of illiquid assets, such as certain business assets or agricultural property. In such circumstances, no interest will accrue on unpaid tax until nine months after the date of death.  Moreover, in cases of real hardship, the postponement of payment may also include the total waiver of interest.  The provisions contained in the Finance Bill allow the Revenue Commissioners considerable discretion in adjusting the terms of deferred payment to take account of the circumstances of each estate passing on inheritance.  These provision will be of particular benefit to farmers and small business owners.</P>
    <P>A discount for early payment will be available to those who pay the tax within nine months of the date of death.  The discount will be at the rate of 1.25 per cent per month, so that if payment is made within three months of the date of death the amount of tax payable will be reduced by 7.5 per cent.  The discount for early payment should, in most cases, more than compensate for the small interest cost of short term bridging finance borrowed by the executor against the estate to pay the tax.</P>
    <P>The probate tax will be allowed as an expense in assessing liability to inheritance tax.  This means that it will be deducted from the net taxable value of the inheritance before calculating liability to inheritance tax.  There have been suggestions that the probate tax should be allowed as a full tax credit against inheritance tax.  However, this would make the new tax regressive in effect.  It would mean that wealthier individuals with relatively large inheritance tax liabilities would effectively enjoy full relief from the probate tax, so that the incidence of the tax would fall entirely on <Col N="517" /> those with little or no liability to inheritance tax.  Accordingly, apart altogether from the adverse Exchequer implications, allowing the probate tax as a full credit against inheritance tax would be undesirable from the point of view of equity.</P>
    <P>Property which is transferred before death will not incur a charge to probate tax as Senator Kelleher indicated.  That situation, in itself, constitutes a positive incentive to the lifetime transfer of businesses and farms, a development which is widely felt to be desirable.  I have made a number of changes to that this year. Indeed, in line with the commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government to encourage more lifetime transfers of farms, there are positive measures in the budget and in the Finance Bill which will further this objective.</P>
    <P>Agricultural relief in respect of gifts is being increased from 55 per cent of eligible assets with a ceiling of £200,000 to 75 per cent with a ceiling of £250,000. Moreover, there is a provision in the Bill under which a reduction of up to 10 per cent in stamp duty may be granted in respect of property transferred by gift, where rights of residence or maintenance attached to property are reserved in favour of the transferor and/or the spouse of the transferor.</P>
    <P>The Government has given careful consideration to the detailed provisions of the probate tax in the light of the representations and suggestions received since the budget.  Having regard to the reliefs and exemptions proposed, the very modest rate of tax and the special arrangements regarding payment which cater for illiquidity and hardship, the Government is satisfied that the provisions contained in the Finance Bill are reasonable, equitable and socially responsible.  I am satisfied that the tax will not place an undue or unfair imposition on the taxpayer having regard to the value of assets acquired.</P>
    <P>The figures compiled by the Revenue Commissioners from rural and urban samples indicate that the amount of any probate tax payable should be less than £1,000 for three-quarters of estates passing <Col N="518" /> on inheritance and less than £500 for about half of all estates.  Moreover, Revenue estimates that about 25 per cent of estates should qualify for full exemption from the tax.  In terms of scale, these figures put into perspective the relatively minor impact of the tax on inheritance.</P>
    <P>I believe that the probate tax is entirely justified.  The yield of about £11 million in a full year will make a useful contribution towards the maintenance and improvement of the Government's economic and social programmes within prudent budgetary parameters.  Moreover broadening the existing narrow base for taxing capital acquisitions by applying a relatively small charge over a wide number of estates passing on inheritance is to be preferred to seeking equivalent revenues elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The tax yield in this year was spent yesterday in the increased provision for the Department of Health to pay for its child care provisions.  The Government is continually seeking ways or raising revenue to pay for improvements in the many essential services.  That is what the public wants.  We cannot afford to maintain some services at present levels.  This is not a high expenditure Government so the problem is to provide resources for essential services.</P>
    <P>To allow significant additional exemptions and reliefs over and above those provided for in the Finance Bill would erode the base on which the tax is to be levied and as such would undermine the objectives of the tax.  Deputy Enright has researched his contribution well and I will look at the points he made to ensure that we have not overlooked any important matters.  At the same time I think it is fair to say that the exemptions and reliefs proposed are generous and that the provisions contained in the Finance Bill strike a reasonable balance between the desirability of avoiding an onerous charge on the transfer of assets by inheritance and bringing about a fairer distribution of the burden of taxation as between inheritance and other sources of additional wealth and income.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher pointed out that the estate duty rate was far higher.  The <Col N="519" /> increase in agricultural relief in the Bill in respect of gifts will greatly reduce the capital acquisitions tax burden, mentioned by Senator Enright.  There is no probate tax on a gift.  That is important. Senators made the point that more people, quite correctly, are transferring property during their lifetime.  Most organisations and the legal profession advise people to do that and a declining proportion of people wait to take out probate.</P>
    <P>The present top rate of capital acquisitions tax is 40 per cent and not 55 per cent as was stated by one Senator.  1991 was the year of the capital acquisitions tax amnesty and in that year the capital acquisitions tax yield of £49 million was inflated by £13 million in amnesty receipts.  1991 is the most recent year for OECD comparative statistics; the 1990 figure would be very different.  The 1992 yield was £33 million and the projected yield for this year is £35 million.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their courtesy and participation in this debate.  The probate tax is a small measure towards broadening the tax base to ensure that everybody pays their fair share so that an unfair burden is not heaped on a few.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. This tax signals the reintroduction of the old death and estate duties.</P>
      <P>The present Minister was first elected to the Dáil in 1977, the year that car tax, estate duties and other taxes were abolished.  It is ironic that he is the Minister who reintroduces death duties and other taxes on the family and property. This tax is like the 1 per cent employment levy &mdash; it applies to everyone.</P>
      <P>There is great emphasis on the fact that the family home and residence will be exempt.  I suppose we should be thankful that the Minister will, at least, allow families to remain in their family home and that it will not have to be sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is unfair.  I appreciate that the Minister, due to the budgetary situation, must collect as much money as possible. However, a 2 per cent tax burden on estates that applies across the board is <Col N="520" /> unacceptable.  If the Minister is serious about his objective of achieving an equitable tax base he should not go for the easy targets.  The 1 per cent levy, as we have seen, is a tax on employment that applies to everyone without exception.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and his Department to reconsider this probate tax.  Look at what happened to car tax.  The first year it was reintroduced it was £5 but few of us now pay £5 car tax.  The probate tax will be 2 per cent this year, maybe 3 or 4 per cent next year and it will probably multiply in its affect on families.  As Senator Enright said earlier, one must look at estates and the value of assets.  It is one thing to value an estate at a certain amount on paper but, when it comes to putting an actual value on property and business transactions, it is a different matter.</P>
    <P>The victims of this new tax will be spouses, in particular, widows, sons and daughters.  It will not be a once off tax; and the rate will increase.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this issue.  The imposition of this tax is an easy option and probably helps the Minister to balance his books.</P>
    <P>This tax will be like the telephone charges, it will affect those who can least afford to pay.  It will be an arbitrary figure and will cause difficulties for those left behind.  I would like the Minister to think again about this matter.  If this tax is imposed a more generous threshold should be written into the legislation.</P>
    <P>We all know what happened when the 100 per cent exemption on property transferring from one spouse to another was introduced.  There should be a generous ceiling for parents who are transferring property to their children.  The Minister is well known for solving problems and answering queries.  Given the small amount of money which this tax will generate, perhaps the Minister could broaden the tax base to bring in the same amount of money.  I accept the Minister is always willing to listen to reason.  I support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my thanks to the Minister for coming to the House and <Col N="521" /> for supplying us with a detailed script.  I wish to ask one question.  The Minister referred to the family residence.  He stated:</P>
      <P>I have decided to allow a full exemption in respect of the family residence where the deceased is survived by a spouse, irrespective of whether the spouse inherits the residence.  Where there is no surviving spouse, the share of the family residence that passes to dependent children or dependent relatives will be exempt from any charge to probate tax.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche made the point that the family residence was exempt.  In the Bill there is specific reference to a Schedule which refers to the fact that probate tax is payable if an individual's income is greater than £3,877.  Does this mean that the figure of £3,877 is being removed and that the only exemption is if a son or daughter resides on the premises?  Will there be a complete exemption?  Is the Minister removing the figure of £3,877?</P>

      <P>I thought the Minister would beat me to the punch; he has beaten me twice to the punch.  The point I made has not been fully appreciated by members of the Government or by people on the opposite side.  A person on an invalidity pension of £107.50 a week, married with two children, would be liable to pay probate tax and the family <Col N="522" /> home would be included in the assets. That is my understanding of the Bill.  I would like the Minister to examine this point.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Calnan's viewpoint. I understand that people in Government have duties and obligations.  I appreciate the Minister's point in relating to balancing the books.  I do not think the probate tax was meant to affect people on low incomes.  The Finance Bill is currently being discussed and it will be passed and, as a result, people will ask the Minister for Finance to make representations on their behalf to the Revenue Commissioners.  This tax will affect many people who will look for exemptions. A son would be liable for tax if the family home was passed to him after both parents died.  That fact is not fully appreciated by the Minister.</P>

This tax needs to be discussed in conjunction with the hardship provisions. I will consider the Senator's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I lived on a small farm.  I know there are progressive farmers in agriculture who are trying to improve the yield from their farms.  The example I gave was where a son receives the full benefit on the death of his father.  In other words the father, a widower, has made a will and leaves the farm to his son.  The family farm is worth £400,000, the family home £40,000, the dairy herd £64,000, dry stock £40,000, farm machinery £20,000 and a motor car £10,000.  The total assets are worth £574,000.  The liabilities <Col N="523" /> for such a person, including a term loan of £40,000, an overdraft of £20,000, and funeral expenses £5,000 would total £65,000.  The net estate, including the house, which in this instance would be liable, is a total of £509,000.  That person will be liable for probate tax of £10,180. In addition, the inheritance tax is £44,000.  It is important to examine a situation where a farmer who already has debts of £60,000 is now required to pay a further £55,000.  The only way that can be done is through the sale of part of his milk quota, his stock, some of his dairy herd.  The potential danger is that part of a farm has to be sold or part of a person's tools of trade have to be sold.  That is <Col N="524" /> why I consider this to be such a serious matter.</P>
      <P>Growing up we were taught the value of work, energy and thrift.  These ideas are no longer fashionable.  Nevertheless it is good to work hard.  Energy and enterprise are important, as is a certain level of thrift.  Enterprise and hard work should be encouraged but this legislation is going in the opposite direction. However, it is early days yets.  There is a long, hard battle ahead of the Minister to get this legislation through.  Although he won the first round tonight I would ask him to think seriously about the points I have raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCashin" hpid="Mr. Cashin Mr. Cashin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cashin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, for coming to the House this evening.  I congratulate him and his Department on their work.</P>
      <P>Kanturk Castle, built in the 16th century, stands one mile south of the town of Kanturk on the Blackwater bridge.  It is a noble building.  The Annals of the Four Masters mention the area as Ceann Tuirc, the head of the boar.  It is not recognised that the castle was the finest castle built by a Celtic family in Ireland. Even the northern chieftains of Ulster failed to build such a splendid mansion.</P>
      <P>McCormac McCarthy who initiated its construction must have been a man of taste, ambition and considerable resource.  The castle is not built in a natural defensive position but in a pleasant rolling landscape.  We can deduce from the design, location, large windows, together with the lack of stone stairways and stone floors, that the family looked forward to an elegant peaceful future with their subchieftains, the McAuliffes, the O'Keeffes and the O'Callaghans of Duhallow.</P>
      <P>The site is now massed by trees and the door seen from the road is the back entrance to the castle.  Perhaps the castle was sited to take the advantage of the river Allow for domestic and farming use. The main doorway has been described as a fine Renaissance door which probably led to an elegant panelled Tudor hall.</P>
      <P>The castle is not located along the Blackwater like Mallow Castle.  It was probably built between the two ill famed Desmond rebellions of 1573 and 1598. This was a settled period in Munster when Edmund Spenser and others settled into a quiet rural life along the river Blackwater and its tributaries.  It was a time of peace and much building work was undertaken, otherwise remarkable structures such as Kanturk Castle would not have been contemplated much less constructed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no evidence of rampaging Elizabethan troops devastating the lands of Duhallow or its trees.  The amount of timber needed for roofing, flooring, panelling and stairs was substantial. However, timber was not imported because wood was available from the surrounding area.  Wild boar roamed Duhallow until the seventeenth century, living largely from the fruits of the native oak, acorn, hazel, crabtree and roots. The forests in Duhallow were substantial until the early 17th century.  Those who <Col N="527" /> built the castle made provision for many fine fireplaces with good surrounds, showing there was no shortage of timber. The original joists were in position until a few years ago.</P>
    <P>The castle is part house, part tower and resembles Burncourt Castle, in plan. The task of planning the castle, organising labour, craftsmen, builders, carpenters, quarrymen, stonecutters and transport must have taken years of planning because there were no roads, only tracks and bridle paths.  The towers must have been roofed with lead imported from England.</P>
    <P>Tradition says that the lime for the building of Kanturk Castle was mixed with blood &mdash; it was believed that the blood of animals strengthened the mortar.  This was a custom in those times. It is not too fanciful to assume that the castle was occupied by the McCarthy's, even if not roofed as they would have liked.  The castle grounds must have been in the Percivals' minds as security when they lent money to McCathy.  It is conjecture that the mansion was occupied and not the towers.  Smith's history of Cork states that MacDonagh lived in Duhallow with his followers in great splendour until 1641.</P>
    <P>For the technically minded, the castle occupies corners of a rectangle, 120 ft. × 80 ft.  It was built of old red sandstone. There are four square defensive towers, five storeys high and connecting the towers is a four storey fine Elizabethan mansion.  The mouldings, the twines, frames and mullions of the Tudor windows are of hewn limestone, as were the battlements.  There are three small openings on the ground floor of each defensive tower from which to fire a gun or pistol.  There is a hint of classical influence in the symmetry of the overall design of the castle.</P>
    <P>The green enamel plaque on the castle reads:</P>
    <P>MacDonagh McCarthy commenced the erection of this strong fortified mansion in Elizabethan times.  It is one of the most massive castles ever undertaken <Col N="528" /> by a native chieftain and it is believed it has never been completed.</P>
    <P>The prominent overceiling corbels around the wallheads supporting the parapets to provide a gallery, are remarkable. Most of the corbels are in position but the roof and galleries have now fallen.  However, in an etching of 1750, the parapets seem complete and the sentry posts seem to be in position at roof level.</P>
    <P>Sir Phillip Percival was in possession of the land of MacDonagh McCarthy on 23 October 1641 when McCarthy was then in rebellion.  MacDonagh McCarthy borrowed more money than he ought from the Percivals and it was certified by the court of claims that Sir Percivil, a minor, was legally entitled to the lordship and the manor.</P>
    <P>The MacDonagh McCarthys have disappeared from Irish history and their castle stands empty and roofless.  The castle has been partly restored by the Office of Public Works in recent years. It is worth preserving as part of Irish heritage.  It has never been damaged by canon or gunfire like so many other Irish castles; moreover it is authentic.</P>
    <P>Kanturk Castle has been held on a long lease by the Irish National Monuments Trust since 1951.  It is the only Irish monument headed by the British National Monuments Trust.  The Irish National Monuments Trust request that this Government seeks the return of Kanturk Castle as a gift to the people by the British Government.  Kanturk Castle was the finest castle built by an Irish chieftain and it still remains outside our jurisdiction. We must encourage the Government to seek its return and complete and preserve this fine structure for future generations.</P>
    <P>Recent Bord Fáilte figures show that 855,000 overseas tourists visited the Cork-Kerry region.  Some 36,000 came from Northern Ireland and 941,000 came from the Republic; 488,000 tourists arrived via Rosslare.  Over one million people travel along the main Mallow-Killarney route.</P>
    <P>The castle is situated two and a half miles off this tourist route.  If this castle <Col N="529" /> is developed and properly marketed, it would prove an important tourist attraction to this area.  On 12 September 1992 the newly formed McCarthy Clan Society met on the castle grounds.  The highlight of the event included the attendance of the McCarthy Moore who came from Morocco and performed the ceremonial floodlighting of the castle.  He also gave a commitment to ensure its restoration during his lifetime.  If one is travelling from Mallow to Killarney a visit to the castle and the pleasant 18th century town of Kanturk, on the river Allow would be worthwhile.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Dempsey, who is unavoidably absent, I thank Senator Cashin for his magnificent historical treatise on the history of Kanturk Castle.  I will bear in mind what he says about visiting it &mdash; I have been in Kanturk many times.</P>
      <P>Kanturk Castle is one of the most massive castles ever undertaken by native chieftains in Ireland.  Construction of the castle commenced in the early 1600s but due to political troubles of the time, it was never completed or occupied.  Building of the castle ceased before the battlements were built or the castle was roofed.  The building is a most interesting combination of the traditional Irish towerhouse architecture and newer Tudor architecture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the castle was built by Dermod MacOwen MacDonagh, it passed through a number of hands before it was presented to the National Trust for England and Wales in 1900.  It is, in fact, the only property owned by the Trust outside of England or Wales.  In 1936 the English National Trust considered that it was appropriate to transfer the castle to its Irish counterpart, an Taisce, and the castle was accordingly leased to An Taisce for a term of 1,000 years.  An <Col N="530" /> Taisce subsequently appointed the Commissioners of Public Works guardians of the castle in 1966, under the National Monuments Acts, for preservation as a national monument.</P>
    <P>Conservation works were carried out to the castle between 1968 and 1972 by the Commissioners of Public Works and the castle is now in good condition.  Maintenance of the castle will continue to be carried out as required but restoration is not envisaged.  As the castle is held under a long lease by An Taisce and is under the care of the Commissioners of Public Works, I do not consider that it is necessary to seek full ownership of the castle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent tour of inspection of Our Lady's Hospital, Manorhamilton, by three members of Leitrim County Council, Councillors McGloin, Cullen, McTiernan and by myself has led me too raise this issue on the Adjournment. We were taken aback by conditions there.  For many years, this hospital has served the medical and acute patient needs of Leitrim with a professional dedication which is second to none.  As the only hospital in Leitrim, the county and the community have relied on <Col N="531" /> the hospital staff to continue to provide excellent care and attention.  Yet, even the most dedicated of professionals become frustrated and angry when their calls for assistance on staffing levels and infrastructural investment are continually ignored and when their ideas and suggestions for an improved service and health care system are dismissed.</P>
      <P>Manorhamilton hospital has, over the years, been neglected and forgotten by the North-Western Health Board.  At present, staffing levels at the hospital are not only the lowest in the county, but the lowest in the North-Western Health Board area.  To cater for 37 to 40 beds with acute medical and long stay geriatric patients, five nurses are on duty in the mornings, two in the afternoons from Sunday to Wednesday and four on afternoons from Thursday to Saturday.  Three nurses are on duty each evening and two SN nurses look after these patients at night.  In addition, a ward sister is available only four days a week and two domestic ward attendants assist with all the domestic duties, with the help of one other domestic, who has other duties in the hospital.  Furthermore, only one porter is available for a limited number of hours per day.</P>
      <P>When the staffing levels at Manorhamilton hospital are compared with those at the Dungloe hospital and Shiel hospital in Ballyshannon, a stark imbalance becomes apparent.  For example, Dungloe hospital, with 43 beds, has seven nurses on duty at 8 p.m. and four on duty each afternoon and evening.  Staff also have the assistance of one SN from the day hospital for two hours each morning and three hours each evening.  While the Shiel hospital has only 22 beds, it can provide a staffing level which includes four nurses on duty in the morning and two on duty in the afternoon, evening and night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These hospitals provide a good patient to nurse ratio, a benefit which is mutual. Patients are given an excellent standard of nursing and medical care, while nurses are not stressed and achieve some job satisfaction.  No such feeling of job satisfaction <Col N="532" /> exists at Manorhamilton hospital. Indeed, medical and nursing staff there are extremely angry and deeply concerned that their calls to redress the imbalance of staffing levels are met with casual indifference.  They fear about their ability to provide a safe and comfortable environment for their patients, especially when one realises that of the 40 odd patients in their care, 15 of them are termed totally dependent.  They need assistance with tasks of daily living such as feeding, dressing and washing.  Other patients who are mobile and able bodied but suffering from differing levels of confusion, also need constant supervision. Nurses have little help to lift and handle patients.  The demands on their time is constant.  Medical staff, constantly hampered by lack of funds and proper medical service support, feel they can no longer provide the type of care and attention our senior citizens deserve, especially if they are to live out the rest of their lives with dignity and comfort.</P>
    <P>Low morale among the staff is not helped by the state and condition of the hospital; frankly the building is archaic. Despite attempts by the staff to brighten it up and make it more homely and pleasant, it urgently needs infrastructural investment.  The outside of the building needs to be painted and anybody visiting the hospital who examined its condition, would be appalled.  The windows are rotten and paint and plaster are falling from the walls of some rooms.  In other areas floor covering is cracked and there is a serious danger of somebody tripping. In the larger wards, there is little space between beds for nurses to work and patients have virtually no privacy.  Bed lockers are old, broken and in need of repair or replacement.  Bed linen is worn and tattered.  Radiators cannot be switched off because they have no control valves.  The swimming pool, which was funded by the public &mdash; and this should be taken into consideration &mdash; has not been opened since last October, except for a few hours.  The litany goes on.</P>
    <P>This hospital is an important and integral part of the community of Leitrim. The staff and its patients deserve better <Col N="533" /> treatment.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to make funds available to upgrade the hospital with regard to staffing and structure.  The requirements are very straightforward and not difficult to fulfil.  The hospital needs its permanent nursing posts filled; an addition of two care assistants to help in the mornings and evenings; an extra nurse Sunday to Wednesday for three hours; a qualified ambulance nurse available seven days a week; resources to help the development of the rheumatology unit and help to establish a rehabilitation unit; greater availability of a speech therapist; and funding for infrastructural development of the hospital building.</P>
    <P>The needs of the staff and patients of Manorhamilton hospital are just as important as those in the Dungloe and the Shiel Hospitals.  Patients have a right to expect a decent standard in both hospital care and medical attention.  Staff have a right to expect and receive a good medical support system, decent working conditions and an environment that allows them to continue to perform their medical duties with confidence, professionalism and satisfaction.  Not content with putting into action the infamous election slogan &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo;, it now looks as though this Coalition Government is determined to hurt staff as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for staffing levels at Manorhamilton hospital is a matter for the North-Western Health Board.  It is the board's view that Our Lady's Hospital is adequately staffed. However, ongoing discussions have been taking place with the staff organisations in the hospital in relation to the most appropriate mix of staffing for the unit.</P>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital fulfils an important role in the board's community hospital network and is also the regional centre for a consultant staffed rheumatology and rehabilitation unit which serves all the board's catchment area. The hospital also has a physiotherapy department, occupational department and a very active day hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> The report of the working party on services for the elderly, &ldquo;The Year Ahead&rdquo; provides a blueprint for the development of services for the elderly. The recommendations of the report have been adopted by Government and are being progressively implemented.  In 1990 and 1991 the Government allocated substantial additional funds to the North-Western Health Board.  These funds amounted to £590,064.  During this period the board used the funds to enhance community services for the elderly in line with the Minister's priorities. The elderly in the north-west benefited from increased levels of home help, home nursing, day care and the provision of a department of medicine of the elderly at Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>
    <P>The home nursing and home help services in the community are supported by a network of residential centres for the elderly, day care centres and day hospital services.  Last year there was a total of 58,637 attendances at the board's 13 day hospitals located throughout the region with 458 new patients attending.  There were over 6,000 attendances at Our Lady's Hospital, Manorhamilton, which had 148 patients on the day hospital register at the end of 1992, 36 of whom were new patients in 1992.  This investment in services for the elderly has led to a substantial improvement in the level of care for the elderly which I hope will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Regarding community hospital services, Our Lady's Hospital has developed a full role in serving its locality.  The matron of the hospital is assigned as district co-ordinator for services for the area which range from short term care, continuing care, active respite care programmes, out-patients, day services, advice care and support, terminal care, etc.  Services at the hospital were augmented by the addition of a day hospital in 1985 which has proved to be most active and successful.</P>
    <P>The regional rheumatology unit provides a comprehensive service in rheumatology and rehabilitation to Counties Sligo, Leitrim and Dongeal.  As the Senator is aware, a new extension incorporating <Col N="535" /> a gymnasium and specialised hydrotherapy facilities was opened in 1987.  The hydrotherapy pool is probably one of the best, if not the best, facility of its kind in the country.</P>
    <P>There has been a fair share of positive action in so far as services for the elderly in the North-Western Health Board area are concerned.  I ask the Senator to accept the ongoing commitment of this Government to the development of services for the elderly in the North-Western Health Board area as shown by the generous additional funding for services in the last few years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> In addition to her duties in Manorhamilton hospital, the matron also acts as district co-ordinator for the north Leitrim area.  The hospital has the following staff:</P>
