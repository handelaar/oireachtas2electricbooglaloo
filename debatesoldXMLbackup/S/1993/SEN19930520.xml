      <P>I have notice from Senator Daly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide additional funding for the improvement of services including maternity services at the General Hospital, Ennis; to indicate his plans for the long term development of acute medical surgical services at the hospital and the appointment of additional nurses to help alleviate the workload on the existing staff; and if he will give an assurance that no wards will be closed during the summer period.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to honour a specific commitment given on behalf of the Government to provide quality third level courses by way of regional college development in Castlebar, County Mayo, and the need for the Minister for Education to authorise such courses in 1993.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to examine the difficulties being <Col N="538" /> experienced by farmers in County Donegal who are due moneys from the EC fund for the seed potato disaster.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the appointment of a home/school liaison officer at St. Anne's primary school, Rathkeale, County Limerick, in view of the large number of traveller children attending this school.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister of the Environment to extend the urban renewal scheme to Wicklow town and to further parts of Bray, County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Daly, Burke, Maloney, Neville and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senators Daly's and Burke's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Maloney, Neville and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Could I please correct the Senator?  It is not a matter for the Government, it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. In view of the Senator's great post-decision interest in this matter, did he ask any of his party's three excellent members on Committee on Procedure and Privileges about the matter then?  If he did not then I suggest that he now ask one or all three of those members about the decision-making process.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he would express to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the deep concern of the nationalist community at the recent judgment in the Coalisland case where six British soldiers were declared innocent?  This case and the impending British legislation as a result of the recent atrocious bombing campaign by the IRA, may further restrict the activities of Irish people going about their daily business in Britain and between Ireland and Britain.  Perhaps this House would have a discussion on Anglo-Irish relations in general.  In this context also there is the result of the judgment yesterday in the British court. According to <i>The Irish Press</i> today, Paddy Armstrong of the Guildford Four believes he is being tried again.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, in view of the concerns expressed by both Senator Ross and Senator Quinn regarding the invitation to Mother Teresa, I am now formally asking you to bring the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges before the House.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is an instrument of this House and in view of the concern which has been expressed, the report should be brought before the <Col N="543" /> House.  The suggestion that we should talk to our representatives on the committee implies that because of a sense of duty or loyalty to them we should be silent in regard to a matter that looks like a sorry episode.</P>

    <P>I accept your ruling a Chathaoirligh, that the matter raised by Senator Ross and referred to by other Senators is not a matter for the Leader of the House. <Col N="544" /> Regarding the matter raised by Senator Mooney we will contact the Minister for Foreign Affairs to see if a debate along the lines suggested by Senator Mooney can be arranged.</P>
    <P>On the matter raised by Senator Cregan regarding expenses to the legal profession in connection with social welfare cases, there will be an opportunity to discuss this matter under the Finance Bill which will be introduced to the House probably on 9th and 10th of June. We can discuss with the Minister for Social Welfare a suitable motion on that matter.  It is also an issue which could be raised in Private Members' Time.</P>

    <Title>Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 21:</P>
    <P>In page 8, paragraph (c), line 3, to delete &ldquo;disregarded&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;deducted but the said amounts shall be payable by the employer to the State as part of the judgment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Quinn.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister replied to my amendment last night I listened carefully and later watched it on television to make sure I had heard her words correctly.  I do not believe the matter I raised was addressed by the Minister.  It is a complicated point which I would like to reiterate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about concern for the unfairly dismissed employee, his or her mental stress and uncertainty for the future.  The Minister is right to be concerned. In a case where an employer <Col N="545" /> unfairly dismisses an employee, the tribunal or court assesses and judges the case, and assesses damages in recompense. It will take into account all of the effects including such items as stress, uncertainty for the future and the period of unemployment.  My proposal is that the tribunal assess damages which must be paid by the employer and received by the employee.</P>
    <P>If we adopt the wording proposed in this Bill an open cheque will be supplied by the State for a sum in excess of the damages as assessed.  That will occur in every case of wrongful dismissal.  Our task in the Seanad is to scrutinise every Bill to ensure we protect the interest of the State.  In this case we must protect the interests of the employer and employee but we also must protect the third party, the State.</P>
    <P>The State is not necessarily always well represented when there is a clash between two parties.  If an employee claims unfair dismissal, wins the case and is then awarded damages, it would appear that by leaving the amendment as it stands we will be giving the employee an open cheque for damages which is unfair to taxpayers.  I suggested yesterday the employer should pay the full amount of damages less the amount that the employee had already received and the remainder would be paid by the employer to the State in the manner I described.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained in this debate that these amendments did not come about by chance but after long consultation between representatives of employer and employee organisations. However, we provide an open cheque for damages if we use the word &ldquo;disregard&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;deduct&rdquo;.  I am convinced my point was not answered by the Minister in her reply yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the points made and looked at the amendment. I could not support it.  That amendment could only come from an employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person is unfairly dismissed and is so deemed by the tribunal, that person is out of a job and may have to rely on social welfare.  A review of his or her tax <Col N="546" /> liability could show the dismissed person to be due a refund of income tax.  Is Senator Quinn saying whatever back tax is due to the employee should be deducted from compensation awarded by the tribunal?</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of this provision but I cannot do anything about the fact that in a great number of cases financial compensation is awarded by the tribunal. One could not agree to have any entitlements deducted if compensation is awarded by the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the case made by Senator Quinn both yesterday and today.  Perhaps the exigencies of time had an effect.  We started discussing this amendment at about 4.55 and Senator Quinn was under the impression it was to be truncated then forever.  That would mean the matter was concluded.  So I allayed that fear.  Therefore perhaps neither side had a chance to talk through the amendment fully.  I clearly understood that needed to be done and we have the opportunity to do so today.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn, I am sure not intentionally, used the words &ldquo;open cheque&rdquo; to describe the payment of the claimant/employee.  It could not be called an open cheque because the amounts of money awarded in compensation and in rebates of social welfare payments or tax deductions are precisely computed.</P>
      <P>My definition of an open cheque is one on which one can write any amount one wishes.  This provision does not allow for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agencies concerned are the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners.  They would not like it to be suggested that they use &ldquo;open cheque&rdquo; methods.  It might be said the Departments are too precise but they are careful about the amounts of money which people are paid.  They do not write <Col N="547" /> open cheques and that phrase could be damaging were it to become common coinage.</P>
    <P>Neither the tribunal, the Department of Social Welfare nor the Revenue Commissioners does its business in an &ldquo;open cheque&rdquo; way.  The tribunal makes its decision and approves awards which are usually modest.  The Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners make precise calculations.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the substance of the amendment now.  The purpose of this section is to give legislative effect to an existing practice of some divisions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to disregard social welfare payments or income tax rebates made to an unfairly dismissed employee when assessing the employee's financial loss.  There is an element of truth in what the Senator said in that the Employment Appeals Tribunal takes account of the circumstances which resulted in the employee bringing his or her case to the tribunal.  The existing practice in some divisions of the tribunal is to disregard social welfare payments or income tax rebates.  I find it unacceptable that an employee's award should be reduced by the amount of the social welfare payments to which the employee was statutorily entitled while the employer's wrongdoing in unfairly dismissing the employee is effectively subsidised by the employee and the State.</P>
    <P>The amendment goes some way towards dealing with this problem but is unnecessarily inflexible in directing the repayment in all cases of those moneys. Compensation is awarded only to an unfairly dismissed employee who may be, as I stated yesterday, facing into a period of unemployment of unknown duration. The tribunal takes this into account when making its decision but it is difficult to quantify in monetary terms.  First, there is the employee's state of mind.  In a small town or village the reason given by the employer for dismissing the employee would become common knowledge. Even though the tribunal has vindicated the employee, the controversy resulting <Col N="548" /> from the dismissal may render him or her feeling insecure about their prospects of future employment.  This should not be the case but, unfortunately, it may be.</P>
    <P>The employee during that period will involuntarily use up valuable social welfare credits for which he or she has paid. The adjudicative bodies under this legislation should not be charged with the responsibility of deciding what, if any, portion of those payments should be repaid.  Nothing in my proposal prevents the Department of Social Welfare from recouping moneys to which it may be statutorily entitled.  The repayment of income tax rebates should be decided by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is up to the appropriate body to assess what, if any, amount should be repaid.  Senator Quinn's amendment does not allow for this flexibility.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation awards in excess of £6,000 are liable for taxation under the income tax code.  This is not a large amount bearing in mind the circumstances about which I spoke.  Reducing an award by the amount of a rebate received on termination of employment would, therefore, if the award is over £6,000, amount to double taxation of the employee.  This amendment, if carried, could result in the unfair treatment of an employee and I am sure the House does not wish this to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sherlock suggested that the amendment would benefit employers.  However, its intent is to penalise employers for, and provide a deterrent against, unfair dismissals and to avoid imposing costs on taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My use of the term &ldquo;open cheque&rdquo; was also misunderstood.  I was pointing out that if we disregard other income, such as social welfare payments or tax rebates, we will not know what amount in excess of the recompense awarded by the tribunal will have been received by the recipient and, thus, will be unaware of the amount paid by the State in each case.  The State should not supplement sums awarded by the tribunal against employers; it should have no direct role in arguments between employers and <Col N="549" /> employees.  Although I appreciate the Minister's argument, I believe the present position should be discontinued and I hope she will reconsider her position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to repeat a general point I made on Second Stage. While reinstatement would be the preferred remedy of the House, since financial compensation is the most common form of redress, it is appropriate that we discuss this issue.  I take the view &mdash; as the Minister has done &mdash; that tax rebates and social welfare payments may be disregarded as relatively small sums are involved.  The average compensation awarded by the tribunal in 1989 was £3,232; in 1990 it was £3,600 and in 1991 it was £2,660.</P>

      <P>We dealt with that point yesterday, although it slightly impinges on what we are saying today. We would all favour reinstatement as a remedy but this is usually not possible due to the circumstances surrounding cases.  I neglected to point out to Senator Quinn that where an employee is awarded compensation, a copy of the tribunal's findings is sent to the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners.  When this legislation was being prepared both agencies were consulted and expressed satisfaction with its content.</P>

      <P>Section 6 introduces a new principle, where a person who has been dismissed unfairly but has not suffered any financial loss will get compensation under the Bill.  It is a traumatic experience for anyone to lose their job unfairly, even if they get another job the following week and suffer no financial loss.  All they can achieve by going to the tribunal is to vindicate their rights having been dismissed unfairly.  The Bill allows that where re-engagement is not possible, they should be paid four weeks' remuneration. I put down a number of amendments, as did other Members and I am curious to know why they were ruled out of order as they will not be a charge against the Exchequer.

      <P>I would like the Minister to look at an anomaly in section 6 (a) (ii): if an employee incurred no financial loss then a payment of four weeks' remuneration can be paid to him.  However, if the tribunal finds that an employee suffered a loss of, say, one week's pay, they cannot award four weeks' pay.  If the tribunal <Col N="551" /> determines that there is a financial loss of less than four weeks' pay can they decide to pay up to four weeks, remuneration?</P>

In practice, the number of cases that would fall into this category would be small &mdash; about half a dozen &mdash; but the principle raised is important.  In a nutshell it means that a person could be awarded up to four weeks' pay while not having suffered any loss.  Yet a person who genuinely is entitled to one, two or three weeks' pay would not get the maximum of four week's pay which somebody who suffered no loss would be awarded.

      <P>I wish to make a few brief comments on this section.  I am disappointed that my amendment concerning leave of absence has not been accepted.  On the question of compensation, it has to be taken into consideration that if a person is awarded compensation and they are in receipt of unemployment benefit, that compensation is their right, as the Minister said, as they have paid their contributions; there might equally have been a rebate of tax.  We must take on board the example given by Senator Neville of a person who may be in receipt of unemployment assistance.  All unemployment assistance is means tested.  I am aware of no circumstances where unemployment assistance is not means tested.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 9, paragraph (b), to delete lines 26 to 36.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment because the Minister of State spoke about legalism and the need to reduce it to a minimum. I was surprised that this legislation provides that an employee with a grievance can go to a tribunal without going to a rights commissioner first.  I think the right procedure would be to initiate a case with the rights commissioner and then move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes the deletion of a technical amendment which has been framed to improve the working of the tribunal and to cut down on unnecessary paper work by claimants seeking redress.  As drafted, <Col N="553" /> section 8 (5) of the Principal Act requires either party to notify an objection to the hearing of a claim by a rights commissioner to the rights commissioner himself.  This has given rise to a situation of &ldquo;mock referral&rdquo; whereby a claimant who wishes to proceed directly to the tribunal must first refer his or her case to a rights commissioner while simultaneously, perhaps, stating their objection to a rights commissioner hearing.</P>
      <P>It is desirable, therefore, that the provision in the Bill should stand so that a claimant may direct a case to the tribunal without involving a rights commissioner if that is what they want to do.  I think it simplifies the matter and makes it clear for a claimant.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 10, paragraph (d), to delete lines 3 to 9 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  when a person is eligible to claim unfair dismissal under the Unfair Dismissal Acts, 1977 and 1993, that person is not eligible to bring a claim under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1990.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The provision in this Bill on alternative remedies available to dismissed employees should be simplified.  I think it should provide that where an employee has a right to claim under the unfair dismissals legislation he or she should be barred from bringing a claim based on dismissal to the Labour Court.  In other words, if they opt for the tribunal they should not then be able to go to the Labour Court.  This simplification would be more conducive to good industrial relations.  It would not bar employees who do not have a statutory right under the Unfair Dismissals Acts from bringing a case under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  It would only apply to those covered by the terms of the Unfair Dismissals Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would deny to every employee eligible to bring a claim for unfair dismissal under this legislation access to the dispute settling procedures provided under industrial relations legislation.  I consider such a broad ranging amendment to be fraught with unsatisfactory implications in practice compared with the provision in the Bill.  That is in general terms.</P>
      <P>I know that the intent of the amendment is to simplify the process and cut out alleged unnecessary avenues and, therefore, perhaps bureaucracy.  I think the provisions of the new section 10 (a) (b) of the Bill allow the parties concerned with dismissal to choose the appropriate avenue of redress themselves.</P>
      <P>This amendment would actually cut off that option.  However, it should be noted that industrial relations legislation limits to cases involving &ldquo;disputes&rdquo; the circumstances in which a dismissal may be processed through the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. Where an industrial dispute concerning dismissal has arisen, the relevant expertise in related conciliation and mediation machinery available in the Labour Relations Commission makes it uniquely suited to processing these cases.  If the amendment were accepted, however, this avenue of redress would be closed to such cases unless the employee concerned was ineligible under the unfair dismissals legislation, that is had been employed for less than one year in that employment.  I do not consider this a desirable state of affairs and I would prefer a proposal which left the decision about which option of redress to be pursued entirely to the parties concerned. The introduction of this proposal would create inflexibility whereas choice of route, depending on the type of case in many instances, is the guiding light in such matters.  I know Senator Neville no less than Senator Hillery, has a wide-ranging knowledge of this legislation.  We seek not to cut off an avenue which can be utilised satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (1) line 11, to delete &ldquo;Circuit Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Appellate Division of the Tribunal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During this discussion over the last few days I have heard statements from people with expertise in industrial relations, such as Senator Hillery and Senator O'Toole. From a layman's point of view the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, which was meant to be informal and to allow people with labour relations problems to have their grievances heard by the tribunal, has not worked out as intended.  The Minister of State said she wanted to reduce legalism from day one in this debate, and that is the principle of these amendments.  The White Paper stated that major changes were necessary in the appeals procedure under the legislation.  At present either party to a dispute may appeal a determination by the tribunal to the Circuit Court.  Originally it was envisaged that such appeals would be few and far between but they have now become frequent with a significant number of determinations being appealed to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> The discussion document mentions, &ldquo;establishing an informal Tribunal with industrial relations expertise&rdquo;, but this to some extent undermines it.  The ICTU, the FUE and the Employment Appeals Tribunal have expressed dissatisfaction with the role of the Circuit Court.  Once a decision is appealed to the Circuit Court it amounts to a complete rehearing where both parties can call further evidence if they wish, and all issues of law are reopened.  A further anomaly, not referred to in the discussion document but requiring some reform, is that decisions of the Circuit Court can now be appealed to the High Court.  Initially we set up a tribunal to deal with grievances of employees who consider they have been unfairly dismissed, and now we find ourselves going from that tribunal to the Circuit Court and, in some cases, to the High Court where new evidence can be called.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is not a court of law and can allow the strict rules of evidence to be relaxed.  When, however, an appeal goes to the Circuit Court or High Court, the judge will apply a different set of rules than those that prevail in the tribunal. It is quite anomalous to provide for an appeal from a tribunal which applies one set of rules of evidence to a court which operates another set of rules.  A system has to be found whereby appeals can be made to a body constituted similarly to the tribunal, comprising representatives from the work place, and with the same rules and standards that apply at the tribunal itself.  For that reason we have tabled these amendments setting down what we believe to be the kind of appeals system that should operate under the legislation.  The White Paper states, in paragraph 43 on page 24:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Major changes may be necessary in the appeals procedure under the legislation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A major recommendation in the White Paper was that the appeals system be changed.  Unfortunately, the legislation before us does not provide for that.  For that reason, Senator Neville and myself <Col N="558" /> have moved these amendments to provide for such an appeals system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as drafted does not alter the basic provision of the 1977 Act under which either party in an unfair dismissal case has a right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  Senator Doyle is quite right to say that there have been many cases going from the tribunal to the Circuit Court which was never the intention of the 1977 Act.  The amendment proposed by Senators Doyle and Neville would appear to be designed to replace the Circuit Court by a newly constituted appellate division of the Employment Appeals Tribunal which would henceforth deal with the determination of appeals from the tribunal.  We discussed this at great length and both Senators took care when drafting these amendments, but I do not think any benefits would be derived from these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been criticisms of the 1977 Act, which I fully accept, whereby proceedings in the Circuit Court involve in effect a rehearing of the case in question. However, section 11 in the Bill, which replaces section 10 of the original Act, lays down revised procedures for the enforcement of tribunal determinations and orders of the Circuit Court on appeal.  The new section makes it clear that a rehearing of the facts is not part of the enforcement procedures and Senator Doyle explicitly raised that point.  The new section in the Bill as drafted makes it clear that a rehearing of the facts is not part of the enforcement procedures.  This revised provision will do much to overcome the criticism of the role of the Circuit Court under the 1977 Act.  The amendment, if accepted, would impose a further layer of bureaucracy on the procedures of the tribunal and people would go to the Appellate Division more frequently than they attend the Circuit Court.  This would diminish the role, function and status of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I doubt whether the amendment is legally feasible.  The removal of the right of appeal to the courts, set up under the Constitution, <Col N="559" /> could be a breach of constitutional justice. A citizen has the right to go to a court of law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>An individual may go to a court on a point of law but not on a point of fact.  The case was well put by Senator Doyle.  There are two systems of hearings: one is relaxed and hearsay evidence is, to a certain extent, accepted; the other is formal, with one person.  The tribunal has a strong input from people with experience of industrial relations, employers and trade unions.  The legal presence acts as a chair rather than playing a determining role.  It allows lay people with experience in this area to determine the justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The avenue is open to a totally different approach to the hearing, where legalism is present, where the laws of evidence are changed and where areas of hearsay evidence are completely ruled out.  Employers are in a better position when such cases reach the courts because of financial considerations, etc.  Often an individual who has been unfairly dismissed has no job and is in a vulnerable position.  A lawyer usually asks for a cheque from the employee if he is unsure whether he will receive his fee after the case is heard.  Therefore, it is fair that the employer should go to a court rather than the employee because of the costs factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Appellate Division of the tribunal must be experienced in this area and the chairperson should have the status of a judge.  The Minister might reconsider this amendment on Report Stage.  A case should go to the Appellate Division only if evidence which was not available or was not presented to the original Employment Appeals Tribunal becomes available.  Such measures might help overcome the Minister's concern about reducing the status of the Employment Appeals Tribunal because of the availability of the Appellate Division.  I would prefer to see it as a different tribunal <Col N="560" /> rather than a division of the present tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the themes I tried to develop on Second Stage was that a dispute is best solved close to where it occurs.  I would prefer &mdash; and I am sure the House would share this view &mdash; if disputes or threats of dismissals could be resolved before they reach the dismissal stage.  However, that is not to say that there is no place for the tribunal.  The existence of third party machinery in the area of labour management relations has its place.  Nevertheless, there is the temptation to use the Employment Appeals Tribunal prematurely rather than devote energy to solving a dispute before it reaches that stage.  I favour the existence of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>Fewer cases are now appealed to the Circuit Court and as Senator Neville said, the lay input into the adjudication process and the experience gained by the tribunal over the years has meant more disputes can be resolved at that level.</P>
      <P>If there is another layer, of an appellate kind, on top of the existing tribunal, that will be almost an invitation to go to the next stage.  In labour management relations the best way to resolve a dispute is eyeball to eyeball.  Disputes can be resolved by using the knowledge and skills of people in the workplace.</P>
      <P>I have confidence in the wisdom of the tribunal and I would not like to see the introduction of an Appellate Division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the interpretation of this amendment, which would allow an individual to appeal a decision made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Often employers arrive at hearings with good legal advice and it is unfortunate that no provision is made to provide free legal aid for those who cannot afford legal representation. It is unfair that a trade union official must present his case against a senior counsel. Claims relating to unfair dismissals may include technical points of law and legal representation is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> An employee who is unaware that a transfer of undertakings is taking place may accept statutory redundancy.  When the transfer is complete the employee may discover that his job has been given to somebody else.  Is there an EC directive which prohibits legislation from protecting workers in that regard?  Free legal aid should be available to those who cannot afford legal representation.</P>

      <P>I listened to and understood Senator Hillery's point that the best place to settle a dispute is close to where it occurs.  The second best place to settle a dispute is, as Senator Hillery said, at the Employment Appeals Tribunal rather than in the courts.  The informality of such a setting has considerable advantages when trying to reach a settlement. People suffer trauma when they have to go to a court of law.  The suggestion of an Appellate Division of the tribunal is sensible.  The Minister might reconsider this amendment on Report Stage, as suggested by Senator Neville.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on unfair dismissals states that all three bodies consider that appeals to the court should be limited to matters of determination to the High Court on a point of law only.  It is suggested that this recommendation be accepted.  As this practice already operates under the redundancy payments Acts and in the Labour Court under the equality legislation, how is it unconstitutional?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We were advised that it would be unconstitutional and I and my officials are bound to take such advice <Col N="562" /> in the preparation of legislation.  The White Paper was introduced in 1987 and following that, it was closely scrutinised and that fact emerged after discussion with my officials.  The Circuit Court would remain as a court of appeal for any citizen on any matter.  The Appellate Division of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, to which the amendments refer, would be an intermediate layer.</P>
      <P>The majority of cases referred to the Circuit Court are settled before they get there, and this has not been pointed out. This debate has revealed a great dissatisfaction with the way the Employment Appeals Tribunal does its business. We have all agreed that there is increased legalism in the operation of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>Although the Bill setting up the tribunal allows employers and employees to have a solicitor present, the hope was that they would not do so, but would have their cases deliberated in a more informal atmosphere.  I know from informal discussions I have had with people outside the House and with representative bodies, such as ICTU, that there is growing concern about the increased legalism in what was meant to be a relatively simple procedure.  That has been highlighted time and again in this debate.  It underlines the points Senator Sherlock made and we keep referring back to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is clear to me that there is a need for straight talking and I intend to do this.  We should try to make the tribunal conform to what was intended rather than for it to become another court, with all the trappings.</P>

      <P>The provision in this <Col N="565" /> section relating to payment of interest on discharged determinations of the tribunal is an entirely new departure in the context of this legislation.  There is specific provision in regulations made pursuant to section 22 of the Courts Act for a judge to order payment by a debtor of interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum. This is the rate used generally in court proceedings where, for example, there is a period between the date of the cause of the action and the date of the judgment.  The rate is reviewed periodically and was last reviewed in 1989.  The rate is set so as to allow some measure of compensation to the claimant for the value of foregoing payment of a financial award.</P>
      <P>The amendment would substitute instead of the interest rate provided in the legislation the rate of interest levied by Revenue Commissioners on overdue taxes, that is, 1.25 per cent per month, as set out in section 46 of the Finance Act, 1978.  It is a penal rate of interest set to ensure that there is substantial financial disbenefit for taxpayers in keeping funds on deposit rather than paying taxes due.  In order to ensure that this is the case, any financial loss to business arising from payment of this interest cannot be offset by taxes.</P>
      <P>It is not my purpose that these punitive measures would be used in this respect but I want to give the employee additional financial compensation in respect of the period for which the award is foregone but the approach in this amendment might be counter-productive. The rate of interest is set at a level to guarantee that any award will be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to increase the interest rate of 8 per cent per annum mentioned by the Minister.  There might be a middle course between the punitive tax I have asked for and the 8 per cent the Minister has suggested.</P>

      <Col N="566" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it will be regarded as a stupid thing to do at this stage, but I must ask if section 11, which Senator Neville and Senator Doyle have failed to amend, is superfluous.  The only reference to the Minister is in section 11 (2) (b) (ii): &ldquo;if he considers it appropriate to make the application having regard to all the circumstances, the Minister,&rdquo;. Could somebody explain that reference to the Minister?</P>
      <P>Under the Principal Act, if, within six weeks, an employer does not carry out the terms specified in the determination of the appeals tribunal, the Minister for Labour may, at his own expense, bring the matter to the Circuit Court on behalf of the employee.  If it finds that the employee is entitled to redress, the court will order the employer to make the appropriate redress.  Will the Minister still have the power to bring proceedings to the Circuit Court where an employer has failed to make the redress granted by the tribunal?  What is the purpose of this section, because the six weeks is provided in the Principal Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the original Act the only way redress can be obtained is via the Minister.  Henceforth, both the aggrieved party &mdash; the person who feels themselves injured due to lack of payment &mdash; and the Minister will be able to bring court proceedings.</P>
      <P>The provision in this section relating to payment of interest on undischarged determinations of the tribunal is a new departure in the context of this legislation. There is specific provision and regulations made pursuant to section 22 of the Courts Act for a judge to order payment by a debtor of interest at a rate of 8 per cent.  In general, that would happen when the judge ordered that a certain amount be paid but it was not. The courts have fixed the rate at 8 per cent per annum and we have adopted that provision and put it into this legislation.</P>

      <P>Many people are concerned that it now takes nine months to get a case to the tribunal.  I do not want to labour the point &mdash; and it has been discussed a lot by those involved in industrial relations &mdash; but, I ask the Minister to look seriously at the delays.  I raised the matter on Second Stage and on the basis of finance and I again ask the Minister to ensure that cases come to the tribunal as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is right. Legalism and long delays are two of the outstanding matters which must be addressed in the talks I will have shortly with the chairman of the tribunal.  The Senator is correct about appeals being dragged out.  I am afraid people will lose faith in the tribunal &mdash; which was set up in good faith &mdash; because of delays and because of legalism.  Doubts are beginning to emerge about the tribunal and my Department must stop that.  I will pursue the point the Senator raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Any backlog is disturbing but it seems to me that a number of cases are allocated a half day when that much time is not required or justified; in some case an appeal might only take a half an hour.  There might be merit in introducing a prehearing device to speed up cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good point: at present, a half day is allocated to each case and if a case is settled quickly the tribunal does not sit for the rest of the allocated time.  There should be a system to make the tribunal more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another disturbing point is that if a case requires more than half a day, the adjournment can be for months and it is hard to pick up the threads of these cases after long delays.  I have seen cases adjourned on three occasions with interruptions of up to three or four months between each sitting.  It is difficult for the tribunal to adjudicate and it is difficult for the parties involved to make a coherent case if there are lengthy interruptions. In respect of the point Senator Hillery made, no case brought to the <Col N="568" /> tribunal in 1993 has yet been heard: it is still dealing with cases from 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This interchange is useful.  The business of the tribunal must be streamlined, but its ethos &mdash; that one gets a fair hearing &mdash; must, of course, be maintained.  Over a number of years a degree of inflexibility has developed in the operation of the tribunal and this must be looked at.  I assure the House that I will pursue this matter and I will draw on the points made in this debate. I assure the House that I intend to go about that matter arising from the debate we have had here.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the exercise of powers by the Comptrller and Auditor General and his constitutional duties to control disbursements from the Central Fund. As far as the section goes it is satisfactory but it does not go far enough.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned and have been concerned for some time about the spending of some Government Departments. There are obvious and glaring <Col N="571" /> areas where there is gross over-spending and procedures in these areas must be tightened.  On Second Stage I spoke about the renovation of Government Buildings, the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham and Portlaoise Prison &mdash; we will be dealing with schools later.  The expenditure incurred in these cases was far in excess of the original estimate.</P>
      <P>This is only one area of excessive expenditure.  It appears the Comptroller and Auditor General gets involved only after the money has been spent.  Is the Minister satisfied that this section covers those points?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is concerned about semi-State bodies which are not under the control of this Comptroller and Auditor General.  The legislation takes the view that in the non-commercial semi-State sectors the Comptroller and Auditor General will be the appropriate officer, but in the commercial semi-State sector it is the responsibility of the board of the company and of the Minister who appoints and supervises the board to ensure proper financial procedures are followed.  Semi-State bodies are subject to the relevant Oireachtas committee and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General comes under the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is important that there be two separate committees.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the commercial semi-State bodies, the commercial auditors should do the job they are employed to do.  If they do not do it properly, they can be sacked or sued by the semi-State company concerned.  It is their duty to do a proper commercial audit in line with the best commercial practice and to report back to the boards of those companies. In relation to the State sector and non-commercial semi-State bodies whose accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the point being made is whether we can identify and deal with potential waste of public money before it becomes a problem.  Later sections in the Bill deal with value for money auditing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> The effect of the new powers in the Bill will be to tighten up procedures in Government Departments so that they will be very alert to potential waste and abuse of public money because they know they are potentially subject to this detailed value for money audit.  This will result in improved monitoring and evaluation of projects.</P>
    <P>Expenditure cannot be audited until the money is spent.  The Senator wants to know if we can avoid future abuse and waste of public money.  Nobody can guarantee that there will not be future waste or that things will not go wrong, but what we are trying to do is to devise models of best practice.  The Bill gives the Comptroller and Auditor General the power not only to carry out value for money audits but also to report on accounting procedures as he did in his 1991 report, in relation to stores.  This will contribute to better public administration. However, as I already pointed out, an audit by definition deals with actual rather than planned expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is difficult to audit expenditure while money is being spent.  However, in the commercial sector a person is usually given responsibility for monitoring expenditure.  Such a person would monitor spending on a building project by examining the amount required to complete each stage of construction, such as the walls, the roof and internal works.</P>
      <P>Expenditure should be continually monitored in areas where it has previously exceeded its target to ensure that planned expenditure is not exceeded in future.  Such monitoring does not take place at present because, in some areas, there have been major spending over-runs. This is not widespread practice. Civil servants are generally competent, reliable and honest.  However, in some areas there are insufficient checks to prevent over-spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals only with standard audit procedures.  I share Senator Enright's concern about waste of public money.  A later section deals with <Col N="573" /> value for money audits and envisages putting in place procedures to avoid waste, abuse, bad value for money and cost over-runs.  It allows the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine practices and procedures and to report on their effectiveness in monitoring expenditure on contracts.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, in response to public concern and concern expressed by the Committee of Public Accounts about cost over-runs, the Department of Finance prepared a report on practices and procedures in tendering for projects which identified areas where cost over-runs had occurred.  Such change in policy by a Department in response to concerns expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General is ongoing, and that will be tightened up by the provisions of the Bill on value for money audits.  The Bill takes on board the concerns expressed by Senator Enright which are shared by all Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The sections specifically deal with audited accounts of money administered by, or under the control of, the Oireachtas.  Money is regularly allocated to commercial State-sponsored bodies.  There is great dissatisfaction with the way a great deal of this money has been spent, or misspent in many instances.  It is essential that the Comptroller and Auditor General has power to investigate this expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies has the power to investigate these bodies.  I accept this but that committee is very short-staffed.  When I was a member of that committee we experienced considerable difficulties and delays in obtaining reports and information because the staff were unable to cope due to staff shortages.  A much more thorough and intensive investigation of how public money is spent is needed.</P>

    <P>There have been many financial scandals in recent years.  The problems in Greencore might never have occurred if the Comptroller and Auditor General had been empowered to monitor its <Col N="574" /> expenditure and inspect its accounts.  The public money which was misappropriated was allocated by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has studied in detail the White Paper on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>This section deals only with the standard audit function of ensuring that money does not go into somebody's back pocket as distinct from being spent on the purpose for which it was voted, and it updates the law in that respect.  Section 9 deals with value for money audits.</P>
      <P>In regard to semi-State bodies, the position adopted in the Bill is that it would be the function of their boards and their sponsoring Departments to monitor what is going on and report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  I take the point made regarding shortage of resources.  If a board is functioning well it will supervise the activities of senior management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have proposals in the draft ethics Bill, which I am preparing and which is virtually ready, to deal with conflicts of interest for senior management of semi-State bodies.  Guidelines on that matter were issued by the Department of Finance in the wake of the scandals referred to.  However, that is not appropriate to this Bill.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General is given responsibility for all the semi-State bodies, resources would be spread too thinly and the job would not be done well.  The decision has been made that the semi-State bodies are to be audited by the normal commercial auditors who will be subject to the <Col N="575" /> boards.  The relevant Minister supervises the board and the board supervises the company and its auditors.  Accordingly there are sufficient checks and balances. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies supervises the whole process.</P>
    <P>The extension of audits in this Bill is to deal with non-commercial semi-State bodies where those kinds of checks and balances do not operate, and the value for money auditing and the scrutiny of proceedings.  They are dealt with in section 9 of the Bill and maybe we can continue discussion of this point on section 9.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) outlines the different schedules and the different bodies which come under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General; it lists the different bodies to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Section 5 (1) (a) (i) states: &ldquo;the accounts for each financial year of the persons specified in the First Schedule,&rdquo;.  Many different bodies are mentioned in their schedule, including Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, and the Board for Employment of the Blind.  On what basis were those decisions arrived at?  Why were some bodies included and others left out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis on which they were chosen was that there are some bodies which are already audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General under their own legislation, for example, the Central Bank.  There are non-commercial semi-State bodies or bodies such as Trinity College, Dublin, which are substantially funded from State funds and <Col N="576" /> are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Bill gives power, on a phased basis, to take over those audits.  The Bill also proposes to include the health boards which previously had been audited by the local government audit service.</P>
      <P>The principle behind this was that bodies which were predominantly in receipt of State money, where that was their main source of income, should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Bodies whose main source of income would not be the Exchequer, for example, the ESB whose main source of income is from the sale of electricity, would be audited in the normal commercial way.  It is, so to speak, chasing the money.</P>
      <P>The decision was taken to include the health boards because first, they are not responsible in the same way as local authorities to directly elected members and a directly elected board.  Second, most of their money comes from the Central Fund.  It is felt that the Exchequer's auditor, who is the Comptroller and Auditor General, should audit them.</P>
      <P>In the case of local authorities, on average only half their income comes from central sources.  Furthermore, there is direct accountability &mdash; as most of us here are aware having been members of local authorities &mdash; of the directly elected members.  It is an accountable form of government where the elected members take a keen interest in all aspects of local authority activities.  That gave enough checks and balances and the local authorities will be left with the local government audit service.  These principles underly the decisions on who would audit which bodies.  I have already said what the dividing line was in assigning the commercial semi-State bodies and the line of principle drawn there.</P>

      <P>Up to now vocational education committees had not been under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  My experience of vocational education committees has been that they have been run efficiently up to now.  The Minister said that moneys were specifically allocated to these bodies and that is part of the reason they come under this criterion.  I find it difficult to see why the Minister omits commercial semi-State bodies which have caused major problems.  There have been serious and gross abuses of public moneys.  To date I have not been made aware of any abuses by the vocational education committees. Their accounts are normally well kept.  I was under the impression they were being looked after by the local authorities. Why is the Minister including them here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same principle as applies to health boards.  Most of the money going to the vocational education committees comes from Government; only an insignificant amount comes from local authorities. Since it is Department of Education money going directly into vocational education committees, the person who audits the Department of Education accounts should also audit the vocational education committees'.  That is the underlying principle.  It means that the Comptroller and Auditor General is entitled to do a value for money audit in relation to vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was told recently of a vocational education committee that was costing £110,000 to run and was administering a payroll budget in schools of £120,000.  Questions need to be asked there about how the vocational education committee is run in terms of value for money.  The powers conferred under section 9 of the Bill are necessary to <Col N="578" /> follow up those issues.  It is appropriate that the accounts of the vocational education committee should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. That is the principle adopted here.</P>

      <P>This is the main issue regarding semi-State bodies.  It is my understanding that in Australia and Canada commercial State bodies come under the control of their respective comptrollers and auditors general.  That seems to work satisfactorily in other countries and it surprises me why it is not the case here.  Some of the bodies listed in the First Schedule strike me as strange. SFADCo, which deals with the midlands, the south and along the west coast, comes under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I cannot understand why the Industrial Development Authority would not have the same criteria for examination.  I am not aware of any significant problems that have arisen to date, although there may have been minor difficulties.  It strikes me as strange that Bord na Móna is excluded.  Some of the semi-State bodies mentioned are subject to Government control.</P>

      <P>The heading of section 9 reads: &ldquo;Examination by Comptroller and Auditor General of economy and efficiency in use of resources and of effectiveness of certain management systems.&rdquo; We are dealing with the First and Second Schedule.  I do not think the Government is going to change this Bill but I am suggesting that it may be worth considering at another stage.  The level of public anxiety, unrest and hysteria over financial scandals in recent years is unparalleled. <Col N="579" /> In my time as a public representative I have not seen anything like it.  Further scandals of this nature involving gross abuse of moneys allocated to semi-State bodies by the Houses of the Oireachtas, will provide a large scale public revolt in years to come.</P>
      <P>We cannot undo what happened in the past, but the Minister of State will be in a position to deal with future developments when further legislation is introduced in this area.  It is essential to act now because those scandals occurred in circumstances outside the control of elected politicians. People were appointed or elected to positions of trust in which integrity and honesty were expected from them, but much of that trust was betrayed.  It was not the culpable people in semi-State bodies who were blamed; much of the blame was attributed to elected public representatives who were powerless in the matter.  By allowing this Bill to be enacted in its present form we are failing to grasp the nettle.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to go through the list of scandals because they have been publicly recorded.  We have the power to deal with them, however, by including the Second Schedule and, though it is late in the day, I feel we should do so.  I take the Minister of State's point that to spread the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General too thinly weakens those powers.  In this instance, the amount of money misspent was so substantial that money spent on expanding the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office would be well spent.</P>

Will the Comptroller and Auditor General's power apply equally to the parent body and to its sub-groupings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In examining a parent body the Comptroller and Auditor General can examine its subsidiaries. To come back to the point made by Senator Enright, the Comptroller and Auditor General in Canada only audits bodies which do not operate in a competitive environment.  It is quite similar, therefore, to our situation where we are putting the non-commercial, semi-State bodies under the Comptroller and Auditor General and leaving the commercial semi-State bodies to operate in the commercial world, and, in the normal commercial way, to employ commercial auditors.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Enright about the problem of public disquiet at financial scandals in certain semi-State bodies. These appear to have involved strong conflicts of interest where people acted on their own behalf rather than on behalf of the company.  I will address that issue in the Ethics Bill which is virtually ready to roll.  That is the appropriate area in which to deal with interest and conflicts of interest involving senior figures in the semi-State sector.  Following the financial scandals, guidelines were issued by the Department of Finance for the tightening up of procedures after a thorough investigation of what went wrong.  Those guidelines have been issued to all the commercial semi-State bodies and include provision for a declaration of interests by members of boards as well as advice on how to abstain from acting on something in which they have a financial interest.  Those procedures will be given statutory backing in the ethics legislation. That is the appropriate way to deal with that concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General's role under this Bill will be to ensure that there are mechanisms in place in Government departments that adequately supervise the operation of the semi-State bodies under their aegis.  It is then up to the Government departments, boards and auditors concerned to see that no funny dealing goes on in semi-State bodies.  That is the correct chain of command; it does not mean that no attempt is being made to address the issue.  I do <Col N="581" /> not think that extending the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the commercial semi-State area is the most effective way of dealing with the issue. The point was raised in the Dáil debate and I subsequently discussed it with professional auditors.  My advice is that mismanagement of funds would be more effectively picked up by commercial auditors operating in the commercial world. That is the job they are paid to do, and if they do not do it effectively they can be sued, dismissed or otherwise dealt with by the board of a company.</P>
    <P>It is the Comptroller and Auditor General's responsibility to ensure that proper procedures are initiated in Government departments to monitor the semi-State bodies under their aegis.  That mechanism together with what is in the pipeline to give statutory effect to guidelines in relation to senior people in semi-State bodies, is the correct way in which to deal with the issues which have been raised.</P>

      <P>In litigation one has no chance if one is up against a judge who is judging his own case.  To some extent, asking the commercial auditors whether one should change the procedure and have the Comptroller and Auditor General take over some of the powers that are theirs at present, is akin to a judge judging his own case.  I do not mean to be disrespectful but I do not believe auditors are the best people to ask for an opinion on that issue.</P>

We debated this on Committee Stage and the point was made that there was no reason to exclude these people from the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act.  At their conference, the Garda Síochána recently passed a motion proposing that they come under all areas of employment legislation.  It is silly that some who work for health boards and vocational education committees are covered while others are not.  A hospital cook, who is an officer is not covered while a hospital porter, who is an employee, is covered. Why should everyone in these circumstances not be covered under the Unfair Dismisals Act?

      <P>After extensive consultation with the Civil Service unions, they showed no enthusiasm for the extension of the protection of the Unfair Dismissals Act to their members, largely because they consider that such a development would probably entail a change in the current tenure arrangements, which in practice affords civil servants a higher degree of protection than their counterparts in the private sector, who are covered by the Act.

    <P>Regarding the continuing exclusion of members of the Garda Síochána from the scope of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, neither the Garda authorities nor the Department of Justice is convinced that the present system needs to be changed. The Garda procedures are governed by the provisions of the Garda Síochána Discipline Regulations, 1989.  These regulations <Col N="587" /> were drawn up with the approval of the Garda Commissioner and the various Garda representative associations.

These provisions include the right of appeal in the event of a non-consensual discharge including ultimately the right of appeal to the Minister for Defence for redress of wrongs.  Accordingly it is not considered necessary or appropriate that legislation designed to safeguard the rights of civilian employees should apply to members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I have covered the points which were raised on Second and Committee Stage. Essentially what I am saying is that I will not accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question of the civil servants on Committee Stage in particular and I referred to it on Second Stage also.  My view is that every worker should have access to the protection of the law and to the remedies and appeals offered by law.  At the end of Committee Stage the Minister indicated that it was her understanding that civil service unions were opposed to being included under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In her reply today the Minister said that those unions have shown no enthusiasm for a change.  That is correct and that is why I have not included civil servants in my amendment.  They are not opposed to it but they do not see any point in the change.  I studied the number of civil servant dismissals over the last ten or 12 years with the unions and it <Col N="588" /> became a purely academic discussion.  I hold the view, however &mdash; and the unions do not oppose it &mdash; that every worker should have the right to protection under this legislation.  Temporary workers in the Civil Service do not have access to the internal remedies and the unions said they were concerned about that. However, I am not prepared to deal with such a minor area in my response.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Garda I wish to make it absolutely clear to the Minister that she cannot have it both ways.  If she expresses the views of representative bodies for arguing against one of the amendments, will she then accept that I have spoken during the last week with the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda Representative Association and that both organisations want their members to be included under the provisions of this legislation?  My understanding is that other Members of the House also spoke to those associations during the week and can confirm this.  It is in the same context that the associations wish to be viewed as trade unions and to affiliate to Congress but I will not deal with that here.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister to answer a number of questions.  I recognise on Report Stage, that I can put the case only once and that I am at the Minister's mercy in terms of the response she chooses to give. I appreciate the full response that she gave on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years a senior member of the Garda, a commissioner, challenged in the courts &mdash; I use the Minister's phrase &mdash; his non-consensual departure from his position.  As I recall he won his case.  I am told for instance by the association that in a number of ongoing cases gardaí are challenging their dismissals.  Nobody has indicated that there is any threat to State security in a member of the Garda having access to the Unfair Dismissals Act if he or she felt a dismissal was unfair. What happens if a garda is dismissed and wants to challenge it?  What happens if a soldier is dismissed through a non-consensual <Col N="589" /> discharge?  The Minister said that under the provisions of the Defence Act a soldier has various avenues of redress.  This is not unusual.  Teachers also have a domestic remedy.  Most courts in dealing with dismissal cases first ask if every opportunity to find a domestic remedy has been exhausted.  Internal or domestic remedies are not alternatives. The idea is that problems be sorted out locally and in a grievance procedure, whether from a trade union side or management side, the objective is to get the matter resolved at the lowest possible level.  As the Minister said in her Committee Stage speech, we do not want to be overly legalistic.  The lower down the line a problem can be resolved, the better.  Therefore the Army should be covered by this legislation.</P>
    <P>If a garda wants to challenge his or her dismissal there are a number of grounds on which they can do so.  One is that the tenets of natural justice were not complied with in the dismissals procedure. This is a difficult and convoluted argument which involves senior counsel. A garda can also seek a judicial review by the courts of the way in which the dismissal was decided upon.  The review would examine if the authorities had the competence to do what they did, and if they acted honourably, correctly and acceptably in following their internal rules.  The third way is to find a precedent in common law.  The more cases that are taken the more common law develops, but this depends also on which court hears the case.  Nowadays, most cases tend to be dealt with at the court below that which determines a common law precedent. This worsens the situation, because each time the case must start from scratch which necessitates numerous lawyers.  The Minister has said repeatedly that she is opposed to this practice.  Fourthly a person who was discharged might claim that his or her constitutional rights were infringed.</P>
    <P>Instead of having to go through all of that procedure there is a remedy under <Col N="590" /> the Unfair Dismissals Act, which would not require people to go to court.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister outline what is wrong with that proposal?  Is it not a neater way? It also saves the State money because going through the courts is a costly procedure. The State has lost many cases brought by gardaí.  This amendment reduces the workload of the Department of Justice and is a less cumbersome way of dealing with a dismissal.  It determines it as easily and clearly as a court and in a way which saves the State money.  I cannot see any reason for that amendment &mdash; or a similar one &mdash; not being part of the Act.</P>

      <P>I am worried about the number of special categories.  The law should facilitate and apply to everyone equally.  I do not understand why some of these categories have been selected for special mention.  This could have the undesirable effect of making these people appear to be in a privileged position.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville gave an example of a cook working in a hospital being in a different position from that of a porter employed under similar circumstances.  I cannot see why these categories should be taken out of the general legislation.  It gives the impression that some people are in a more privileged position than others.  We all should be equal before the law and the fewer special categories there are, the better.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not accepted her own argument that where a trade union or representative is in agreement with changes in this legislation, it should be examined. There is no logical reason for the inclusion of these categories.  The Minister stated that the Civil Service might not fully support this change, of which we took note, and, therefore, did not include section (f) of the Principal Act in these amendments.  However, we consulted other bodies, as Senator O'Toole said, and PDFORRA, and the Garda representative bodies are anxious to be covered by this legislation.  To use the <Col N="592" /> Minister's argument, why is this opportunity being lost when the Garda representative associations wish to be included?</P>
      <P>Employers were very apprehensive about the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, but it has worked well for the groups which it covers.  Extending cover to other groups would reduce the costs incurred in their attempts to obtain justice and would give them the option to take their case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>As Senator Henry said, we now have a ludicrous situation in the health boards where the new Bill covers temporary and part-time officers, but if they are made permanent they lose their rights.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not seen fit to include the positions and areas to which we referred and has not taken into account the fact we took note of the people who needed further consideration. I am extremely disappointed that the Minister has not seen the logic of our argument.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the deletion of all words from and including &lsquo;unless &mdash;&rsquo; down to and including &lsquo;notwithstanding pregnancy.&rsquo; in paragraph (f) of subsection (2).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Department of Equality and Law Reform was established by this Government with a lot of brouhaha; it was intended to show us the light and to bring equality to Irish society.  It would be the beacon for all Europe hurrying up the process of equality and showing the way forward.  However, on the basis of its performance so far, it has been a total waste of money.</P>
      <P>Under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, a woman's pregnancy may not be used as a reason for dismissing her. However, the Act goes on to say that for a woman to lose her job because she could not adequately do the work for which she was employed by reason of her pregnancy would not constitute an unfair dismissal.</P>
      <P>I will quote from Article 10 of an EC Directive of 19 October 1992 of which I know the Minister is aware:</P>
      <P>Member States shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the dismissal of workers, within the meaning of Article 2, during the period</P>
      <P>that is simply a definition</P>
      <P>from the beginning of their pregnancy to the end of maternity leave...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A woman may not be dismissed for any reason during the period of pregnancy. The Irish Government is required to comply with this directive before the end <Col N="594" /> of October next year.  Yet, this legislation is in direct contravention of the EC Directive. I, therefore, tabled an amendment to take the objectionable section out of the Act, in other words, to remove those aspects of the Act which are in breach of the European Directive.</P>
    <P>The Government will be required to take many other measures under the terms of the EC Directive.  That is not in dispute, and is irrelevant, because no matter what else has to be done, section 6 (2) of the Principal Act will have to be deleted.  The Minister of State informed the House of this the other day.</P>
    <P>The Government has undertaken to comply with this part of EC law.  That is why I tabled this amendment and it should now be accepted.  If not, this legislation will go through this House and will be in breach of an EC Directive. However, the EC Directive is only one aspect of the argument, for the moment let us forget it, because it is being used to slow down the process of equality.</P>
    <P>In reality, the Minister of State is as opposed as I am to the fact that a woman could be dismissed as she could not do her work because of pregnancy.  I am not claiming any high moral ground on this matter as I know the views of the Minister of State and they are not different from mine.  However, the Minister of State is guiding the Bill through this House and the record will show that, regardless of discussion, she allowed these sections to go through.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we discussed representative groups and their views.  Since we discussed this matter I raised it with the Employment Equality Agency, the Council for the Status of Women, the women's committee of ICTU, the equality officer of ICTU and various like-minded people.  These interested parties are appalled that this legislation will go through the House without making this change.  They cannot understand the logic that will not allow a Department accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>I have written to the Minister for <Col N="595" /> Equality and Law Reform about this matter, because &mdash; as the Minister of State indicated on Committee Stage last week &mdash; it is the responsibility of his Department who indicated it did not propose to deal with it in this legislation. That is balderdash.  There is an amendment relating to equality which the Minister of State apparently wishes to support but the Department of Equality and Law Reform will not allow her to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister charged with creating an equal society &mdash; enshrining equality in legislation, in administration and in the operation of the State &mdash; now says that this House should not improve the Bill in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government, the objectives of his Department and of the EC Directive. This improvement would also be in the spirit of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and consistent with the policy of the Employment Equality Agency and of the Council for the Status of Women.  All the groups set up by the State to advise the Government on equality are of one mind except one, the newly created Department.</P>
    <P>The Department has written back to me, and I quote:</P>
    <P>As you know, I am committed to preparing the requisite national legislation to give effect to...</P>
    <P>the EC Directive</P>
    <P>...This will involve detailed consideration of a number of issues which require attention, before your proposed amendment to the 1977 Act can be taken on board.</P>
    <P>It is not true that will involve detailed consideration of other aspects of the directive before my amendment can be taken on board.  My amendment can be taken on board now.  It is in line with the directive and it will not impact on the detailed consideration of the other matters, other than making the job of implementing the directive easier, <Col N="596" /> because one requirement will have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the response of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  It does not stand up to even the most cursory scrutiny.  The letter says: &ldquo;I am satisfied that if the amendment proposed were accepted, the resulting provision would not achieve the desired effect of implementing in full the EC Directive which it intends&rdquo;.  I do not know to whom these people talk.  Do they think we cannot read?  The EC Directive in my possession is quite long.  I am simply talking about the implementation of Article 10 of that directive.  This amendment is required under that Article.  I never indicated that this amendment would fully implement the pages and pages of EC Directive 92/85 of 19 October 1992 but I cannot see how anybody can tolerate this part of the Act which is repugnant to everything in which we believe about equality.  I can see no option but to accept either my amendment or a similar one.</P>
    <P>The division between chaos and cohesion in any form of life can be very narrow at times.  It would appear to me that the establishment of the Department of Equality and Law Reform, far from achieving cohesion in the drive for equality, is creating chaos.  On three occasions over the last week the Minister indicated instances where the policies of the Department of Equality and Law Reform were slowing down the process of equality proofing legislation.</P>
    <P>What is happening to taxpayers' money if this is the reality?  Instead of accepting clear and logical procedure from Europe we are moving in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>Members on the other side of the House will take the Whip to walk through the lobbies today.  That is the reality of political life.  However, would somebody ask what nonsense stops this kind of positive proposal being accepted by a Minister. I move the amendment.</P>
    <Col N="597" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is so at variance with what I know the Minister has accomplished in the Department of Education, where she did so much to further equality for men and women that I sympathise with her having to bring it here today.</P>
      <P>While there has only been a slight increase in the number of women in the workforce in the last ten years &mdash; it is still around 30 per cent &mdash; there has been a large increase in the number of women who are married and working.  That number has increased from about 30 per cent in 1981 to about 48 per cent at present.  Therefore this legislation will affect a large number of women who are working.  One does not have to be married to become pregnant and it would be a serious situation for a lone parent to realise that pregnancy can be used as a reason for dismissal.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been influential in bringing forward legislation in the areas of health and safety for all in the workplace regarding toxic chemicals, hours of work, night work, radiation and so on.  Of all the categories of work the only category where pregnancy might be a problem is in lifting heavy weights.  I understand in those circumstances employers have to show that they have made the utmost efforts to introduce automation to reduce load lifting wherever possible.  Lifting heavy loads is inadvisable in all circumstances.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole indicated that protection was already available under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  More importantly, the EC Directive from the Council of Ministers has to be introduced by the end of next year and it appears extraordinary that we should insert this clause in this legislation now when it will have to be changed next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to the Council for the Status of Women and the Employment Equality Agency.  The women in both organisations whom I consulted could not believe legislation was being introduced with such a clause. <Col N="598" /> I urge the Minister to exclude this clause as it could easily be used as a means of excluding women from certain work.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that many women today are interested in a career rather than just a job.  The average Irish family has two children almost as low as the European average.  Because of this clause, a woman may lose not only her job but her career if an employer takes advantage of the fact that she is pregnant and says she is unable to do the prescribed work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank both Senators.  We had a long debate on this matter on Second and Committee Stages. All Senators would agree that women have a special feeling for women who become pregnant and might be in danger of losing their jobs.  I said I was sympathetic with the sentiments expressed in this House and I subsequently contacted the Minister for Equity and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor and he replied:</P>
      <P>With regard to the implementation of the EC Directive on pregnant workers, I have responsibility to bring this into Irish legislation by October 1994.  One of the areas of the Directive involves an amendment of substance to the present Irish Maternity Protection Act, 1981.</P>
      <P>The EC Directive on pregnant workers raises a series of new and complex issues relating to risk assessment, transfer to other jobs and entitlements to leave and pay.  Consequently it is essential that these issues be adequately resolved and that the necessary implementing measures be included in comprehensive legislation which must be introduced by 1994. Meanwhile pregnant workers are not precluded from protection under the Act simply by amendments not being taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be possible under amending legislation which will give effect to the <Col N="599" /> pregnant workers' directive to strengthen as necessary the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act.</P>
    <P>Representations from the Council for the Status of Women and from the Employment Equality Agency were made to myself and others.  I received the EC Directive of 19 October 1992 and I read it.  The EC will have to use language that people will understand.  The directive covers many complex issues as the Minister said and I have no reason to doubt him.  He is a man of integrity with high principles.  He confirmed that his aim is to ensure that the legislation he will introduce will enhance and extend the rights of pregnant women.  I will urge him to introduce this legislation as soon as possible to relieve the concern expressed by people who speak about the needs of pregnant women.</P>
    <P>We pay a lot of lip service to motherhood, to the ideal of motherhood and to women as the bearers and rearers of children.  Rearing may be a joint parental task but bearing is the woman's job.  We must pay the same regard to a woman's rôle as a worker and to every other aspect of her life as we do to motherhood.  All politicians say our biggest asset is our young people, and that is obviously the case.</P>
    <P>I wish I was bringing in that legislation. I do not mean to be sexist because Senator O'Toole, has spoken passionately about it, as has Senator Henry and others but it would be appropriate if a woman introduced it.  However, that is beside the point.  I have faith that my Government colleague, Deputy Taylor, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform with his fine legal mind will introduce comprehensive legislation to implement the directive.  This legislation will show the Minister's commitment and that of the Government to protecting the rights of pregnant women.</P>

      <P>The Minister is anxious to <Col N="600" /> implement this amendment but is unable to do so.  It is disappointing that the Labour Party is slowing up the process of equality.  This amendment would establish a necessary right for pregnant women.</P>
      <P>There is a growing number of married women in the workplace.  The work women do extends further into what was previously the male domain.  In many instances pregnant women cannot do their jobs because of the physical nature of their work.  It is unfortunate that the existing law shall apply for another 12 months and that the Minister is forced by her Labour colleagues not to accept what she knows is proper legislation.</P>

      <P>I share the feelings of the previous speaker.  I find it difficult to comprehend this situation.  Ireland must comply with an EC Directive.  As an amendment to the amending legislation is accepted as being reasonable, it would appear logical to accept it at this point.</P>
      <P>I want to ask Senator O'Toole a question: what device is being used to bring in the EC Directive?  Will it be further amending legislation or a ministerial order?  If the 1977 Act does include pregnancy as a means for an unfair dismissal, would he clarify that the grounds of pregnancy cannot be used?</P>

      <P>I too support this amendment. I appreciate the Minister would like to bring in this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women recommended a full Government Minister to deal with women's affairs.  Perhaps the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has so much to do that he does not have enough time to deal specifically with issues which relate to women.  He has a wide brief and he caters for many minority groups, but women make up almost 50 per cent of the population.  As Senator Henry said a substantial number of them are <Col N="601" /> of child bearing age and they will be affected.</P>
    <P>For a number of years women have been very patient, but no longer.  It takes so long to bring legislation before the Oireachtas that when an opportunity like this arises we should use it to enact that section of the EC Directives with which we must comply by this time next year.</P>
    <P>Many things have to change in Ireland to give women equality yet we are not taking this opportunity.  That is unacceptable to me and other Senators.  It is not even acceptable to the Minister.  I do not understand why the Minister cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been open and honest.  No one questions her bona fides in the matter.  This is a question of where the functional responsibility for meeting EC Directives lies, which is clearly in the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  Not alone that but the relevant legislation is in course of preparation.  When the obligation under the EC Directive is met through legislation, the protection for pregnant women will be more comprehensive than the narrow inclusion that is proving not possible today.  Even if we did accept this amendment, it would only cover one aspect of the issue.</P>

      <P>I have expiated myself and run out of energy.  I have a great sense of disappointment.  It is a privilege for a Member of either House to be involved in the legislative process.  When people hold conflicting views the majority rules and a decision is taken. That is democracy and people have to take the good and the bad.</P>
      <P>The most worrying time is when consensus is reached but there is no movement. That is the process of parliamentary debate and legislation through democracy stymied and not finding fulfilment.  The Minister has responsibility not only for equality but law reform.</P>

    <P>For the Minister's information and to <Col N="602" /> respond to the point Senator Sherlock raised, the effect of my amendment would be to make it unfair for a woman to be sacked because of pregnancy or any matter associated with it.  I am trying to remove a provision from the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>The last section of this Bill says the 1977 Act and this Bill when enacted, may be cited as one.  This Bill will form part of the consolidated unfair dismissals legislation.</P>
    <P>Senators on the Government side are about to walk through the lobbies voting against what they stood for during the election. There must be some honesty in politics. I am not inferring dishonesty but this is not an unemotional or remote issue.</P>
    <P>Most people are as often wrong as they are right; nobody has a monopoly on the truth.  Neither is the Government always right because it has a majority.  Not all wisdom is sited in one body.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with any of the points made by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform in his letters to the Minister present and to me.  However, he neglects to say that if he is to achieve his aims he will have to amend this section.  The suggestion in his letter that this would slow down, stymie or pervert the process of reform is incorrect.  It must be done in response to the European Directive.  He is the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and this is law reform.  This House is, to a greater extent than the other House, a reforming one when dealing with legislation.</P>
    <P>Not only is my amendment necessary, there is no conflict between it and what the Minister for Equality and Law Reform said in his letters to the Minister and me.  Refusal to accept my amendment brings the process of Government and democracy into disrepute and raises the fundamental question of whether the establishment of the Department of Equality and Law Reform slowed down the process of achieving equality.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Senators are familiar with the provisions of the original Unfair Dismisals Act, 1977.  The dismissal of an employee shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be unfair if it results wholly or mainly from one or more of the following: the employee's membership of a trade union; the religious or political opinions of the employee; civil and criminal proceedings, whether actual, threatened or proposed against the employer; the race or colour of the employee and the pregnancy of the employee.  There are four sub-clauses dealing with pregnancy.  The Principal Act specifically refers to the &ldquo;pregnancy of the employee' as being grounds for unfair dismissal.  There are clauses qualifying this and it is these which Senator O'Toole and Senator Henry are discussing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, after line 47, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the insertion of the following new paragraph in subsection (2):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(eee) membership of the travelling community.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> I am endeavouring to respond to the points put forward by the Minister of State and Members of the House on Committee Stage.  I had moved an amendment to the effect that a person's cultural background should not be a cause for him or her to be dismissed.  The Minister of State pointed out &mdash; validly &mdash; that the matter was very broad and difficult to define, and gave her some problems in terms of accepting the amendment.  She indicated, however, that she had sympathy with my point about membership of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>The reason I used the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; at that time was twofold.  Travellers see themselves as having a cultural identity separate from the settled culture, while I would say that we are all part of the Irish culture.  I used that particular word in deference to their views and I also hoped it might cover situations in future where any kind of latent racism might show its face in employment.  However, that is now being replaced by the amendment before the House.  Unemployment is endemic in the travelling community and it is almost impossible for them to gain or hold employment.  The few travellers who get employment have to become culturally invisible in their jobs, afraid that somebody will discover their background in case it could lead to their dismissal. This comes through from talking to them at seminars.  It is a minority view but it exists.  It has a negative spin-off because if people knew travellers were in employment it would be good for their general image and would provide a positive role model to other members of the travelling community, perhaps motivating them to seek employment in certain areas.</P>
    <P>We have already discussed this matter. As the Minister of State said, it is not for me to claim a monopoly on this issue.  It is one in which I am involved, like many other Members of this House and I readily concede that.  I was brought up in an environment in Dingle where travellers <Col N="606" /> in the area integrated with the settled community and there was never a problem.  I was lucky in that I got to know the background to the travellers' culture and that I had teachers who explained their argot.  I saw the positive side so it is easy for me to understand.  It is also the reason I have certain sympathy with the travelling community.  I recall that the Minister of State, as Minister for Education, implemented important initiatives to extend access to primary education for children of travellers including the establishment of visiting teachers and other moves in that area. Will the Minister of State continue that mission by responding to a fair proposal which is consensual in that both sides of the House have agreed it?  Will the Minister of State accept that membership of the travelling community should not be a reason for dismissal and that, if it happened, it would constitute an unfair dismissal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, as Minister for Education, helped the travelling people to further their education which means that it is now possible for more of them to seek employment.  Like Senator O'Toole, I come from the country, and it is only in recent years that the travellers have had such a bad press. When I was a child that was not the case. They were also self-employed within their own culture.  Many were employed in horse dealing and others in mending and repairing.  It is sad to see how, gradually over the years, their culture is regarded as demeaning.  In view of the fact that the Minister of State has striven for equality in the area of education for travellers, and I praise her for that, it would help us if the travellers were in a position to help themselves to regain their former position.  They do not have to be subsumed into our culture; as Senator O'Toole said, they feel they have a separate culture of their own which the settled community should accept.  It was fine for them to be able to accept their <Col N="607" /> culture at home but I would like those who, thanks to improvements in education and the fact that the old forms of employment are no longer there for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope we will see that culture return to the way it was as I remember it in County Cork years ago.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding may I bring to the notice of Senators an error in the wording of the amendment? We spoke about putting in the amendment at the bottom of page 6 after line 47.

      <P>The proposed amendment to the Act includes sexual orientation and we accepted its inclusion previously as being very worth while. There is provision for race and colour, in that section of the 1977 Act, it is deemed unfair to dismiss a person because of race or colour.  There are many schemes for people starting employment, such as the social employment scheme, and it is envisaged that more members of the travelling community will be employed. Travellers register at the local employment exchange and, because it is a condition of receiving unemployment assistance that they must be available for work, management could have a person <Col N="608" /> sacked because he or she was a member of the travelling community.  For that reason I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It is appalling that because somebody is a member of the travelling community he or she would be unfairly dismissed from employment.  The legislation should confirm the equality of travellers and ensure that there is no discrimination against them.  While I fully accept the amendment, which copperfastens existing legislation, I cannot envisage a situation in which the Employment Appeals Tribunal would find that somebody had been fairly dismissed from employment because they were travellers.  I have no hesitation in saying that it would immediately, even without consultation between the Members, be regarded as unfair.  It is important in our culture and in the way we approach travellers to have this confirmed in legislation.</P>

      <P>We had a lively debate on this matter and we ended it by trying to get an agreed wording.  While the wording proposed by Senator O'Toole sounded right, how would it be identifiable? How would one break it down to what one wanted?  The &ldquo;travelling community&rdquo; became the words which were best suited in this regard.  I have given this matter a lot of thought and I have had representations from various interest groups.  Further legislation will be introduced in due course.  Senator O'Toole has narrowed the amendment; he has made it more precise.  I, therefore, have great pleasure in accepting the amendment.</P>

    <P>The Minister's decision is a landmark for the travelling community and it will be a cause for celebration.  It will allow travellers, in employment, to celebrate their cultural identity.  It will give them a <Col N="609" /> sense of protection and security.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>These measures will motivate groups who work with and support travellers and it will help travellers become more involved in their culture.  It will improve the situation of the travelling community. I launched a book in Listowel, County Kerry.  One of the stories in the book was about a traveller who experienced trouble at school.  I mentioned that this legislation might improve the position of travellers in our society.  Although it was difficult to leave Listowel, County Kerry, this afternoon, it was worth it.</P>

      <P>I am commenting on the Bill.  If it is necessary to have a legal person as chairperson then free legal aid must be available for people to bring their <Col N="610" /> case before the tribunal.  This provision is absent from the Bill and I want to have that taken into consideration.  The fact that compensation is awarded in a number of cases defeats the purpose of this legislation because it limits the value of the legislation as a protective measure.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned the EC Directive.  It would not be appropriate to implement this directive.  The mandatory provision in the maternity protection legislation which requires a pregnant employee to give her employer formal notice of her intention to return to work must be addressed.  This is important legislation but it has shortcomings.</P>

      <P>I share the unease which <Col N="611" /> Senators have when legislation is whipped from under them and Senator Neville has had that experience.  One can introduce important legislation in the Seanad. The debates on all stages were educative. I was involved in labour relations, not so much with the unions as, in the minutiae of legislation and its effect on wokers' rights.  I am glad I was given responsibility for this area.</P>
      <P>I feel comfortable in the Seanad Chamber. I was a Member of the Seanad on two occasions.  The intimacy of the Seanad, the frankness of its Members and the fact that the Cathaoirleach permits so many exchanges between Members allows for good interchange on legislation and effective debates.  The vocational background of many Members allows for expertise in specific areas to be brought to bear on legislation.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Hillery, Senator Neville and others who contributed to the debate.  It was heart warming to see the sustained interest in this Bill.  I have learnt a lot from this process.</P>
      <P>The Bill &mdash; and the debate &mdash; are important and I am glad that we were able to make significant amendments to the Bill.  What is the point of legislation if one does not listen?  One cannot accept all amendments &mdash; that would be a bizarre way to pass legislation &mdash; but one can listen to the views of others.  Apart from these significant amendments, there was also an interesting and important debate on the Employment Appeals Tribunal and on points concerning dissatisfaction with its workings.  I was glad to hear the points of view &mdash; they have already been expressed to me by representative groups &mdash; of Members, they had a clear authority and authenticity about them.</P>

    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and his staff for their courtesy.  When legislation is introduced, the Minister concerned should be present on Second Stage and on Committee Stage.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  I also thank the Minister for coming here.  I am aware, from previous discussions he had with public representatives and with an important delegation he recently graciously received, that he is fully aware of the widespread concern at the diminishing level of services in the general hospital in Ennis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there has been a constant curtailment of services and activity at the county hospital; bed numbers have been consistently reduced over the last few years.  Serious hardship is being experienced by many, by those in isolated parts of the country, because of the absence of facilities in the hospital, indeed, the general maternity service has been discontinued.  The most recent curtailments, <Col N="613" /> including changes in staffing levels for the ambulance service, the closing down for periods and at night of the accident and emergency services and the curtailment of acute surgical services by the closure of an operating theatre are now creating serious doubts about the future viability of acute surgical services in the hospital.  It is widely thought that the closure of this theatre will precipitate the final closure of acute surgical services there and that future surgical services for the area will be provided at the regional hospital in Limerick or in the adjoining regional hospitals in Galway or Tralee.</P>
    <P>We have had widespread calls from various organisations and individuals in support of the hospital seeking to impress upon the Minister the desirability of providing additional funding to the Mid-Western Health Board, to enable it to provide the same level of services at the hospital &mdash; as a minimum &mdash; as last year. From the funding available to the health board, it is clear that unless these curtailments, which are currently being discussed with representatives of the unions involved, are agreed, the hospital may well have to close one of its main wards for the summer, with the subsequent lack of facilities for many needing acute hospital treatment.  Due to lack of funds, the available services there may not even be funded to last year's level.  The mixing of male and female patients in wards was vehemently opposed by many last year because it created undue hardship for the patients and caused anxiety for their relatives and visitors.</P>
    <P>The situation in Ennis is now chronic. We welcome the financial package announced yesterday by the Minister and compliment him for getting the Government to provide an additional £20 million in funding to relieve the acute waiting lists.  Could some of this funding be allocated to the general hospital in Ennis to prevent the closure of the acute operating theatre this year?  Otherwise, the waiting lists will get longer and the hospital will become less viable as an acute surgical <Col N="614" /> unit.  The Minister has a contingency fund of about £412,000 &mdash; and an allocation from that sum would help to keep the theatres fully operational in the hospital. It would also alleviate the fears in regard to the closure of the acute surgical services unit and the further downgrading of the hospital, at a time when this service is urgently needed in County Clare.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the Minister. However, I repeat that there is a widespread belief that services in the hospital are gradually being diminished and curtailed to an extent which will lead to inevitable closure, especially of acute surgical services.  This is causing widespread anxiety to the people of the country, especially to the staff and professionals who operate the services in the hospital.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to raise any fear that might further damage the prospects of the hospital.  It has been providing an excellent service within the limit of the capacity of those working there and the available financial resources.  A highly professional and caring service is being provided at the general hospital in Ennis for the country and we wish it to continue. Additional staff should be appointed, a review was carried out last year which indicated that this was necessary. We also want the Minister to examine the possibility of even a limited emergency maternity service, especially for the people of the peninsula who are miles from the nearest maternity services. There is widespread anxiety and there have been tragedies because of lack of this facility.</P>
    <P>The Minister can assist the Mid-Western Health Board now.  Like most health boards it is in financial difficulties but, in the contingency funding which was announced yesterday, it may be possible to find some money which would enable the Mid-Western Health Board to keep the operating theatres and emergency services &mdash; especially the accident and emergency services &mdash; operating at the same level as last year.  I again appeal to the Minister to specifically examine this <Col N="615" /> case and consider what assistance he can give to help to maintain the very high level of service at Ennis General Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have this opportunity to place on record the facts in relation to the future of Ennis General Hospital. Senator Daly and his Oireachtas colleagues from County Clare have, in the four months I have been in office, forcefully expressed their concern for the future of its services.  It is important that the message is clear and I assure this House that the hospital will continue to play an integral part in the overall acute hospital services in the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>
      <P>The health board undertook a detailed examination in 1988 of the acute care services in the region and this confirmed the continued role of Ennis General Hospital in the provision of these services for the population of County Clare.  The hospital's bed complement was fixed having regard to this role and there are currently 94 beds in Ennis General Hospital.  This figure is made up of 52 general medical beds, 26 general surgical beds, six day care beds and ten beds in the new geriatric assessment unit.  The day care beds are used for patients who undergo minor surgical procedures and return home the same day.  The number of procedures which can be carried out in this way is growing and, in 1992, more than 1,300 day cases were treated in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fears expressed in County Clare about the future of Ennis General Hospital are without foundation.  There is no agenda, hidden or otherwise, in my Department or in the Mid-Western Health Board concerning any downgrading or closure of the hospital.  The Mid-Western Health Board has, over the last five years, spent £0.5 million pounds on improving and upgrading the hospital. The improvement programme has included the refurbishment of the operating theatres and the purchase of new <Col N="616" /> equipment for the intensive care unit. The surgical ward and two medical wards have been upgraded and the accident and emergency and physiotherapy departments have also been enhanced.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently in discussion with the health board about proposals for further developments in the hospital, especially in regard to an equipment replacement programme.  These proposals must have regard to the limited resources available to me for capital projects and the many competing demands for funding.  I will look upon these proposals as sympathetically as possible.</P>
    <P>I referred to the dedicated geriatric assessment unit in Ennis General Hospital.  This new ten-bed unit came into full operation in July 1992 and involved the appointment of a new consultant physician in geriatric medicine as well as additional support staff.  The provision of this unit was in recognition of the increasing geriatric dimension to the medical workload not only in the mid-wetern region but also in other health board areas.</P>
    <P>As regards maternity services, it is the policy of the Mid-Western Health Board that all obstetrics services in the region should operate on a centralised basis at the regional maternity hospital in Limerick. Gynaecological and antenatal care are provided at Ennis General Hospital on an out-patient basis.  In line with the trend nationally, the number of births in the mid-western region has continued to fall in recent years and it is envisaged that obstetrics services should continue to be provided at the regional maternity hospital, as this is considered to be the most appropriate way of providing services for the region as a whole.</P>
    <P>In March this year, I had a meeting in Leinster House with a deputation comprising public representatives from County Clare and many other interested parties to discuss their concerns about Ennis General Hospital.  At this meeting, I undertook to have officials from my <Col N="617" /> Department visit the hospital and to report to me on the situation there.</P>
    <P>This visit was undertaken by two senior officials in recent weeks and they have reported their findings to me.  Their report confirms that the hospital provides an essential and valuable service to the people of County Clare.  The fabric of the hospital has been greatly improved by the programme of refurbishments already mentioned.  It is recognised that there are some areas still in need of refurbishment and enhancement and the necessary measures will be considered urgently by my Department in discussion with the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the issues of the funding and efficiency of Ennis General Hospital.  There is no need to detail the budgetary constraints under which I, as Minister for Health, must operate.  Suffice it to say that there is no scope for additional resources being allocated to the funding of existing health services, above those allowed for in this year's Estimate.  It is, therefore, imperative that the health board ensures that it operates within the approved levels of allocated expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board allocated £5.36 million to Ennis General Hospital in 1993.  To live within this amount, the hospital must function as efficiently as possible.  The Mid-Western Health Board is anxious to avoid a repetition this year of the difficulties which arose in 1992.</P>
    <P>The health board has, therefore, undertaken a detailed examination of the staffing and activities of several departments in the hospital and has compared these with staffing and practices in similar hospitals elsewhere around the country. As a result of this review the health board has identified a number of areas where there is scope for greater efficiency in the delivery of services and is at present engaged in a series of discussions with staff interests about the implementation of new arrangements in these areas of the hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> It must be borne in mind that activity levels in hospitals vary according to the time of year.  They also vary each week and at different times of the day.  The health board's aim is to ensure that staff members on duty are sufficient to meet the peak periods of demand and are scaled down when activity decreases.</P>
    <P>The present system of deploying staff in Ennis General Hospital has, I understand, resulted in situations arising where, at times, staff are on duty in certain departments when there is very little or no activity in progress.  The Mid-Western Health Board proposes to redeploy staff from those areas during periods of low activity while at the same time ensuring that all services continue to be available when required.</P>
    <P>Provided the proposed measures are agreed by the interested parties, the health board is confident that it will be possible to avoid any ward closure in Ennis General Hospital in 1993.  The health board intends to continue providing the full range of services currently available in the hospital and to do so within the approved budget.  There is no question of reducing the approved staffing levels in the hospital.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I repeat my assurance to the people of County Clare that both the Government and the Mid-Western Health Board are fully committed to the continued provision of acute medical and surgical services at Ennis General Hospital.  Furthermore, the services provided and the fabric of the hospital will be improved, as resources permit.  It is a significant factor in my determination of resource allocation.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Provision of Castlebar (Mayo) Regional Technical College.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, thank you for allowing me to raise this matter. I welcome the Minister to the House.  The case for provision of a regional technical college in Castlebar has been made in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am disappointed <Col N="619" /> that the Minister for Education is not here but I have no doubt that Minister Howlin will inform her of what was said.</P>
      <P>Mayo is the third largest county and has one of the highest participation rates of third level students.  Students from Mayo have to travel great distances weekly to third level colleges throughout the country.  This puts great pressure on families and students.</P>
      <P>The recent report, <i>Eduation in a Changing World</i> indicates clearly that 30,000 extra third level places will be needed by the year 2001.  The former Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, stated it was his objective as Minister to ensure that every second level student who so wished, could attend third level college. The present Minister has stated that by the turn of the century that there will be more than 100,000 third level students in this country.  This copperfastens my case for further third level colleges.</P>
      <P>Every Sunday there is a mass exodus of students from County Mayo to various parts of the country.  Mayo is the third largest county and has a great need for a third level institution.  Mayo is more than a county; it is a region and any rural development policy should have the provision of a third level college in Mayo as one of its priorities.</P>
      <P>The case for a third level college in Mayo is well documented and supported by the various industries and manufacturing agencies within the county.  The developing the west initiative &mdash; which is assisted by the bishops &mdash; the GAA, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers, the Irish Country Womens' Association, Mayo County Council, Castlebar Urban District Council, the Mayo County Vocational Education Committee and every parent and student, fully support the need for a third level college in our county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, has already committed himself to supporting <Col N="620" /> the case for a regional college for Mayo. Last November, a former Minister for Justice, now Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn announced on behalf of the Government that a third level college would be established in Mayo in 1993 to take 200 to 250 students at the outset rising to 800 students after three years.</P>
    <P>The people of Mayo are annoyed with the number of U-turns that have been made.  We were promised a regional technical college and an extension to Davitt College in Castlebar.  Some years ago, Castlebar was promised third level courses in Davitt College but this was not possible because the college was designed for 500 students and now has 800 students.</P>
    <P>I spoke here on a previous occasion about the provision of a kidney dialysis unit in Castlebar and we will be welcoming the Minister to Castlebar soon. We hope he will announce the provision of a kidney dialysis unit at that stage and perhaps the second phase of the hospital.</P>
    <P>I thank the Western Health Board for providing a portion of St. Mary's Hospital complex in Castlebar for a college. This means it will not cost a fortune to set up a third level institution in Mayo. We would like the Minister for Education, who will be visiting Mayo soon to honour the commitment given by a previous Government that third level courses would commence in Castlebar in 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Senator Burke on his ingenuity in raising so many of Mayo's concerns under the title of the need for a regional college, and I have made careful note of his comments.  I speak on behalf of the Minister for Education who cannot be here because she is involved in a series of seminars in preparation for the publication of the Education Bill.  I am sure the House wishes her well in those deliberations and in the consultation process which will take a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to outline, on behalf of <Col N="621" /> the Minister for Education, the dramatic changes which have taken place in higher education over the past generation.  The number of students in third level education has more than trebled from 21,000 in 1965 to about 80,000 at present.  As the Senator indicated, current projections suggest that there will be over 100,000 students by the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>The growth and success of the regional technical colleges has been particularly dramatic with more than 22,000 students now in place.  Growth in expenditure on third level education has also increased significantly, now accounting for 22 per cent of the education budget as against 8 per cent in 1966.</P>
    <P>In relation to meeting the increased demand for third level places generally, a new capital investment programme is currently being drawn up to build on the success of the 1990-93 programme.  The responses from institutions in this context are clearly targeted at the Government's policy of economic growth and job creation.</P>
    <P>These are very positive indicators of the programme which highlight the Government's commitment to the systematic expansion and development of the higher education sector and underline the willing co-operation which has been forthcoming from all higher education institutions in maximising the use of existing facilities and resources.</P>
    <P>The increasing demand for higher education and the value placed on the siting of institutions is reflected in the increasing pressure from various locations for the provision of new institutions.  Castlebar, Thurles, Blanchardstown, Dún Laoghaire and my own home town of Wexford have put forward particularly strong cases.  We in Wexford share the same experience of seeing students leave for Dublin, Cork or the regional technical colleges in Carlow or Waterford every weekend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Or Athlone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>And Athlone.  There are many competing towns seeking this important facility.  Unlike Mayo which has a high level of participation in third level education, my county has the third worst level of participation in third level education and this is causing great concern. All these matters are being carefully considered by the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>It is clear that higher education requires a very large investment by the State and there is, therefore, very heavy responsibility to ensure that this investment is maximised so that the system operates on a well co-ordinated, equitable and transparent basis.  Proper planning and informed decisions on investment are essential.</P>
      <P>Decisions on investment must have regard to priorities in educational provision with particular regard to the disadvantaged; the most effective use of scarce resources; additional places required overall; viability of establishing new centres as against the expansion of existing institutions; local and regional participation rates; the contribution such investment will make to regional development and overall economic welfare; and the type and level of courses needed, bearing in mind their contribution to productive enterprise.</P>
      <P>Bearing this in mind the Minister recently announced in the Dáil that she proposed to examine the needs of different regions, socio-economic groups and the overall needs of society with a view to developing an integrated plan in the context of third level education generally and in the context of the White Paper on Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study will be carried out by the Higher Education Authority.  Terms of reference are currently being finalised and it is expected to get under way within a matter of weeks.  In line with the Government's objective of achievement of aims through the highest level of democratic participation, such a review will be expected to consider submissions <Col N="623" /> from all interested parties.  Decisions on new institutions must await the outcome of this review.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Minister has been aware of the particular pressures relating to the Castlebar situation.  She has invited County Mayo Vocational Education Committee to submit their views on appropriate developments in County Mayo and looks forward to receiving comprehensive proposals.  She has stated that, as part of the developments, she would be prepared to approve of the first year of national certificate programmes <Col N="624" /> on an outreach basis.  Subject to viability, including adequate demand, resource availability &mdash; including availability of suitable accommodation &mdash; and agreement with interested parties, it is hoped that programmes could commence in September 1993.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also agreed to visit Castlebar to discuss this matter with interested parties.  This visit will take place on 2 June.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 May 1993.</P>
