      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to outline the steps being taken by his Minister of State regarding the proposed new bank charges.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to ensure that the needle exchange and drug maintenance clinic at Baggot Street Hospital, Dublin 4, is carried out in such a way as to protect the residents of the area and their property from harassment, intimidation and general nuisance.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to allocate more funding to Co-operation North.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to outline the circumstances which gave rise to the withdrawal of postal services from Ballyheane post office, Castlebar, County Mayo, and to take immediate steps to have the service reinstated.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cosgrave, Doyle and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Doyle's and Cosgrave's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Ross may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.  I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Burke as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.  I call the Leader of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on this subject.  We all regret the deaths of innocent people that have taken place in the North.  We have a duty to spell out very clearly that deaths and killings in the North will not achieve anything politically in this island.  The first thing that has to be clearly said is that hope lies in negotiation.  I come from a part of this country that is very near the North and has suffered as a result of the troubles in the North.  As a House our priority must be to send the message to the families who have lost dear ones. First, our deepest sympathy goes out to them.  Second we must send a message to those who carry the bomb or the gun and mow down innocent people that that is not acceptable to the ordinary people on this island.  This is turning the clock back 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commercial border on this island has disappeared.  There was hope that we could resolve our political differences within the context of a European Common Market, but there is still an element who have no patience and who seem to thrive on using the gun and slaughtering innocent people.  That behaviour is alien to the vast majority of the Irish people.  Whether you come from the Shankill or elsewhere, killing human beings will not solve the problem.  I welcome <Col N="1508" /> this opportunity to extend the sympathy of this House to the families of those innocent victims.</P>
    <P>I believe that the responsibility lies with the British and the Irish Governments to solve the problem and to come to grips with the present situation.  The Irish Government have been honest and fair in their approach to the talks that have reached stalemate.  The people who prevented the talks and created conditions and pre-conditions for talks, must bear some of the responsibility.  The Irish Government has been enthusiastic and energetic about these talks.  On taking office, the Taoiseach stated that he had two priorities &mdash; the troubles in the North of Ireland and unemployment.  I accept that without question.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and Tánaiste, and everyone who supports them, are totally committed to a peaceful process in the North of Ireland.  We should stand together and condemn the people who kill and slaughter in the name of the ordinary people.  They do not have our support or the support of any section of the people to continue that process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very dark cloud of despair hanging over the whole island, and in particular over the northern part.  I do not believe there has been a time in the last 25 years when people have felt so fearful, helpless and hopeless in the face of the terrible events of the past couple of days.  This is not a time for recriminations or divisiveness in this part of the island.  Our only concern should be, and must be, for the safety of the people of Northern Ireland and of the whole island, and for peace as a prelude to political progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent the last two days in Belfast and I have never seen such widespread fear right across the city among all classes of people.  A terrible monster was unleashed by that bomb last Saturday which killed so many innocent people.  I am sad to say that that bomb acted as a recruiting sergeant, as nothing else has done, for the UVF, UFF and other terror forces on the loyalist side.  Everywhere in Belfast today people are living in fear of massive, <Col N="1509" /> arbitrary, wanton and random retaliation, fear of an attack such as befell innocent corporation workers yesterday morning, fear of an attack such as, fortunately, did not succeed last night in Lisburn, where many other innocent people could have lost their lives.  This fear extends to constitutional politicians, especially on the nationalist side who are living daily in physical fear of their lives. Many of them now feel themselves to be targets for murder or some form of retaliation.</P>
    <P>Last night people in many parts of Belfast did not sleep because they were afraid who might come to their house during the night.  I am afraid this situation is likely to continue.  Side by side with that fear there is an extraordinary sense of frustration among the politicians who know that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want peace.  They want an end to the agony and weariness of the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>Many of the politicians to whom I spoke over the last couple of days were drained, emotionally and physically, angry, frustrated and helpless in the face of events.  Unfortunately, in these circumstances the gap between the constitutional parties is widening, not closing.  Misunderstanding is growing and the inevitable natural tendency towards recrimination and blame is now the norm.  This is something we cannot afford.  We, the constitutional politicians who have borne the burden over these years, cannot afford to allow that gap to widen.  Everything we can do to bring them together must be done.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be controversial or divisive but I would like to refer in passing to the Hume-Adams process.  I will not comment directly on it because I do not know what it contains.  Like most Members I have the highest political and personal regard for John Hume.  From my experience talking to people, especially in the last few days, I believe if this process is not brought to a head in the near future, if the British and Irish Governments are not in a position to give us their considered views on it and the rest of us do not have an opportunity to <Col N="1510" /> see whether it is realistic and unthreatening, it may do more harm than good. In the absence of hard information uncertainty, rumour and misrepresentation flourish.  This is happening at present. The unionists see the process as a further attempt to isolate them.  Many moderate nationalists see it as a betrayal of their opposition to Sinn Féin and the IRA over the years.  Many others see it as marginalising the process about which the previous speaker spoke, that is, the major political efforts of both Governments to bring about talks between the parties in Northern Ireland.  If the Hume-Adams process is to take place let it take place quickly.  The last thing we can afford is further uncertainty which paralyses any attempt to get back to where the real action has to be.</P>
    <P>I conclude by reaffirming my belief, which is shared by all parties in this House, that the best hope of a lasting solution in Northern Ireland lies in the three strand process established over the past two years with the constitutional politicians and the sovereign Governments working together.  The message must go from this House today to our Government &mdash; its members are the only people to whom we can speak directly &mdash; that we expect it on our behalf to do everything to clarify its position and to get the process restarted in a way that can remove the ever growing gulf between the parties in Northern Ireland, to get the two sovereign Governments talking and to do something to bring hope to a people who today are utterly devoid of hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we all question what good expressing our views here can do to alleviate the atmosphere of fear, despair and sorrow that exists in Northern Ireland.  Nevertheless, we must express them.  First, we must express our sympathy to the families of those who have been killed on all sides of the political divide in the violence of the recent past.  We must unreservedly condemn all violence from whatever source.  I hope there is a possibility that those who supported violence in the past because they <Col N="1511" /> felt they needed to be protected by people of violence will realise they have not been protected by such people but have been exposed to violence by them, that violence breeds violence and that no good has come to any community in the North as a result of violence.  I hope that realisation will come to at least a small number of people and a larger number in the North specifically and everywhere in this country as a result of the terrible atrocities over the weekend.  If this happens a small amount of good will have been achieved out of this terrible situation.</P>
      <P>I support what was said about the need to restart talks between the sovereign Governments and those who represent legitimate political views in Northern Ireland.  The Tánaiste spoke some months ago about a new covenant for the people there.  He talked about securing the rights of both sides of the Northern divide under a new covenant where their political viewpoints, the right to have them and the right to exercise their political freedom, would be protected.  I sincerely hope those talks can be resumed and that this view can be the overall guiding principle of a solution to the problem in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is a growing number of people in the North and the South who realise there must be a break in the log-jam of violence.  As Senator Manning said, there is despair at the moment but I hope that after a few days people will realise there must be legitimate progress in organised talks.  I wish to extend the sympathy of my party to all those who have been bereaved and injured in recent events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We on the Independent benches would also like to offer our sympathy to those who have been bereaved over the last few days in the North, we share their grief.  We need to underline the sense of guilt which everybody on this island must feel.  Those of us in constitutional politics &mdash; and ordinary citizens &mdash; have failed, no matter who we blame.  We can blame the bombers and gunmen but the division of the funerals <Col N="1512" /> and the deaths are testament and witness to that failure which we must all share.  I am not saying that to apportion blame but as constitutionalists and citizens we have failed to bring peace there.  We need to work for peace and to recognise the fear and terror of parents and workers trying to go about their daily life in the North.</P>
      <P>We also need to recognise the elements of violence endemic in the North.  Violence is the great recruiter for both sides. It is its own agenda and it is, in the main, its own end.  Violence for these people, instead of being a means of trying to achieve something is an involvement which is part of what they are.  This is the greatest fear of all.  In discussing the problems in the North it behoves us to extend a sense of concern to constitutionalists on both sides of the divide &mdash; those who are seeking to make a bridge, to eliminate violence, to improve the quality of life and to make constitutionality the base on which we make progress for peace.  All we can do is to offer our sympathy to the families and our support to those representatives who are attempting to retrieve peace from the jaws of war and hope from its own ashes.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that in the North we have all the signs of a civil war.  It is hard to say those words, we thought all that was behind us but it is there and it is real.  I talked to some of the members of my organisation in the North today and in my 20 years of dealing with the situation there I have never come across such a feeling of despair and hopelessness. There is no doubt that it is now running through the whole community.  Five thousand of my members are going into classrooms this morning to deal with the fear, confusion, terror and utter sense of hopelessness and abuse which young people, who are at their most volatile, are feeling.  We should also recognise that, even as we speak, violent men are using the funerals and the grief of families on both sides to recruit young people into more bombing, terrorism and shooting. That is the saddest part and it must be recognised that violence cannot be the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> It is important to put on the record that we had discussions here over the last number of weeks; I fully support Senator Manning's approach, that it is easy to apportion blame in the North.  My heart goes out to any constitutional politician in the North, from any side, trying to make progress.  I also recognise that they can be critical of each other.  I also recognise that people have been critical of John Hume's initiative.  I cannot make a judgment from this distance.  However, I recognise that people who are doing their best to achieve a solution deserve our support from all sides.  I think everybody is trying to do that today.  We all share responsibility to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>I extend my sympathy to frightened families in the Falls Road, the Shankill Road and in north and south Belfast who are worried about a knock at the door or whether a bomb or a bullet will come through the window.  We are committed to finding a solution and we will renounce the cant of other generations.  We will not look at tradition to find a way forward, but we will try to learn from the mistakes of history.  We will try to make progress from the grief, loss and hopelessness which exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Regrettably, this is not the first time Seanad Éireann has expressed its horror at an atrocity in Northern Ireland, Great Britain or on the Continent. It is proper to express our horror. However, it is virtually impossible to find the right words to express the depth of our anguish and horror at what we have seen over the past few days.  Yet again, innocent people have been blown to bits by the bomb and have had their lives taken by the bullet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You, a Chathaoirligh and the Members know that the sympathy expressed in this House is genuine.  However, I suspect it is of little comfort to those who have been suddenly and devastatingly bereaved. The people of the Shankill Road, Andersonstown and other areas of Belfast and Northern Ireland have our sympathy, but it is not enough.  It is not enough for constitutional politicians committed to the democratic process to <Col N="1514" /> express our outrage and sympathy here. We need to do more than this.  We are at the point where we remember not only bloody Saturday and bloody Sunday, but every other bloody day as well.  We remember Warrenpoint, Enniskillen, the La Mon bar and now the Shankill Road. How many more will there be?</P>
    <P>If Mr. Gerry Adams and his lieutenants want dialogue and peace, as they say they do, then Seanad Éireann should send them one clear message: &ldquo;Stop the killing now.  Put away your bombs, bullets and guns because that is the road to peace.&rdquo;  Mr. Gerry Adams speaks about a peace process and that peace could be the result of the process.  Mr. Gerry Adams is wrong because peace is the beginning of the process, not the end. There is no ambiguity or lack of understanding of peace in this House or in the Republic.  He said the bombing on the Shankill Road was wrong, but can he say in what circumstances he would think it was right?</P>
    <P>The Government has a responsibility to politicians on all sides of both Houses to tell us what is happening.  Otherwise, how can we be expected to contribute, as we wish to do, to any peace process?  We assure people that we want to help.  I doubt if many people in Northern Ireland are prepared to listen to us in Seanad Éireann, but that does not take from the fact that we must continue to add our small voice of reason, compassion and understanding.  The alternative is further chaos.</P>
    <P>We must support, as other Members said, the constitutional politicians on all sides who continue day in and day out, in the face of these atrocities, to try to find a way forward and a way towards peace and reconciliation.  We will continue as constitutional parties in both islands to strive for that solution and to release the decency and energy that we know is in the Shankill, Andersonstown and other parts of Northern Ireland.  If that were to happen, the sacrifice of the past week, however horrific, would have been worth while.  May those people rest <Col N="1515" /> in peace, and we send our sympathy to their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that my emotions do not get the better of what I want to say.  I certainly underline what has been said by many Members, including Senator Manning.  The situation in Northern Ireland is very serious and thousands of people are now living in fear.  On both sides people are asking if they will be next.</P>
      <P>We in Enniskillen were very fortunate as there was no backlash.  Enniskillen is not that kind of town; community relations in Enniskillen were always fairly, if not very, good.  Unfortunately, Belfast is that kind of town and there has been a knee-jerk reaction.  I would not want to make any statement which might be seen as a knee-jerk reaction but I assure you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Members of the Seanad that we live in fear.</P>
      <P>This morning before I left home, I looked under my car for the first time in my life to ensure that there was nothing under it.  I said to my wife &mdash; in fact I instructed her &mdash; not to open the door under any circumstances tonight after dark until she was certain who was there. If we are at that point in Enniskillen, what is it like for those who live in Belfast where evil, dreadful men are running loose and seem to be taking over from the politicians and the security forces?</P>
      <P>It is not good to hear Reverend Magee, a man who has had close contact and, I would have thought, immense influence on the UFF say on television last night that young men are queuing up to join them.  I get frightened when I hear community workers who have worked for years in Belfast say that the communities were never as divided as they are today or when the Chief Constable of the RUC says that the security situation is still under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask what I and we in this House can do.  We can of course send our sympathy. I know a little of what those people in Belfast are going through this week and I know how much it helps if people send <Col N="1516" /> their sympathy, support and love.  I hope that this Seanad, if it does nothing else today, underlines that support and sympathy for all the people going through hell in Belfast.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here?  Millions of words have been spoken by archbishops and cardinals, by politicians and the man in the street and, after 24 years, we are still at each other's throats.  What can this Seanad do?  I have no answer except to say that the solution to Northern Ireland can only be found by elected politicians who must get together and constitutionally arrive at a solution which is achievable but not under threat of arms. There is absolutely no way that a sovereign Government &mdash; British, Irish or both &mdash; can sit at a table with a man who represents a terrorist organisation and who says that if people do not agree with him he will kill them.</P>
    <P>The answer to Gerry Adams is simple and has been given by better men than me.  He knows it very well.  Let them, as Senator Dardis said, lay down their arms. If Gerry Adams says he can get the IRA to do that when peace is achieved, let him do it before we begin to talk about peace.  My view &mdash; and I do not have a God given right to be correct &mdash; is that terrorists on both sides must lay down their arms.  That will give them the right to state their position from strength and not under threat.</P>
    <P>There are many things I could say but one other thought strikes me.  I hope that the situation does not deteriorate.  I am afraid that we are in a civil war, not just approaching it.  I ask the Leader for some time next week, when we have had time to think the matter through, to have a discussion on the situation in Northern Ireland and in particular what the Seanad can do about it.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I join others in condemning the atrocities that have been committed &mdash; not in the name of the Irish people &mdash; and in calling for an end to the violence. The opinion was expressed by my party leader in the past that the Hume-Adams talks were more likely to go in the direction <Col N="1517" /> they have now reached than in the direction of peace.  There must be some effort at dialogue to end this.  To see the carnage over the last few days &mdash; the people mourning their dead, innocent people being murdered at the hands of gunmen and bombers from both sides &mdash; is the greatest atrocity ever committed in this island and I condemn it out of hand.</P>

    <Title>Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ways in which property can be owned may not have changed radically in the last century or so but the attitude of society to the ownership of property within marriage, and specifically to the ownership of such property by the female partner, has undergone a revolution.  We have moved from a time when any property owned by a woman at the date of her marriage or subsequently acquired became automatically that of her husband to a time when husband and wife are essentially treated as two separate persons for all acquisition of property purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that revolution has come a further questioning about the nature of marriage in our society and the property arrangements which are most appropriate to that institution.  In particular, we are now focusing with ever increasing awareness on the idea of marriage as a partnership to which both spouses may make differing but equally valuable contributions. With that shift in emphasis comes a reassessment of certain ownership patterns which we have hitherto taken for granted.  In the past it was commonplace for the family home to be in <Col N="1518" /> the sole name of the husband.  His wife, in return for looking after the home and rearing the children, was given a roof over her head and the housekeeping money.  If she was lucky some limited provision was made for her if she became widowed.</P>
    <P>In society today such commonplaces are no longer acceptable.  Women who choose to take on the nurturing role which, hitherto, was expected of them are now perceived as opting for a career which is every bit as worthwhile as those careers which attract monetary remuneration. However, for those women who have no independent income there is a basic problem when it comes to asserting an ownership interest in the matrimonial home.</P>
    <P>At present even where the matrimonial home is in the sole name of the husband his wife may acquire an equitable share in its ownership through direct monetary contributions made towards its purchase, for example, by way of mortgage repayments. Indirect contributions such as payments into a general family fund may also give rise to a share in the ownership of the home.  However, it is well settled law that no such ownership share will be gained by the unpaid work involved in looking after a home and bringing up children.  That is the situation which this Bill now seeks to remedy.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation the nonowning spouse has a right of veto in relation to the sale of the matrimonial home and, in the context of a judicial separation, the courts have wide powers to make property adjustment orders.  In making such orders they must have regard, among other matters, to the contribution made by spouses who look after the home or care for the family and to any impairment of the future earning capacity of such spouses by reason of their decision to remain at home.  However, the essential fact remains that the marriage of itself and the partnership thereby created does not give rise to any specific ownership interest in the property in which the couple concerned are likely to spend a considerable part of their married lives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> While the majority of spouses affected by the situation I have outlined are women, in our developing society the male partner is increasingly choosing to take on the caring role traditionally assigned to women.  This Bill will lead to an improvement in their situation also. Sadly, our society is sometimes guilty of paying mere lip service to those who do not take up paid employment but undertake instead the role of homemaker and carer.  Their work is praised but the materialism which characterises society today means it may not always be given equal recognition.  The granting of automatic and equal ownership rights in the matrimonial home is one way of redressing the balance and ensuring the work of which I have spoken is recognised in deed as well as in word.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to establish joint ownership of the matrimonial home as the normal form of ownership appropriate to that property.  For many couples the home is the most tangible asset they will possess over the lifetime of their marriage. The essential feature of a joint tenancy is survivorship, whereby the surviving spouse is automatically entitled to the whole of the interest on the death of the other spouse, which makes this form of ownership particularly appropriate. Furthermore, the Bill provides for joint ownership of the household chattels. These may not be as substantial an item as the matrimonial home but the provision being made for their joint ownership also illustrates the partnership approach to marriage which informs this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the text of the Bill now before this House differs in some important ways from that published last June.  There has been a process of dialogue which has resulted in many changes being introduced and many consequent improvements.  Because the Bill is breaking new ground it is important that the views of as many interested parties as possible are heard.  In this context, I stress I am receptive to ideas for further improvement and if Senators wish to come forward with amendments on <Col N="1520" /> Committee Stage I will consider them carefully.  This is not an empty promise since, in all likelihood, I will be bringing forward additional amendments.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill has undergone a transformation since its publication I will go through its provisions in some detail and, in particular, focus on the content of the new provisions introduced.  Central to the Bill is the definition of &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo; in section 2.  Originally it was defined as the dwelling in which a married couple were ordinarily resident either immediately before or at any time after the Act came into force.  However, following some persuasive arguments, I came to the view that this particular definition could be open to abuse by an owning spouse anxious to evade the provisions of the Bill.  Accordingly, the new definition of &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo; extends to a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily reside on or at any time after 25 June 1993, the date of the Bill's publication.  I am aware some advocate greater retrospectivity but I honestly believe this is the furthest extent to which we can safely go in terms of safeguarding the interests of vulnerable spouses.</P>
    <P>I should also make it plain that where a couple have separated since 25 June, the provisions of any separation agreement or court order in relation to the home will override the provisions of the Bill.  It is not my intention to disturb existing arrangements where the parties concerned have already reached their own decisions about the disposition of their property.  Furthermore, in the case of a judicial separation, the courts will retain their existing powers to make property adjustments between couples under the provisions of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  The Bill will not affect the courts' discretion in this regard.</P>
    <P>At this point I should also like to draw Senators' attention to the fact that when this Bill is passed the definition of &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo; and &ldquo;family home&rdquo; will in substance be one and the same.  This alignment of the definitions will be of help to those who have rights to assert under the relevant legislation as well as to <Col N="1521" /> prospective purchasers anxious to ensure that they satisfy any requirements necessary for them to obtain good title to the property in question.  I also emphasise that the ownership interest acquired by the benefiting spouse by virtue of this Bill is a permanent one.  In other words it remains with the spouse until the home is sold or otherwise disposed of and if the home is sold, the interest will, of course, transfer to any purchase money received.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Bill for joint ownership of mobile homes, which are dealt with separately in section 10. The reason for this is that the technical provisions relating to ownership interests in land are inappropriate to such structures. It is, nonetheless, important to state that the joint ownership concept has as much validity for these dwellings as for more conventional homes.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is at the heart of the Bill. When it comes into operation, three months after the Bill has been enacted, an equitable joint interest in the matrimonial home will vest in both spouses. This applies regardless of whether the interest in the matrimonial home now vested in one spouse is legal or equitable or whether it is freehold or held under a lease or tenancy agreement.  Provision has been made, however, to exclude certain interests such as those held by individuals in their capacity as trustees and lettings made for the duration of a person's employment.  Section 4 will apply to existing matrimonial homes in which both spouses have been living at any time on or after 25 June last.  It will also apply to future matrimonial homes which come into being only after this measure has been enacted.</P>
    <P>I stress that the automatic joint tenancy applies not just to the standard kind of dwelling which is to be found in urban areas, it also applies to farmhouses and to dwellings which form part of a larger commercial entity, such as a public house or shop.  While there may be certain practical difficulties in reaching an agreement as to what constitutes the boundaries of the matrimonial home in these cases, they are not insurmountable and can be determined by the court under section 17 <Col N="1522" /> in default of agreement.  Certainly if the alternative was to exclude such dwellings from the benefits of the Bill I imagine few Senators would argue in favour of such a course of action.</P>
    <P>To deal with some of the problems which may arise with such larger entities, the position with regard to easements is clarified in section 4(5).  Under section 2 any existing easements attached to the matrimonial home and exercisable over other land will continue to apply to the joint ownership.  A right of way would be an obvious example of such an easement. However, other situations which are somewhat more complex could also arise and these are provided for in subsection (5).</P>
    <P>For example, where the whole farm is owned by one of the spouses, the right of access to the matrimonial home portion of the farm would not be carried over to the joint ownership because that right of access &mdash; and any other such rights over the farm proper &mdash; are not technically easements, they are rights that the spouse concerned has by virtue of his or her ownership of the farm.  They are personal to the spouse and are not attached to the land.  It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that the benefiting spouse acquires these rights, particularly in a situation where the ownership of the home and the larger entity would diverge in the future, and this is what subsection (5) does.  In the interest of balance, of course, provision is also made for a case where there are existing easements attached to any other land and exercisable over the home and for any necessary additional easements where that other land is owned by either or both of the spouses or by either or both of them and another person.</P>
    <P>Before leaving section 4, there is a further point to which I should like to draw the attention of Senators.  Concern was voiced lest unscrupulous individuals would seek to avoid the provisions of the Bill by conveying their interest in the matrimonial home to a company before the Bill could take effect.  I have dealt with this potential problem by providing that, where such a transfer takes place and the purpose is to avoid the application <Col N="1523" /> of section 4 to the home, the High Court may impose a charge in favour of each spouse, or either of the spouses, on the interest of the company in the home. This provision applies to any transfers made on or after 25 June last.  While I do not envisage that this provision will be used with any great frequency, it is of importance in terms of the message it gives about the significance which the Government attaches to the benefit conferred by this Bill.</P>
    <P>While the Bill establishes joint ownership of the matrimonial home as the norm, it recognises that there may be circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to confer ownership, and certain exclusions from the operation of the Bill are provided for.  Where spouses already are joint tenants or tenants in common with equal share of the home, it is clear that they have already made a specific decision as to their ownership arrangements and the Bill will not affect these arrangements.  Similarly, it would be grossly unfair if the Bill were to vest joint ownership in both spouses only to put the owning spouse in the position of possibly losing his or her home because a judgment mortgage could be registered against the interest of the benefiting spouse in respect of debts incurred by that spouse before the section 4 interest vested.  Provision has been made in section 5 to ensure that this will not happen.</P>
    <P>Circumstances may also arise where the owning spouse may feel it manifestly unjust that the joint ownership provisions should apply.  In such a case, application can be made to the court to have the section 4 vesting set aside.  In coming to a decision on the issue, the court will have regard to a number of broadly based criteria but it cannot set aside the statutory vesting unless it is satisfied that it would be unjust not to do so.  In the normal way, it is anticipated that the application would be made during the lifetime of the owning spouse.  However, where that spouse has died, section 6 allows either the personal representative, or a child of the deceased, to apply.  This <Col N="1524" /> is subject to a time constraint to minimise any problems which such an application could cause for surviving spouses.</P>
    <P>Section 7 recognises that some spouses may not wish to take up the benefit being conferred by the Bill.  They may have property in their own right, for example, or there may be agreement between the spouses that, for particular family reasons, a joint tenancy would be inappropriate. In such cases, the benefiting spouse, provided he or she receives independent advice from a lawyer in advance, is free to opt out of the joint ownership. The mechanism for this is a written declaration which, to take effect, must be registered in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds, as the case may be. Couples intending to marry may also exercise the right to opt out.  Where the declaration is made between the passing of the Act and the coming into operation of section 4, the joint tenancy will not apply to the home or the intended home. I must stress that the decision to opt out is one for the benefiting spouse alone and that the decision should only be taken where that spouse understands the implications of his or her act and is happy to accept the consequences.  Agreement between the spouses is not necessary for the declaration to be effective.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that the interest conferred by the Bill is equitable rather than legal.  The main reason for this is that an automatic vesting of the legal interest in the benefiting spouse could give rise to considerable difficulties for future purchasers of matrimonial homes and could adversely affect the marketability of domestic property. However, while the equitable interest conferred by the Bill is the real and beneficial interest, it is desirable that the legal formalities relating to ownership be tidied up by both spouses.  Section 8 allows for the joint tenancy interest to be registered and provides that on registration any nominal legal interest of the owning spouse in the home will vest in both spouses.  I strongly urge that this procedure be availed of.  To encourage this, the usual stamp duty or registration fees will not apply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> While the Bill is essentially reforming social legislation, it affects property rights and therefore does have conveyancing implications.  Section 9, therefore, sets out specific situations in which a purchaser can get a good title to the joint tenancy interest in the matrimonial home.  In brief, such a title will be passed where both spouses convey an interest. It will also be passed where it is conveyed by one of the spouses but where the purchase is bona fide for full value and the purchaser is without notice that the home is a matrimonial home.  If the first conveyance was not made in either of these situations, a subsequent purchaser will get a good title if full value is given and the purchaser is without actual notice that the home is a matrimonial home.</P>
    <P>Even where purchasers have acquired good title, a spouse who may have been disadvantaged will still have rights against the other spouse in relation to the purchase money and these rights are being preserved.  Furthermore, the requirement to obtain the consent of the non-owning spouse to the conveyance of the home, in accordance with the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, will still apply.</P>
    <P>One final conveyancing point is provided for in section 11.  Once six years have elapsed from the date of a conveyance of a matrimonial home and provided that the benefiting spouse is not then in occupation of the home, the title of the purchaser will acquire a degree of certainty.  Section 23 contains an analogous limitation period in relation to the Family Home Protection Act.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions in the Bill are largely self-explanatory but there are a few issues with which I would like to deal briefly.  Section 15 makes it plain that, if the benefiting spouse is bankrupt when he or she would acquire the section 4 interest, the interest will not vest in that spouse.  Section 21, in line with the intention to have any court proceedings under the Bill determined as speedily and as cheaply as possible, extends the jurisdiction of the District Court so far as homes with a rateable valuation not exceeding £20 are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> As I already mentioned, in section 23 the definition of family home, as contained in the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, is being made virtually synonymous with that of the matrimonial home in section 2 and this should avoid any difficulties or confusion that would otherwise arise.  Provision has also been made for transitional arrangements to safeguard those spouse who currently enjoy protection under the 1976 Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill testifies to the value of marriage in our society and confirms it as an institution where partnership and sharing should predominate.  By automatically conferring joint ownership of the matrimonial home on the partners to a marriage, it recognises that the contributions of both spouses are capable of having equal validity, regardless of whether one contribution is valued in money terms and the other contribution comes through the daily task of caring and nurturing in the home itself.  It seeks to get away from the reductive system whereby work is deemed to be of value only if it can be expressed in monetary terms.  It pays tribute to different values and insists that these also be recognised and honoured.</P>
    <P>I look forward to what I expect will be a stimulating and interesting debate on the provisions of this Bill and I reiterate that I will consider carefully any suggestions made by Senators for its improvement. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  As the Minister said, it recognises that marriage is a partnership with equal roles for both spouses in promoting and developing that partnership.  It recognises the contribution of both partners to the maintenance of the family unit and is in accordance with the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael has called for such a Bill since the Supreme Court decision in December 1991 denied women automatic right to the family home.  At the time, we put down a motion on the Seanad Order Paper on this issue.  In that context I welcome this Bill.  I note the complexity <Col N="1527" /> of the Bill; perhaps this is one of the reasons for the delay of almost two years in its introduction.</P>
    <P>The Bill takes into account the social realities of modern Irish society.  Up to the date of its implementation, a person whose spouse is dead is on a safer financial footing than a person in a broken marriage.  The Bill is particularly relevant in furthering women's rights.  Women make up the majority of dependent spouses.  Changes brought about by the implementation of the Bill will mark the recognition of changes demanded by society to recognise the equal role of both spouses.  It will help remove some of the low self-esteem often felt by the wife and mother in the home who was regarded heretofore as her husband's dependant. The report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, extensively discussed in this House, states that the wife working in the home is entitled to a share in the family home and the family income instead of being maintained as a dependant and as someone whose esteem depends on the goodwill of the other spouse.</P>
    <P>The Minister commented on concerns expressed about the proposed legislation affecting proceedings under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill which allows flexibility for the courts to make orders regarding property given the failure in securing maintenance payments, a constant feature of existing law. I note the Minister's comment in this regard and we may tease this out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This is a complex and detailed Bill and the central issue is the ownership of the home.  However, the Bill does not go as far as recommended by the Second Commission on the Status of Women. The commission recommended not only joint ownership of the family home but also joint entitlement to income and a legal right to share one half of the estate where the other spouse dies testate.  It also recommended no change in this regard where the other spouse dies intestate.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended a legal prohibition against charging any lands, <Col N="1528" /> premises, business, enterprise, assets, savings or investments without the consent of the other spouse above a discretionary limit.  It recommends a provision for the court to dispense with this consent and to make recommendations in regard to the right to information about income and assets and control and management of property based on title with no responsibility for premarital debt.  Perhaps the Minister, in his reply, will comment on this.  It may be outside the scope of this Bill but it was a central issue in the Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  Perhaps the Minister would like to state whether he plans to initiate legislation on these proposals and if he does, when he plans to introduce it.  It is important that we recognise that in many circumstances the man is in a position to go out to work because his wife stays at home and cares for the house and children. Surely then she has a legal right to a portion of that income.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the role of this Bill in a future divorce referendum.  One of the reasons for the defeat of the 1986 divorce referendum was the absence of this type of legislation.  It is important that the Bill before us will be fully operational well in advance of the Minister's proposed referendum.  There is a growing belief that the proposed referendum will get an easy passage.  I do not share this view.  It is important that all the difficulties which may arise during the debate are anticipated and that legislation is introduced well in advance of the referendum.  We must head off the type of scare stories which were abroad during the last referendum, and the Bill is one measure which will be of assistance in doing this.</P>
    <P>I will refer to other areas in the context of the introduction of a divorce referendum and, hopefully, a situation where there is controlled divorce thereafter.  A family court system should be developed to cater for the increasing number of cases of marital breakdown, If a divorce referendum is successful, thousands of separated people whose marriages are in name only will seek decrees of divorce.  At present the number of welfare officers <Col N="1529" /> is being reduced but it must be increased. The extra personnel is required in the resolution of family disputes to ensure that the welfare of the children and the vulnerable spouses is fully safeguarded. There must be increased funding for mediation services and couples should be encouraged to reach a sensible agreement without engaging in court conflict regarding the protection of the children in respect of family and property matters.</P>
    <P>Provision must be made to ensure that a divorced wife is not excluded from benefit under her former husband's occupational pension scheme.  The law must also be up-dated to protect the succession rights of divorced dependent wives.  The provisions of the Bill will increase the cost of property conveyancing, even though the Minister has qualified that in his speech.  Title investigation will be more detailed and new statutory declarations will be required.  Legal advice for both spouses or intending spouses will be required.  All this costs more money and, as I have said, it will be essential to have an improved or an expanded scheme of civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the matrimonial home and the farm; the Minister touched on this.  I can see some difficulties which must be overcome.  On most farms it is difficult to separate the family home from the buildings and yard adjacent to it. The traditional family farmhouse was an integral part of the group of buildings which serviced the farm.  The farmhouse was fronted by the farmyard and was flanked on each side by the farm outoffices. This was the traditional approach which still exists in many parts of rural Ireland.  Where does the family farm begin and end in such circumstances? How does one sell off the farm and retain an interest in the family home?</P>
    <P>The Minister has highlighted the difficulties and I wish to refer to them where a dwelling includes a business within its walls, whether it is a shop, an accountant's office, a bar or an auctioneering business which is often undertaken, as Senator Farrell will know, within the confines of the family home.  How can this situation be catered for?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> Section 7 allows a married couple or a couple contemplating marriage to opt out or exclude the application of section 4 to their matrimonial home or intended matrimonial home.  A case can be made in favour of this approach in certain circumstances. The fact that the Minister is introducing a special format for this is helpful but the Bill should have procedures to guard against the potential for undue influence of one partner over another.  The Minister goes some way to cater for this in saying that the partners must have obtained legal aid but I would like to ensure that the vulnerable partner is not overly influenced in any way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill; my party has been asking for this Bill for some time and I commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Matrimonial Home Bill shows the Government's commitment to equality which is enunciated in the Programme for a Partnership Government and in the National Development Plan.  The Bill before the House is a clear manifestation of this commitment.  It is a direct response to the widespread concern and confusion felt around this country as a result of marital breakdown, and difficulties in property transfer within families.</P>
      <P>At a legal level, one can trace this evolution back to the Women's Property Act, 1882.  Prior to this Act, any property owned by a woman prior to her marriage automatically became the property of her husband.  The 1882 Act provided that a married woman would be capable of acquiring and disposing of property. While the fact that such an act was even necessary for such an inalienable right may seem bizarre to us in this day and age, the Act did mark a fundamental step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Intestates Estate Act, 1890, the Registration of Title (Ireland) Act, 1891, and the Intestates Estate Act, 1954, covered the issue of entitlement after death. However in terms of legislation, there was obviously much to be done.  In 1959, the Administration of Estates Acts completed the reform started by the Registration <Col N="1531" /> of Title Act, 1891.  Modern statutes also had an important role to play.</P>
    <P>The Succession Act, 1965, put an end to the absolute freedom of a testator to dispose of his property as he saw fit and allowed for certain provisions to be granted to his spouse and surviving children. It also allowed for a child to make an application under section 117 which allowed the court to make provision if it was of the opinion that the testator had failed in his moral duty to make proper provision for the child.  The Act also allowed a spouse to claim a legal right share which cannot be disturbed by any other provision in the will.</P>
    <P>The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, was the first piece of legislation to tackle the question of the rights of spouses and children where a marriage was recognised to have terminated. While this Act does not allow for any alteration in the ownership of property while the marriage existed, after the granting of a decree of judicial separation it allows the courts a very wide range of powers to make ancillary orders not only on maintenance but on adjustment of property ownership and capital assets disposal, as well as an extinguishment of succession rights.  The Married Women's Status Act, 1957, recognised a married woman's position as similar to that of an unmarried person in relation to torts, contracts and the ownership and disposition of property.</P>
    <P>The Family Home Protection Act, 1976, which has many similarities with the Canadian Dower Acts, gave a spouse a right of veto over the sale of a family home.  In particular it provides that a spouse may not sell or mortgage the family home without the prior consent in writing of the other spouse.  The Act also provides that where one spouse is engaging in conduct which may lead to the loss of an interest in the home and that this is done with the intention of depriving the other spouse or a dependent child of residence in the home, a court may make an order in relation to the protection of that home.  In the case of <i>Somers v. Weir</i>, <Col N="1532" /> which was initially heard in the High Court, the Supreme Court held that:</P>
    <P>... if the necessary enquiries had been made the purchaser's solicitor would have been aware of the earlier non-compliance with the provisions of the Act, resulting in the purchaser by imputation having notice of the position at the time of the conveyance to him.</P>
    <P>I will come back to this point later on another section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Family Home Protection Act, 1976, also contains provisions restraining a spouse from disposing of household goods to the extent that it would be difficult for the other spouse or dependent children to reside in the family home without undue hardship.  In one particular case &mdash;<i>B.L. v. M.L., 1989, ILRM 528</i>&mdash; a High Court judge decided that a woman who elected to adopt a full-time role of wife and mother in the home was thus precluded from contributing directly or indirectly in money or moneys worth to the purchase of the family home and was, under Article 41.2 of the Constitution, entitled to have her work as home-maker and mother taken into account in calculating her contribution towards the acquisition of the family home.  However, this decision was appealed to the Supreme Court which, in a judgment given on 5 December 1991, reversed the High Court decision confirming the existing law that a spouse must make a contribution in money or money's worth to acquire a beneficial interest in the ownership of the family home.</P>
    <P>What is illuminated by this slow process of the law is that it reflects, often in a painful manner, the struggle of women to gain full equality in our society; from a position where they were merely seen as adjuncts to men, to the present when the Government is engaging in a marked process of equalisation.</P>
    <P>Many have chosen to interpret this Bill merely as a paving stone towards the coming constitutional referendum on divorce. While this may be true in part, I prefer to see this Bill in a broader context. <Col N="1533" /> The <i>raison d'être</i> of the Bill is to protect the rights of those in society who find themselves in a vulnerable position. In a situation of marital breakdown this position of weakness can apply to women and children in particular.  It is a situation that demands to be rectified, and this is the true intention of the Matrimonial Home Bill.</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown is an unavoidable fact in Ireland.  There can be very few of us who, at this stage, do not know someone who is in an unhappy marital situation.  Marriage breakdown can be a traumatic and scarring experience.  There is an onus on the State to ensure that, in the event of an irretrievable breakdown, no partner or child is left in a financially vulnerable or impoverished situation. When a marriage does break down it is often women who find themselves in this impoverished situation, sometimes after many years as homemakers or working parents.  In such a case the family home is a vital piece of security for the wife and offspring.  It is vital to their future wellbeing and for the best interests of any children involved.  Joint ownership of the family home is a natural right, pure and simple, that is why this Bill is so important and so welcome.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has always been a caring party, and this philosophy has continued with our partners in Government, the Labour Party.  The Government has an underlying commitment to care.  This philosophy will have a central role to play in how this Government approaches the problem of marital breakdown and other associated social problems.  It is a problem that demands a multi-levelled, sensitive and considerate approach.  I believe that this Bill is a manifestation of this attitude.  It is a very clear indication of the pro-active and positive manner in which this Government, and in particular the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, proposes to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>On a further point, I would like to ask the Minister about the provision under section 22 (1) which states that &ldquo;Proceedings under this Act shall be heard otherwise than in public.&rdquo;  Due to the fact that the High Court, Circuit Court and <Col N="1534" /> District Court have jurisdiction in many matters dealt with under this Bill, I would ask that provision be made for the proper reporting of all Circuit Court and High Court hearings <i>in camera</i> so that the process of precedent as laid down by the High Court in its interpretation of this legislation &mdash; and also the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which gives a wide range of powers to make ancillary orders &mdash; can be recorded and followed by the lower courts when dealing with these matters. At times it seems there is no precedent and orders seem to be made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis from area to area and from sitting to sitting.</P>
    <P>I welcome and fully commend this Bill. At a later stage, I would also like to see a wider definition of property.  We could perhaps look at examples from the civil law system where instead of having joint ownership, certain types of property are vested in community property within the marriage system.  This Bill is important in covering aspects in marital breakdown and helping spouses in that situation to get the maximum protection possible.  It is also vitally important in underpinning the importance and value which our Constitution places, and which our legislation to date has placed, on the importance of the institution of marriage.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister once again for leading the way in reforming legislation in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, warmly welcome the Minister and this Bill to the House.  The tone of the Bill is set in the last part of the Minister's speech where he said:</P>
      <P>This Bill testifies to the value of marriage in our society and confirms it as an institution where partnership and sharing should predominate...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... it recognises that the contributions of both spouses are capable of having equal validity, regardless of whether one contribution is valued in money terms and the other contribution comes through the daily task of caring and nurturing within the <Col N="1535" /> home itself.  It seeks to get away from the reductive system whereby work is deemed to be of value only if it can be expressed in monetary terms.  It pays tribute to different values and insists that these also be recognised and honoured.</P>
    <P>It is often suggested that there are two different sorts of women; women who work within the home and those who work outside it.  Frankly, no one knows better the value of those who work solely within the home than those who also work outside it because they know what it costs not just in time but also in money, to replace time within the home.  The Minister has done far more in this Bill in recognising the value of women's work and of the institution of marriage and the family in our society than anything in Article 41.3 of the Constitution.  I warmly commend the Minister for this paragraph in his speech because it is important to look at the whole Bill.  What we are doing in this Bill is trying to enhance the position and stability of marriage in society.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has taken such urgent action on this Bill is very good.  It may give him some pleasure to hear the following.  Today I was at the launch of a book by a former Member of this House, Gemma Hussey.  On page 113 of the book, <i>Ireland Today &mdash; Anatomy of a Changing State</i>, she talks about the decision of the courts in 1991 which&mdash;</P>
    <P>established that, despite some legal protection for a spouse's interest in the family home, it is not automatic that each partner is entitled to half of the home.  This was deemed to be depriving people of their constitutional right to private property (Article 43.1). Shocked by this bald statement, which dismayed most women in the country, promises were made that legislation would be immediately forthcoming.  By late 1992, no such legislation had appeared.  When a general election was called in November 1992, and seven weeks elapsed before a new Government was formed, hopes for such legislation in the short term were dashed. <Col N="1536" /> A new promise was made in the programme of the new government for &ldquo;legislation to give each spouse an equal share in the family home and household belongings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>How very nice that today we are able to say that this has moved one step forward, and that these words will very shortly be out of date.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing the Bill on such a good day.  In 1964 Charles Haughey said that women Members of the Oireachtas should take a particular interest in and carefully examine all legislation affecting women.  As previous speakers said, it is mainly women who will benefit from this leglislation. In 1964 there were only four women Members of the Oireachtas, there are now 28.  When the Bill was debated in the Dáil the Minister received seven times as much advice from women as he would have received 30 years ago and I am glad he has taken some of that advice on board as is evident in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the most interesting things about this Bill is that it is of most importance to older women and women living in rural areas.  While most of us talk about owning our own houses we do not really own them because a bank or building society has a big share in them.  Over the last 20 years or so such institutions have been very careful to try to include the names of both spouses in lending agreements in their own interests rather than in the interests of their women clients.  It is good to see that women who were unprotected within their homes are now automatically protected.  It is also very good &mdash; the Minister pointed this out &mdash; that judgments based on the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and which generally gave women half, or in some cases a greater share, of the family home, will not be affected.  It is extraordinary that in the past one had to fight with one's husband and separate from him to get some form of legal ownership of the family home.  This situation has now been changed so that those of us who are happily living <Col N="1537" /> together for many years will have security.</P>
    <P>Legal friends have told me that the Minister has been very wise in making this a case of joint tenancy where the whole house will go to the remaining spouse.  I am also advised &mdash; the Minister also said this &mdash; that it would be unfair to change the situation of those who are already legally separated because they will probably already have made arrangements and legal chaos could result.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville spoke about the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The First Commission on the Status of Women stated that this change was sadly needed.  It has taken nearly 25 years for this change to take place which makes today a day for even more congratulations. Senator Neville raised another important point and said that the commission's recommendations on the right to a joint income and information regarding income, to which a woman has no right at the moment should be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>In rural areas the farm as well as the matrimonial home will be of great value. While the women may not have any legal right to the farm, I wonder what is their position.  After all, they may have made an enormous contribution to the income of the farm.  This is an area where injustice could be meted out to women who make an income from their endeavours on the farm.  Teagasc has pointed out that there is no recognition of the enormous amount of work done by women on farms.  This will have to be dealt with in future legislation.</P>
    <P>When I read the Bill initially I was worried about contracting out or opting out by the beneficial party.  Catherine McGuinness, addressing a Fianna Fáil women's group last Saturday, said that if one's fiancé says &ldquo;contract out&rdquo; one should have another look at one's fiancé. I hope such cases will be rare exceptions and I am glad the Minister has decided that people who want to opt out should have independent legal advice.  Occasionally there may be very good reasons for opting out but it is important that young <Col N="1538" /> people in particular should understand the implications of opting out.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was speaking in the Dáil he had a nice idea of romantic love; he said that two adult people with their wits about them would not need much advice.  Romantic love is not always described as having one's wits about one. The princess may kiss the toad and he may stay a toad or the prince may nourish a viper to his bosom.  It is appropriate that the Minister has decided they should have independent legal advice in these situations.  I gather excessive enrichment, such as an enormous country home, is being dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Divorce legislation which may be introduced, as promised by the Programme for a Partnership Government, would be important.  Divorce will not be easily introduced; there will be a great deal of resistance to introducing such legislation. Marriage breakdown is terrible and, unfortunately, many people decide to make their own legal arrangements which are not very satisfactory in many cases. We will have to rely on the Government to carefully explain the legislation they introduce.</P>
    <P>This Bill greatly enhances the status of marriage and the status of women in marriage.  The President, a former Member of this House, will have the greatest pleasure signing this Bill.  She has done so much for women's rights.  I warmly commend the Minister not just for the Bill but for the urgency with which he has introduced it.  We should stress this Bill as a means of enhancing marriage rather than as a prelude to divorce.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the Matrimonial Home Bill and congratulate the Minister for being brave enough to tackle this issue in a practical way.  This matter was raised many times in both Houses and proposed by many but was brushed aside because of its complicated nature.  The Bill is simple in its main object but the ramifications, results and possible results are many.  Its object is to give spouses equal rights in the ownership of the matrimonial home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> Because of the intricate and technical legal principles and rules related to the Bill it may be helpful to give Senators a brief outline of the law on this matter prior to the Bill.  At common law up to the last century a married woman was not allowed to own property.  The law went much further and stated that a woman was herself property, the property of her husband, and, therefore, had no independent rights, including that of property ownership.  In those days upon marriage any property belonging to the newly wed woman prior to marriage automatically went to her husband.  Even her personal items became his.  Therefore, if Cupid's arrow did not hit the man's heart her bank balance certainly did.  In more recent times, the married woman was allowed to own items of personal use, or paraphernalia as it was called.  Then legislation was introduced to allow her own her own property. However, this right was limited and in practice women who owned property still tended to hand it over to their husbands. Only in 1957 with the introduction of the Married Women's Status Act did we see a provision that a married woman could deal with property as an independent person.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that many married women are not joint registered legal owners of the family home.  In many cases the husband attended the auction or the estate agent, went to the solicitor and placed only his name on the title documents. While this will not pose a problem to a happy couple, it can create fear and panic for the non-property owning spouse in times of trouble and dispute. This Bill hopes to give such spouses some comfort in the knowledge that they will have some rights in the property in which they live.</P>
    <P>The first and second reports of the Commission on the Status of Women recommended that legislation should be introduced to provide for joint ownership of the family home by a married couple. The Department of Equality and Law Reform has accepted this proposal and this Bill is the obvious result.  Both the <Col N="1540" /> Commission and the Minister consider this a first step in providing a suitable régime of marital property in order to eliminate inequality in the traditional marriage.  In this regard, there is an argument for community property, that is, community ownership of property in the sense that all property and income of the married couple would be equally owned. I would be the first to admit that such a proposal would entail much consideration and discussion and would give rise to some controversy.  It would obviously be a major task.  However, I believe the Minister is right to get on with his job by dealing with what is a matter of priority &mdash; the matrimonial home.</P>
    <P>Many people may not realise that a form of deferred community property already exists in Ireland in the form of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  That legislation allows the court, in the case of judicial separation, to divide the family property in whatever way it deems fit in the individual circumstances.  There is no predetermined share but the court is given power to take into consideration contributions of a spouse to the welfare of the family, the children's ages, conduct of each spouse, effects on earning capacity, etc., in deciding who gets what, to put it bluntly.  However, the 1989 legislation deals only with cases of judicial separation. The situation of ordinary married couples needed examination.</P>
    <P>We cannot speak of equality of the sexes until we are prepared to back it up in practical terms.  Thousands of women in Ireland suffer from low self esteem and a lack of appreciation for all they do. Senator Henry referred to this and I feel it really affects women in isolated rural areas and older women.  The Constitution praises the role of women in the home, but what good is that when a woman works herself to the bone looking after her husband and children only to find herself with nothing at the end of the day, perhaps not even a thank you?  There can be no improvement in the status of women until they have full access to money and power.  In all justice, the wife working in the home is at least entitled <Col N="1541" /> to a share in it.  That is why this Bill is crucial.</P>
    <P>We all know that in many cases the husband is the breadwinner while the wife remains at home.  This means that but for a paltry children's allowance, the wife may not have any money of her own. This places her in a difficult situation if the couple fall out.  The situation is much worse where the wife does not have any ownership in the home &mdash; the house in which she has lived and worked for many years.  Her fear is that she can be left without a roof over her head.</P>
    <P>In recent years, various court decisions stated that a spouse gained property rights by working in the home and thus contributing indirectly to the household finances.  However, last year the Supreme Court in a case entitled L <i>v.</i> L decided that this was not correct and that the housewife did not have any right to the family home simply because she worked in it for so long.  The Matrimonial Home Bill rectifies this appalling situation by automatically granting 50 per cent equitable ownership of the home to each spouse.  Thus, it rewards those women who have worked at home for years and may have no money or property to show for it.  They will now be deemed to have half the value of the home, even if they are not legally registered as joint owners on the title deeds.</P>
    <P>All too often I see the unhappy effects of marriage disputes.  I hope that this Bill will bring some relief to the non-owning spouse and will remove the fear of being abandoned.  I welcome in particular the fact that the right to joint ownership is automatic.  Spouses do not have to go to solicitors to get this right enforced. However, as the Minister stated, they are facilitated fully if they wish to place their joint names on the title documents.  They do not have to pay stamp duty and, to my knowledge, the Registry of Deeds or Land Registry fee is at most £40.  Neither will this right be adversely affected by taxation, in that capital acquisitions tax will not apply to this acquired right. Therefore, any concerned spouse can sort the matter out as simply as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> This Bill is undeniably complicated.  It has to be because it touches on many constitutional and legal issues.  It affects conveyancing law and practice and will have a significant impact on many people. It deals with the right of way or other easements which may be necessary to give proper and practical effect to the law by dividing the home from, for example, the business or farm.  The Bill deals with possible effects on bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>In particular, I welcome the fact that the benefiting spouse under this legislation will not be deprived of his or her right simply because the erring spouse has had a judgment registered against the property in question by virtue of debts. The Minister has stated that in such circumstances the joint tenancy in the home divides to become two separate shares, one to each spouse &mdash; in technical terms, a tenancy in common.  Therefore, the judgment mortgage can only affect the erring spouse's half share of the matrimonial home.</P>
    <P>I had to consider the right to opt out of this legislation long and hard and I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has provided the requirement of independent legal advice.  Often a couple come together to their solicitor's office and get advice which will possibly suit only one partner.  This may only trouble them if it comes to a separation but at that stage it is too late.  I know that in small towns it may be difficult to get independent legal advice.  However, this requirement will ensure that spouses get proper advice when they are considering such a serious matter as whether to opt out of their rights under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill covers chattels in the home, that is, the right to ownership of half the household items. That is not insignificant.  I know a woman who minds babies in her home to contribute to the family income.  She saved her children's allowance and bought a fridge-freezer and cooker recently with that money.  That simple purchase requires much saving on the part of the housewife who has no real personal income.  The joint ownership of all such <Col N="1543" /> items is a practical assistance to such women.  Many women, including my mother, contribute in a big way to saving family income by her work in the home, 24 hours a day &mdash; cooking, washing, cleaning, saving on laundry, medical and many other household bills.  This legislation gives some recognition to the valuable and essential work of the woman in the home which I am delighted to see.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be pleased to hear that I have spoken to groups of women who are thrilled with this legislation. However, I warn him &mdash; and I know it was referred to earlier &mdash; that they now want joint ownership of the business, farm and everything else to which they contribute.  I know that is for another day but it should not be forgotten.  This Bill is important to older women, as I said earlier.  They grew up in a situation where they may not have expected those rights. Perhaps they have lived in fear in unhappy marriages and this Bill gives them some consolation and security, which cannot be overlooked.  Since marriage is a partnership which each spouse promotes and safeguards, this Bill will give proper recognition to the contribution which each makes towards the maintenance of the family unit.  I welcome it wholeheartedly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The general principle of this Bill which the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor introduced has been recognised and it will be fully supported by this side of the House. The rights of the wife and husband will be safeguarded in this Bill and this is as it should be.  It is not a matter of one person seeking an advantage over another or of someone trying to prove a superior interest.  The Minister is trying to achieve balance and fair play and people will know that their rights in the family home are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not hear the entire debate in the Dáil on this issue, but I ask the Minister to consider one matter in relation to this Bill.  Joint tenancy means the survivor obtains the interest in the property.  In other words, if I am in business with a <Col N="1544" /> person and we have joint interest in a property, the survivor gets everything on death.  For example, a husband and wife are living unhappily together because the husband is a gambler and a heavy drinker, in other words, a &ldquo;rake&rdquo;.  The wife is concerned about the young family because she knows that if her husband obtains the property he could lose it. Legal advice should be given to this lady that a tenancy in common might be better.  From my understanding of this legislation, the husband gets everything when the wife dies.  As a result, the wife is concerned that the husband would waste or sell the assets.  Perhaps the Minister has considered this situation, but I would like his views on it.</P>
    <P>Although many people have a stable relationship with their partners, they are anxious to protect their own rights and interests and those of their children.  For example, if a partner dies and the property is given to the surviving partner, the property could be sold and their children might not be protected.  Will the Minister outline his views on this issue because it is worthy of consideration?</P>
    <P>There are many problems relating to marriage break-up.  It is important for the Government to do whatever it can to resolve family problems.  Every effort should be made to help marriages in difficulty because the State or Church can only do a limited amount.  The problem needs to be resolved by the husband and wife.  We should try to protect, foster and strengthen marriage in every possible way.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with a limited number of cases.  Senator Gallagher is a solicitor and has dealt with many matters of this nature over the years.  I am sure that 95 per cent of family matters with which she deals involve good family relations.  It is the 5 per cent which must be dealt with as they are the difficult cases.  The laws should cater for the small percentage of people.</P>
    <P>Many men believe they can achieve anything if they have money and power. Some effort must be made to curtail these powers and the Bill goes in that direction. <Col N="1545" /> There must be understanding, kindness and love in a marriage to make it work.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has reduced the costs involved in registering the property in joint names.  This is important because £200 or £300 is a significant amount of money for some people, even when they are dealing with family homes worth thousands of pounds.  Every effort should be made to minimise the costs involved.</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of the Bill in regard to the family home.  Chattels cannot be divided between people. Family heirlooms have been handed down through families.  I do not have a grand piano as my family are not interested in music, therefore it is of no interest to me.  However, in some families heirlooms have been passed from one generation to another.  We should make practical laws, especially in relation to the family home.  However, it is wrong to make regulations which state that a sofa, dresser or wardrobe must go to a particular person.  I have no objection if my wife wants to leave a dresser to someone she likes, and she would not object if I left an item to some person.  That is what life is about and one cannot go too far in restricting people's rights.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes overboard and extends powers too far.  One cannot curtail freedom too much.  It is wrong to introduce regulations and legislation which tell my wife to leave me specific chattels.  Nobody has the right to tell either of us what we can or cannot leave each other.  That is going a little too far so I have some reservations about the provision relating to chattels.</P>
    <P>However, it is necessary to protect the family home.  I live in an area where, over the years, I have seen many people who are fond of gambling and drinking.  Some of them would blow not just one or two farms but five if they had them.  Fortunately, they are the exceptions rather than the rule.  Therefore, I agree with protecting the family home but it is an interference with the rights of individuals to extend it to the chattels in the home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1546" /> I also ask the Minister to think about the tenancies in common.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is good and necessary legislation.  All legislation is &mdash; and always has been &mdash; a reaction to a situation.  It is a pity that we have to enact this type of legislation and that so many marriages are breaking down.  I would like to see some system or scheme which might reduce the present rate of marriage breakdown.  The sad thing is that marriages are not breaking down once but, in many cases, two and three times, that is the harsh reality.  It seems from the statistics in the media and surveys that people who cannot make marriage work the first time often cannot do so the second or third time either.  It is a complicated problem which is difficult to confront.</P>
      <P>I am pleased this Bill is before the House and I do not agree with the female Members who say it is all in favour of women.  It is a balanced Bill in favour of both spouses.  That is how it should be and what I like about it.</P>
      <P>Women suffer more ailments and ill health than men.  I have been saying for a long time that they are over-worked. When women get married and are rearing a family, they should get a five to seven year break or leave of absence from work.  At the end of two years, they could do a course to keep abreast of change.  If women retire to look after their family or home, they lose their jobs and cannot return to work.</P>
      <P>Families need money when children are going to secondary school, it could cost between £8,000 to £12,000 to keep two or three children in university; it cost £4,000 five or six years ago.  I ask that, at some stage, provision be made for a woman who wishes to take five years' leave of absence with a right to return to work.  I would like to see this happen and many women also want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a woman was elected as a Senator or TD, she could return to work if she lost her seat but, unfortunately, if a woman leaves work to look after a family and home, she cannot return to work.  Which is more important?  That is the greatest <Col N="1547" /> right women could have and it should be made available to them.</P>
    <P>I am pleased there is recognition in this Bill for women who work in the home, they are the saints of this country but, sadly, they do not get recognition.  There is some recognition in the new social welfare legislation and I am delighted with that.  I am glad that, in assessing the value of a home, a woman's work and contribution by way of saving money and so on is considered.</P>
    <P>I had ten years' experience as a rate collector and 20 years' experience selling to the farming community and I am qualified to speak about them.  Some 95 per cent of the women hold the purse; if she decides something is unnecessary, it is not bought.  I do not believe that women have as few rights as some of them make us believe, I say that from practical experience.</P>
    <P>When one started to sell, if the woman did not like or want what was on offer, it was not bought.  I could count on the few fingers I have left the number of men who paid me rates; it was always the woman who held the purse.  Those are facts and I do not believe that women were as downtrodden as some feminists say they were.  However, I am pleased that their work is being taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I have some problems which I am sure the Minister will clarify for me.  When a wealthy woman or man gets married, does the new partner automatically gain half ownership of the property into which they come with one hand as long as the other?  It would be very bad if this was the case.  I tried to figure it out but I can never understand the legal jargon in Acts.  It is a pity they could not be written in clear and simple language such as that in the Minister's speech.  I always learn more from the Minister's speech than I do from the Act as I get confused when reading it.  It is important that there is a system whereby a property would be valued in that situation.  If property was worth £100,000 initially and at the end of the marriage was worth £150,000, the joint ownership should be assessed on <Col N="1548" /> £50,000 because it could have been handed down from generation to generation and be worth a large sum of money.  Many people can play a nice game until they get access to a business or property and then they are seen in their true colours.  &ldquo;Love runs blind but marriage is an eye opener&rdquo; is an old saying.  People say all the nice things when they are being wined and dined, it applies to men and women.</P>
    <P>There should be at least two valuations of the property.  I know of a case where a man and a wife separated amicably and decided to get the property valued by a professional.  The gentleman was a tricky little man but was himself fooled in the end.  He told the valuer to get someone to buy the property for a certain sum although it was worth much more.  When the professional gentleman bought it and the former owner went to collect his extra money, he said he had bought it, that it was his, so neither gained in the end.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill to ensure that, even when the two people agree, there are two valuations to ensure the true value of the property is realised.  I know of another case where the property was on the market for a long time because the two partners could not agree on its value.  The problem was that one of the partners was trying to upset the sale and not give the woman a chance.  In that case the woman was victimised.  I had experience of another case where property was left to a religious order.  One of the members wanted to give it to a certain valuer so the religious order got three valuations and selected the middle one to agree a price.  That was a good way to sort it out because it resulted in a fair price.</P>
    <P>Can a spouse leave his or her share of the home to a member of the family? Does the other spouse automatically inherit it?  A spouse who becomes a full owner may get married again and the children of the first marriage may get nothing from the property.  It is important to protect the children.  The first spouse should be entitled to decide what to do with his or her share of the property, it should not automatically be inherited by <Col N="1549" /> the other spouse.  I hope the legislation will not apply to cohabitating couples as that could be complicated.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville referred to property in rural areas.  Being an auctioneer I have encountered people who, having bought a farm, wish to sell the house.  That has resulted in problems because they may decide that they wish to keep an outside shed.  I advise that the shed must be taken down and re-erected, otherwise nobody will buy the house because of cattle roaring and causing disturbance.  There must be at least half an acre with the house.  It is difficult to divide a house from a farm. Likewise, in a town, a business may be attached to the house.  It may be a pub, grocery or some other business with perhaps a yard and storehouses that go with the business.  In such cases it might be better to have valuations so that there could be a monetary solution.</P>
    <P>While the law works well on paper we may find that it is not easy to put it into practice.  I am speaking as an auctioneer who has tried to sell houses on farms. There is a problem dividing the home from the land and in such cases the spouse who wishes to leave should receive their share in money.  They could then buy a house which would be worth more to them.  They may get more value as a result because, even if they got the original house, it would be difficult to sell it later if cattle are roaming around it, if cars are parked outside it or if they do not own the business premises attached to it.  In the interest of the spouse who wishes to leave we should provide an option in the legislation whereby he or she can receive the monetary value of their share which would give them the opportunity to purchase another home or perhaps start their own business.  While I welcome the Bill there are practical problems in those areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright mentioned common sense.  God knows, if common sense prevailed there would be no problems.  It is the 4 per cent or 5 per cent of people who kick over the traces who keep many others in jobs.  If people used their common sense there would be less need for solicitors and gardaí and many people <Col N="1550" /> would be out of work.  Those who do not have common sense keep people in jobs.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to divide chattels.  When I sell farms it is difficult to sell the contents of the house although they may be of value in the house.  If it is an old house and the contents are antiques there is no problem selling them, otherwise there may not be much interest.  Some contents may be very valuable to the house owners.  I do not see how the division of chattels can work.  If there is only one double bed in the house do you split it in two and make two single beds?  That may be simplifying the issue but in many cases there may be only one of each item.  How can those items be divided?  Perhaps it would be better to use a valuation system so that the spouse who leaves can get the value of the chattels rather than stripping the house.</P>
    <P>If there is an heirloom the spouse who inherited it should automatically be permitted to take it.  That is fair.  It may not be worth much but it is a point to be borne in mind when dividing the chattels.</P>
    <P>It is good to see a Minister come into the House with an open mind; I congratulate him for not saying take it or leave it.  I am pleased that he is prepared to have another look at the Bill if he believes some of our points should be considered and I would like him to look at the points I have raised.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he will not disturb existing arrangements where the parties concerned have made their own decisions about the distribution of property.  I have referred to that point.  In such cases one spouse might have agreed because they were fed up and wanted to get out, or they might have agreed in a weak moment.  In that case there should be a double valuation.  It is too easy for property to be sold under its value with an agreement of that kind and it ends up, with some smart alec taking advantage of one spouse I would like more emphasis on valuations to ensure that the market value of the property is obtained and that both parties get a fair share.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that where spouses decide to transfer and share ownership there is no great legal expense involved. <Col N="1551" /> That is necessary because if one had to pay full legal fees, stamp duty, etc., for transferring property the cost would be prohibitive and that would stop many people from doing so.  I am happy the Minister has taken that into consideration so that the title will be waterproof and, at the same time, one does not have to pay big legal fees or stamp duty.</P>
    <P>I presume that when we were talking about chattels we were not referring only to the furniture in the house.  On a farm, for example, there will be cattle and farm machinery and if both spouses have helped to build up the farm both should be entitled to half the profits.  &ldquo;Chattels&rdquo; should cover more than the bare essentials in the home; it should take into account whatever the couple have built up together.</P>
    <P>There should be a valuation system.  If a man marries into a business, it should be valued at that time and if they split up later any money he has put into that business should be deducted.  The same applies where a woman marries into a home and the spouses split up later, the profits made from the joint partnership should be divided in total.  If a woman married a man who had only five or six cows and she had a few thousand pounds and bought 30 or 40 cows, and they split up, she should get half of everything. Similarly, if they go into a business which is run down and they put in a lot of work to build it up, then the value of the business and the stock should be taken into consideration.  All these things should be included as &ldquo;chattels&rdquo;.  I would like that to be considered.</P>
    <P>Where one of the partners wants to make a will they should be able to leave their share of the property which is in joint ownership &mdash; which now means that the other spouse takes all &mdash; to a daughter or son or divide it among the family.  In that case they should be entitled to leave it to their family.  I do not see that in the Bill but I would like it to be considered.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome this legislation. <Col N="1552" /> As a woman I also welcome it as it gives each spouse equal rights of ownership in the matrimonial home.  It is part of the preparation for the divorce referendum which we hope to have in the autumn of next year.  This will help to allay the fears of many women that they could be thrown out of their home had the last referendum on divorce been passed.</P>
      <P>In regard to women's issues we have made slow progress.  This is a milestone. After the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, many women believed they had an equal share in the family home and were shocked to realise that this was not the case.  As a member of the Commission on the Status of Women this was one of the first recommendations we made &mdash;&ldquo;legislation should be introduced immediately giving each spouse equal rights of automatic beneficial ownership in the family home and household chattels&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I congratulate and thank the Minister for bringing forward this legislation.  I understand why the legislation took so long to introduce; it is a minefield.  Reading the Bill as first published and, having been passed by the Dáil, the amended version, I felt that one would have to be a High Court judge to fully understand its provisions.  Having said that, this legislation is long overdue and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>When the Commission on the Status of Women made this recommendation it believed that as a matter of priority the Government should recognise what Article 41.2 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>... by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The women of this country should feel let down by the Constitution.  We are mentioned in the Constitution in two areas; the one I have just mentioned and the pro-life amendment where the woman was given an equal right to life with the child.  They are the only two areas where women are specifically mentioned in the Constitution which has been an insult to women.  It is more relevant <Col N="1553" /> to the role of women in the 1930s than the 1990s.  The role of women has progressed since then but the Constitution still reflects the role women played in the 1930s.  I look forward to the day we can have a constitution of which the women of Ireland can feel proud and which gives them a role other than housewives and will recognise the full part women play in our society.  We are making progress but it is slow and the introduction of this Bill is a small step on that road.</P>
    <P>One other recommendation from the commission was to introduce the concept of community of property. That would extend joint ownership of the family home to all property within marriage. When we discussed the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, many male Members were appalled by this suggestion.  This shows that although we have progressed considerably since the 1930s, many people still believe there is a certain place for women and that their rights, including property rights, should be restricted. These people probably regret changes in regard to the rights of women.</P>
    <P>I found the Bill difficult to read and understand, I would probably need to be a High Court judge to fully comprehend it.  Even practitioners in the field are finding it difficult to understand fully the implications of the legislation.  I hope it will not lead to an increased volume of litigation and that it will not be a minefield for lawyers.  I hope also women will not have to go through an enormous number of procedures before getting the rights the Minister intends to confer on them by this Bill.</P>
    <P>This legislation is part of the preparation for the divorce referendum but there are other provisions the Minister should put in place before then.  He is committed to doing this.  The great problem for women is that many of them are financially dependent on men.  This governs their whole outlook on life and restricts their options.  Women battered by their husbands and many others remain in unhappy marriages because they feel if they try to leave they will be <Col N="1554" /> impoverished.  Therefore, it is important that women can choose and make decisions about their lives free from financial dependency.  There is much to do in that area but the Bill is a small step.</P>
    <P>People do not realise how afraid women are of being impoverished.  When cases of women being abused, beaten and battered by their husbands come to court, some people say it was the women's fault and ask why they stayed with their husbands. Up to now, many women had no choice, no one on whom they could rely. They cannot walk out of the family home because they are afraid if they do they will have no redress and no means of supporting themselves and their children. There are many women in that situation and it is difficult for those not affected to understand why they remain, it is from fear.  If we want women to participate at every level in society and the choice to do what they want to do, we have to give them financial independence.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in the Bill about which I am concerned and which I will query on Committee Stage.  However, I welcome the Bill most generously and I commend the Minister.  Although we have been critical about the length of time it has taken him to produce it, when we see its complexity we can understand why it has taken so long.</P>

      <P>Like all Members who have contributed so far I welcome the Minister to the House and applaud his initiative in bringing forward this significant legislation.  As a member of a species that appears to be endangered in that we are deluged by the growing tide of feminist opinion as exemplified most admirably by Senator Honan, Senator Henry and other female Members of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no fear of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I immediately nail my colours to the mast by applauding the comments they made in defence of women.  The Minister, in his usual articulate manner, outlined the background to the status of women.  It seems incredible <Col N="1555" /> that we in this male dominated society should have tolerated this for so long. Senator Honan and others might say the position has not improved much but there has been progress.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the background to the legislation and one can only reflect on the conditions under which women lived.  It seems incredible that the contribution by the wife, whether directly through financial means or by unpaid work looking after the home and bringing up children, has not been legally acknowledged until now.  I agree with Senator Honan, we may never know the true story of many marriages in which women have had to bear the most awful physical, emotional and psychological humiliations, mainly because, as Senator Gallagher said, they do not have power or money.  When that day dawns I as a mere male will applaud that equity.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also addressing the existence of marriage as an institution in determining shared ownership.  I welcome that interpretation.  The thrust of this legislation enhances rather than diminishes the institution of marriage.  With so many attacks on family values and some media commentators calling marriage outmoded or wishing it to be, the philosophy behind this Bill means the Minister and the Government firmly support it as an institution.</P>
      <P>The provision in the Bill for joint ownership of household chattels reminds me of that section of our common law, admirably outlined by Senator Gallagher, which referred to women as chattels. Will women now be able to get their own back and include men as part of the household chattels in any apportionment of articles in a separation judgment? Congratulations will be in order if they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ownership will be permanent.  If a marriage breakdown is followed by a refusal by either party to leave the family home or dispose of it, will the courts enforce disposal?  It may happen that one partner wishes to cohabit with a third party and remain in the family home after a judicial separation under our existing <Col N="1556" /> laws.  My question is as much based on ignorance of the family courts and the enforcement orders that can be applied as on a wish to get clarity.</P>
    <P>Section 4, as the Minister said, is the heart of the Bill and one anticipates that section will receive most comment on Committee Stage.  He referred to unscrupulous individuals who may wish to avoid the provisions of the Bill by conveying their interests in family homes to companies prior to the Bill taking effect.  I welcome the closure of this loophole by the Minister but it does involve another aspect of the connection between house ownership and business.</P>
    <P>Last week in the United Kingdom a housewife brought a case against a bank which sought to repossess the family home following a debt default by her husband's company.  The house was jointly owned but, two years ago, the lady's husband needed to raise capital to ease his company's financial worries.  He briefly discussed the matter with his wife and then drove her to the bank where she duly signed the documents.  The business failed and the bank foreclosed.  The wife won her case because the bank failed to explain to the lady the legal implications of her signature.</P>
    <P>The woman was understandably relieved when the case went in her favour.  Significantly, however, she was quoted in the media as saying she had little knowledge of her husband's business, she trusted her husband and was unaware she could, and almost did, lose the family home, the roof over her head. While I do not suggest that banks in this country, faced with a similar situation, would wilfully pursue a person ignorant of the consequences of signing such a document, they would, however, be legally entitled to do so.  I wonder if the Minister would consider it his duty or if he has a legislative role in protecting the spouse where they may, willingly but unknowingly, sign over their rights to the family home in such circumstances.  I appreciate that a Minister or Government in framing legislation cannot legislate for human foibles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> It was unique but when one reads between the lines it seems a very recognisable situation not confined to marriages in the UK.  How many women in loving relationships in this country know little or care less about their husband's business interests or are perhaps prevented from knowing about them?  I know I am walking a thin line when I suggest that perhaps women have an emotional lightness of touch which males sometimes fail to have.  That emotional attachment to a marriage may lead them to a situation where they are very trusting of their husbands even, as Senator Honan correctly pointed out, where they are being battered or in a difficult marriage.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan asked why women stay in such marriages.  That is a question for psychologists and I do not intend to address it here.  I am sure the Minister, like myself or any Member of this House, would not be an expert on the whys and wherefores of relationships.  However, it poses a problem in that, because of the trusting nature of women in so many marriages, even where love has disappeared, an unscrupulous husband, may for his own ends prevail on the spouse to sign over her rights.  She would do so willingly and then find herself literally without a roof over her head.  That is the main reason I raise the issue and because of the curious nature of the story in the context of this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister has a point of view on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher correctly said &mdash; I made this point earlier but it needs to be repeated &mdash; that until women gain the same rights to the reins of power and money they will always be at a disadvantage. Again this is not something for which a Government can legislate but at the same time a Government and a Minister can create the climate and environment in which women can be encouraged to have more self-esteem.  The acquisition of legal rights, as enshrined in this legislation and others, within the family home and the matrimonial relationship, will enhance their self-esteem and give them a confidence that perhaps has been missing because they have not had the full protection of the <Col N="1558" /> law.  Consequently, in a short time they may gain access to power and money. We are living in a male dominated society where women are not being given their full and just role in a wide range of activities. I know that the Minister in his brief, which is unique in that he is the first to be given the specific brief on equality, is already making great strides in addressing equality, at least in the State sector. I am sure that by the time his term of office ends he will have created a climate where women will not be excluded and where there will be a gender balance as of right rather than by inclination.</P>
    <P>Running underneath this debate is the question of a divorce referendum.  The Minister stated that he is attempting to put in place legislation which will answer as many questions as have been posed over the last number of years in relation to whether people should opt for legal divorce.  I know that the 1986 referendum centred more on legislative issues, such as those being addressed by the Minister today, rather than moral issues.  This may seem surprising to outside observers who look on us as being a church or religious ridden State.  Coming from a rural environment, the reality as far as I am concerned was that the issues the electorate addressed in making up their minds on how they should vote were mainly issues of this nature rather than moral or religious issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Underlining this debate is the question of the impending divorce referendum.  Therefore, I ask the Minister when he will address the ridiculous anomaly where the Catholic Church grants marriage annulments yet the State will prefer charges of bigamy in relation to either person of the annulled marriage if they decide to remarry in a church.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was reminded recently of a case where a member of the Garda Síochána found himself in such a predicament.  It seems that the marriage was deemed in the eyes of the Catholic Church &mdash; I am narrowing my focus here to the canon <Col N="1559" /> law of the Catholic Church &mdash; not to have taken place.  The priest to whom the couple went initially recognised that fact and recommended annulment.  It went through the normal processes; the marriage was effectively dead and they both wished to remarry.  That is how the case came before the priest who asked the garda if he was aware that, as an employee of the State and under current law, if he was to proceed with what the State perceived to be a bigamous marriage he could be dismissed from his job. Sadly, the garda in question, even though he was made aware of this possible consequence, did not address it.  The marriage was annulled by the Church and, therefore, in its eyes it did not exist.  The couple were free to remarry which they subsequently did.  The Garda authorities were made aware of the situation and I believe the garda in question was dismissed from his position.  The Minister perhaps is more aware than anybody of this anomaly.  With the greatest respect, I suggest that this issue should be addressed separately, sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Overall I welcome this Bill.  Not only does its philosophy, as the Minister pointed out in the final paragraphs of his statement to the House, testify to the value of marriage in our society and confirm it as an institution where partnership and sharing should predominate, it also reflects the personal philosophy of the Minister.  In that respect I know it is but one aspect of his continuing progressive role as a Minister in the area of equality and law reform to ensure that more equity is brought into not only matrimonial matters but in other areas.  I wish him well in his endeavours.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  Over the past 20 years there have been major changes in property law, commencing with the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  At that time the then Minister for Justice, Paddy Cooney, introduced legislation which was revolutionary in regard to property law. Today's Bill is commendable and is a <Col N="1560" /> further positive step to bringing about equality and equity in the legal system.</P>
      <P>As a former member of the committee on marital breakdown, which sat between 1983-85, I particularly welcome this Bill.  In our deliberations on that committee, we examined many aspects that needed change and made definite recommendations in a variety of areas, some of which have been introduced and others which remain outstanding.  I recall many heated debates there, with regard to property, concerning what may happen to traditional properties owned by families in the event of a marriage breakdown or of difficulties arising.  I recall the comments of the European Commissioner, Mr. Flynn, who made strong and vehement contributions during the course of that debate concerning traditional family farms and businesses. I am interested to see the specific family farmhouse and the immediate garden and property around the farmhouse, as distinguished from the farm itself, singularly designated in this Bill. Did Commissioner Flynn have an input to that section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It does bring back memories, Minister, as to where it came from.  I also wonder why, in that section, there was not further elaboration on the traditional family business and a provision in this Bill specifically dealing with that type of business, for example, what happens if the family live over the business and the business is on the street?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Is it?  I did not notice that in my perusal of the Bill. I must have skimmed the surface.  The Commissioner has strong views on that matter and we had heated debates in the committee.  Indeed some distinguished lawyers, one of whom has become even more distinguished since &mdash; the President, Mrs. Robinson &mdash; took a different side in the debate at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> This legislation is welcome because it is central to the position of women in society.  Women, traditionally, have had a second class standard of living and rating in the legal system over the years, especially with regard to the ownership of property and, for that reason, I am pleased that the Minister has seen fit to bring this legislation before us.  I am aware that in doing so, he is also clarifying the property issue because, with the possibility of a divorce referendum, this could become a huge matter for debate in the course of such a referendum, as it did in the last one.  It would be wise to have any matters and issues of that nature which could cause huge concern &mdash; in the business property or the family home &mdash; to be legally clarified before the referendum.</P>
    <P>The Bill is highly detailed and specifically outlines the manner in which the traditional matrimonial home will now be equally owned by both spouses.  I am especially interested in the change from legal to equitable ownership introduced in this Bill and I welcome that aspect.  I am curious about one section &mdash; maybe the Minister will clarify it.  It states:</P>
    <P>A spouse or a person intending to get married who would otherwise benefit from joint ownership may exclude the application of the Act (sections 7 and 10(4)(a)).</P>
    <P>Could a person wishing to get married be cajoled or forced into excluding themselves from the terms of this Bill prior to marriage?  I know that it would be subject to court and litigation but what would the final outcome be if this occurred?  One may say that it is highly unlikely but it is important to address every eventuality. A girl engaged to be married could, for some reason, be manipulated or cajoled into specifically excluding herself from the terms of this Bill where it concerns the family home.  What will occur in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>Many matters were dealt with by the Marriage Breakdown Committee, one of which concerned family courts and while this Bill may reduce the instances of court cases over family property, its contents <Col N="1562" /> will, undoubtedly, be subject to litigation in the courts at some stage in the future. There are ten year old recommendations from this committee concerning family courts which need to be addressed.  The close examination of the physical conditions of family courts and the manner in which matrimonial cases are heard is long overdue.  The level of formality and antiquated legal nonsense that occurs in these courts is ridiculous and the accommodation, privacy and surroundings are unacceptable.  I ask the Minister to examine that with a view towards urgently providing funding to change these physical conditions.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of judges in family cases.  There must be a close examination of the way they make their decisions on family matters.  We are all aware of the huge discrepancies in various judgments and cases and one can say that this happens only because of the variance of the contents of the case.  That is true but there are also cases where there are extraordinary variations in judgment, despite huge similarities in the cases.  We must realise that many judges were legally trained before any of this legislation or the major debates on social reform had taken place.  There is a need to provide them with proper training and regular re-education to give them a sense of common direction as to how they should address cases and the types of decisions at which they should arrive. There should be a certain similarity in their approach.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that is not the case at the moment.  One can have harsh and lenient judges addressing these matters, so it is important that those involved in these cases have a certain human understanding and expertise and come from practices where family law is dealt with on a regular basis.  Unfortunately, many of them do not come from such a background. I am not castigating them for that; they are doing the best they can within what is available to them and what they know, but the onus is on the Government to ensure that the expertise they lack is made up by providing some type of in-house training in that area.  In recent <Col N="1563" /> years the number of family cases dealt with in the local Circuit Court has doubled and in some case trebled; they cannot be dealt with in one Circuit Court sitting and must be held over.  Additional family judges must be appointed and provided with specific training.  The condition of the courts in which these cases are heard must be addressed and I ask the Minister to ensure that this issue is dealt with.  Although inappropriate at this stage, I would like to raise a number of other issues which will be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Although a number of centres were set up, mediation services were provided on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Unfortunately, the type of professional mediation service required is not extensive throughout the country.  It is important that such centres are set up.  Under the Judicial Separation Bill, it was agreed that a couple could not legally separate unless they engaged in mediation.  Although it is a legal obligation, mediation services are unavailable. This issue needs to be addressed. Unless professional people are engaged to mediate in these traumatic cases, those involved may not reach the best conclusion regarding important decisions for themselves and their children.  Perhaps the Minister will address this matter as soon as he has an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not long in his position and I commend him for taking the initiative and having the Bill before this House. He is well intentioned and I urge him to continue this good work.  However, there are still a number of outstanding recommendations in the marriage breakdown report which have not been implemented and work has not commenced in this regard.  Perhaps the Minister will give priority to certain areas and decide on a course of action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome this Bill because it gives women rights which they do not have and any advance in this regard must be applauded.  The Bill confers the right to co-ownership of the family home. Until now co-ownership could be proven <Col N="1564" /> if a woman made a financial contribution to the purchase of the house, but this is difficult to establish.  Many marriages do not break down in the first three or four years, sometimes a marriage lasts for 20 years.  Solicitors' records often disappear and few people keep record of transactions, bank cheques, etc., for 20 years. I am aware of cases where people have contributed to the purchase of the matrimonial home, through gifts from parents or by direct contribution, but it was impossible to prove this in court.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives women a right to the matrimonial home on marriage, this is important because it recognises the work a woman puts into a home which cannot be measured in monetary terms.  The effort of keeping a home goes beyond providing money for its upkeep.  If a woman chooses to retire from the work-force to spend time looking after her children or relations and to care for her home, she should not be denied a right to that house because she did not go out to work.  I hope this is the first of many improvements which will recognise the worth of a woman living and working in her home.  As the Minister said, we often pay lip service to this.  We tend to say how important it is for a woman to stay at home and look after her children, but we do not place any monetary value on this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this materialistic age, one's status in society is measured by the amount of money one earns.  The woman who remains at home has a low status.  I discovered this when I became a full-time mother for a short period.  I became invisible and I was often left out of conversations. People believed I had nothing to contribute because I was a mere housewife. Until recently this attitude was often reflected on radio programmes.  It was normal for an interviewer to ask a woman what her husband did to establish what type of question to ask her, regardless of the work she did in the home.  As a full-time mother, I read newspapers and listened to the radio and became more up-to-date on current affairs than many of my working sisters or friends who blithely snubbed me in conversations. <Col N="1565" /> I knew more about what was going on in the world than they did tucked away in their offices.  I welcome the recognition of a woman's worth by giving her a right in the matrimonial home.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in relation to household chattels, an old fashioned word which, I presume, means household goods.  Often jibes are made in regard to how one divides the double bed, but many women save money from the children's allowance, gifts from relatives or money earned from part-time jobs to buy a deep freeze, a chest of drawers or something for the house.  In many instances the house is equipped by the woman using her skills as a homemaker.  It is proper she has a right to the goods in the house as well as the four walls.  Many women devote time to the maintenance of the interior and exterior of the house by sewing curtains, painting walls and investing in goods for the house.  They turn four walls into a home and this fact often goes unrecognised.  Shortly after I was elected a county councillor, a woman came to me in great distress.  She had lived in the family home for 30 years, she had scrimped and saved to maintain it, she and her husband bought it in a poor state and she personally improved it bit by bit.  She often had to go without so that her husband could entertain clients in the house.  She redecorated the house so that he could influence his clients and he built up a successful business.  After 30 years of this careful management of her home, her husband no longer wanted to live with her and, he wanted to sell the house.  I told her he had no right to sell that house without her permission, but somehow she had been persuaded that his business would go down the drain unless she gave her consent and she found herself with an eviction notice.  The house they put up for sale was infinitely more valuable than the house they had originally bought, simply because she had put so much loving care into it.  If this law had been there two or three years ago, she would be in a better and more protected state than she is at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn that judges need to get coaching on family law.  Because so many family law cases are heard <i>in camera</i>, little public notice is given to some of the strange decisions that can come out of family courts.  Very diverse views can be seen and judgments made in different cases.  Some people have been known to try and have their cases moved to a particular court because a specific judge is known to favour the man or woman.  It is not right or just that there should be a bias towards one party in our courts.</P>
    <P>The opt-out clause can be fraught with danger because, at the time of marriage or pre-marriage, romance is in the air and the idea of mistrusting one's future partner is not uppermost in one's mind. If a bride to be is asked to sign a prenuptial agreement which contains the opt-out clause, many women will fall into the trap of signing that opt-out clause.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea that women should be encouraged to have good legal advice. We should treat marriage more seriously. Instead of being immersed in a cloud of romantic sentimentality, all couples should be made take a business course to realise that what they are entering into is a business arrangement.  No one would set up in business with a partner without first reading all the details and examining all the pitfalls of such a merger.  The same should be true of marriages.  It should almost be a prerequisite of marriage that people have studied the financial and legal implications of marriage and it should not be left simply to trust and goodwill.  It might knock some of the gloss off the marriage if people were to sit down and talk pounds, shillings and pence; nevertheless it could cut out a great deal of heartache later if all the details were gone into first.</P>
    <P>I welcome the mention in this Bill of mobile homes.  Very often it is assumed that when one talks about property one is talking about people living in Dublin 4 or the leafy suburbs of our larger towns and villages, but a number of couples, who have no money of their own, and the local authority housing lists are long, live in mobile homes.  We must also <Col N="1567" /> remember, although it is not very common in the travelling community for marriages to break up, that they will be as influenced by that trend in Irish society today as the settled community.  Since a young travelling couple are often given a car and a caravan or mobile home as a dowry, it is important that the rights of travelling women, or of women who have not got a permanent home, are also protected.</P>
    <P>I am also delighted that recognition is given here to the situation where a farming couple split up.  There is recognition that gardens around the house are part of the house, because in a rural area it could lead to a great deal of friction if, the minute a woman steps outside her backdoor, she is trespassing.  It is important that sufficient land is left around the family home to allow her children to play, for the woman to hang out her washing, to store fuel, etc.  I presume that the word &ldquo;easements&rdquo; would apply, to the right to a water supply and the right to a septic tank.  It is also very important that such rights are written into this Bill.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have said, this is the prelude to more legislation which will eventually lead to the introduction of divorce legislation in this country.  We need that legislation badly.  I still have memories of the bitter debate that followed the last divorce referendum and I hope such bitterness will not become a factor in the next referendum and, that it will be recognised that couples in Ireland, like couples in any other country in western Europe, will have the same difficulties within marriage.  I believe we should legislate for that.  There is no point closing our eyes to the facts.  I hope all the obstacles encountered during the last referendum about property and rights will be sorted out before the new legislation is introduced.  While I do not favour &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; style divorce proceedings common in some parts of the United States, the present procedure &mdash; where people have to go to a number of court sittings before they get a judicial separation &mdash; could be simplified.  If a marriage has broken down it is not necessary <Col N="1568" /> to add to the trauma and heartache by spreading the proceedings over three or four years, as often happens.  Speedier and more humane legislation should be adopted.</P>
    <P>When this Bill becomes law, the Minister's press office should run articles in our leading daily and weekly newspapers to signal to women the importance of this Bill and to emphasise the importance of taking independent legal advice when dealing with any kind of property transfer. It is vitally important to give a simple explanation.  As others said, this is not an easy Bill to read or understand and I have the feeling I have got some bits of it wrong.  I am not a lawyer, and I imagine that other lay people probably have the same difficulty.  Therefore, a layman's guide to what this Bill entails should be made widely available so that everybody knows about the benefits it has to offer to women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement in the Minister's speech goes to the essence of the question.  He said that the Bill seeks to establish joint ownership of the matrimonial home as the normal form of ownership.</P>
      <P>In a civilised society that is exactly as things should be.  It is perhaps a sad reflection that very complex legislation has to be introduced to achieve what seems to be not just the norm but the civilised way of doing things.  I compliment the Minister because this has been a difficult Bill to draw up due to its complex nature.  I listened with great interest to the Minister's speech today and many of the sentiments he touched on reflect my own views.  They are the views of anybody who has a compassionate view of the type of society in which we should live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is correct when he says there has been a revolution in our society and in the way we look at marriage.  It is not too many years since there was a court action involving a prominent citizen of this State whose wife was described as a &ldquo;chattel&rdquo;.  In a civilised society that is extraordinarily archaic, medieval and primitive language to describe any partner, <Col N="1569" /> let alone a partner in marriage. Regrettably, this Bill is now being discussed in the context of a divorce referendum. I say &ldquo;regrettably&rdquo; because this Bill stands on its own merits and is something we should implement irrespective of any other agenda item.  The comprehensive nature of the Bill has been well dealt with.</P>
    <P>There are a number of specific points that I would like to touch on.  One point, mentioned by the Minister and Senator Kelly, is about the ignorance that exists about even the current state of law.  For example, the Minister made the point it is not often recognised that, under existing legislation, the non-owning spouse has a right of veto in relation to the sale of the matrimonial home.  This legislation is creating equality for both partners in marriage although I do not think we even recognise the extent of equality in existing law.  Because this is complex legislation it will be important to communicate the nature of the change.</P>
    <P>I remember during the last referendum debate on this area, there was much wringing of hands and discussion of the property rights issue as if property rights was the supreme issue in the debate.  This Bill will get that element of the debate off the agenda though I am not sure that applies to other emotive issues.  Irrespective of what we will do next year on the issue of divorce, it is of primary importance that the change introduced in this law should be well and comprehensively understood by everybody.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly mentioned the powerlessness of women.  The reality is that in spite of all the changes in society, women's role in the home has not been recognised by the State although this Bill does go some way towards that.  The State has been deficient in explaining to the woman who chooses to make her career in the home as the nurturer and homemaker, that she too has rights.</P>
    <P>I remember an horrific case in my own constituency a few short years ago where a woman was literally tricked into signing papers to sell off her family home.  Within 18 months that unfortunate woman was found dead in a flat, she had been dead <Col N="1570" /> for some time.  She was not aware of her rights.  She had equal rights with her partner and could have vetoed the sale of that home.  Somehow or other we as a society failed her.  I compliment the Minister for putting this aspect of marital relationships beyond question.  I hope that the changes introduced here will be well explained throughout society.  Every public representative has had experience of this type of tragedy.  I felt like applauding the Minister when he said that women who choose to take on the nurturing role, which hitherto was expected of them, are now perceived as opting for a career which is every bit as worthwhile as those careers which attract monetary remuneration.</P>
    <P>How right the Minister is.  It is extraordinary that for generations the big enemy of women was male chauvinism. I am not sure that political correctness and some of the more extreme elements of the feminist movement would not now be regarded as the people downgrading the value of women in the home.  It is good that the State recognises in this legislation that women who build the home are every bit as involved in building up the family's assets as the husband who happens to put in the hours of nine to five somewhere else.  I am pleased that the Minister specifically took that point on board in his speech.</P>
    <P>I have a query about one or two things. Senator Kelly welcomed, as I do, the fact that the Minister dealt with land contiguous to a family home where it is on a farm, as well as the rights of way issues that arise from it.  I wonder how we take it that farm property is separate.  Why is so much value put on land here?  Maybe I should address this question to members of my own party as well as to the Minister.  We should be thinking of co-ownership of all assets because a marriage is a partnership.  I reckon that over the years I have been married to a long suffering and brave Mayo woman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I call on Senator Calnan to move the motion.  He has 15 minutes, the Minister has 15 minutes and other Senators have ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the proposed developments in the Marine Sector as outlined in the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> and, in particular, welcomes the commitment of the Government to increased employment and greater export earnings through the further development of sea fisheries, inland fisheries and commercial ports; and further commends the Government for its commitment to coastal protection and marine research programmes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  My constituency stretches from Dursey Island at the southern tip of Ireland to Kinsale, by road a distance of 120 miles.  If one were to travel in and out of all the inlets one would travel several hundreds of miles of coastline.  I am familiar with the many harbours, inlets, coves and islands in south-west Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are an island country.  Unfortunately, we sometimes act as if we are a land locked country because, over the years, we have not developed our fishing resources to the full.  The National Development Plan proposes an investment of £270 million in the marine sector. This is very welcome and I hope it will <Col N="1572" /> be used to the full in developing employment in our commercial ports in the remote and developed parts of our country. Investment in commercial ports will amount to £100 million.  Being an island country we have to develop our ports which connect us to Europe, particularly to Britain and France.  We expect that a large amount of money will be spent in Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Waterford, Cork, Rosslare and the Shannon estuary.</P>
    <P>However, we must not forget there are many smaller ports where there is a great deal of activity related to aquaculture and sea activities.  Very often these ports have inadequate facilities.  I refer in particular to Bantry, Kinsale and Baltimore.  A new pier was built at Schull but is not being fully used.  Courtmacsherry is a fine fishing and tourist port.  There is a new and very welcome development at Union Hall.  I am very familiar with developments in this part of the south-west.</P>
    <P>Bantry and Baltimore have harbour boards.  Baltimore has had such a board for many years.  I was a member of this board for a number of years as a representative of Cork County Council.  It was starved of money.  We met once a month.  We had very little money &mdash; only pounds and pence &mdash; to develop this fine natural harbour.  The Bantry harbour board is also very short of funds.  No developments have taken in either of these two places.</P>
    <P>I welcome the transfer of ports, which are willing to be taken over, to local authorities which are willing to take them over.  The Departments of the Marine and the Environment were probably jointly responsible for this transfer which is welcome provided money is invested in them.  I am glad regional ports will be developed and I hope smaller ports will benefit prominently in terms of cash and investment from the development of commercial ports.  There cannot be proper development of ports without proper roads, lighting and other such facilities.  Consequently, great co-operation between the Departments of the Environment and the Marine is needed in carrying out such development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> Most of the money, a sum of £137 million, will be spent on fisheries aquaculture. We have not taken advantage of being surrounded by a sea with plenty of fish.  We are worried because other nations are fishing in these waters.  It is up to us to develop our resources properly. Since we are restricted in many cases by sea fishing quotas there is a great need for the development of aquaculture such as shell fishing.  Many of the islands off our south-west coast, as well as areas on the mainland, have developed very lucrative shell fishing industries, such as the mussel industry, which provide plenty of employment.  Unfortunately, much of this development has been very haphazard and only occured by chance.  It is up to us to invest money in such development in a planned fashion.  We have great resources which can be developed to provide employment which is very badly needed in areas &mdash; again I will be parochial &mdash; such as south-west Cork where large industrial development does not exist.  We have to develop alternatives and use the money provided by Europe for the National Development Plan to invest in fishing and aquaculture development.</P>
    <P>Since Castletownbere is a designated fishing port, money will be provided for its development.  This is badly needed there.  There is a 22 mile stretch of road from the the N71 to Castletownbere. About ten miles of this is totally unsuitable for the huge trucks which use it to transport fish and fish products from Castletownbere.  Money will have to be spent on this road.</P>
    <P>On one of the islands off our south-west coast there are valuable catches of brown crabs, swimming crabs, lobsters, shrimps, mussels and oysters.  The people of this island need money to properly develop aquaculture there.  We need marine research programmes and I am glad the motion refers to them.</P>
    <P>I must mention the work done by Matt Murphy on Sherkin Island.  Its marine station is a credit to Matt and his family and is doing tremendous work for fishing. Matt is not amply rewarded for this.  He is always available to give highly professional <Col N="1574" /> advice and the facilities are second to none.  He made such developments in the research field that his advice and the advice from his marine station are sought worldwide.  Recently, he was consulted in relation to fishing problems in Chile.  If we can build around what Matt developed on Sherkin Island, we will do much for the fishing industry of the south west, indeed for the country. Matt also has problems with insurance. He has a fine research station which is ideal for school tours and tourist activities but he cannot use it because the cost of the necessary insurance is prohibitive. Iron and steel girders and cement blocks had to be brought from the mainland at great cost to build this fine station, which has weathered mighty Atlantic storms.</P>
    <P>I am glad that £19 million will be spent on tourism angling.  We must think of the value which our many lakes, rivers and sea areas can be to our economy.  Many local organisations &mdash; and I know of one near my home &mdash; have taken on the job of restocking a lake.  They are building a little roadway into the lake, putting a pier there and developing it properly. Tremendous work is being done on Gurranes Lake, which is four or five miles from my house.  People are coming great distances to fish there.  A great job is being done on the restocking and I hope this £19 million will help these people to develop our inland lakes, particularly in the more remote and disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>There is also a unique feature in my area &mdash; Lough Ine near Skibbereen which is a tidal lake.  The water comes in at high tide and drains when the tide goes down. However, there is a rock lip which holds back water and this unusual physical feature has resulted in the development of unique flora and fauna at the bottom of this lake, which is of great interest to botanists and people interested in marine life.  Features such as this attract tourists and develop the tourist facilities in the areas.</P>
    <P>I am glad also that £5.5 million is designated to preserve economic and public infrastructure and protect important local communities.  In this context, I want <Col N="1575" /> to speak about sea erosion.  Recently, we had a problem on the south west coast where much of Tragumna Strand and the adjoining road was torn up by an unusual storm.  The council repaired that but further along the coast, Warren Strand in Rosscarbery &mdash; pieces of which are being eroded every year &mdash; Ownahincha, Castlefreke and Garrettstown are suffering as a result of sea erosion.</P>
    <P>Installing a type of wire mesh bag with rocks &mdash; I do not know the technical term &mdash; helps to hold the sand in these fine strands.  Otherwise, they would be washed away.  There is a hotel, a county council bridge and a sewage treatment plant behind the stand at Ownahincha which, if proper protection is not provided, could be washed away due to the force of the sea.  We often do not see the effect of the sea until there is a violent winter storm.  With regard to safe seas, I visited Haulbowline recently and I was glad to see the sophisticated instrumentation which they have there for checking our seas.  Unfortunately, they lack ships.  We should have more help from EC and other boats to protect our waters.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to speak about islands. There are about seven islands off the south west coast.  Six of them are nonGaeltacht islands and feel that they are being left out of everything.  They are very remote, can encounter great difficulties in winter and have high transport costs.  Help is needed.  An island committee has been set up by Cork County Council on which there are representatives of each island.  Good work is being done by them but no work can be done without money.  Consequently, we will expect the Department of the Marine to provide money for the development of piers, lights and roads on these islands to give the islanders proper living standards. If we do not, these islands will soon reach a population level which would make it unfeasible to inhabit them.  I refer in particular to Dursey Island.  I am glad the Minister is here and that money will be available to develop our marine resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I would like to formally second the motion which welcomes the proposed developments in the marine sector as outlined in the National Development Plan.  The plan provides for a basic investment programme of £270 million in the marine sector.  I welcome the investment of £100 million in the development of commercial ports.  I am pleased that the Shannon Estuary is at last recognised as a strategic corridor and commercial port.  For too long we concentrated our efforts on the ports of the east coast, as if we had no place apart from England to send our goods.  The realisation now is that we need to export from the west coast and have access to the shipping lanes to the west of our country.</P>
      <P>Foynes is one of the ports on the Shannon Estuary and is worthy of investment by the Minister.  The basic infrastructure is there.  Granted, there is need for great improvements to dredge the harbour to make it capable of taking ships of deeper berth.  Work also needs to be done on the roads leading into the port.  Nevertheless, the roads are there, although they need to be improved, and there is a valuable rail link to the port.  It should and could become the principal port of the mid west.  At the same time, its geographical location means that any development of the port will not hinder or impede the development of the Shannon Estuary as a tourist area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the emphasis in this plan on tourism angling.  There has been an increase in funding in this sector from £1 million in the last round of Structural Funds to £19 million in this round.  It is worth bearing in mind &mdash; and perhaps Senator Burke will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; it has been reckoned that in Mayo a salmon caught off the coast might be worth in the region of £10.  The same salmon, if caught inland, can net the local economy in the region of £300 to £400 when one takes into the account that the angler, especially if coming from abroad, will spend money on bed and breakfast, restaurants and entertainment in the area.  It is also recognised that some of <Col N="1577" /> the best inland fishing is in areas where there would not otherwise be a great deal of tourist activity.  For example, tourists often bypass west Limerick and the salmon rivers on their way from the Cliffs of Moher to the lakes of Killarney. Senator Rory Kiely will agree with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>One could bypass Waterville because there are no sea trout in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Angling should be encouraged because it increases revenue. Angling and inland fisheries are often in places of little scenic value.  People do not come to Ireland for the sun and, therefore, we should encourage them to pursue leisure activities.  A German who lives in the Ruhr valley would love an opportunity to fish in our peaceful waters and enjoy a night's drinking.</P>
      <P>Money injected into tourism and angling will benefit many communities. However, investment in our waters must be backed up by revenue from our local authorities to improve access to these rivers and to help the local farming community maintain the purity of the waters. It is sad that many rivers are badly polluted at times of low water, but I am glad the number of fish kills has decreased. Perhaps this is due to improved farming methods, an awareness by the farming community of the importance of our rivers and lakes and added rainfall in the past few years, which has made it easier for fish to live in the rivers.  Rain can sometimes be a blessing in disguise.</P>
      <P>I welcome the emphasis in the National Development Plan on research and development as, without it, we would be left behind.  In Brittany there is fishing activity at every inlet and shoreline.  It is difficult to get fresh fish around our coasts.  Recently, for example, I was on holiday in County Wexford and it was difficult to buy fresh fish.  I spoke to a local fisherman and he said that the fish is bought as soon as it is caught.  It is often exported to Spain in lorries and containers.  The fish is placed in ice and no processing is done before it is exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot catch more than our quota <Col N="1578" /> of certain varieties of fish.  I am glad there are some varieties whose cultivation can be improved.  I hope we will be able to export this product to Europe as this would increase the income of many people who live on the periphery of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, to the House.  I am delighted there is good news in the National Development Plan for marine areas because there is little in it for the west.  It is interesting that this motion was tabled by the Labour Party when the Dáil is due to discuss a confidence motion with regard to the plan.  There is disagreement between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance.  The Tánaiste told this House we would get £8 billion over the period of the plan, even when questioned by several Members.  Now we will get £7.2 billion.  I hope he does not leave the country again because each time he does we lose further moneys.  It is interesting that we are discussing this motion.  Perhaps we should discuss a no confidence motion in the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>In the weekend newspapers one journalist said that the National Development Plan was little better than the economics of the 1930s, but at least then there was a certain dignity in the policy of self-sufficiency and the country was solvent.</P>

This speaks for itself.  We have seen £8 billion reduced to £7.2 billion. When one takes the investment by the private sector into account, the £20 billion on which the plan is based will probably be further decreased to £16 billion.</P>
      <P>The following is another quote in the newspaper in relation to the Taoiseach:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When one takes £300 million for the Department of the Marine out of the £20 billion on which this plan is based, it amounts to 1.5 per cent of the total amount in the plan.  It is an insult to an area which probably has the greatest growth potential and which is most open to creating jobs.  If we are serious about job creation the Department of the Marine, fisheries and tourism deserve much more than the £300 million earmarked in this plan.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether there will be any reduction in that figure because of the reduction in the overall sum from £8 billion to £7.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Some £5.5 million is included in this plan for coastal protection.  County Mayo has one of the largest coastlines in the country.  Mayo County Council estimated that £6 million would be required to keep our coasts properly guarded and fully protected.  We are getting £5.5 million for the whole country over the period 1994-99.  It is a very small sum when one considers that County Mayo alone needs £6 million.  This amount is clearly inadequate. We need more funds because our coast needs to be protected.</P>
      <P>Why is so much of the container traffic out of this country going via Northern Ireland when we have such ports as Dún Laoghaire, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork.  If a large percentage of our container traffic is leaving via Northern Ireland I am sure that is putting great pressure on jobs at existing ports and affects the efficiency and manner in which our ports are being run.  The Minister should examine this to see what can be done to retrieve that business and make our ports more profitable or more efficient and enable them to handle the Irish traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, we have a number of ports and the £100 million included in this plan for the upgrading of <Col N="1581" /> ports is inadequate.  In Mayo alone there are seven or eight ports, including small ones and ports that cater for traffic to the islands.  The capital allocation for our harbours needs to be increased.  The Department sanctions a certain amount of money for local authorities to upgrade ports and harbours but finding 50 per cent of the money places a great burden on a local authority.</P>
    <P>There are two deep sea ports in Mayo &mdash; Darby's Point off Achill and Ballyglass harbour.  I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of providing facilities at those ports to enable the fishing fleet to dock there and unload their produce more efficiently.  More freezing and storage facilities are needed if fishing is to be developed along the west coast.  At the moment, the port in Killybegs in County Donegal is coping with large trawlers but there are no other ports south of that which are properly developed.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach seo agus mo chomhchairdeas a ghabháil dó agus an Aire tuisc an méid atá déanta acu do Roinn na Mara agus iascairí na Éirinn.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to the House and congratulate him on his efforts in bringing about a better fishing industry than we had in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present it is proposed that in excess of £300 million will be invested in the fishing industry and the development of our fishing ports.  I welcome this development. At long last there is light at the end of the tunnel because the fishing industry <Col N="1582" /> has been starved of cash because of a lack of commitment over the years.</P>
    <P>In 1973 we started a major ports development starting with Killybegs and Castletownbere, followed by Howth. Now, after 20 years there are five major fishery ports.  This is unacceptable; the ports should have been developed faster.  Money should have been invested sooner, but at last it is being invested.</P>
    <P>I can be critical of the fishing industry because nobody in this House is more entitled to speak about fishing than I having spent the best part of my life fishing. While we are here tonight debating this motion we should remember that there are people 150 miles out at sea and instead of quoting from the paper the Senator on the opposite side should be talking about fishing.  He should have a mind of his own and state positively and critically what, if anything, is wrong with the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>In my view there certainly is something wrong with the fishing industry and the Minister, the Minister of State, the Department and probably the Government would be the first to admit that. There is not enough emphasis on the potential for job creation in the fishing industry.  There are as many square miles of sea to the west and south of Ireland and in the channel on the eastern side as there are square miles of land on this island; there is probably double that amount.  Those seas are rich in fish and we should avail of the opportunity to reap a rich harvest.  However, we did not take that opportunity over the years and I do not know where the blame lies.  If memory serves the 1964 London Convention Agreement allowed Spanish fishermen to fish into our shores for lobster. That was taking the bread from our mouths.  We were probably seeking &mdash; and I do not blame the people who attended the convention &mdash; to trade off fishing for agriculture.  I have always maintained that such a trade off took place.</P>
    <P>It is time there was proper investment, as we see today, in the fishing industry. Indeed I would like to see even more <Col N="1583" /> investment because jobs can be created around our coasts and there would be, as Senator Quinn said last week in a different context, development of the poorer parts of Ireland &mdash; places like Mayo, Kerry and west Cork &mdash; where there are lovely harbours and ports which could be developed to a proper standard.</P>
    <P>There have been great developments which I welcome.  I deplore the critics of development and those who make little of, for example, the development of the harbour in Dingle which cost £4.7 million to date.  I hope the Minister will announce further investment there in the future, because it is deserved.  Castletownbere and the other ports also deserve extra investment because they, too, have proved themselves.  In 1988 the landing of fish in Dingle was worth a little over £100,000 annually.  I was then, and still am, chairman of the harbour board in Dingle so I am familiar with the figures. The landing fees from boats were a little in excess of £6,500 that year.  The landings in Dingle at present are worth up to £5 million.  A total of 120 extra jobs have been created and it is anticipated that the landing fees will be in excess of £50,000 this year.  All this is due to development and in fairness to the former Minister, Senator Daly.  He signed the agreement and we give credit where it is due.  We will be ever grateful to him for that.</P>

      <P>There is also a marina there.  We have heard much talk from the Opposition lately about marinas and over-spending.  These marinas are a great benefit and we need several of them.  The marina in Kilrush complements the one in Dingle which complements the one in Kinsale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not listen to the knockers.  He should continue investing in developments once they have proved themselves.  The figures <Col N="1584" /> show these developments are good.  I hope the Minister will come back to the Seanad so that we can properly discuss the development of the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>There is much talk about the value of salmon fishing up river.  I advocate that we consider banning salmon fishing around our coast for a time and compensate the people who make a living from it; I would never suggest that salmon fishing be banned without proper compensation being given to the salmon fishermen.  When such a ban is imposed we would see if the figures quoted by Bord Fáilte and the Central Fisheries Board about the value of salmon fishing up river are true.  That is an option the Minister might consider.</P>
      <P>At this time I would seriously reconsider the role of BIM in the fishing industry. It certainly had a role 40 years ago when we had few boats and fewer engine driven boats.  When the Government of the day appointed Brendan Kelly as chairman of Bord Iascaigh Mhara he built a fishing fleet.  The current role of BIM must be examined.  It should be reshuffled and have a greater emphasis on job creation.  At present it is too involved in aquaculture and mariculture.  I do not support that.  I agree with Senator Calnan that there should be more emphasis on natural mussel and scallop beds and even creating new ones, as happened in Bantry Bay.  In this way you can create employment during the winter months in inland bays for the small 36 foot boats and half deckers.  They create the most employment.</P>
      <P>I welcome this plan although I do not have enough time to discuss every aspect of it.  It is good that money has been allocated for coast erosion.  About £0.5 million was recently spent by Kerry County Council to tackle coast erosion in the Maharees at Castlegregory.  That example should be followed.  Rocks taken from land instead of the gabions mentioned by Senator Calnan were used to protect the coast.  That achieved two aims: the land was cleared of rocks and the coast was protected from erosion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I will focus on one aspect of this comprehensive motion, and that is our commercial ports.  If I concentrate on this item it is not because I do not consider the entire marine sector to be very important although it was interesting to hear the concentration of earlier speakers on the fishing sector.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight the urgent need to tackle the problem of our ports without any further delay.  Part of the problem is that our ports are not yet regarded as crucial to the economy.  I believe they are.  We do not yet recognise the fact that our ports have become bottleknecks, which to a certain extent, are throttling the growth of the economy.  We recognise the importance of exporting but we forget that everything we export must go out through a sea port or an airport.  The overwhelming majority of the goods we export are transported by sea.</P>
      <P>During the last five years we have begun to improve our roads system and this has already made a great impact on the time it takes to transport our goods from source to the market and the cost of getting them there but we have still a long way to go.  I argued last week that the roads programme in the national plan should be brought to the fore so that we can benefit from it more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to ports I would like to remind the Minister of State that we are a good deal further behind, we have a lot of catching up to do.  As our roads get better it is becoming clearer that our ports are just not good enough.  I welcome <Col N="1586" /> what the national plan proposes for ports but my problem is that it is not comprehensive enough or quick enough. We had a high powered committee which reported, it must be over a year ago now, on the future of the ports.  It went to the heart of the matter which is that our ports are not run as commercial enterprises; they are not serving the needs of commercial customers; they are not open around the clock, seven days a week, and they are hampered by ludicrously out of date work practices.  In a word they are uncompetitive.</P>
    <P>The fact that so much of our national output now goes the long way around &mdash; through Larne as Senator Burke said, rather than through the southern ports &mdash; is a dramatic indication of how uncompetitive our ports have become.  Good luck to Larne and to Warrenpoint, they deserve the business.  However, going the long way around through Larne or Warrenpoint is an added cost for all our exporters who have to use that route compared to what it would cost if our ports were properly run on commercial lines.  We just cannot allow this to continue.</P>
    <P>While the national plan genuflects to the recipe put forward by the review committee last year &mdash; turning the ports into semi-State companies, improving the work practices and making them more commercially viable &mdash; I do not detect any sense of urgency or immediacy, I do not detect any awareness of how urgent this problem has become.  This is a factor not just for the companies, both Irish and foreign owned, who are trying to compete on the European and world markets, it is also at least as important for the companies we are attempting to attract here.</P>
    <P>Incoming companies which are considering Ireland as a potential site in which to set up business do not just look at how much in IDA grants they will get. One of the key things they look at is how quickly and cheaply they can get their goods from where they produce them to the market.  When they look at the Irish ports they do not get excited.  On the contrary, their interest in Ireland often <Col N="1587" /> stops right there.  When will we realise that the state of our ports is a constraint on our growth both now and even more in the future?  We have been hearing too long now about the need to do something while at the same time little has happened on the ground by way of change.</P>
    <P>My cry tonight, which I hope will not be a cry in the wilderness as I described it last week, is let us put some urgency behind the ports programme.  I have spoken solely on ports in order to concentrate the mind on that one item.  Our ports are a festering sore that is costing us jobs and it is possible to do something about them if we give them the priority.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members for welcoming me here this evening.  To bring Senator Burke up to date, Mr. Jacques Delors has indicated that the quality of the plan of which the marine section is a part will draw down at least £7.84 billion.  I do not want to go into the debate here this evening on the vote of confidence, but my function here is to outline to the House the marine section of the national plan which I am confident will not be reduced in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator it will not be reduced in any way.</P>
      <P>The <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> will benefit the marine sector to the sum of £300 million pounds.  The plan will encompass developments in sea fisheries, inland fisheries, commercial ports, coastal protection and marine research.  As Minister of State it is my view that we have never fully realised the potential of our marine sector.  We have available to us a vital natural resource which, if exploited to its full potential, can provide much needed extra employment.  The primary aim of this plan is jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apology for stating that I will allocate the moneys available under <Col N="1588" /> the plan primarily on the basis of the potential for job creation.  Furthermore, I will ensure that such jobs are both sustainable and well paid.  That is the great advantage of employment in the marine sector.  Employment is based on an existing indigenous resource which can earn large scale foreign earnings for the country. Furthermore, the geographic nature of the marine sector is peripheral.  Therefore, the jobs that are created will be in regions where increased employment has historically been difficult to achieve.  I make that point for Senator Burke.</P>
    <P>This is where the real benefits of this massive injection of funds will be felt. Regions with low levels of employment and underdeveloped marine activities will be transformed and revitalised by this plan.  As Minister of State with special responsibility for port development I will be putting in place a £100 million investment programme for commercial ports throughout the country.  This programme will incorporate further development of the strategic corridor ports of Cork, Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Waterford, Rosslare and the Shannon Estuary.  I will also be providing for key regional ports around the country.  I take the point Senator Quinn made that there is a need for development in ports around our coast.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress enough the importance to the economy of improvements to our commercial ports.  A common complaint within industry is the high cost of getting Irish products to foreign markets.  It is my intention to develop our ports with a view to ensuring efficient and cost effective access to foreign markets for Irish companies.</P>
    <P>The £100 million investment in ports, allied to the restructuring of our major ports in the forthcoming harbours Bill, will bring our commercial ports into the 21st century.  Virtually all our externally traded goods leave the country by sea and by developing our ports we are in turn developing employment in industry. Again it is the positive effect on employment that is most important.</P>
    <P>While regional ports are small by comparison with ports such as Cork and <Col N="1589" /> Dublin they are nonetheless important to the areas they serve.  It is my view that an active and efficient port in a small town can bring many direct benefits to that town.  There are many examples of industries based in towns primarily due to the availability of port facilities.  I have received many worthwhile proposals from regional ports for funding.  If these proposals are viable and can show a positive jobs effect, then funding will be made available.</P>
    <P>Both the Culliton report and the Moriarty task force stressed the importance of developing our ports.  Through this £100 million investment programme the Government is showing its commitment to the further development of Irish ports.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State I also have responsibility for inland fisheries.  Since becoming Minister of State I have been acting to develop our inland fisheries with a view to substantially increasing the number of tourist anglers visiting our lakes and rivers.  Under the National Development Plan I have secured funding totalling £19 million for this sector. Given that the last national plan allocated a sum of £1 million, the new investment programme is the single biggest boost the sector ever received.</P>
    <P>Again my aim is the creation of sustainable new jobs in remote and disadvantaged areas where the majority of the fisheries are located.  At a minimum the Government envisages the creation of over 1,000 new jobs in this sector. Most importantly, the development of our inland fisheries will benefit all those who service the tourism industry through travel, car hire, accommodation and restaurants as well as in the angling sector itself.  We can and will realise the full potential for the inland fisheries sector.</P>
    <P>The single largest programme of investment under the Department of the Marine relates to sea fisheries and aquaculture. Our planned investment of £137 million recognises the vital contribution of the fishing industry to the national economy.  While we are constrained by EC regulations under the Common Fisheries Policy to a certain extent the Government intends to ensure the significant <Col N="1590" /> development and restructuring of our fishing fleet.  This modernisation and restructuring will ensure that the fishing industry can take up unused fishing quotas and increase catches of non-quota species.  The planned investment will also incorporate a major improvement in fish processing and marketing through the provision of new processing facilities and the modernisation of existing facilities.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that we secure new markets for our fish products abroad.  We have a high quality product to offer on the international market and the proposed investment under the national plan will ensure access to these markets.</P>
    <P>In particular we are targeting the aquaculture sector for major investment and growth.  The development of salmon farming and the shellfish sector is recent to Ireland but vast in potential.  I recently visited the ANUGA Food Fair in Cologne, Germany, where prime Irish salmon is now being marketed in competition with the best products from other countries.  The House should know the German distribution company, Van Der Burgh, indicated to me that although Norwegian salmon was much cheaper the company was buying more Irish salmon which has better texture, quality and taste.  It was also buying from the western seaboard and the density of salmon farming there was a major reason they were involved with BIM in producing what I consider a first class product.  I hope having this product on the international market, and in Germany especially, will create many jobs on the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>We are now investing heavily in the promotion of Irish fish products abroad and I am confident we will secure high quality niche markets.  The investment in marketing under the National Development Plan will secure increased demand for Irish fish abroad with a resultant increase in employment at home.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan also includes an investment programme of £9 million towards marine research.  This investment will provide significant assistance <Col N="1591" /> to the Marine Institute in the work they are carrying out under the chairperson of Professor Máire Mulcahy of UCC.  As Senator Calnan said, I have appointed Matt Murphy to the institute for his input over the many years he has been involved in research.</P>
    <P>For the first time we have included a planned investment of £5.5 million in the area of coastal protection.  This programme will allow coastal protection works to be carried out in key coastal areas and is of significant importance to many local communities.  When one considers £200,000 was the sum allocated last year for coastal protection, which was probably all spent in one area, that is a considerable improvement.  We will seek to have that sum further increased.  We recognise the coast needs protection in vulnerable areas in the south, west, east and especially the south-east.</P>
    <P>One issue not in the plan but which I feel is a key area in which we must take an initiative is the 20 mile exclusion zone. I have pursued this matter in Brussels. Our marine environment is vital.  If we are to market our products abroad, it must be fresh and clean.  I have proposed a 20 mile exclusion zone to prevent shipping, particularly tankers and ships carrying hazardous cargoes, entering inside a 20 mile limit.  I was in St. Malo recently at a conference on peripherality and was given wholehearted support by France, Britain and the Netherlands on the initiative we have taken.  It is important this proposal be presented to Brussels as soon as possible because if one tanker goes aground off our coast, this country would experience an horrific nightmare. This must not happen and I have made this proposal and we hope to get agreement from the EC.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan for the marine sector has increased employment as its primary objective.  Based as it is on increased development of an existing natural resource, the national plan signifies a major move forward in the marine area.  Our plan is a blueprint for economic progress in Ireland and most <Col N="1592" /> importantly it is a blueprint for increased employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his personal commitment to the marine.  It is obvious from the way he speaks that he sincerely wishes events were moving faster.  I do not wish to be personal about the national plan or the amount of money that was or was not committed.  However it is an embarrassment to us as a nation and anyone who would say we were not embarrassed internationally by the havoc created is a fool.  It will certainly be an embarrassment to us in years to come.  Yesterday evening on television commitments by the President of the EC Commission were discussed and someone said the money could be drawn down provided the programmes were implemented.</P>
      <P>I have been in the Seanad over eight years and this House would not wish a party in Government to bring before us a motion about something which has not even been started.  We should not get into this habit.  This issue might return to embarrass the Government.  We should not discuss something which has not yet been implemented.  I always like to see a project moving.</P>
      <P>I am impressed by the way some people have spoken about fisheries.  I am a city man but I know Cork port well.  I congratulate those Senators who have given commitment over the years to smaller ports.  However let us not suffer from any illusions.  Realistically the EC must ask questions about 1.5 per cent of the total money being spent in an area where a massive number of jobs could be created. The Minister says this but no one can say it can be done with less than £300 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fiercely embarrassing for a Member of the Government to say facilities provided in the Schull area are not being used.  Does that mean we have built facilities which will not be used or are they not being properly used?  Whose decision was it to put them there if they are not being used?  I am in favour of establishing marinas around the country but Kilrush marina must be an embarrassment. <Col N="1593" /> Was the planning done properly?</P>

Massive amounts of money could be earned if we could get more people to come to Ireland.  If every salmon caught upriver is worth £300, as one Senator said, as opposed to £10 off the coast, we should not allow anyone to catch salmon off the coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know if it is true.  Vast amounts of money could be spent ensuring we create work in fisheries. I can see the potential but let nobody tell me they are taking credit for something they have not even <Col N="1594" /> implemented.  It is only 1.5 per cent of the total money allocated, yet a vast number of jobs can be created.  What argument was made by the Department of the Marine at the Cabinet table if it only got 1.5 per cent when so many jobs could be created?  It is an embarrassment to that Department because there are enormous opportunities in this area.</P>
      <P>It is an embarrassment that people from other nations can travel 1,500 or 2,000 miles up the Mediterranean and fish off our coast for two and three weeks without going home.  We are not doing that.  That is what I call investment.  It was an embarrassment to hear another Senator say that a man bought a trawler for £24 million but got no grants.  That is a sad reflection on us.  That is where the Department should spend the money and it should argue for more money from the National Development Plan.  We need extra money if we are to avail of the opportunities that are there.</P>
      <P>The same can be said for forestry, I am no genius but I am a realist.  I can see the opportunities in this area.  I accept the sincerity of the Minister, although I am sure I will have many disagreements with him, but he is going nowhere with only 1.5 per cent of the total allocation.  It is a sad reflection on all on the Government side who say they are committed to more work in fisheries, yet only 1.5 per cent of the total amount has been allocated.  I feel sorry for the Minister.</P>

      <P>I wish to devote the last two minutes of my time to commercial ports.  I am concerned about our priorities and the way the moneys are being allocated to every port on the east coast.  I do not wish to be biased but I see opportunities where shipping that is bypassing Ireland could be used.  This would ensure that we get more shipping to redistribute to the mainland of Europe.  There are opportunities for that and the Minister knows it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Daly, the former Minister, who, in 1987, put in place measures that were relevant to the Cork region and the Cork free port.  The sad reflection is that if they had been properly implemented less money would now have to be spent in the Cork region. The 10 per cent corporation tax, as applied in the Shannon region, was not given to the Cork ports.  There was a dreadful injustice done to Senator Daly as the former Minister.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that as a nation we have grotesquely undervalued the entire marine area.  Ten years ago I remember being invited by the then leader of the Opposition, Mr. Haughey, to come into his office where I was charged with the task of writing a policy document on the marine.  Senator Cregan was right when he said we have bypassed an extraordinary opportunity in the last ten years. It was tragic and Senator Cregan was generous in his comments about Senator Daly.  When Senator Daly came in as Minister for the Marine it was tragic that the issue of the rod licence &mdash; nonsense which made no difference in the context of creating jobs from the marine resource &mdash; should have become so predominant as to destroy the first years of that Department, but that is history and we have to look ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other Senators, I want to concentrate on two specific issues. Money invested in the small commercial ports will create jobs.  We have two small commercial ports in County Wicklow &mdash; Arklow and Wicklow.  It is a scandal that both ports have been ignored by successive <Col N="1597" /> Governments over the years.  We got band-aid funding, pennies, where a couple of pounds put into those two ports would have produced hundreds of jobs.</P>
    <P>The entire economic hinterland of Arklow is dependent on the port and we have to wait until there is a storm, a hurricane or some crisis before we get money.  It got some money in the last few years, and I welcomed it, but it was not enough.  The Minister, and the Minister of State, will be hearing much about those two ports.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker spoke about access to ports.  One cannot get into the port of Wicklow because there is no proper bridge, yet the entire industry of that town depends on proper access to that port.  In the case of the port of Arklow, dredging is required.  The condition of the inner port is a scandal and a small amount of resources needs to be spent there.  Inadequate as the money in the plan for marine development is, I welcome what is provided.</P>
    <P>The second issue I want to deal with is coastal erosion.  I welcome the fact that some money has been allocated to deal with it.  The Senator is correct when he said that that amount of money allocated is grotesquely inadequate.  It is far better than the £200,000 that has been allocated for the past ten years but it is still inadequate. The Minister of State and the Minister will have a very hard job in the year ahead because there is a crisis with regard to coastal erosion from Bray Head right down along the Wexford coast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should see the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the areas in Mayo which were mentioned, we could spend ten times the amount of money that is provided in the plan.  We have a problem with the seafront in Bray.  The £20 million to £30 million of public and private investment there is in danger of being engulfed.  We have to do something about it.  We know of the crisis along the coast as far as Wexford.  We should put funds into this work because if we spend money on either the small commercial <Col N="1598" /> ports or on tackling coastal erosion we will protect investment and create jobs. Tackling coastal erosion, as everybody knows, will create jobs in building.</P>
      <P>I wish we had more time for this debate; we need two days to discuss the entire issue of the marine and perhaps we will table a motion on that issue.  I commend the Minister.  I do not think I had the opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment and welcome him to the House.  With the permission of the House, I will give the remaining five minutes of my time to Senator Daly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Roche I compliment the Minister of State and the Minister on bringing forward this development plan.  They have gone to the trouble of publishing a document which sets out in a broad way what they hope to achieve in this area over the next five or six years.  There are details in that plan that many of us would like to tease out with the Minister of State and some of the issues raised are important.  As an island nation, we have failed to fully exploit the potential of the seas around us.  In relation to some of the points I wish to make, I want to especially refer to the importance of the marine leisure and recreation area.  The plan which the Minister is now putting before us has not lost sight of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marine leisure and recreation is one of the areas of greatest development in the Continent today but we are sadly lacking in facilities in that area all around our coastline.  With that in mind the decision was made to promote and encourage the development of marinas.  This would, in a small way, exploit the potential of the marine leisure area, open up the opportunity for further jobs and for tourism promotion development, especially as the regions where this can be developed are the most remote in the country and have suffered the most from lack of investment, employment opportunities and emigration.  As there has been investment and the provision of marina leisure <Col N="1599" /> facilities in the area around Kilrush on the lower Shannon estuary, it opens up, for the first time, the potential of this region.  It also opens up the prospect of developing marine leisure facilities in Ballylongford, Foynes, Killadysart and Labasheed at the Clare side right up to Limerick city, a leisure area that has not been developed since the foundation of the State.  The investment there is worthwhile and useful and, as Senator Fitzgerald said, will link up with developments in Fenit, Dingle, Kinsale and along the coastline.</P>
    <P>I refer Senators to the success evident in the tall ships' race which stopped off in Cork harbour.  Many saw the economic value of that type of activity to the region. It gives an indication of what can be done around the coastline, and the provision of this type of facility is vitally important. Politicians who would seek to run down this investment seem to be more interested in getting short term publicity from knocking these projects, which would be valuable to the economic prosperity of these regions which have suffered dramatically from the decline of employment opportunities and from the loss of population through emigration over countless years.  The coastal communities need our support at this time.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go over many of the subjects raised tonight but coastal erosion, the protection of those working in the fishing industry and the provision of adequate safety standards to ensure safety at sea are vitally important.  The £19 million proposed to be invested in the new marine research institute will be the most important investment in any sector of this industry over the next four to five years.  I would like to see more money provided because, if one looks at our marine industry, aquaculture business and the development of our marine facilities, one will find that most of the technology used is either Swedish or Norwegian.  We have failed to develop our own technological industry to exploit the resources of the seas.  The seas can be farmed in the same way as the lands &mdash; I would say better than our lands at <Col N="1600" /> present.  Not only will it create employment opportunities in marketing and selling the products, it will also offer the possibility for young technicians to get meaningful and worthwhile employment in the coastal communities in developing our own specialist technological infrastructure, which will be available to develop the resources around us so that we will not have to depend, as we do now, on imported technology from Sweden, Norway, Japan or other countries.  This area is vital to the overall development of the economy.  As many Senators said, it has been to a large extent ignored or not fully developed but now is the opportunity to do something about it.  Instead of criticising the size of the investment, we should make sure it is put to good use. Matching funds from the private sector should also be added to ensure that this development can be speeded up and undertaken quickly.</P>
    <P>In the provision for inland fisheries it was hoped that at one stage angling clubs and others involved in this area would also make a contribution to ensure that that development took place.  This is just as important today as it was when it was proposed a few years ago.  It is not being done.</P>

      <P>I will answer some of the former Minister's questions as to why we do not have Irish technology in the fishing industry.  I wish to give three minutes of my time, with the permission of the House, to Senator Sherlock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I grew up in the same fishing port as Senator Fitzgerald &mdash; and what is happening in the fishing industry &mdash; I have no intention of blaming one side or the other because nothing annoys me more than hearing the Government and the main Opposition party arguing about who did what on this matter &mdash; has been a disaster since the foundation of the State, that is not a criticism of either the present or the former Minister.  It has been a disaster since 1922.  It is not a <Col N="1601" /> question of protecting our ports.  Our fishing industry is one of the oldest in Europe.  Why are we afraid of the Spanish? Why are we not worrying the Spanish in their waters?  If people could answer that question, they would have the key to the problems of the Irish fishing industry. We have never invested in this industry.</P>
      <P>Why is there no Irish technology in the fishing industry?  It is because we never put a shilling into research and development until recently and I welcome the commitment to the marine institute.  I have watched people trying to make progress in this industry and they have been cut to pieces at every step.  Who remembers &mdash; is it the <i>Inishalagh</i> or the <i>Loughalagh</i>&mdash; the boat attached to University College, Galway, which was the only academic research being done in the area of fishing and sea farming?  What happened to it?  The Government of the day &mdash; I do not know which Government and I care even less &mdash; cut their funding.  In the Minister's own county, Matt Murphy has been out in Sherkin island for many years shouting out to the Atlantic with no one in Dublin listening to him.  I congratulate the move that has given him a place where he can have a voice at last. He has been conducting research on the formation and founding of a marine research station.  This summer I was on Inishturk island off the Mayo coast, one of the most westerly points in Ireland and a strategically important place for a fishing industry.  There are two boats in the island &mdash; it is the only live industry there &mdash; and they do not have low water landing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem does not lie with the small ports.  We have increased our exports by 8-9 per cent last year, 14 per cent the year before and 7-8 per cent the year before that, so we are managing to export our produce.  With respect, the Minister should not waste the resources of his Department looking for new markets abroad for Irish fish.  If he has a problem with this, I will sell them for him because there is no difficulty in finding markets for Irish fish abroad.  The problem is in finding fish and in putting added value on in processing them to send abroad.  I grew <Col N="1602" /> up in a town where gurnard were not landed, dogfish were not even taken on board and John Dories were not even seen as a fish to be eaten.  We should have led the way in dealing with the development of the marketing of these and other fish.  We have failed miserably over the last 60 years.</P>
    <P>In terms of industry we have achieved a huge level of growth over the last number of years.  There will be more economic growth in this country than in any other OECD member state in 1993 or in 1994.  However, our exports are in the high-tech, low labour intensive industries while fisheries has fallen to pieces. The figures are startling.  In Europe, for every fisherman &mdash; if I may use that sexist term &mdash; working at sea, there are eight or nine processing jobs on land.  In Ireland, for every person working at sea, there are approximately two jobs on land.  That is where resources must be focused.  There will be a debate on agriculture in this House in the next two weeks and we will discuss the fact that one cannot get good beef in this country and that the national herd has been reduced as a result of the export of lambs and other young animals.  However, there is a greater problem in the fishing industry.  If one could use the terms &ldquo;fish on the hoof&rdquo; or &ldquo;fish on the fin,&rdquo; the Minister and I are aware we export fish without any added value.  This country should be the granary of Europe. Although we should produce the best food in Europe, it would be extremely difficult for somebody to get wild Irish salmon in a restaurant tonight because it is unavailable.  Tasteless farm salmon is available but the market for it is in Europe.  We must market and export the farm salmon and keep the best for our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Less than five or six years ago a huge development off the Cork coast was initiated to try to develop the shellfish industry.  I was delighted the Minister mentioned it in his speech, that development failed because of a lack of support. I do not know who was in Government at that time, that is not the issue.  We have failed to produce jobs because there <Col N="1603" /> has been no research and development in this area.  While I welcome moves which have taken place, I do so reservedly because we must first ensure that jobs are created.  We must ensure that fishermen dependent on the sea for their income are getting a proper price because no group of workers has been more exploited by those running processing companies on shore.  Fishermen need protection.</P>
    <P>When the <i>Atlantic Explorer</i> and the other large fishing vessel in Killybegs were bought two or three years ago, why did those fishermen go to Norway for funding to buy what was then the largest vessel in the Irish fishing industry?  Something is wrong when other countries, banks, etc. are prepared to invest in our industry.</P>
    <P>I grew up in a place where people at 14, 15 or 16 years of age were given control of large boats worth perhaps £0.5 million without the experience required to run this industry.  Many of these people were unable to continue.  Honest, hard working and well meaning people who got grants and loans for boats were unable to make repayments because of a lack of support and the industry died in its peak.  It is an underdeveloped industry which needs processing plants on land and added value.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well and I recognise his commitment at different levels. However, the problem is in Ireland, not abroad.  The fishing industry must be developed as a labour intensive, successful, indigenous one to which people will be attracted.  You do not hear people say that they want to become involved in the fishing industry and we are trying to change that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this important issue and I wish the Minister well in his portfolio. I know the Minister is sincere in his efforts in this regard.  It is a matter of regret that, despite being surrounded by some of the best fishing grounds in the world, our fishing industry remains underdeveloped.  Our record is poor <Col N="1604" /> compared to countries like Iceland where one fifth of the population is employed in fishing or fish processing.  Although Ireland controls 16 per cent of total EC waters, we account for only 3.3 per cent of overall Community catch.  Ireland is not responsible for over capacity or for the threat to some fish stocks.  If the EC is concerned about preserving stocks, it should take action to deal with the unacceptable activities of fishing vessels operating under flags of convenience.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the EC proposed to reduce our fishing fleet by one quarter.  We called for that to be resisted because, despite being an island nation, the Irish fishing industry has never been fully developed. The job creation record in fishing and fish processing has been disappointing. We rely on people like Mr. Joey Murrin, chief executive officer of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, and others, to keep us informed of these matters.  Is investment in our fishing industry related to the restructuring of our fishing fleet? Each time we discuss coastal erosion at meetings of Cork County Council, there is ambiguity regarding responsibility for the provision of finance.  I would like that position to be cleared up as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCashin" hpid="Mr. Cashin Mr. Cashin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cashin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I wish him well in regard to the National Development Plan.  Down through the years, the fishing industry has been neglected.  Some of the finest fishing waters in western Europe are located off our coast, yet we failed to exploit them.  We all remember the portfolio of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, fisheries being the poor relation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the development and restructuring of the fishing fleet.  Given fishing quotas, it is necessary to go after certain types of fish and specific boats are required.  Many boats used are out of date and unsafe. Perhaps the Minister has the development of the Cork shipyard in mind when he talks about restructuring the fishing fleet.  I refer to the development of commercial ports.  As an island nation, if we are to compete in Europe, we must have <Col N="1605" /> adequate ports from which to export our goods and, as previous speakers said, good roads to get to ports on time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the investment of £2 million in the port of Union Hall, County Cork, which has a turnover of £6.5 million; 20 boats operate from that port, fishing from Ballycotton to Dingle.  This is needed to create employment and I congratulate the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding aquaculture, from time to time I go deep sea fishing and I have noticed many such farms in Bantry, Castletownbere, Bere Haven and places along the west coast.  People are employed in an area where industry is no more than a dream.  Products from aquaculture may be sold on demand in Europe as we have clean and unpolluted waters.</P>
    <P>Training programmes and the development of the fish processing sector are important.  As the previous speaker said, no marine research has been carried out and the inclusion of Matt Murphy on the Minister's team is welcome.  He is an expert in this field and he will be of value in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the subject of tourist angling, I come from an inland town, Kanturk, which is located three miles from the Blackwater, one of the best salmon fishing rivers in western Europe.  I was involved with farmers, pollution officers from the county and fishermen in recent years in relation to pollution in that area. I am glad that, as a result of new methods used in the production of silage, effluence is no longer reaching our rivers and thousands of fish are not floating dead in the rivers.  There is very little industrial pollution in our rivers, because we have very little industry in the area.</P>
    <P>I can see development in the area of tourism.  Between 1989 and 1992 the number of visiting anglers increased by 50 per cent to 76,000.  However, there is an aspect of angling creeping into my area, borrowed from Scotland, where lucrative monopolies buy stretches of the river where once local anglers in small syndicates had fishing rights.  The fees paid for this type of angling are £3000 per week for a rod which would exclude many <Col N="1606" /> of the native anglers.  While I am in favour of bringing in the tourists and developing the tourist industry through angling, I urge the Minister not to neglect the native angler, or I can see poaching becoming one of the local pastimes.</P>
    <P>In regard to coastal protection, much of our coast has been eroded and, in recent years because of fierce gales and storms, much of our land is slipping into the sea.  Some of our smaller ports have been hit very badly and as a result are working at half capacity, Ballycotton is one.  As previous speakers stated, all these small ports have silted up.  They have been there since Victorian times and now, regardless of how much money the Minister has, it would not be sufficient to tackle this situation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the European Community policy on safe seas, I applaud the Minister for legislation which will be introduced to ensure that loaded oil tankers passing our coast will have to stay at least 20 miles off our coastline.  I agree with him that if one of these was to spill it would cripple the fishing industry.  I mentioned Castletownbere and Bere Haven, I do some sea fishing there, and as the Minister is an O'Sullivan and Castletownbere and Bere Haven is his hinterland, I ask him and the Minister to bring in legislation to deal with ships wrecked on our coasts which have been left to rot and rust.  There are two such vessels in Castletownbere and Bere Haven, one on the mouth of the port and the Spanish trawler around the corner, rusting, unsightly, certainly not a tourist attraction, damaging to fishing and I am sure, to fishermen. The Minister has a mammoth task in hand as the industry has been sadly neglected through the years.  I believe he has the commitment to tackle it and I wish him every success in that task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for allowing me some of his time and I welcome the Minister.  I enjoyed this debate about fishing and the development of the ports, but I am most interested in the development of the Shannon estuary.  I am delighted that a £100 million investment programme is being set aside by the <Col N="1607" /> Government.  I have been a promoter of the Shannon estuary since I started in politics 15 or 16 years ago.  The Shannon estuary has been greatly neglected and much could be done to develop it, another Rotterdam could have been set up there.  Much land in the area has been bought by Government agencies over the last number of years, and the State owns about 600 acres of land between Tarbert and Ballylongford.  The deepest waterway in western Europe is at Ardmore Point, where the biggest ships in the world can berth at low water.  Of course we have problems with removing the obstruction off Ballybunion, we need money to develop the infrastructure to try to attract industries.</P>
      <P>During my time in politics we lost at least five, if not six, major industries along the Shannon estuary due to lack of development.  The Taoiseach in Killarney a couple of years ago and the Tánaiste, who lives in the constituency, said that there is real need for development in that region.  I hope the money will be made available to put the infrastructure in place so we can get out into the world market and attract industries to the Shannon estuary.  I thank my colleague for allowing me a few minutes.  I am sorry I did not have more time to speak on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his appointment. I do not question his commitment or sincerity, but I have questions about the document before us, the motion and the substance of that document.  I do not support the motion particularly, it is like saying that we are all in favour of God, the Church and blueberry pie.  A government of any complexion would be committed to increasing employment and greater export earnings through the further development of sea fisheries and so on.  It would also be committed to coastal protection and marine research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some positive aspects of this National Development Plan which I am prepared to concede, dealing with research and development which has been sadly neglected in the past and to <Col N="1608" /> which Senator O'Toole referred in some detail.  There are positive aspects dealing with harbour development and coastal erosion although, as Senator Roche said, £5.5 million would hardly get us from Bray to Arklow, let alone down the east coast when it comes to that very serious matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to concentrate on the role of inland fisheries and tourism, how they might contribute to national prosperity and how they are dealt with in the plan. I notice that at an early stage the plan mentions developing key aspects of the tourism product base and lists some of them.  It says that there will be special measures to facilitate upgrading and improvement of tourist angling waters. Will we have upgraded and improved waters without fish?  This is already the case in the west in certain circumstances. The plan then goes on to make a very serious admission.  It says, when dealing with fishery development for tourist angling, that the success of tourism angling is now at risk because of the deteriorating quality and level of Irish fish stocks.  Amen to that.  If anything it is more serious than that.  The Minister is aware of these matters because I raised them already on a motion on the Adjournment on 8 July when I appealed to him to do something about the disappearance of sea trout from the west.</P>
    <P>The central question about the aspirations in this document is how to reconcile our desire to develop our inland fishery resource, which is of immense quality and value, with our desire to develop aquaculture, because the two activities are fundamentally contradictory. Unless research and development can come up with a solution to this problem, I am very apprehensive about the future of inland fisheries, particularly when it comes to migratory fish such as sea trout and salmon.  Senator Kelly referred to the value of fish caught in fresh water compared to their value when they are caught in nets at sea.</P>
    <P>I agree with what she said but it must be a matter of serious concern that a resource like Ballinahinch, one of the premier salmon and sea trout fisheries &mdash;<Col N="1609" /> not just in Ireland but in the world &mdash; had only a handful of salmon caught in its waters this year.  There is a hotel in the area and the people working there are dependent on the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I have catalogued what happened to fisheries all down the west coast from Delpi above Leenaun, down through Kylemore to Screeb and Gowlaun and into Costelloe and so on.  I have fished all those waters and people fly in from America and Australia to fish there.  They hired a car, stayed for a month in the best hotels and had a gillie with them every day of the week.  They left an immense amount of money in areas that had very little prosperity.  Those people have now gone to Scotland, Norway and Russia &mdash; where they have fishing &mdash; or even to the Falkland Islands.  They will go to those places if the sport is there.</P>
    <P>This is a high value resource which we are letting slip through our fingers.  It does not make sense to say that we have a commitment to these matters when everything that has happened over the past ten years indicates otherwise.  We do not have the commitment to tackle this problem or the pollution which has taken place over the past 20 years.  These resources have existed since the ice age, uncontaminated, and this generation in its greed can decide that they are expendable. We put pig farms on the side of Lough Sheelin and allow them to discharge their pollutants into the lake. Lough Sheelin had improved.  I went back there at the beginning of October and once again there are areas of green water.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that the legislation to prevent people taking gravel from rivers and sand from beaches is implemented.  Legislation must be implemented, otherwise the resource will be gone, and the tourists we hope to attract to this country to spend money, will also be gone.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and acknowledge the fact that we are getting extra money.  However, I question the management of resources, particularly inland fisheries, the development of which is the business of the regional fisheries boards while marketing and other matters are dealt with by other bodies.  These bodies, however, are acting on their own.  The regional fisheries boards and the regional tourism organisations, for example, have no common membership. It is one of the areas that has worried me for a long time.  I brought it to the attention of the other House on many occasions and put forward proposals that we should have common boards or common membership of some sort so that there could be coordination. What is the point in spending £19 million on the development of inland fisheries unless you have people there to fish and facilities, apart from basic fishing facilities, to encourage them to return?</P>
      <P>Development is unco-ordinated and obviously it is a very valuable resource, particularly in my constituency.</P>

      <P>Having moved the motion which I thought was most timely and necessary, I thought for a while I was in the wrong House and that we were talking about the National Development Plan. However, eventually we got around to <Col N="1611" /> talking about the marine plan which is the one for discussion here.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State putting great emphasis on jobs in areas with a low level of employment.  Living in such an area, I see the value of any job at the moment.  If people are not involved in drift-net or shell fishing, they have only two alternatives; unemployment assistance or the boat. Therefore, any job created will be of great benefit.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock mentioned overfishing of our seas.  The North Sea was cut off from its fish supplies by overfishing with foreign boats moving in there and now it is nearly a dead sea.  If something is not done off our coasts to prevent Spanish and other foreign boats from fishing there we will have a similar situation in the Celtic Sea.  I know the Minister of State is well aware of that.</P>
      <P>Senator Cashin mentioned wrecks. The <i>Bardini Reefer</i> is lying inside Castletownbere and Bere Haven and if something is not done about it in the not too distant future there could be a disaster if another boat gets caught on it.  It is clogging up part of the inlet to this fine, natural harbour.  Senator Cashin visited the place and has seen the problem.  I agree with Senator O'Toole when he says that fishing has for many years been the cinderella of Irish industry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the points by the Minister of State regarding inland fisheries and angling for the development of tourism because it is of the utmost importance.  Having visited the Salmara fish farm in Bantry Bay, which is not too far from Castletownbere, I saw that a small amount of sea contained a large amount of salmon which were being reared there.  That small pocket of sea gives an indication of what is possible given the millions of pockets around the coast that could be developed in this way.  We have a marvellous resource if it can be developed.  I was pleased to move this timely motion and, as Senator Fitzgerald said, we need a lot more time to develop fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of focusing a lot more attention and resources on <Col N="1612" /> fishing, the marine and ports has been agreed by everybody in the debate.  In the past, not enough resources or attention was paid to them.  The House also agreed that the Minister of State is totally committed to that area and we can expect that the money will be well spent.  I also share Senator Calnan's satisfaction that the emphasis is on jobs and job creation.  There is a huge potential to create jobs in these areas.  Senator Quinn detailed the importance of ports.  The Minister of State stressed that point when he said that virtually all our externally traded goods leave the country by sea.  It is obviously of crucial importance to our exports that we develop our sea ports, and I welcome the fact that there is a commitment to that development in the plan.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the commitment to the Shannon estuary.  We often talk about being a peripheral nation but, in terms of sea shipping and trading links, we are central if one looks at the world stage rather than the European one.  There is tremendous potential to develop the Shannon estuary.</P>
      <P>I also want to speak about the question raised by Senator Dardis on the conflict between inland fisheries and aquaculture.  I hope that the marine institute, which will receive £9 million under this plan, can be the link in solving the problems in that area.  Lice infestation, for example, will be studied by the marine institute.  I hope it will be possible to have the two sides living together because there is huge potential for job creation in aquaculture and the area of tourism and inland fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to processing and marketing which have huge potential.  Figures were quoted of the potential number of land jobs as opposed to sea jobs.  Europe was mentioned as an example but Japan has shown that there is much more potential to create jobs on land, particularly in processing, if money is invested, research is carried out and industries are established.  I visited Brittany recently.  Many of us are live in towns and villages which are twinned with areas in Brittany.  The huge potential on the Brittany coast for aquaculture and processing has been <Col N="1613" /> developed.  This can also be done in Ireland.  As other Senators said, there is tremendous potential for the development of inland fisheries.  The increase in spending on inland fisheries from £1 million in <Col N="1614" /> the last plan to £19 million in this plan indicates how serious the Government are about this.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Bank Charges.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the charges announced recently by one bank.  I would like to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am glad she is taking action in relation to this question.  The Minister of State is, I think, fully aware of the situation which has evolved in recent weeks.  It represents a further chapter in the saga of the ordinary consumer being penalised.  It is another penny-pinching and money-grabbing exercise by the banks.  I ask the Minister of State, when she meets the banks or representatives of the Central Bank or both to impress on them that it is not on for them to bring in charges at will.  She is aware that many charges brought in by the banks are often hidden charges.  We must look in particular at the charges recently announced by Allied Irish Banks and the whole question of how the banks and building societies operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen responses from other banks on how competition has worked and there is no doubt that the banking and financial world is going through a period of rapid change.  In the past, people were met by their friendly bank manager and, with the exception of the parish priest, probably confided most in him.  Unfortunately, times have changed. I am concerned that people are now not much more than a number to the bank. The banks do not want to see them.  I <Col N="1615" /> understand the need to improve the system, particularly to ensure that people are paid by cheque so that there is less cash in circulation and not as great a need for security measures.  However, people are increasingly being penalised if they want to use the old methods of withdrawing and lodging cash or pay for certain items by cheque.  If people do not wish to use the latest plastic card in ATM machines which reduces their dealings with a bank, the banks either do not want to know them or penalise them in relation to the operation of their account.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes, particularly in relation to Visa cards and cheque book accounts, will mean that people who cleared their account on time will have to pay an extra fee, an extra £15 charge on top of the Government charge of £10.  It is up to the Minister of State, possibly in co-operation with her colleague the Minister for Finance, to insist on the Central Bank becoming more active and consumer oriented and not to accept these charges.  I hope the Minister of State will make it clear that legislation will be introduced if the consumer is not protected. The Minister of State has contacted the Director of Consumer Affairs about the introduction of these charges.  I have had complaints from constituents about banks sending them letters about them. The banks claim they are not making a profit if customers keep their accounts in credit.  As a result they impose penalties or reduce the credit period.  For those who go over the limit, and there are few of us who do not, the banks are introducing administration fees, referral fees and other charges.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has a role to play in this regard and I am pleased the Minister has taken the initiative and arranged to meet the banks, the Central Bank or both.  I hope the Minister impresses on them the gravity of the situation and how consumers are affected.  The ordinary person who has completed paper transactions through the years does not want to change to the &ldquo;hole in the wall&rdquo; system.  People should be welcomed in the bank but they are complaining that <Col N="1616" /> the meter is running from the moment they speak to the bank manager about accommodation, mortgages or loans.</P>
    <P>There must be competition in the banking sector.  Some years ago one had to wait to get an application form for a mortgage from a building society.  Now bank and building society managers are chasing customers in the same way as lawyers are accused of ambulance chasing. Borrowers must be made aware of the various hidden charges by some of the building societies or banks.  I welcome the aggressive approach by some banks. Perhaps I am only getting half the story, but at least some banks are making an effort and putting the customer first. Interest should be paid on current accounts which are in credit.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State has taken steps to deal with this.  However, she and the Minister for Finance must act if there is no response.  The Central Bank must be more than an observer at the proceedings.  The banks believe they can introduce any charges they like and hidden costs.  The consumer must be protected, particularly in regard to overcharging. I compliment the Minister of State on taking action and I hope she will take steps to deal with this if there is not a satisfactory response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for raising this matter on the Adjournment. Once again, the Seanad's speed in responding to an issue which has aroused great interest throughout the country proves its relevance.  I am surprised at the response to this issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave has acknowledged that the banks play a major role in economic development.  They provide services at a cost to producers and consumers.  I am interested in having those services provided as competitively as possible.  Senators will be aware that this emphasis on competitiveness was stressed in the Culliton report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expressed my concern last Friday when the new arrangements were announced by Allied Irish Banks.  Bank <Col N="1617" /> charges are regulated under section 28 of the Central Bank Act, 1989.  Section 28 (2) requires each holder of a banking licence to notify the Central Bank of every proposal to change any charge, terms or conditions which have been previously notified to the bank.  The Central Bank has powers under section 28 (3) to direct a holder of a banking licence to refrain from imposing or changing a charge, term or condition applying to the provision of a service to the public or to any class of the public, without the prior approval of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The House will be interested to hear that in the four years since that Bill was passed the Central Bank has never exercised those powers, as far as the Department is aware.  Charges made by the banks and the proposals for increases in bank charges are not examined in any detail.  The apparent justification for this approach is that market forces should determine the optimum level of charges.</P>
    <P>As a result, banks are setting their charges in a way which directs the customer into the practices which the banks require of them.  Instead of the banks being glad that consumers are buying their product, money, and charging well for that product, which they do, the consumer is being directed away from paper banking transactions to the new era of technology.  Many people have contacted me because their way of life suits the cheque book, rather than this new transaction. This extra £20 charge is only applicable if one is overdrawn.  A person who is not overdrawn would be unusual but, perhaps, the Senators could tell me of such a person.</P>
    <P>The banks are probably in a position to carry on this quasi-monopolistic behaviour because customers do not react and go elsewhere when charges increase.  We are meant to be in market forces and out of the cartel.  However, there is a subtle cartel in operation because when one bank introduces a charge another bank does the same six months later.  We tend to condone such matters.  The reasons consumers do not leave are because they have built a relationship and a system in a bank and <Col N="1618" /> they are apprehensive about moving elsewhere; they fear loss of references should they change and there is a belief on the consumer's part that if one bank changes its charges and is not challenged the others will follow.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank must play a more positive role in relation to the responsibilities of banks towards their consumers. We are not talking about deposit rates or the defence of the currency, but about consumers and their rights.  There must be a balance between the concern of bank solvency and the needs of Irish producers and consumers.  There is a rate of safety for liquidity purposes and the Irish banks are above this.  Therefore, that will not be called into account.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank might tackle a more positive consumer role in a number of ways, including the promotion of increased competition through the interest rate mechanism, the promotion of fair competition between the holders of banking licences and other institutions taking money on deposit and offering credit, thereby expanding the choices available to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I contacted my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, in whose area of responsibility the Central Bank rests, with a view to determining what action may be taken expediently towards these ends.</P>
    <P>The draft consumer credit Bill which will be introduced shortly &mdash; I hope we will be able to introduce it in this House &mdash; will deal with interest rates in credit agreements.  It will provide a formula for calculation of annual percentage rate of charge.  It is also my intention to provide scope in the Bill for the transparency of advertising regarding the availability, the cost or the provision of credit to the consumer and the necessary power to amend such provisions by regulation if and when it is considered necessary.  A section of the Bill will deal specifically with advances on current accounts and information in relation to their operation which, when the Bill is passed, must, by law, be given to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I am meeting AIB tomorrow to discuss their recent announcement and following <Col N="1619" /> that meeting we will be in a position to determine further action.  In the meantime, I would draw the attention of bank users to the need to look around for better value including that available from non bank financial institutions.  Senator Cosgrave asked what we are going to do after the meeting tomorrow.  There are two routes open to us.  The Minister for Finance could have discussions with the Central Bank pointing out their responsibilities under the Central Bank Act, 1989 and, if that is not rigorous enough, consider amendments to it.  Alternatively, we could, either by legislation or regulation, through the consumer credit Bill intervene in this process if and when the rights of consumers are clearly seen to have been transgressed.</P>
    <P>We are trying to get away from regulation and intervention but when dealing with financial institutions, and the product they sell to consumers, that is money, the consumer is still very much the supplicant when the reverse should be the position.  The consumer is buying a product and paying heavily for it through a variety of charges and it seems always as if the financial institution is giving a privilege when in fact the consumer is buying a product and paying dearly for it.  There should be some way in which consumers' rights and interests can be more clearly observed.  In response to the motion tonight, I intend to do something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise the need for the Minister for Health to ensure that the needle exchange and drug maintenance clinic at Baggot Street Hospital, Dublin 4 is carried out in such a way as to protect the residents of the area and their property from harassment, intimidation and general nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The AIDS Resource Centre at 19 Haddington Road was opened about four years ago to prevent the spread of AIDS <Col N="1620" /> among drug users.  In August 1992 the Eastern Health Board established a clinic there to provide primary health care to those who might be HIV positive or were in danger of becoming HIV positive. Prior to September 1992 about 60 people were receiving methadone treatment at the clinic but by October 1992 the number had increased to 160 and by Christmas the number was 200.  The increase in numbers has caused problems in the area.</P>
    <P>I will describe the kind of area Baggot Street is.  It is a closely knit residential and commercial community.  The residential community is mostly comprised of elderly people and a number of senior citizens.  I propose to share my time with Senator Manning as he is a resident in the area and lives a short distance from the clinic about which I am speaking.  He will outline the difficulties residents have experienced. I wish to explain the difficulties the business community have experienced in the area.</P>
    <P>Businesses on Baggot Street include the usual commercial businesses such as banks and shops but there are also a number of service shops such as restaurants, cafes, dry-cleaners and so on. Since the numbers increased at the clinic, they have suffered severe harassment. Going around the area last week I discovered that a number of cafes and restaurants have to employ security personnel between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.</P>
    <P>The clinic has enticed many undesirables into the area including people who might not need or be dependent on methadone treatment.  I have been informed by the gardaí that a number of drug pushers have been found in the area and that is a serious cause of concern. The problem was not helped when the hospital authorities opened a door at the side of 19 Haddington Road.  It is a small lane about the width of the Press Gallery in the Chamber and people receiving treatment have to go in that way.</P>
    <P>I received a number of representations on this matter and I will read one from Dr. Walter Halley.  I discussed this matter with him this afternoon and he has given <Col N="1621" /> me permission to quote his representations. He said:</P>
    <P>Many of my patients have been harassed and several of them in recent times have been mugged.  They are all elderly, usually female.  I would also like you to note that I have been personally threatened and have many problems with some of these people arriving in my surgery and on several occasions I have difficulty getting them out.</P>
    <P>He went on to refer to the problems that the shopkeepers are experiencing and then mentioned the needle exchange:</P>
    <P>I have on several occasions recently regarded with great caution deposited needles and syringes with physeptone bottles, some of them half full.  Surely this is totally unacceptable in an area which is beside a large junior school.</P>
    <P>They are the problems residents in the area are experiencing.  I became aware of them in February when the numbers increased to 200.  I attended a number of meetings organised by the residents and the business people.  At my invitation the chief executive officer of the health board attended two of these meetings to see what could be done to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Health is not in the House &mdash; I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister of State.  I met the Minister for Health privately about this problem.  I met him at the annual health board meeting in Bundoran last April and undertook to give him details of the problems, which I did one week later.  It saddens me that I only received an acknowledgement from the Minister; he never replied to my representations.</P>
    <P>In my representations I stated that residents of the area &mdash; Dr. Halley also states this &mdash; are prepared to accept that people from the catchment area be treated in this clinic.  If the situation is allowed to continue the goodwill of the people will be lost.  Time is running out on us and something must be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> I suggest to the Minister that only people from the catchment area be treated there.  Dr. Joe Barry, the AIDS and drug co-ordinator for the Eastern Health Board who is in charge of the clinic, told me that 30 people are being treated at that clinic from that catchment area.  I am referring to health area No. 2 in the Eastern Health Board region which is divided into ten.  I support any treatment programme to help people break their drug habit.  I will conclude by quoting the following from what Dr. Barry stated in a letter to me, dated 20 October, 1993:</P>
    <P>However, the situation is always volatile and we are continuing to monitor the situation.  We have a security man on duty from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. every day to patrol the lane through which patients gain access to the hospital.  We also have a 24 hour video recorder in the lane so any disturbance can be recorded.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reduce the number of patients being treated to 30 and to treat them with a certain dignity by allowing them to enter the hospital through 19 Baggot Street and not through the laneway where there is a video camera and security patrol.  It is not right that they should have to go through a laneway to receive this treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Doyle for raising this issue and sharing his time with me.  He has made his case strongly and fairly.  The people in this area are not against the clinic.  They realise that those attending the clinic have a problem for which they must receive treatment. However, they are saying that the numbers must be controlled to prevent the nuisance, harassment and intimidation which has been there for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle described the area well. It is a settled and good business area and is one of the oldest parts of Dublin.  It is a tolerant area but it is also vulnerable for three reasons.  First, as Senator Doyle said, many old people live in rent-controlled flats in the area.  Many of them have, as Dr. Halley outlined, been the <Col N="1623" /> victims of mugging, threatening behaviour and intimidation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the area is vulnerable because there are so many young people. The centre in question is close to a number of national and secondary schools.  On many occasions children have been intimidated by some of those receiving treatment in the clinic.  Thirdly, it is vulnerable due to the range of businesses there.  They are thriving service businesses, such as pubs, dry cleaning, mini shops and so forth, and every business person has, not once but on several occasions, been threatened with syringes or abusive behaviour.  As a result some pubs do not open until late in the day.</P>
    <P>Dr. Halley, who is a respected doctor in the area, outlined the situation in a fair way.  He could have said that people have been attacked in the church and that they are now afraid to go into the church out of fear of attack.  It is also a frightening experience for a young assistant in a shop or a pub to have somebody wave a syringe at them and threaten to inject them with an AIDS infected syringe. Likewise, the people lurking in laneways have intimidated people.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle has made the essential point, the people in this area are tolerant, good and decent.  They realise there is a problem.  They are willing to accept that people in their catchment area must be treated and treated with dignity.  They are not prepared to accept that their hospital be used as a dumping ground for people from across the city who need treatment.  Dumping large numbers of such people in the area leads to the problems of security I have described.  When that happens the good will of the people in the area is forfeited.  Senator Doyle said it may be forfeited.  People have had to put up with a great deal and have done so patiently and quietly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to resolve the problem in such a way that those in the catchment area can continue their treatment with dignity, under supervision and in such a way that people of the area will not have to live under threat.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board established two clinics in August 1992 in response to the recommendations of the Government Strategy to Prevent Drugs Misuse and of the National AIDS Strategy Committee.  These clinics, which are not directly associated with large hospitals, are known as satellite clinics.</P>
      <P>Central to the Government's policies on drug abuse and HIV/AIDS is the unfortunate fact that of the people in this country who have developed full blown AIDS, intravenous drug abusers account for 44 per cent.  The figures for HIV infection are even more revealing: 58 per cent of all those who are HIV positive are drug abuse related.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances, therefore, both the Government Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse and the National AIDS Strategy Committee recognised that the treatment of such individuals and the need to target prevention strategies to at least reduce and at best halt the spread of infection are of paramount importance. The Eastern Health Board chose Baggot Street community hospital as one of the locations for a satellite clinic because of its central location, its catchment area and because it had already been providing services through the AIDS resource centre for some considerable time.  For these and other reasons it was regarded as a very suitable centre from which to offer services.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, aware that there have been difficulties in the locality which have been blamed on the patients attending the Baggot Street clinic.  Any incidents which have occurred are to be regretted but I know that the health board staff regularly liaise with the local gardaí, based in Donnybrook, and have employed a security guard specifically to ensure, as far as is practicable, that the clients attending at the clinic are of good behaviour.  The board's officers have also met on a number of occasions with local traders and residents' associations and I am satisfied that everything possible is being done to ensure that the clinic operates with the minimum of interference to the local community.</P>

      <Col N="1625" /> Since the Baggot Street clinic began to provide services over one year ago it has been successful in providing treatment and services for a group of people for whom it is notoriously difficult to provide services.  These services are being provided in tandem with, and complementary to, a methadone maintenance programme.  For those who are not aware of methadone or its properties it is a heroin substitute which has a longer half life thereby lending itself to a once daily dose for addicts.  It can be used in a variety of ways including as a stabilising element for drug abusers; as part of a detoxification programme or as part of a longer term maintenance programme.</P>
    <P>The use of methadone in such circumstances to provide a dose of medication which is capable of maintaining a patient at a particular level is recognised internationally as a proven method for controlling the often chaotic behaviour of drug abusers.  The Government Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse and the National AIDS Strategy Committee recognise that the ultimate goal should be to help drug abusers to work towards a drug free lifestyle.  However, in practical terms, in order to ensure that clients present for treatment and services it is necessary to offer methadone as part of the treatment regime.  Patients can then be assessed for future treatment needs, their behaviour can be monitored and, if necessary, they can be referred elsewhere for treatment.</P>
    <P>Central to this policy of providing methadone in such controlled circumstances is the necessity to monitor and evaluate its availability outside of such clinics.  I am obviously supportive of the provision of methadone in the community where the proper guidelines have been followed and where there is close regular liaison between general practitioners providing such a maintenance programme and the statutory authorities. Otherwise there is obvious potential, which will be speedily exploited, for drug abusers to obtain excessive quantities of controlled drugs such as methadone.</P>
    <P>In order to provide such guidelines I accepted earlier this year the recommendation <Col N="1626" /> concerning a Protocol on the prescribing of methadone which was drawn up by an expert group within the Department of Health.  This Protocol gives clear guidelines for the essential requirements for providing methadone maintenance programmes in the community and introduces the concept of treatment cards and treatment lists. These innovations will mean that large concentrations of abusers at particular clinics will be avoided in the future and that general practitioners will have clear guidelines available to them to protect them from persons trying to abuse their services.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the treatment list will be introduced shortly and that the other elements of the Protocol will follow in the near future.</P>
    <P>In the Baggot Street clinic at Christmas 1992 nearly 200 persons attended daily for methadone maintenance.  As a result of various initiatives, including the transfer of patients to the newly opened satellite clinic on the north side of Dublin, transfer of some patients to the Drug Treatment Centre, Trinity Court, and the opening of a clinic at the premises of the Drug Treatment Centre, Trinity Court, which is staffed by Eastern Health Board personnel, the number attending for daily methadone maintenance at Baggot Street is now less than 100.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances I believe that the Eastern Health Board staff are providing an efficient, caring, comprehensive service to persons who do not always appreciate such service but who must be helped because of their needs and also because of the threat that their chaotic behaviour can cause to the community at large.</P>
    <P>To summarise, large concentrations of people in receipt of this treatment will be reduced when the protocol goes into operation.  Secondly, by providing extra satellite clinics we are reducing the number which will be treated at any one clinic and we are going to proceed to do that as quickly as resources allow.  That is not just an empty political promise and I hope to have a positive announcement on that between now and Christmas. <Col N="1627" /> Thirdly, in my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Justice I will speak tomorrow to the Garda Superintendent in Donnybrook to see if we can intensify the liaison between the local gardaí and the clinic.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised a question about people having to go through the laneway. I have taken a note of what the Senator said and I will talk to the Eastern Health Board about that to see if we can alleviate that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that the acceptable number would be the number for each health board catchment area which would be 30 in the area we are talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The problem with confining each area to the people from its <Col N="1628" /> own catchment area is that we would immediately have to provide a considerable number of extra satellite clinics &mdash; I do not have the exact number &mdash; one for each catchment area.  We might not be able to do that as the numbers living in each catchment area would not be similar.  Some catchment areas could have three or four times the population of others.  If we were to reduce the number to 30 immediately it would be beyond our present resources.  However, the fact that we are providing extra satellite clinics in conjunction with the implementation of the methadone programme will alleviate the situation considerably.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 October 1993.</P>
