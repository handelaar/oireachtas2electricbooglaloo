      <P>I have notice from Senator Reynolds that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to allow the coal burning power station at Arigna, County Roscommon, to continue production until all the coal deposits in the area are exhausted.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In light of gross underfunding of Irish primary schools, the need for the Minister for Education to ensure that primary schools be issued with free television licences or, alternatively, that a general national fee to cover a licence for each school be negotiated with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications by the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senators Reynolds and O'Toole as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Item 1, all Stages of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1993 from now until its conclusion. There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 1.30 p.m.  Item 2, the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1993, all stages, will be taken from 1.30 p.m.  I suggest 30 minutes per spokesperson and 20 minutes for other speakers.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Members, I wish the Cathaoirleach well and hope he will soon be back in the House.</P>
      <P>We agree with the Order of Business. Could the Leader of the House outline what legislation will be introduced in the House during the next couple of weeks? There is a growing list of Bills and a timetable for their introduction would give Members an opportunity to prepare. It is unfortunate that, at the end of each session, there seems to be a rush to pass outstanding legislation.</P>

      <P>It is always difficult at this time of the year to operate like other workers and ask when it is proposed to go into recess.  Operators in the tourist industry are tired of people not booking their holidays until the last minute.  This House contributes to that difficulty as Members do not know when the House will go into recess.</P>
      <P>On a serious note, I agree with Senator Cosgrave on the need for a timetable for the introduction of new legislation.  I realise it is not possible to impose a definite deadline for the completion of business but we should have some indication so Members can make plans in order to maintain good relationships at home.</P>

      <P>I wish to bring the question of appeals under the disadvantaged areas scheme to the attention of the Leader of the House.  Yesterday, he dismissed my request to discuss the matter rather lightly but I am not prepared to accept that.  There is too much confusion about the issue.  I again ask him to allocate Government time next week, when the Seanad will sit for three days, to discuss this.  It is not an issue for a motion on the Adjournment.  It is a national issue.</P>

      <P>In regard to questions from Senators Cosgrave and O'Toole concerning the legislative programme, I will try to keep the House informed.  This House will be sitting next Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and the Animal Remedies Bill, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill and the Defence (Amendment) Bill will be taken next week.  I ask the Senators to understand that time has to be found for other debates, but this will be assessed as the summer proceeds.</P>
      <P>The amnesty Bill will be dealt with in this House on 13 July.  I understand that Dáil amendments to the IDA Bill will come back to this House on Report Stage.  There are many other Bills that will be dealt with between now and the summer recess.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister about section 1 (2) &mdash;&ldquo;the Authority has incurred a legal obligation to pay at least 25 per cent of the cost of its making.&rdquo;  I do not know where that figure came from.  I would have thought that the commissioning of such a production would have entailed 100 per cent payment by RTE.  It is slightly ambiguous. Does this mean a down payment of 25 per cent, or a legal obligation in the end? If that is the case, what steps are envisaged to ensure the other 75 per cent is <Col N="141" /> paid?  Is it envisaging a joint venture with another company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins) Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) makes it clear, as Senator Ross has pointed out, that RTE must have committed at least 25 per cent of the cost of making the programme before production work commences.  One of the difficulties for a programme maker &mdash; perhaps for any business &mdash; was to get sufficient funding to get a project off the ground.  Once the initial finance is committed, other funding is less difficult to obtain.</P>
      <P>When I spoke yesterday, the Senators will have noted that I stressed the editorial integrity of RTE &mdash; which I am protecting &mdash; in relation to the quality of what is transmitted.  At the same time, those approaching RTE will make their own arrangements for the viability of a programme.  I had consultations with the different interests involved and there was general agreement to a 25 per cent provision; that is from where the figure came.  I then realised that &mdash; and I have approached it with a great deal of flexibility from the beginning &mdash; while in later years I had made provision for commissioning and had specified sums rising from £5 million to £12.5 million, or 20 per cent of commissioning, there were many people who had projects where the investor had withdrawn and these programmes could have been finished if they had a little extra finance.  To test the viability of a proposal, a person needs a small amount of seed capital.  The reason I put back a 10 per cent provision was to deal with those two exigencies.  The specific figure of 25 per cent came from my consultations with the industry and from looking at the procedures for commissioning and for fund raising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by the wording of the subsection, this is obviously not a down payment by RTE but a commitment, a legal obligation to pay at some stage.  Does the Minister envisage that there is a possibility that some of these independent producers might get into financial difficulties because, although <Col N="142" /> there is a legal obligation that they will get a down payment of 25 per cent, they might not have any commitment for the 75 per cent to pay for the film?  I think RTE should look for some sort of comfort that this 75 per cent will definitely be paid because there might be uncompleted projects as a result of this requirement. Is there a cast iron guarantee that all these projects will be completed or will RTE's 25 per cent be wasted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that I have been involved in making documentaries &mdash; not in the financing side &mdash; but it would be totally unreasonable to suggest to this, or any, House that one would have a 100 per cent success rate in projects suggested for film making; this is not the nature of the industry.  What we must do is balance three things that are very important.  First, what the public see must be of excellent quality and second, the RTE Authority, which has an integrity of its own, has equal responsibilities as to standard.  Then we come to the third dimension.  I wanted to allow flexibility.  I am certain that looking at the commissioning procedures within RTE, while some seed capital may be provided most people will have negotiated a package.</P>
      <P>As I said yesterday, this is only one part of an overall approach I have towards tele-visual and film production. We currently enjoy an existing film co-production agreement with Canada and I hope to sign more of these co-production agreements in the short term, probably with Australia, France and Germany. I am also aware of the way television commissioning works.  The world has changed in relation to purchasing. It is now more difficult to sell into the European market and the trend is towards selling a series rather than a single documentary film.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Film making is a highly sophisticated business.  What will happen is this.  People will get commitments for sales and production costs.  All this will be on paper for evaluation by RTE when it comes to commissioning.  I also wanted to allow flexibility.  I want the national station and <Col N="143" /> the creativity I am allowing within it and within the commissioning fund to be made available to develop ideas.  That may take time.</P>
    <P>There are many good film makers &mdash; of both genders, which is exciting &mdash; and they say that if one waited for every penny to be in place one would never produce anything.  I wanted to include some guarantees and, at the same time, ensure flexibility.</P>
    <P>I made provision for not only a personal review of this legislation but for the compilation of an annual report with every commissioned product stated.  This will provide both Houses with an opportunity to examine developments.  If a series of shaky proposals were presented, the Authority would have to justify them to me and I would justify them to the Oireachtas.  However, I do not see this happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by the manner in which the Minister is examining this industry.  Over the years I said the film industry has a major role to play in relation to entertainment and tourism. This industry must be examined and reappraised.  I am inspired by the Minister's knowledge, enthusiasm and attitude which will remove many barriers.</P>
      <P>Those involved in the film industry are aware that it is a high risk industry.  It is many times more difficult to achieve success in the film industry than the record industry.  Those of us who have attended the Cannes film festival on many occasions in an effort to obtain business, know that the Americans, who control over 75 per cent of the film industry, and the Europeans require test runs to examine proposals submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen the impact of the television series &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; on the city of Dallas.  Tourism in that city increased fivefold.  Likewise, the series &ldquo;Hawaii Five O&rdquo; generated an elevenfold increase in tourism in Hawaii.  I suggested a number of years ago that if we produced a successful television series we should call it &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  Such a series showing our countryside and depicting life in <Col N="144" /> modern Ireland would benefit our tourism industry.  Some 25 per cent of funding must be allocated for test runs.</P>
    <P>Young people are full of enthusiasm and ideas.  However, they lack capital and financial institutions are reluctant to fund their proposals.  Therefore, it is important that the national station support their creativity.  I welcome the proposals regarding the accountability of the Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years those involved in commercial film-making have given this country a good name because of the quality and content of their work. Commercial production for cinema requires substantial funding.  We have a core of young talented independent film makers who are restricted in their work. The measures contained in this subsection will benefit these people.  I ask the Minister how these measures will affect in-house development and programming in RTE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sherlock asked a question which I may not have adequately answered.  I do not see creativity being moved outside RTE.  In my discussions with RTE I have said, and I believe they support this suggestion, that I would like to see an equal development section in RTE to allow young people in the station come forward with new ideas for programmes and that this would merge with the creative process which will exist in the independent film-making community. Therefore, creativity is neither inside nor outside and structures that match and merge with each other may evolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must keep our nerve in this regard. I have taken a risk by staking so much on my belief for the future of the film industry.  This section provides seed money but I am happy to release the capacity of film makers.  This product is creative, cerebral and with low transport costs.  It eliminates the problem of peripherality which affects the Irish economy and turns disadvantages into advantages.  Some of the most exciting film concepts are coming from peripheral parts of Europe and elsewhere.  I intend <Col N="145" /> to move a considerable amount of this activity into a European framework and build and support it in terms of training. Young film makers need a launching pad.</P>
    <P>As a former Member of this House I was aware of the limited information available to Senators.  Therefore, I will answer any questions which Senators ask. I have attended meetings of the Council of Culture Ministers and I realise the kind of view I am developing is consistent with developments elsewhere.  I also realise that culture was neglected in the founding treaties of Europe and was barely acknowledged in the Maastricht Treaty, although it has come to be recognised now.  When we look at televisual activity, approximately 80 per cent of hardware is sourced in Japan, while approximately 70 per cent of software &mdash; the &ldquo;Soaps&rdquo;&mdash; is sourced in North America.  There are great opportunities and challenges for Europe in this regard.  The European cultural space must be diverse and culturally pluralist.  I hope the assistance I am giving to the film making community both inside and outside will enable Ireland to be vigorous in making a real contribution to the new European cultural area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been helpful in allowing us to elicit facts from him and this is consistent with his own attitude when he was a Member of this House. He was adept at extracting information from Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on an issue raised by Senator Sherlock.  The Minister has told us what he hopes to do and I accept that he is sincere about this matter. However, I am concerned about how the commissioning of these productions will work.  I fully understand what he wants when he talks about creativity and independent film production.  I am slightly worried that the Bill says the Authority shall have a commissioning role.  It looks as though the Authority is commissioning in the independent sector and, obviously, internally as it has authority in both areas.  There is not necessarily a conflict of interest but there might be.  The Authority itself is not going to commission the <Col N="146" /> persons who are making these productions. Could the Minister tell us if there is going to be a layer, a subcommittee or independent committee below the Authority to decide which independent producers will benefit from this money and what the method and basis of their appointment will be?  I would feel uneasy if the Authority itself, or even any individuals or committee delegated this power by the Authority, made decisions both internally and externally. Could the Minister tell us to whom the making of such decisions will be delegated by the Authority?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I deal with some of these issues in section 5.  There were a number of norms which I wanted to address.  As I said already, I wanted to ensure excellence and respect basic legislation and the integrity of RTE.  I have to respect RTE's editorial function.  The second thing in which I was very interested was the definition of &ldquo;independent producer.&rdquo;  I define it in the Bill and took very great care in doing so. People feel this definition has gone quite far when compared with corresponding European legislation.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have introduced a legal requirement which obliges the Authority to publish the effects of its decisions.  Not only must it produce a report every year but I have imposed a time limit by which it must be published.  I will not rubber-stamp this report but will bring it before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Beyond that I have stated that I am going to review the procedures and how they work.  If the Authority were not working with appropriate distance or if questions were asked about a preponderance of theme, these issues would surface in the very first year and it would be open to any Member of the Oireachtas to raise these matters and they would have an opportunity every year to do so. Also, when I undertake the review, they will be entitled to ask me about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important, when one is making the kind of changes I am making, to have trust.  I do have trust; the RTE Authority, the Independent Radio and Television <Col N="147" /> Commission, the independent sector and I will have to trust each other.  When I come to the major legislative changes they may direct more than trust at me in the initial stages.  I am willing to trust the Authority to initiate the procedures for commissioning and I am not going to interfere at the beginning.  Let us see how it will work within the framework I have given it.  I take the point the Senator is making and I assure the House that if the procedures are not working I will put more formal procedures in place to deal with any deficiency in the short term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point but think he should note that there is a danger that the prejudices of the Authority will be felt on both sides of the divide, on the independent and internal sides.  That is a danger which we will have to watch for in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see any implications for jobs within RTE? He stated that in the area of programming there would be liaison between RTE and the independent sector.  How will this come about? Section 1 (2) imposes a legal obligation on RTE to pay at least 25 per cent of the cost of the making of any independent television programme commissioned by it.  There is a danger that RTE will become a transmitting and commissioning agency because another sector is now guaranteed funding.  I therefore ask the Minister if he sees any implications for jobs within RTE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are anticipating matters a little.  When I met the RTE trade unions, and other people prior to that, I considered the question of jobs. When we come to look at it the Senator will see that in section 4 (7) (a) I went so far as to say that part of my review would be occasioned by a consideration of what was happening in relation to jobs.  When we come to that section he will find that his concern has been not only implicitly but explicitly recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister's views on the amount of daily time that should be fixed by the Authority for advertisements.  I feel slighly uneasy, as I made clear in my speech on Second Stage, about the powers over RTE given to Ministers in general.  We have two authorities in the area of advertising time, one is the Authority itself and the second is the Minister who has to approve the time.  As the Minister knows, the Authority is a politically appointed one. The Minister is also a political person. I feel slightly uneasy that something as important as the advertising and broadcasting times should be decided by politicians or people appointed by them. Advertising is a very important aspect of RTE's income and administration.  If politicians can control the amount of time that RTE devotes to advertisements and can, therefore, also control its income, it gives not only the Authority but also the Minister, who can give his approval or disapproval to it, an extraordinary power over the workings of RTE.  In the case of this Minister I would not find it in the least difficult but in the case of some of his predecessors I would have found the principle a little difficult to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>All that section 2 does is to restore the pre-1990 situation.  Again I remind the House that what I have done here is to create an atmosphere of calm in which we can move back to the previous position and then assess what is appropriate for the general review legislation. That is all I have done, no more and no less.  When I come to the general review of the legislation I intend to look at the most appropriate structures and I am looking at structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is too often said that politicians have an inclination to interfere in broadcasting. I wish to make it clear that is not my inclination.  I know the Senator would <Col N="149" /> wish to disassociate himself from the scurrilous suggestion in a recent newspaper that I had abused my position as Minister with responsibility for broadcasting. I certainly do not think like that and members of the political community, by and large, do not think like that.  All I have done is to restore the pre-1990 situation.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Senator asked me to make sure RTE did not abuse its monopoly position in relation to advertising, this being the basic framework of his thinking.  The Senator should bear in mind that I need ministerial power to make sure that RTE's powers are not abused.  As legislators we must give a lead.  If we place our trust in democracy we erode it by imagining that elected people are necessarily morally weaker than other members of the public. Elected representatives are accountable to these Houses and to the public.  The people who have abused power in Irish society, by and large, have been accountable to neither.  Those who influence the media but who are not accountable to the public have a power more sinister than any I might have as Minister.  This modest section simply restores the pre-1990 conditions to establish an atmosphere for the most thorough review possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>If after this Bill RTE returns to pre-1990 times for advertising, it will be broadcasting 50 per cent only of the EC permitted limit.  That is responsible action compared to the amount of advertising broadcast on other channels seen in this island.  RTE radio advertising if restored to pre-1990 rates will take up only 50 per cent of the time granted to independent radio.  Returning to the previous arrangements will give an extremely modest amount of time to advertising. RTE is a high quality station because it does not interrupt its programmes every five to seven minutes as happens on some of the channels paid for monthly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The pre-1990 position is being continually cited but that does not mean it was necessarily utopian or right.  I accept the Minister's promise to examine <Col N="150" /> those arrangements also.  Because the 1990 Act was so appalling we might fall into the trap of reverting to the prior system and assuming everything would then be fine.  The pre-1990 position was not acceptable.  However, I accept the Minister's assurance that he will look at the entire broadcasting sector so I am happy with the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will clarify that point and I am grateful to the Senator for raising it.  When I say I am returning to the pre-1990 arrangements I am talking about powers but not necessarily the same regime of hourly proportions of advertising.  I will watch and review that and take reservations expressed in both Houses into consideration.</P>

      <P>Section 3 is the core element of the Bill.  I expect RTE will acquire some additional income.  I must not interfere in an autonomous body. From my experience of the commercial, economic and financial worlds, although it is not as sophisticated as the Senator's&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect advertising rates to drop making it possible for more people to advertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point distressed me in the 1990 Bill.  Many projects such as the Vanburgh String Quartet and the Chamber Choir had to be quickly dropped by RTE because they could no longer be sustained. It is to the great credit of RTE that in anticipation of this legislation <Col N="151" /> these projects have been revived.  That is centrally important to broadcasting. Therefore the Bill will not only create a better environment for RTE but may also enable it to restore some of the ancillary activities it had to end because of section 3 of the 1990 Act.  It will also allow RTE to foster a process of renewal and creativity in the station.</P>
    <P>I think the total of extra money involved will be quite small.  Advertising rates will go down so the only way for the income to significantly increase is if the volume rises.  However, the volume of advertising that can be carried is restricted. I believe the Bill will create a real rather than a distorted environment.</P>
    <P>There are always rumours about broadcasting.  I place great confidence in RTE in a number of ways.  It plays an important role while I prepare to put my proposals for Teilifís na Gaeilge into operation.  If RTE is to be able to cooperate in new worthwhile extended ventures it must be economically healthy. However I do not see RTE receiving a windfall as a result of the removal of the cap.  Logically, rates will drop so additional income could be modest.</P>

      <P>As we heard yesterday the imposition of the cap affected small businesses more than any other sector. This was the experience of many people I know.  It would be welcome to hear of a rates system suitable for small manufacturing companies especially who should be enabled to compete with multinational companies producing similar products.  I welcome this provision and I hope the extra advertising space will be taken up by smaller home-based producers. It is vital RTE give them the opportunity to market their wares and perhaps create extra employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>One must look at the effect of the section.  Repealing section 3 of the 1990 Act means the advertising revenue cap imposed will be lifted.  The cap limited RTE's annual revenue from advertising to an amount equivalent to funds received from the licence fee or <Col N="152" /> something to that effect.  At that time RTE increased its advertising charges.  It can now reduce them which will obviously affect advertising on local radio.  Does the Minister see implications for local stations who benefited from increased advertising rates in RTE?  Has consideration been given to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an appropriate time for Senator Sherlock to mention local radio.  It is possible that rates will go down as the Minister has said.  Perhaps he could give solutions to the problems this will present for local radio.  He knows these problems will only be compounded if RTE's advertising rates are reduced because local stations in order to compete will have to reduce their rates and their losses will therefore be greater.  I know the Minister is conscious of this problem and intends to address it.  Could he give some idea of his commitment, if any, to local radio and what he intends doing about the immediate commercial difficulties such stations are likely to encounter because of the fall in advertising rates in RTE?</P>
      <P>It is possible that rates will not be reduced.  A huge amount of possible advertising could not be included for broadcast by RTE during the period of the cap.  Rates may remain the same; the issue is an imponderable.  If rates do go down, has the Minister immediate plans for local radio or will that sector have to await the next Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points. First, let us be clear how the problem arose.  I ask Senators to draw a distinction between television and radio.  Sometimes an assumption is made, which I warned about in 1990, which goes as follows: people assume there is an automatic, easy migration from advertising in the print media to radio and television.  They are distinct and separate.  The idea that it is to the advantage of newspapers to limit the amount of time available for advertisements on television has proved to be nonsense.  What happened when the advertising cap was imposed on RTE was that as the cost of television advertising <Col N="153" /> increased people had less left in their advertising budget for print advertising. A body that could hardly be called subversive, radical or revolutionary, IBEC, clearly makes this point.  If less time is available, and the rate card system, where time is auctioned to the highest bidder, is in use, this drives rates up, and drives certain companies out of the market altogether.  Changes in the amount of time allotted to advertising will have some effect on the rates paid.</P>
      <P>I have given repeated assurances about local radio.  One of the reasons I am retaining the bar is, I have said, that I am not automatically returning to the pre-1990 regime in relation to rates and times on radio.  I will examine the situation as it develops, and I will not allow predatory activity that would damage local radio.  I wanted to explain clearly the effect of the Bill on local radio.  Perhaps it will end at this stage.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is thought I am not sensitive enough to the issues of local radio.  I met with representatives of local radio for over two hours, which was the longest meeting I have had with any group on this issue, followed by several technical meetings between them and nominated people from my staff.  We were not simply responding to their demands.  I made proposals to them.  I identified many of the major cost areas.  I know the cost areas and have worked on proposals about how it might be helped.</P>
      <P>Some representatives of local radio said that all their problems would end if they had a share of the licence fee.  Others asked me whether I intended giving a share of the licence fee to local radio stations, irrespective of their standard of broadcasting.  Gradually we began to assemble information.  I had meetings with the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  I wish the development part of the 1988 legislation had been used more, as stations that were given licences would have been given better support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local radio stations fall into different categories.  A small group are breaking even.  Another group are in difficulties and seeking merger.  A third group are in difficulties and resisting merger.  This <Col N="154" /> issue can only be resolved by taking into account the profile of costs and the stations, their capital investment, and the competition they face.  The highest costs are those incurred in relation to transmission, news gathering and training, among others.  I am open to discussion on each of these areas, but when I seem to be making progress, discussions seem to stop and the megaphone tactics start again.  I am again asked whether I am prepared to give a share of the licence fee to local radio stations.  I have been very calm about it so far.  The word &ldquo;community&rdquo; has become very important but the community fared worst under the 1988 legislation.  I will examine that too.</P>
    <P>These people wanted me to address all of their issues.  To do that I had to assemble information, and it was not easy.  To help somebody who is in difficulties, it is necessary to know what are the difficulties.  I am trying to get it right once and for all, and this is the way to do it.  I will address this problem in a review of legislation.  I may look, for example, at the appropriate authority to look after local and community radio, but that does not mean that I am not working on other aspects of the problem.  I have listed these aspects this morning.  I have listed the meetings, the topics, the proposals, and so on.</P>
    <P>I know people are in difficulties financially. If I were a different kind of Minister I would adopt the attitude of people in other parties, that of <i>caveat emptor</i>, that I did not drive anyone into local radio, that they went in knowing the legislation and conditions in place at the time.  I could have washed my hands of the situation but I am not doing that. Many stations which began with one conception of local radio, performing a very valuable community service, carrying news, have been pushed by their listeners in the direction of the old concept of public service broadcasting.  I want to help them, as much as I also regard local newspapers as part of the local communicative order.</P>
    <P>Another issue on which I hope Deputies and Senators will support me when we come to it, is that if conditions <Col N="155" /> of employment are satisfactory in local newspapers, must I not look at the conditions of employment and the procedures in local radio as well?  That is how I am approaching this issue, searching for ways to be of assistance, and using the talks and discussions I have with representatives to identify the most effective ways of coming to their assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed the section at length.  I ask the Senator to be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Leas-Chathaoirleach's haste but we have not yet touched on section 3 (2).  I accept what the Minister says about local radio. It is a serious difficulty for everybody, I do not know the answer to this problem, and it is the fundamental problem in our attitude to public sector broadcasting.  It begs the question whether stations have a public sector broadcasting element at all, whether we should have public sector broadcasting at all in this country.  I understand the Minister's difficulty.  I was simply asking for some indication of his thinking on this vital issue.  I do not know the answer, I do not know what I would do in the Minister's position and I sympathise with him on his difficulties on this issue.  There are ideological and there are also tangible difficulties here.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) is obviously a retrospective piece of legislation, I presume this is to do with the fact that RTE exceeded the amount of revenue it was allowed on 1 September 1992.  I presume the money is being taken into the coffers of the Exchequer.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if I give succinct information immediately it will make our progress easier.  The reason for this subsection is that had section 3 of the Act of 1990 not been repealed, RTE would have exceeded the cap for the second year and would then be breaking the law.  That is why the date mentioned is 1 September.  The figure accumulated <Col N="156" /> was £17.9 million.  Again, I am anticipating discussion.  If Members were in that business, I do not think they would have turned the business away and sent the customers, the accounts and the advertising, with the jobs attached to both, out of Ireland altogether.  The £17.9 million is there and there is an explicit reference to one usage for it in the Programme for a Partnership Government. The joint programme states that the initial costs of Teilifís na Gaeilge will be met out of the accumulated surpluses under the cap.</P>
      <P>The inter-party agreement which is the basis of the present Government transcends me and other Ministers and Departments, including the Department of Finance.  The Programme for a Partnership Government is democratic and agreed and parties to it are accountable. The explicit commitment given in it is sacrosanct.  How much could and should the Minister with responsibility, in this case myself, use of that money in the current year?  In discussions the Department of Finance and others have suggested that I use £4.5 million this year, should I need it.</P>
      <P>That £4.5 million is available for the current year's needs for Teilifís na Gaeilge and the balance has been paid into the Exchequer.  I would point out that the Programme for a Partnership Government involves a Government commitment, transcending my views and anyone else's, that the balance will be available for the further needs of Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Obviously, our public administration works within one financial year at a time. Those of us who are fortunate, or unfortunate, enough to stand before the public for election are required to have political visions that extend for longer.  I have a function to defend the Government programme and will do so.  If my needs for Teilifís na Gaeilge are £4.5 million in the current year I will spend that amount &mdash; as far as I can see it is sufficient.  I will obviously come back and draw down the balance of money which has been paid into the Exchequer should I need it next year.</P>

      <Col N="157" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection 2 (b), lines 22 and 23, to delete &ldquo;unless it is impracticable to do so&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;provided the preceding year's annual accounts are not in deficit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am startled by the large sums to be allocated on a progressive basis to independent producers.  These are substantial even in terms of RTE's current profits: £5 million next year; £6.5 million the year after; £7.5 million in 1996; £8.5 million in 1997; £10 million in 1998; and £12.5 million or 20 per cent of RTE's expenditure in the following years.</P>
      <P>This is an extremely long term commitment which should be subject to serious review.  It is such a large amount of money there is a danger that compelling RTE to pay these sums in all circumstances would be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to what the Bill says.  Section 4 (2) (b) reads and I quote &ldquo;unless it is impracticable to do so&rdquo; in the financial year.  That is inexact and imprecise.  It does not say who is going to define &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo; or who will decide what is impracticable or how it relates to the financial state of RTE.  If RTE were unable to write a cheque for that amount it would be impracticable, but that is unthinkable.  If RTE is not in profit one year but expects to be the next can it thereby afford to pay the amount?  Will RTE be pressured to do so by the Minister of 1998 in spite of the state of its balance sheet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see a simple commitment in this Bill that these extremely large payments &mdash; and we are talking about £12.5 million or more in the years from 1999 onwards &mdash; will not be paid if RTE cannot afford to pay them.  There is only one possible rule one can make in legislation to cover RTE's not being able to pay and that is not to compel payment <Col N="158" /> when it is in deficit and has made a loss in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Impracticable&rdquo; means absolutely nothing and is a form of blanket statement which will lead to serious difficulties in the years to come when somebody, be they the Minister, the Authority or the RTE director of finance, has to decide whether it is impracticable to pay the amount.  There could be a collision between the director of finance's opinion that it was impracticable and the Authority's and the Minister's claims that it was practicable.  It would then be paid even though RTE might not be making enough money to pay these vast sums.</P>
    <P>I put down this amendment because, I believe it would be irresponsible for RTE to pay this money if it has to get into financial difficulties to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me point out again that the purpose of section 4 was simply to introduce a regime of opportunity for independent producers.  We can get matters askew if we did not follow them through to the logical end.  I am not taking money from RTE for something else; that would be like going into a shop that sells seed potatoes and insisting on buying millinery.  This is not the case as RTE will be spending money on programmes in any event.  We are simply saying that for certain good reasons there will be a balance in the expenditure on programmes.</P>
      <P>RTE will have no difficulty paying £5 million.  I will not damage RTE by giving detailed figures, but from my discussions with RTE I believe even its most conservative people would say it is already spending over £3 million on independently produced programmes.  There are others, myself included, who believe it is spending more than £4 million.  In any event, spending £5 million will not create any trauma for RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When considering the figure of £12.5 million or 20 per cent of RTE's expenditure it was necessary for me to look at how such a large demand might impact on the station itself.  That is why I included the requirements, including the review, which address the matter raised <Col N="159" /> earlier by Senator Sherlock, the potential employment effect on RTE itself.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo;, is I believe, after consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, the best word one could find.  One could throw veils of casuistry around it by saying wholly and totally impracticable but one would end up with a litany.  The point is simply that if the entire procedure is going wrong RTE have an opportunity to tell me.  I will be relying on the wisdom of my peers in the Oireachtas when my review comes out each year &mdash; and I am putting the obligation on myself to review the matter not later than a certain date.</P>
    <P>The point had been reached when the number of shoots in any month for new products had dropped.  Activity in one of the most creative and wonderful areas of job creation, film making in Ireland in the independent sector, had first frozen and was then beginning to drop.  This was happening at a time when we were providing courses on film making in our colleges and people were winning prizes. As an example of the value of the independent sector, a young man, Mr. Charlton, entered his documentary, &ldquo;Blood on the Canvas&rdquo;, at a festival in Houston recently.  There were 4,200 entries and his entry won the gold medal. That film was made and finished at Telegael near Spiddal.  The opportunity is being provided to allow this creative capacity a small platform from which to launch and create even more jobs through a realisation of that potential.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement on this, even if some Members voted against the Bill at different times.  That, I believe, is a good thing, but how to make it happen? The review handles that.  I will consider submissions.  The Bill imposes obligations and creates responsibilities.  The Bill clearly establishes the responsibilities of the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be complimented on introducing this Bill so soon after his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> I welcome the opportunity afforded in this legislation to the independent programme makers and programme producers. As the Minister confirmed, their numbers were decimated following the 1990 Act and the industry was set back many years.  The figures provided illustrate the decline.  For example, the number of television commercials made in Ireland fell from 147 in 1991 to 75 in 1992.</P>
    <P>The legislation will create competition among the employees of RTE and will provide an extra incentive to improve the already high standard of their own programme making.  The opportunity is now afforded to former RTE employees who took redundancy to use their expertise to co-operate in the production of quality programmes.  An outstanding example was the recent Eurovision Song Contest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is difficult to accept.  I find the language in section 4 (2) (b), &ldquo;... unless it is impracticable to do so, ...&rdquo; too subjective, vague and open to interpretation.</P>
      <P>A situation could arise at some future date where there is a serious dispute about what this legislation means, with differing interpretations from the Minister of the day, the RTE Authority and other people in RTE.  If the legislation is specific about amounts of money, then it is wrong that we should be vague as to the state RTE's finances should be.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that this legislation takes that into account.  A situation could arise where RTE's balance sheet and a profit and loss account were in difficulties, and yet the company was obliged to pay these large amounts of money.  It is not acceptable to counter this with the words &ldquo;unless it is impracticable to do so&rdquo; as that could be open to differing interpretations in the future.</P>

      <P>May I engage in a straightforward manner with the language issue raised by Senator Ross?  His amendment would not achieve what he described today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his amendment the Senator suggests deleting &ldquo;unless it is impracticable to do <Col N="161" /> so&rdquo;.  I have outlined the reasons for the use of these words and I have specified them in the legislation.  I have offered a review and have said I am open to changes and will involve Members of the Oireachtas.  Yet this is what the Senator proposes to abolish, replacing it with &ldquo;provided the preceding year's annual accounts are not in deficit&rdquo;.  The Senator is requesting me to forsake the accountability I have given to the House, the review and the specified conditions for a review, for an accountancy procedure.</P>
    <P>In my early days I had a brief relationship with the accountancy profession. With respect to the profession, I am not satisfied that, first, the amendment will achieve what the Senator wants; secondly, <Col N="162" /> it would have a damaging effect on what I have just described by way of a genuine and proper review; and, thirdly, it would remove accountability and not just from the Minister and RTE. The proposed amendment would frustrate the intention of section 4, including the proposals on film making and so on. All of this could be wiped out by the simple expedient of putting the accounts into deficit.  The Minister would then be faced with the possibility of having to challenge the accounts in court.  This is an impracticable amendment which I must oppose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the principle of fostering independent programming by the sector.  I am concerned that the provisions of the Bill are rigid and inflexible with regard to the amount of money to be provided as far as RTE's obligations are concerned.  I voted against the amendment which was put forward because it is better to say &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo; than to say &ldquo;not in deficit&rdquo;.  A fund need not necessarily be in deficit, but it could be marginal.  In these circumstances it would be reasonable to have flexibility.  I am satisfied with the flexibility that is provided.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what he means by independent television programmes.  I know there is a definition in the Bill but it is intended that this money should go to Irish television programmes and Irish productions. However, the Minister cannot do this because of EC regulations.  The intention and the rules are in conflict.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us how the authorities will make a decision to grant this money to Irish producers, without infringing EC rules.  In other words, will we advertise for tenders in the local newspapers?  How will we ensure that this money stays in the country and that it benefits Irish producers and programmes?</P>
      <P>Difficulties will exist because Irish producers and programmes must stand on their own merit and face competition from programmes and producers from abroad.  How will the people who decide who will benefit from the commissions the Minister is talking about ensure that the commissions stay in this country, because they are awarding these commissions on merit?  Will they have to award several of these programmes to overseas film producers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can be explicit in my reply.  First, the Bill is careful not to breach European law.  The European Community Directive No. 89/552/EC on television broadcasting activities is the directive which applies.  That point is correctly adverted to by Senator Ross and by myself and it is acknowledged in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is not talking about the production of a commodity which is general or homogenous. We are not talking about putting proportions or quotas into intervention.  We are talking about a television product which must aim for excellence when the editorial decision is made by the Authority.  Therefore, it is only reasonable to expect that the people who are working in that world of symbols and creativity which is in that local community will be more sensitive to the nature of the product and will, therefore, have some advantages.  What they cannot <Col N="164" /> be given are unfair competitive advantages. I give an example of a Dutch film crew coming to Ireland to make a programme which would be appropriate for Irish editorial use.</P>
    <P>There is no intention in this Bill to break European law or the directive I mentioned earlier.  It is only fair to expect that there will be real advantages for the native industry but we will have an opportunity to review this.  That is the great advantage of publishing the annual list of commissions.  There is nothing in this Bill which breaches European law or which would put RTE's practices into conflict.  The environment in which these initiatives are being taken will allow the Irish industry to take advantage of new opportunities.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross should look at the three reports which have been published on the structure of the film industry; for example, the Coopers and Lybrand report and the working group on film which reported to the Taoiseach at the end of last year.  This group's report was sent to me in January and I recently published it.  These indicate there is scope for the Irish industry to take advantage of these new and exciting opportunities which are being provided.</P>

      <P>I worry when I see references to &ldquo;the account&rdquo;.  Will the Minister tell us what procedures there will be for monitoring expenditure on auditing the accounts?  Will there be accountability to this House in respect of the account?  I am concerned about this matter because of the cases of non-accountability in the semi-State sector; Aer Lingus is a recent example.  There are great difficulties in that company and millions of pounds have not been accounted for.  I would not like a similar situation to arise in RTE and I ask the Minister to give us details as to how that will be closely monitored.  The motivation behind this section is good.  It is commendable that three would be independent, talented people who, although not in RTE, will have the opportunity to make programmes and have them broadcast on RTE.  However, I would like to <Col N="165" /> know how the Department intends to take care of the accountability aspect.</P>

      <P>The answers to the Senator's questions are explicitly set out in section 6 of the Bill.  The suggestion, for example, to open a separate account for independent commissioned productions was mine.  I specified that so as to identify it within the totality of the accounting system of RTE.  I went further and specified the procedures in section 6 and I required the publication of such within three months of the end of a financial year.  That is explicit.  These particular provisions I am making within general accounting procedures in RTE will fall within the normal auditing by the RTE authorities of their accounts.  In other words, section 25 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 regarding the auditing function also applies, so there is both a general and an additional specific set of mechanisms which are specified in section 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says and we have legislation for other semi-State organisations that also deals specifically with annual reports.  As the Minister says we are talking about quarterly reports in this case.  I want a more detailed explanation as to what impact the Department will have in perusing the accounts directly and what accountability there will be to the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 deals with that but I will add that one must remember that &mdash; and I am surprised that Senator Taylor-Quinn has not adverted to it &mdash; that an annual report on all matters has been commissioned and not only regarding independent commissioning.  I have taken the unusual, but proper step of deciding that changes will be made by orders that are laid before both Houses and that is additional to normal practice. That condition of transparency is specified in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister does not appreciate what I mean.  I <Col N="166" /> am concerned because with other semi-State bodies there is great difficulty at present with regard to their accountability. My concern springs from the difficulties that have arisen with other bodies.  I appreciate what the Minister is doing but I am concerned about accountability in the semi-State sector.  I will depend on the Minister to ensure the same situation will not arise in RTE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should not have to depend on me; she may depend on my legislation where requirements for accountability are specifically laid out and I understand her concern with maximum accountability.  There are other innovations in the Bill.  For example, I have taken a lead in specifying the gender equality requirement of the RTE Authority when I could have waited.  I have expressed this wish to every board for which I have responsibility. I have exceeded the gender equality requirement and the gender ratio that is specified in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The Film Board which I will be addressing later today at its first meeting has seven people on its board, four of whom are women. In this Bill, with regard to the RTE Authority, where the authority is composed of seven people, three should be men and three should be women and where it is composed of nine people there should be four men and four women.  I tried to put as much into the Bill by way of information on the implementation of gender equality as I could.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister on what basis the figures for expenditure are worked out.  I am referring to the £5 million increasing to £12.5 million over the years.  I understand it is a fairly logical progression although it goes up steeply.  I assume the base of £5 million for 1994 is based on the projected expenditure on total television programmes and that the Minister is working upward from that base figure.  These are large figures, a point we have already debated. I would like it confirmed that £5 million, which is the base figure, is based on 20 <Col N="167" /> per cent total television programme expenditure as projected for next year on RTE.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is good at this and I appreciate his great attention to detail on this Bill.  The 20 per cent comes into effect after 1998.  The base figure from which we depart to achieve this significant contribution was arrived at on the basis of consultations regarding what I knew RTE was spending already and what I knew of products that might come on offer, and I arrived at that figure which is not perceived as an unreasonable imposition by RTE.  There is a progressive rise from that figure towards £12.5 million or 20 per cent.  In the interim I will review it as I have specified, not later than three months after the end of the financial year.  The base figure came from existing practice and consultations. The Senator is correct about the progression.  It is reasonable but in the interim, for example, as we come to the latter years if anything is going wrong not only I, but the Houses, have an opportunity to review it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the industry will grow fast enough to be able to pay the 20 per cent.  The Minister is specifying 20 per cent to give the industry a target to achieve and if they do not achieve it then the review clause is there.  It is wise and shows the Minister's knowledge of the industry.  If I had to put a percentage on it I would say the industry would definitely supply 15 per cent at present, but I think the 20 per cent target encourages the industry to grow over the five year period so as to achieve the 20 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am not quite clear, and there is no reason why the Minister should have this information at his fingertips, whether £5 million represents 20 per cent of total television expenditure next year.  I want to know whether these figures anticipate a substantial growth in this expenditure by the year 1999.  In other words is a larger proportion of RTE's television <Col N="168" /> programme expenditure going to be paid in 1999 than is being paid next year and, therefore, is the Minister anticipating a large growth in this area?</P>

      <P>I too am very pleased that the Minister is hoping to increase the gender balance to 50 per cent.  The RTE Authority has a high gender balance at present &mdash; one-third of its members are women.  I hope people will not be appointed to the Authority for the sake of gender balance because people with expertise, whether male or female, should be appointed on merit.  While balance is being addressed, the quality and expertise of the particular individual, whether male or female, should be the most important factor.  I welcome the aspiration for 50 per cent representation for women.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to the Members for their welcome for this <Col N="169" /> section and I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Cassidy.  As the section is acceptable and welcomed, I need not elaborate on it.  The choice facing me was to wait for general legislation in relation to gender equality or to go ahead and introduce it if the opportunity arose, and that is what I decided to do.  I take the points raised and when I come to appoint the Authority I will be looking for one that will be representative and able to handle the new régime of broadcasting which I hope to have in place at that time.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that women's experience will be taken into account.  I am very impressed by the number of technical grades in RTE which are now being filled by women.  In Millstreet the first woman to direct the Eurovision Song Contest was Anita Notaro and she was assisted by five other women.  Perhaps a video should have been made to show to every girl in this country that there is no skill at any level in this industry that cannot be performed with excellence by a woman. Women's experience has been excluded too much in Irish society and in administrative decision making.  I wanted it to be there in the Authority.  When I look at other bodies for which I have responsibility &mdash; such as the Independent Radio and Television Commission to which I have appointed a woman to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of a woman &mdash; I will follow the same principles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to introduce this Bill to the Seanad.  This House has taken considerable interest in preventive measures to contain the spread of AIDS since the recognition of the virus as a specific entity.  There has been a number of motions on the topic the most recent of which was on 5 May this year when a motion put down by Senators Norris, Henry and O'Toole was debated.  During that constructive and balanced debate the need for effective preventative programmes was stressed time and again. Speakers emphasised the necessity for a media campaign which would provide clear information for all sections of the community on how to avoid infection. They also expressed support for making condoms more easily available and for an expansion of the free needle exchange programme.</P>
      <P>In the course of my colleague, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy O'Dea's response to that debate, he outlined my commitment to developing an AIDS strategy which would be responsive to our needs.  He set out the preventative programmes which were in place and outlined upcoming developments, including a multi-media campaign on HIV prevention which I have recently launched, and the developments in the risk reduction services in the drug abuse area.  He also informed the House of the Government's decision to amend the Health (Family Planning) Acts to liberalise the availability of condoms and of my proposal to bring a new Bill in that regard before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Senators are, of course, aware that all Stage of this Bill passed in the Dáil on 3 June following an incisive, interesting and constructive debate which was massively supportive of the proposed changes in the existing legislation.  I am pleased, therefore, to commend this Bill to an Seanad and I am glad of the opportunity to remind the House of the reasons the Bill is before it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two main elements for an effective programme to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus are proper and non-moralistic programmes of education directed <Col N="171" /> at the various sections of the community and legislation to remove the restrictions on the purchase of condoms.  On 24 May I launched the new AIDS media campaign which deals in a clear, unambiguous fashion with the role of the condom in preventing HIV.  This campaign is directed at all sexually active people.  It is complemented by other measures aimed at various groups within the community, such as drug abusers.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is clear in its content and its intent.  It provides for greater access to condoms at a time when there is clear evidence that they are an effective barrier against the spread of HIV.  I am very pleased, therefore, to bring the legislation before the Seanad.  It demonstrates both my commitment and that of the Government to rationalise family planning legislation initially in so far as this is required for public health reasons but ultimately in regard to all family planning issues.  I propose to look at the broader issue of family planning as part of an overall strategy for health which is currently being developed in the Department of Health and which I hope to have completed before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>As my Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, outlined on 5 May, the Bill is necessary for public health reasons as it is a means of tackling the problems of HIV/AIDS, and indeed, other diseases which are sexually transmitted.  In Ireland, we have an increasing number of persons who are testing positive for HIV.  To date, a total of 1,375 persons have tested positive and it is accepted that this figure understates the true situation.</P>
    <P>We extended the HIV surveillance programme in October 1992 to include the analysis of blood, on an anonymous, unlinked basis, which is taken at antenatal clinics for routine clinical purposes and which is surplus to requirements.  We propose to extend the programme, on a phased basis, to include blood taken at STD clinics and hospital in-patient and out-patient clinics in an effort to develop as comprehensive a picture as possible of the prevalence and spread of the infection <Col N="172" /> in Ireland.  I am not satisfied that the current data available gives me that comprehensive picture.</P>
    <P>Our current data base indicates that the infection is largely present in certain groups of the population &mdash; intravenous drug users, homosexuals, haemophiliacs and, to a lesser extent, in heterosexuals. In the latter, there is a steady presence of new HIV positive cases.  There is no cure for AIDS.  We must make a concentrated effort, therefore, to ensure that those who are not infected remain so and to ensure that those who have contracted the virus do not transmit it to others.</P>
    <P>People generally are now aware that the main routes of transmission are through sexual intercourse or through sharing needles while abusing intravenous drugs.  Even though they are aware of these facts many, nonetheless, continue to put themselves at risk of exposure to the virus.  We must encourage these people to behave in ways which will reduce or eliminate this risk.  We know that the surest way of avoiding sexually transmitted HIV infection is by being faithful to one person who is also faithful to you, assuming that neither person has shared needles while injecting drugs.  However, there are sexually active people who do not adhere to these guidelines for behaviour and they must be encouraged to behave responsibly.  Our National AIDS Strategy places a strong emphasis on primary and secondary prevention.</P>
    <P>Our primary prevention programmes are designed to prevent persons from becoming infected in the first place and education and information are key components in HIV/AIDS primary prevention programmes.  So, too, is easy access to condoms.</P>
    <P>Our secondary prevention programmes are aimed at preventing the transmission from an infected person to persons who are not infected and this is implemented through risk-reduction services, such as Outreach, methadone availability, needle exchange, condoms and counselling.  In programmes to prevent HIV, and other sexually transmissible <Col N="173" /> diseases, it is recognised and accepted that a good quality condom, properly used, is the most effective prophylactic against these diseases.  It is essential, therefore, that people be aware of the role of condoms as an effective prophylactic and that sexually active persons are not discouraged from using them by restrictions placed on their availability.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill, therefore, is to provide for improved access to condoms, as a necessary and practical response to the evolving HIV/AIDS problem here.  The Bill implements the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, which called for the supply of condoms through vending machines.  It also bring us into line with public mores and thinking in Ireland and with the situation in other EC member states, where condoms are supplied through vending machines.  I would point out to the Senators that the most recent survey of public opinion on this matter in the <i>Sunday Press</i> a fortnight ago showed a huge majority in favour of this legislation and this is heartening to note.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the amendment of the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979, which is the Principal Act, and for the amendment of the Health (Family Planning) Amendment Act, 1992, as follows: (i) the removal of controls over the supply of condoms; (ii) the exclusion of condoms from the definition of contraceptive; and (iii) the provision of enabling powers to the Minister for Health to regulate the location of vending machines for condoms and to prescribe standards for them.  I am also taking the opportunity, in the Bill, to remove the licensing requirements to import and manufacture other contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill defines &ldquo;contraceptive sheath&rdquo; to include condoms for men and women.  Senators will recall that the position under the legislation of the female condom was raised by me during the Oireachtas debates last year. I have included the female condom in the definition of &ldquo;contraceptive sheath&rdquo; under section 2 of this Bill to ensure that it is excluded from the legal controls. <Col N="174" /> Section 2 amends the definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; to exclude condoms, thereby removing the controls over their sale and supply altogether.</P>
    <P>As a result of the exclusion of condoms from the definition of contraceptive under section 2, I am proposing, in section 8 of the Bill, to repeal sections 5 and 6 of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1992.  These are necessary and consequential on the proposed new definition.  The effect of this will be to remove the controls in section 5 of the 1992 Act, which prohibited the sale or supply of condoms to persons aged under 17 years, or from certain outlets, such as vending machines, mobile outlets or street vendors.  It will also remove the controls contained in section 6 of the Act relating to the age limit of 17 years of persons to whom condoms could be supplied for resale.  I consider the amendment of the definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; and the consequent removal of the control over condoms arising from this and the repeal of section 5 of the 1992 Act as being extremely important developments, not alone in the fight against HIV/AIDS, but also towards ensuring that the State is now retreating from unnecessary intrusion into the private lives of its citizens.</P>
    <P>In the context of HIV/AIDS, these proposed amendments and repeals are fundamental and essential.  The attempts in the 1992 Act to liberalise the availability of condoms has simply transferred their supply from one type of supervised sale to another.  They did not result in a realistic, practical or effective approach to HIV prevention.  It is reasonable to assume that the supply of condoms through vending machines will provide that degree of privacy to encourage sexually active persons who require the protection of condoms to avail of them and thus protect themselves and their partners from exposure to disease and infection.</P>
    <P>The Government was mindful, however, of the possible adverse consequences of removing the controls contained in the 1992 Act and have decided to include in the Bill a provision in section <Col N="175" /> 3, which would enable the Minister for Health, if it was deemed necessary, to prohibit by regulations, the sale of condoms in places which could be considered to be inappropriate and a provision in section 4, which would enable the Minister to prescribe, by regulations, standards for condoms.</P>
    <P>Section 3 might be required in the event of a proliferation of vending machines in, for example, places where very young persons congregate or in certain locations in main streets.  The expectation is, however, that the removal of the controls in section 5 of the 1992 Act, will lead to the location of such machines in appropriate internal locations, to the extent that inappropriate internal or external locations may not arise and I do not believe it will be necessary for me to utilise the powers to regulate locations. Section 3 (3) provides that a person who contravenes this section will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides an enabling power to the Minister for Health to prescribe standards for condoms.  This provision is necessary to safeguard against the supply here of condoms which do not meet a recognised standard.</P>
    <P>CEN &mdash; the European Committee for Standardization &mdash; has drafted standards for latex rubber male condoms.  It is expected that the draft standards will be finalised and adopted later this year as a European standard, which will then become our national standard.  In the meantime, I propose to recognise, in regulations, a recognised standard of an EC member state or condoms of an equivalent standard as being suitable for sale here.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the section provides that a person may not sell or supply contraceptive sheaths which do not comply with the standards.  Subsection (3) provides that a person who contravenes subsection (2) will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for technical amendments to the 1992 Act.  It provides for the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;in accordance with section 3 (3) of the Principal Act&rdquo; in section 4 (1) (b) (i) (iv) <Col N="176" /> of the Act of 1992.  This is necessary as section 3 of the 1979 Act was repealed by the Act of 1992.  This section also provides for the amendment of paragraph (c) of section 4 (1) of the Act of 1992.  This is consequential and will be self-evident, on the repeal of sections 5 and 6 of the principal Act under section 8 of the Bill.  I will refer to section 8 later.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Act of 1992 sets out the list of persons who may sell contraceptives. That section provides in general terms, that contraceptives may be sold by pharmacists, registered medical practitioners, employees of health boards, family planning services and employees of hospitals.  It also provides for the sale of contraceptives by a licensed importer or manufacturer to the persons I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill is designed also to remove the licensing requirements to import and manufacture contraceptives, other than condoms, by repealing section 5 and 6 of the 1979 Act.  As a result, paragraph (c) of section 4 (1) of the 1992 Act requires to be amended, to delete the references to sections 5 and 6 of the 1979 Act, but at the same time ensure that importers, distributors or manufacturers of contraceptives can sell contraceptives to the persons listed in section 4 (1) of the 1992 Act, and whom I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the making of regulations in relation to any matter referred to as being specified or prescribed by regulations.  This is a standard provision in legislation.  The sections of this Bill which refer to regulations are: section 3, regarding controls on the location of vending machines; and section 4, which concern the standards for condoms.  Section 7 specifies the penalties for offences committed under the Bill when enacted.  The sections to which it applies are: section 3, penalties for contravening regulations on the location of vending machines; and section 4, penalties for contravening regulations on the standards for contraceptive sheaths.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, section 8 will repeal the current requirements that importers and manufacturers of contraceptives  <Col N="177" />&mdash; other than condoms &mdash; should be licensed, through the repeal of sections 5 and 6 of the 1979 Act.  The EC Commission has expressed its unhappiness at the existence of these controls in the context of the completion of the EC Internal Market and I have taken the opportunity to repeal them.  I also mentioned earlier that section 8 of the Bill proposes the repeal of section 5 and 6 of the 1992 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (1) gives the short title of the Act and is a standard provision.  Section 9 (2) provides that the Health (Family Planning) Acts, 1979 and 1992, and this Act may be cited together and will be construed together.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the enactment of this Bill will bring to a conclusion the long running saga of legislation relating to the control of condoms.  As I mentioned during the Dáil debate, we have long left behind us the era of &ldquo;Irish solutions to Irish problems&rdquo; and the debate on the Bill in the Dáil reflected a new maturity in Irish politics in the area of family planning.</P>
    <P>I look forward with relish, therefore, to contributions of Members of this House to the debate on the Bill and I have pleasure in commending it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister will recall that we were on the same side when the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1992, was debated in the Dáil. That legislation was inadequate because it failed to solve the existing problem. The former Minister for Health permitted the sale of condoms in retail outlets and other places, with the exception of vending machines.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, correctly pointed out that there was no privacy for people purchasing condoms.  I am glad he has availed of the opportunity to amend that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was young I remember that my contemporaries across the Border were able to purchase condoms from vending machines and they did not suffer from sexual depravity but those of us living south of the Border could not do that and <Col N="178" /> we thought there were problems with our sexual prowess.</P>
    <P>It is important that this legislation is passed to prevent the spread of AIDS. The AIDS virus will have horrific consequences for society if it continues to spread at an alarming rate.  It must be controlled and measures which help control this virus must be supported.  If the sale of one million condoms prevents one person from contracting AIDS or one woman from going to England for an abortion, it will be worthwhile.  We must allow people purchase condoms from vending machines, thus affording people privacy.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of condoms from the definition of contraception is ironic.  The Minister said that the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1992, was an &ldquo;Irish solution to an Irish problem&rdquo;.  However, there is an element of that in this legislation. A condom is a contraceptive.  Perhaps people in the Department of Health have more creative imaginations than I have.</P>

Members will recall the story about the invisible condoms in County Mayo.  People put money into a vending machine only to discover that it did not contain condoms.  Although it was illegal, the man who owned the vending machine obtained £40 because people were too embarrassed to complain.  Proper sex education programmes must be introduced in primary and post-primary schools.  Although I am not young, I do not consider myself one of the older Members of this august establishment. However, ten or 15 years ago I received little sex education at school.  Perhaps the Minister for Health could consult with the Minister for Education in this regard. Regarding section 4, the Minister should outline what he considers to be &ldquo;inappropriate locations&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> This legislation is progressive.  My colleague, Deputy Flanagan, stated in the Dáil that the State has no role in matters of private morality.  As legislators we have been interfering with private morality, something which should not concern us.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will end the shabby legislation brought before the Oireachtas in recent years to deal with this matter.  There are many other important issues to be dealt with.  My party and I welcome and support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on this legislation.  From my point of view, this is a good time to be a Member of the Oireachtas.  Given the debate in the Dáil last night and the tone of the debate in this House today, it appears that compassion and understanding have taken over from suspicion and hostility. It is a worthwhile time to support this legislation.</P>
      <P>It is amazing to think that over 20 years ago President Mary Robinson was unsuccessful in having family planning legislation passed in the Seanad.  We have come a long way since then and since the Irish women's liberation movement travelled to Belfast on the so-called &ldquo;contraceptive train&rdquo;.  I welcome the change in Irish society and an end to &ldquo;Irish solutions to Irish problems&rdquo;.  This was evident in last night's Dáil debate on another piece of social legislation.</P>
      <P>While I welcome this enlightened approach, perhaps we are becoming liberal and compassionate in our outlook because a life threatening disease has highlighted the need to make condoms freely available.  The Minister and a previous speaker mentioned that this is a health Bill.  However, it would be foolish to presume that condoms are not being used as contraceptives.  This Bill should encourage the use of condoms as a contraceptive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now the onus for contraception has been on women.  The use of the contraceptive <Col N="180" /> pill and IUDs are not in the best interests of women.  They placed a burden of responsibility on them when it came to deciding and regulating the size of the family.  Senator Henry may either confirm or deny these suspicions but many of the contraceptives being used by women will probably have negative side effects for womens' health.  As the Minister said, this legislation is predominantly a health matter and relates to the ongoing legislation dealing with the containment of the HIV and AIDS virus.</P>
    <P>The Bill responds to a new maturity and openness in Irish people and reflects an Ireland where important matters of health, sexuality and ethics can be debated in an open and clear-sighted manner.  I believe the majority of Irish people see the practical significance of this legislation.  I mentioned that I feel it is not right to pretend that this legislation does not also make condoms more widely available as contraceptives.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the outlets for providing condoms.  If we are to take this matter seriously I suggest to Senator Quinn that he and other shopkeepers make condoms available in their supermarket outlets.  It is nonsensical to have women's sanitary products available in supermarkets and then baulk at the suggestion that condoms should be available in vending machines in toilets; this is not a balanced situation.  Condoms must be as acceptable as sanitary products in supermarkets.</P>
    <P>The Minister expanded very much on the Government's plan and hopes in relation to the containment of the AIDS problem.  I know he is not suggesting that condoms are the total focus of this Government's programme; the Minister also referred to the need for an education programme.  I also urge that not only would this be a HIV and AIDS programme but also a comprehensive sex education programme.</P>
    <P>I received correspondence in relation to this legislation and the legislation which we will be discussing in the House next week from a lobby group opposed to the Bill which asked if I favoured giving contraceptives to 17 year olds.  It is not <Col N="181" /> my intention that this should be done but I have three children, aged 15, 16 and 11 and I intend that my children will know what they need to know before they head out into the world.  My daughters should know that women who have unprotected sex run the risk of an unplanned pregnancy and my son should know that by such sex he could be responsible for such an occurrence.  There are also the associated risks of sexually transmitted disease. When I was growing up such disease was very nasty but was not life threatening; AIDS puts the matter in a completely different light.</P>
    <P>The condom has been removed from the class of contraceptive for technical reasons.  This is the only focus of the legislation to which I object.  We now have an ideal opportunity to start a good, sensible and balanced programme of sex education.  This in itself would result in young children knowing they have to be responsible.  Making condoms available will not mean they will rush out madly to buy and use condoms.  This will not happen.  People who want to have sex will do so regardless of the availability of condoms.  If they are available those who are considering sex may consider being responsible or staying with a single partner as the Minister mentioned in his speech.</P>
    <P>A case which remains clear in my mind is that of a 14-year-old mother with her first child who came to my clinic.  She was lucky in that her parents were totally supportive and she had a job.  They insisted that she continue to work and they would support her.  It was funny and a little enlightening that they felt their daughter would be stigmatised if she claimed the lone parent's allowance.  This was the source of a possible stigma rather than the fact of being a single parent. They did not want her to become stuck in a particular category; they wanted to see her progress and I admire the support they gave her.</P>
    <P>It has to be said to those who send the letters we received suggesting that we turn a blind eye and ignore our responsibilities as legislators that I do not intend <Col N="182" /> to do so.  I commend the Minister for bringing this legislation to us so soon.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the National AIDS Strategy Committee which is part of the Government's comprehensive programme of family planning legislation. The committee's report proposed a wide series of measures designed to combat the spread of AIDS and to help people with HIV and AIDS problems.  I regret to say that many of the report's excellent proposals have not yet been acted upon, particularly the recommendation to combat discrimination against people infected by the HIV virus.  An exception is the proposal to decriminalise homosexuality and I welcome this.  It is deeply regrettable that we have not acted on the other areas.  Ignorance and fear only serve to increase prejudice regarding AIDS.  The last thing people living with the disease need is to be treated like pariahs and denied basic rights.  I urge the Minister to deal urgently with this issue as I am sure he will.  I would appreciate if he would provide the House with a progress report on the implementation of the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Minister's speech which startled me a little was that he said the data which is being collected on the actual incidence of AIDS and the HIV virus is being compiled from the testing of samples in pre-natal and antenatal clinics. Could the Minister expand on this?  I am a little worried that this would happen without the people involved knowing it is being done.  The Minister mentioned that people being tested are not to be identified.  What is the benefit of finding that people have AIDS if they are not to be identified?  If we are to carry out this procedure fully there may be a need for consent.  If it is decided that we do not need consent because it is such a serious issue, those who are found to be carriers should be identified and informed.  To collect data, information and statistics and to know there are people with the virus who are unaware of it means we have done nothing but compile data.  I am worried about this and look forward <Col N="183" /> to hearing the Minister expand on his proposals in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are very many voluntary groups doing invaluable work in caring for people with AIDS and this should be put on the record of the House. The Dublin AIDS Alliance and Body Positive are two such groups that spring to mind.  These organisations are at the coal face of AIDS care.  However, the level of funding they receive for this work is wholly inadequate.  Their funding could be considered in the context of the programme.</P>
    <P>In the public imagination condoms have been closely linked to the AIDS epidemic.  In my previous contribution I said we should not concentrate on this, because the object of this legislation is for people to feel relaxed when buying condoms over the counter, from vending machines or in their local supermarket. We must de-stigmatise those who buy condoms.  The point was made earlier that people can buy condoms across the Border.  If one walks into a chemist stop here one will find men buying toothpaste and mouthwash instead of condoms. Many women, particularly married women, buy condoms as the contraceptive to be used in their house.  We must put an end to the perception that somebody buying condoms from a chemist, a vending machine or in Senator Quinn's supermarket chain is a carrier or a potential carrier of AIDS.  Condoms must be seen as items which are bought by people who are responsible and not as items which are linked to the AIDS epidemic and used by people who are very sexually active and have more than one partner.  A different impression must be given.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and I commend the Minister.  It is sometimes easier to avoid legislation of this kind and of the kind introduced in Dáil Éireann last night.  Now more than ever people expect politicians to be courageous in making decisions; indeed, the constant criticism is that politicians avoid hard decisions and fail to grasp the nettle.  This brings our profession into disrepute.  If we show <Col N="184" /> courage and are willing to take criticism for doing what is right the public will respect us more.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I will be brief so the Senator may have a chance to contribute.  I welcome the Bill.  While I was listening to the debate I remembered a story my brother told me years ago which will show the House that not everyone will welcome it. A friend of his had a chain of butcher shops mainly located in housing estates in Cork.  One day one of his butchers was sick so he served at the counter himself. A child came in with a note saying: &ldquo;A pound and a half of round steak and six of the others&rdquo;.  It was only then he discovered his assistant had a lucrative business selling contraceptives.  He decided to take no action since he thought it a perfectly reasonable commercial transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator McGennis I regret the contraceptive element has not been stressed in the Bill but I take the Minister's word that he is dealing with the issue.  The Senator was right to say the pill is not suitable for all women. Condoms are regarded as effective contraceptives and for many years they have been used all over the world for family planning.  It would be a pity if they were not regarded in the same way here.  It is difficult to see how they could be made available on the GMS, with people perhaps looking for 40 to 60 each month from their doctor.  However, I am sure <Col N="185" /> this problem will be overcome.  I hope sterilisation is also made available, particularly for women with serious medical problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right to stress the AIDS issue.  I have a certain sympathy with those who say they do not want safe sex programmes to be solely about condoms. Senator Dardis thinks I have given up on the youth of Ireland but I feel sorry for them.  When one sees the emphasis on sex and sexuality, particularly in the case of young women, it is no wonder young people think teenage sexual activity is obligatory.  Girls are often pictured sitting on cars and in many cases they are not old enough to have a driving licence let alone the money to buy a car.  As Senator Reynolds said, sex should be included in general education.  Teenagers must be told sexual activity is not obligatory, that there can be reasons for saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; and it does not imply one is prim or not macho.</P>
      <P>The AIDS problem is extremely serious and cannot be over-stressed. Today in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> Dr. Joe Barry has written an article entitled, &ldquo;Ireland is Sitting on an AIDS Time Bomb&rdquo;, which is true.  It does not happen in Irish newspapers but the British press has been asserting the AIDS crisis is not as bad as was thought.  Thankfully, the original projections have not materialised because the consequences would have been appalling.  Nonetheless the position is worrying.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why anyone would try to disabuse people of the fact that heterosexual sex can lead to the transmission of AIDS.  It is more easily transmitted through homosexual sex but Dr. James Walsh, the Minister's adviser, in whom I have great confidence has repeatedly stressed the danger to heterosexuals. Dr. Barry is right to stress the spread of AIDS by drug addicts because this is one way it reaches the heterosexual community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a remarkable coincidence that the Bill concerning homosexuality and prostitution is being discussed in the other House while this Bill is being discussed here.  I live in Dublin's inner city which <Col N="186" /> has a large number of prostitutes.  They have no organisation but since they know of my interest in women's health they come to see me.  Three women recently told me while most prostitutes are extremely careful about making clients use condoms, a large number of women drug addicts have become prostitutes.  I do not know if the same applies to male drug addicts.  A drug addict who is not trying to get off drugs or enter a programme must beg, steal or become involved in prostitution.  Many addicts are prepared to have sex with clients without using condoms.  The Minister may find it difficult to cover that issue in his advertising campaign.</P>
    <P>Even worse, much younger girls are becoming involved in prostitution because clients believe the risk of HIV infection is lower.  One thinks one has solved one problem when another arises. I do not know how to tackle that because there is a considerable amount of prostitution in the city.  I was interested to hear Deputy Harney suggest the legalisation of prostitution.  We may have to do that; I do not know the position in other EC countries.  Most of the women I know take extremely good care of their health and attend doctors but the difficulty is with people on the fringe of society who have severe medical conditions. The problem seems to be even deeper than that; it is a difficult one to tackle.</P>
    <P>I also am sorry to hear people say condoms do not provide protection because the virus goes through the pores. To hear members of the medical profession say this is dreadful.  It would be better if they said people would not become HIV positive if they did not indulge in casual sex.  Also, as the Minister said, being faithful to a faithful partner is vital.</P>
    <P>Apart from those issues the Minister has done an extremely good job.  The importance of sensible behaviour must be stressed and I accept the Minister's word that he will deal with contraception. It is essential that he should do so.  Since contraception was introduced in Ireland the average family size has dropped from <Col N="187" /> 3.8 children about 20 years ago to two children now which is roughly the European average.</P>
    <P>The drop in our maternal mortality figures in one generation is staggering.  I did a study of the figures about 20 years ago and I found a large number of those who died were older women with large families.  I presented a paper on this subject in the college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, and I was very sorry I included a woman of 47 who was on her 19th pregnancy and who was also an epileptic, because I know they thought I was making it up.  Between 40 per cent and 60 per cent of women had more than nine pregnancies.</P>
    <P>That was in the 1960s.  The great improvement we have experienced in this area since then is not just due to the medical profession, though humility is a great problem with us.  To a great extent it has been due to measures the general population have taken themselves to improve their own health care, and also to better improvements in socio-economic conditions.  This will be another important step in a general health policy which must apply to everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad, and I congratulate him on the Bill he has introduced, which is very welcome.  I also congratulate the Members of the Lower House on their maturity recently in relation to the Bill when it was being debated there.  Their attitude has helped to improve attitudes in this country and we can only go from strength to strength in this regard.</P>
      <P>From February 1993 to April 1993 there were 18 new cases of HIV infection reported in this country with three deaths in that time.  Since the beginning of 1993 there has been an 8 per cent increase in AIDS.  To date there has been 146 AIDS-related deaths and this is why I welcome this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a useful step to try and curtail the spread of the disease and if it can save lives it is to be welcomed. Nobody has ever died from using a condom.  National AIDS day was a dramatic <Col N="188" /> success because it opened the eyes of many people in this country to the real problem.  It also helped to change the attitudes of people.  It brought home to the population generally that there is a problem there which we must address.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his outstanding education campaign on television and radio.  The reaction to it was not as extreme as I expected.  Perhaps years ago there would have been an outcry but not now.  We have educated ourselves as a society to accept these matters.  Senator Reynolds comes from a Border county like myself and we know that in our area there was never a problem regarding availability of condoms; people did not have far to travel to Derry or Strabane to buy them.  I am sure the rest of the country found it somewhat more difficult, but the attitude of people in Donegal is more mature anyway.</P>
    <P>Young people today are more sexually active, and they are sexually active from an earlier age.  When we used to go to dances, we waltzed or danced a fox-trot, but that day is gone.  In dance halls or discos nowadays, when it comes to a slow dance, the temperature in the place rises sharply.  We live in different times and we must deal with that.  Young people are introduced to drink at a much earlier age these days.  People get drunk, situations get out of hand, and it is better to have some help in the form of a condom to avoid an unwanted pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The fact that vending machines may now be installed in clubs and possibly pubs is most welcome.  Up to now, chemist shops had a monopoly on the sale of condoms, and there are massive profits to be made.  I welcome the fact that they will be sold in other places now.  Condoms should also be sold in shops generally. Shops in my own county are selling them at present.  Possibly they are breaking the law and I know some of them have been warned.  There is no doubt there is a great demand for condoms to be made available generally.  As the Minister said in his statement, we have had enough Irish solutions to Irish problems. I welcome the reaction of the churches <Col N="189" /> as well.  They did not intervene to the same extent as they have in the past and it is good to see that.</P>
    <P>As Senator Henry said, we are living in troubles times and we are experiencing high levels of unemployment and poverty. Many people do not have easy access to condoms, especially those who live in rural communities.  People find it hard to go into a shop in their village to buy a packet of condoms because they feel the whole village will know they are using contraceptives and perhaps the fact that it will be possible to buy condoms in shops other than the local pharmacy will ease matters.  There may be a drop in the rural birth rate as a result.</P>
    <P>Access to contraceptives is important, and the fact that the Minister has widened the areas of access is to be commended. Vending machines are essential.  I congratulate the Minister for the work he has done up to now, and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand a little like a voice in the wilderness.  I stand to express a concern, which I hope the Minister will take into account, about a general direction, of which this Bill is just one indication. For 2,000 years, people have valued the family, and this has been a stabilising influence.  I question whether the steps we have undertaken in recent times, and those we will undertake in the immediate future, take into account the benefits we have received from the value we placed on families over those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's legislation is one of a number of measures that will come before us. Other Bills we may find ourselves discussing in the future will deal with divorce, with homosexuality and, I suggest, with abortion.  Senator McGennis said that people who are going to have sex will have sex.  My concern is not specifically with the detail of this Bill but with the general direction we are going in.  The sort of thinking that allows people to say that people who are going to have sex will have sex is exactly the danger that we are not considering in all this legislation. Here I am bound to sound anti-progressive. I am bound to sound like a <Col N="190" /> backwoodsman who does not want change.  Yet, each Bill is a step which damages the value we have placed on family life over many years.</P>
    <P>It is hard to argue against this Bill and say it is the State's duty to interfere in what anybody does in the privacy of their own home.  However, my concern is the point Senator Henry expressed, that is, that sexual activity is not obligatory but the steps we are taking almost suggest to our youth and to coming generations that it is.  That is why I am concerned about this Bill despite understanding the need for it on health grounds.</P>
    <P>When a divorce Bill comes before the House it makes sense to say that if a marriage has broken up we should recognise that fact and enable people to remarry.  It would be cruel, hard hearted and unrealistic to do otherwise.  The same is true of criminal law reform on homosexuality and of the sad cases requiring an abortion Bill.  However, each step not only legalises these measures, but gives the right to promote the sort of thinking that says sexual activity is almost obligatory.</P>
    <P>I do not know how to protect those minorities, or majorities, who require this legislation.  However, I believe we have to protect people against the promotion of enforced sexuality.  I recognise and welcome the fact that in section 3 the Minister has the right to control where these machines will be placed but I am not sure whether this legislation will be enacted in a manner which will protect us almost from the promotion of the belief that a person, especially a young person, is expected to be sexually active. If you see a condom machine at the tennis club dance or at the teenage disco, the assumption is that sex is expected of the young lady who has a date that night.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the culture which promotes this and I do not believe this nation has thought this measure through.  The Minister has taken just one step in this Bill.  Each Bill, viewed on its own, will be recognised as a worthy response to a problem but let us stand back and look at the wider picture of the dangers now threatening society.  Are we <Col N="191" /> thinking of each Bill as part of a general trend to which there may be an alternative?</P>
    <P>I voice this concern at the promotion of a culture which says family life is not important and that sex outside marriage is the way of the future.  I see the Minister shaking his head and I understand that is not his intention, but each Bill is a step in that direction.  The most I can do is voice that concern because I have not heard it voiced strongly enough in the Oireachtas in the debates on these Bills. I hope that in legislating for worthy objectives we will also take account of another very worthy asset, the family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by Senator Quinn.  That is the context in which I want to look at this Bill, the reasoning behind it and its stated purpose as introduced by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The reasoning behind this Bill is as flawed as the content is contradictory. The title the Minister has selected for the Bill is &ldquo;Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1993&rdquo;.  However, in his statement introducing the Bill the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for improved access to condoms as a necessary and practical response to the evolving HIV-AIDS problem here.  It is nothing whatsoever to do with family planning, natural or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The manufacturers of contraceptive sheaths, who must otherwise be enthusiastic about the terms of this Bill which will make their approved products freely available without restriction, must be surprised to find that in Ireland, at least, they are no longer defined as &ldquo;contraceptives&rdquo; within the meaning of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public relations exercise and propaganda which preceded this Bill is a subtle but serious attack on the well being of our young people in particular.  The Minister stated: &ldquo;Recognising that people are sexually active from an early age they should have reasonable access to condoms.&rdquo;  This is a blatant capitulation <Col N="192" /> to the promotion of irresponsible and uncaring behaviour among young people who this legislation is allegedly supposed to protect.</P>
    <P>The State does have a primary and fundamental responsibility to protect the young and to advance their well being in every sphere of activity.  The abuse of terms such as &ldquo;sexually active&rdquo;&mdash; and we have heard a lot of this abuse recently &mdash; as a conditioning process for this legislation implies that healthy and vigorous young people who do not engage in promiscuous or irresponsible behaviour are seen as sexually passive if not inert.  The social pressure this puts on young people is intolerable and unacceptable, particularly at a time when we see the consequences of immature and irresponsible behaviour in so much unhappiness and suffering.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said: &ldquo;We should have a Bill that is in keeping with the times and does not seek to be a throwback to a time long forgotten.&rdquo;  The conditioning is again obvious; only those who support such legislation are enlightened and tolerant.  Those who question, or oppose, it are accused of being repressive or intolerant.</P>
    <P>Under our Constitution the State guarantees to protect and vindicate the family by its laws.  Yet, the Minister charged with that responsibility in the area of health, where sexual relationship is an essential and enhancing element in the creation of that family, is no longer actively and positively promoting his constitutional responsibility by the introduction of legislation such as this for the reasons he stated.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have us encourage young people to behave, and I quote, &ldquo;responsibly&rdquo; in the fight against AIDS by using condoms.  To equate that with responsible behaviour gives a misleading message from a Minister to our young people.  Perhaps there is a consistency in that the television advertisement campaign, which is being paid for out of public funds by the parents and taxpayers of Ireland, also promotes the use of condoms by &ldquo;sexually active&rdquo; young people as responsible sexual behaviour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> I advise Senators to look at some of these advertisements.  They make no attempt to advise young people that the only guaranteed protection against the spread of AIDS in the area of sexual relationship is through truly responsible and caring behaviour from which the security and happiness of families in Ireland has been derived, and must be derived, in the future.</P>
    <P>We are constantly advised through elements in the media that we must be &ldquo;courageous&rdquo; and &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo;.  This has been reflected in some of the contributions made by Senators to this debate today.  Senators will differ with my views on this and on much else I have to say on this issue.  By confining courage and enlightenment to a selective and spurious distortion of those terms, those who oppose such views are, <i>ipso facto</i>, represented as backward and uncaring if not troglodytes.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by these elements that the Government had prudently limited the time for discussion on the Bill decriminalising homosexual conduct between adults, which will shortly come before this House, to avoid what one commentator referred to as an outbreak of moral flatulence.  What this suggests is that the responsibilities of legislators are to be directed, limited and restricted by individuals in the media or elsewhere who are not answerable to any elector and who can determine what is or what is not moral flatulence.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have a responsibility to legislate for the greater good and stability in society.  We must not be deterred by any preconditioning on the part of any individuals who set themselves up as judge and jury on what is enlightened and appropriate action on the part of legislators.  Unlike such individuals, legislators are elected by the people and are answerable to them.  Whatever views we have on these issues, each of us must decide, having regard to our obligations as legislators, that we will not be deterred, cowed or intimidated by any self appointed individuals who happen to make their living by writing or communicating in the media.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> I completely reject any right on the part of individuals to predetermine the role or courage of legislators.  Those legislators who question and reject such rights may require courage to counter the view that if one accepts this type of &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; thinking then one will be acknowledged as courageous and enlightened.</P>
    <P>Terms such as &ldquo;promiscuous&rdquo;, &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; and &ldquo;uncaring behaviour&rdquo; are being substituted in a subtle and constant campaign by words such as &ldquo;sexually active&rdquo;.  In many instances there is a lack of care, especially for young girls and young women.</P>
    <P>The AIDS virus is a major and critical problem of our times.  Those who suffer from it, for whatever reason, deserve and must receive total support in every way. They must not be made feel isolated and ignored and their families and partners must be supported through programmes and action by the State.  However, when we witness the suffering and the condition of those members of our society, we must also be determined that in the area of sexual relationships we will, to the maximum extent possible, highlight that the only truly effective guarantee against the spread of AIDS to others as yet unaffected is responsible and caring single partnership relationships in marriage, which is the bedrock of the family which is guaranteed protection by the State under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister states: &ldquo;The primary purpose of the Bill ... is to provide for improved access to condoms, as a necessary and practical response to the evolving HIV/AIDS problem here.&rdquo;  I believe this is a counsel of confusion and despair. The Minister goes on to state: &ldquo;It brings us into line with public mores and thinking in Ireland and with the situation in other EC member states, where condoms are supplied through vending machines.&rdquo; The incidence of AIDS is lower in Ireland than in the other EC member states, with the possible exception of Greece.  I am aware that there are other causative factors, such as the unfortunate cases of blood transfusions, the use of drugs and needles that have not been properly sterilised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> Despite this, and I am not suggesting that it is his deliberate intention, the Minister wants to bring this country into line with this situation in the EC.  I have lived in Europe and I know a little about the social and marital conditions pertaining. Many people look at us and acknowledge that, despite all its faults, Ireland at least adheres to standards that protect public order and morality, especially in young people.  Many of these people would find it strange to note that Ireland is now endeavouring to catch up with Europe in this area.</P>
    <P>Is a new era emerging where moralistic programmes of education are to be rejected as the standard in our community? I ask this in view of what the Minister states, where he is at least being consistent:</P>
    <P>The two main elements of an effective programme to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus are: proper and non-moralistic programmes of education directed at the various sections of the community and legislation to remove restrictions on the purchase of condoms.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with moralistic programmes of education?  Enlightened jurisprudents have always recognised that all laws must reflect and respect standards of public morality and not only in the area of sexual morality.</P>
    <P>There is a notion that our legislation should no longer be based on standards of public morality which creates stability and happiness throughout our society, be it in respect for the person, property and well being of our fellow citizens.  That notion is a new thesis which, if pursued, would mean that &ldquo;private morality&rdquo; take precedence over public order and morality which are guaranteed under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This notion is not based on any religious precept, which often influence many laws and customs.  Distinguished jurisprudents, such as the late Lord Chief Justice Devlin, the most distinguished judge of the British courts, who was, to the best of my knowledge, an agnostic <Col N="196" /> for most of his life, have established that laws will always reflect public mores. Such mores arise from a complex of influences, such as historical inheritance, cultural inheritance, and he also mentioned the prevailing religious ethos.</P>
    <P>What would be good law in an Islamic society which, for instance, tolerates if not promotes polygamy, would give rise to chaos in a Christian society where the norm is monogamy.  So let us not run away with the notion that public order and morality are not part of our responsibilities and that this new notion of private morality means each of us has the right to set ourselves up in the closet and say &ldquo;I establish my total exclusive code of morality.  I will behave as I will, totally and utterly without regard to my responsibility as a social being.&rdquo;  All our laws negate that simple fact, and if they do so in other areas there is no reason they should ignore it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is the role of the State to regulate our relationships as individual citizens with each other, subject to public order and morality as our Constitution lays down.  We can never abrogate our responsibility under the Constitution to legislate to give effect to that.  Individual freedom of action is guaranteed under our Constitution but that does not give us the right to exercise our free will in a manner that does not take account of our responsibility as social beings.</P>
    <P>No man is an island, said John Donne, and it follows that our private behaviour does not entitle each or any of use to set up a code of &ldquo;private morality&rdquo; which would take no account of the effect our behaviour would have on our fellow citizens, have no due regard for the well being of society generally and not have sufficient regard for the well being of our young people.  They are being targeted in a whole range of conditioning these days with regard to the use of terms such as &ldquo;sexually active&rdquo;, which implies that those who are sexually responsible are somehow sexually inert if not paralysed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the eloquent speech of Senator O'Kennedy and it came as a considerable <Col N="197" /> relief to me that he could spell.  He demonstrated that adequately to the House, but unfortunately his understanding does not go much beyond spelling in certain areas because he clearly did not understand the difference between moral and moralistic.  &ldquo;Moralistic&rdquo; contains a whole series of adverse value judgments which are imported into matter to which they are quite extraneous.  That is what moralistic is, and that is why the Minister is right in saying that the importation of moralistic values into this kind of situation is disastrous, dangerous, wrong and inimical to the health and well being of young people.  I am sure Senator O'Kennedy, for whom I have the greatest respect, would not wish to complicate matters by introducing the dangerous notion of moralism into this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister kindly referred to the debate that I and Senator Henry and Senator O'Toole had on a similar issue some time ago, and it would be futile for me to rehash the arguments, but there are one or two things it is important to say.</P>
      <P>There is an extremely dangerous campaign of lying being engaged in by certain groups in this country.  I propose to call it a lie inside and outside this House, and I will name the persons outside the House because it would be unfair to do so here. If they or the organisations seek legal remedy then I will meet them in the courts.  I am speaking about the people who dishonestly maintain that the prophylactic, latex sheath is not a defence against AIDS because they maintain the AIDS virus is 50 times smaller than sperm and can make its way through naturally occurring flaws in the latex sheath.  This is not true.  It has been demonstrated not to be true; the medical information has been placed on the record, and still these people persist.  I can only conclude that they are seeking further victims and that they will be satisfied when more young people are sentenced to a lingering and pretty grisly death.  I condemn them out of hand for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are simple.  Whatever the size of the virus as compared to the sperm, no virus is capable of travelling independently <Col N="198" /> or nakedly; it is always accompanied by a mantle of H2O, ordinary water.  In addition it has an electrical charge and it has been demonstrated in laboratory and clinical tests time and time again that the AIDS virus is incapable of travelling through a latex sheath.  I wish these people would stop peddling their lies.  It is a vitally serious point; I think it is a matter of life and death.  It is desperately important that this message goes out from this House.</P>
    <P>I asked Senator Henry, distinguished medical practitioner, whether she had mentioned this point and she had.  I hope it will be reported particularly in the Independent Newspaper Group, I have the highest regard for that group which produces reputable, decent and balanced newspapers, but lately they have persistently peddled this lie and it is time they stopped doing it.</P>
    <P>The <i>Sunday World</i>, I have to say, did not exactly peddle this lie; it was contained as a question in a column by somebody for whom I have the highest regard as a humane, decent person, and that is Fr. Brian D'Arcy.  He had the decency to ask a question because the same American right-wing reactionary people sent him the same rubbish and he said, &ldquo;I wonder if it is true.&rdquo;  The <i>Sunday World</i> had the responsibility last Sunday to publish an article by a woman doctor which directly contradicted this.</P>
    <P>The latest EC tests involving 540 heterosexual couples &mdash; in each of which one partner was infected with the AIDS virus &mdash; have shown that, as a result of the consistent use of contraceptive latex sheaths, there was not one instance of the AIDS virus being transferred.  I think that is pretty conclusive evidence.</P>
    <P>People say that the condom is not 100 per cent perfect; they quote a figure of 82 per cent effectiveness.  In fact, if it is properly used it is very nearly 99 per cent safe.  However, even if it was 80 per cent or 75 per cent effective, are any of the people who are campaigning against the use of condoms going to go out and campaign against crash helmets, safety belts, lifebelts, or lifeguards?  Should we abandon 80 or 90 per cent of insurance <Col N="199" /> because there is a 10 per cent possibility? What kind of idiocy is this?</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I said on an earlier occasion that, confronted with this dangerous situation, we needed somebody of the calibre of Dr. Noel Browne who, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, attacked tubercular infection in this country with a ruthless efficiency, an ability to cut through bureaucratic red tape and establish what was needed in terms of facilities.  Having listened to the Minister in the Dáil and in this House, I believe that in Deputy Howlin we have somebody who is demonstrating that he is of that stature.  I thank God for it because this is precisely what we need.</P>
      <P>We cannot muck about with this problem any more.  We have done so for far too long and it makes me angry.  I have known a number of people who have, tragically, become infected with the HIV virus, by no means all of them gay.  I have come into contact with them because of the altruism and generosity of people in the gay community who have reached out to people who have contracted this infection from other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to reconsider the position of national AIDS co-ordinator. I am sure he will agree that Dr. James Walsh is one of the unsung heroes of the medical service in this country.  He has done a remarkable job.  I am not minimising the work of officials in the Department of Health.  I know some of those present in the House today and I have had useful discussions with a number of people in the Department. However, by their nature, departmental officials are anonymous.  It is important, particularly when people are deliberately telling untruths and deliberately peddling death, that we have a person in a national position who is able to counter this campaign of dangerous misinformation.  I appeal to the Minister to think about the <Col N="200" /> possibility of re-establishing this important office of national AIDS co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  One could be cynical about it.  The Minister is correct when he spoke about Irish solutions to Irish problems.  If one wanted to be amusing and witty one could spend some time playing with the notion of the exclusion of condoms from the definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo;. This is a nonsense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it is a necessary nonsense but if it saves lives, I do not mind being complicit in this degree of nonsense.  What matters at the end of the day is that young people should be protected and saved.</P>
      <P>I must be living in a sexual igloo because I have never experienced the slightest twitch of the giblets at the prospect of a little piece of limp rubber and anyone who is capable of sexual excitement when a condom is waved under their nose, more power to them.  I have never understood the notion that because there are condoms in a machine the entire country will be in a state of extreme titillation. Perhaps I am totally out of step on this issue.  In some ways the children of this country have more sense than the adults.  No sensible child will become sexually inflamed by the prospect of a condom machine.</P>
      <P>On the other hand due to a variety of factors, such as access to television programmes, sex education, etc. &mdash; perhaps diet is a factor &mdash; sexual maturity is occurring earlier and young people are sexually active earlier.  Young people who are sexually active are entitled to protection &mdash; and it is our moral obligation to protect them &mdash; against serious infection and disease and there is no doubt that condoms can do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these pestilential American figures are quoted in relation to incidence of venereal infection.  The latest controlled programme in the United States showed that there was a 30 per cent decrease in the incidence of gonorrhoea as a result of the use of condoms.  I do <Col N="201" /> not hear the moral majority &mdash; or as I call them the immoral minority after a button badge I saw in San Francisco &mdash; peddling this information.  They are highly selective when it comes to dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>I welcome the detail, the sentiments, the directness, the courage, the integrity and the forthrightness of the Minister's approach in this Bill.  I welcome his comment that the State is now retreating from unnecessary intrusion into the private lives of its citizens.  All I can say to that is hurrah.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 4 of this Bill.  A matter to which we referred in the previous debate concerns the quality control of condoms, particularly with the completion of the Internal Market.  There is always the danger that substandard material might be imported into this country.  There is no point wearing a useless condom or one that will easily burst.</P>
    <P>It is important that clear and explicit information is given about the simple mechanics of a condom.  The principal reason for the 10 or 20 per cent reported failure rate is user failure, in other words, people do not know how to use condoms properly.  It is important that people are given this information.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Various people have mentioned Lord Devlin.  I do not share the admiration for this scion of the British judiciary.  The reason I travelled to Northern Ireland, where I was often made welcome, was that I wanted to ascertain if my memory was correct and that Lord Devlin had been involved in an unsavoury way in matters in Northern Ireland.  I wonder if this House shares the unqualified admiration that was expressed.  Perhaps I am doing Lord Devlin an injustice; perhaps he is dead and beyond my barbs.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am pleased to welcome this legislation.  This is a further episode in a long and tedious process concerning female reproduction and contraception, although today we are defining condoms as no longer being a contraceptive.  This is hypocritical.  This is an area which is <Col N="202" /> important to women and it is extraordinary that we are defining condoms in this way.  I have no doubt that this measure would never have come before the House if it had not been for the threat of HIV and AIDS.  I wonder if we would be dealing with this matter if men could not contract the AIDS virus.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister is introducing this legislation.  There are many challenges facing him in this area and he is meeting each of them.  I hope this will continue.  There is a lot of hypocrisy in this country about these matters.  For example, it was farcical that the contraceptive pill could not be prescribed as a contraceptive under the GMS. However, the Minister dealt with this matter recently.  All forms of legal contraceptives should be freely available under the GMS.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to tubal ligation for women which Senator Henry mentioned. The Commission on the Status of Women recommended that it should be a condition of funding to public hospitals that this operation should be available to women, and I do not believe it should be the subject for ethics committees, as it is at present.  The decision to have this operation should be made by the woman in consultation with her doctor.  The Minister promised that he will look at all issues concerning family planning and that this matter will be considered in relation to his overall health strategy which is being developed in his department. I would like him to consider these matters which affect women.  I believe they have not been dealt with because they affect only women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for the way he is dealing with this matter.  The growing problem of HIV and AIDS needs strong and effective action.  The wider availability of condoms is only part of the comprehensive approach which is needed in the fight against the spread of AIDS. Another important area which needs careful consideration is education.  The Minister is directing his response to the public.  However, we must concentrate our efforts on high risk areas and we must educate our young people about <Col N="203" /> the dangers of AIDS and HIV because education is important.  If we had not been hypocritical about this issue, we could have looked at education sooner.</P>
    <P>I know the Department has an AIDS strategy in place which includes education, prevention, monitoring the treatment and care of patients and research into the condition of AIDS.  This strategy is in line with recommendations from the World Health Organisation and other international agencies and the education and prevention programme has elements aimed at the general public, high risk groups and second and third level students.  All these areas are important but the Minister tends to concentrate on the general public at present.  I hope he will look at the high risk groups and see what can be done to educate our young people.</P>
    <P>One of the problems relating to education about AIDS, particularly for young people, is that in some schools there is little or no sex education.  Sexual activity should not only be discussed in the context of life threatening illnesses, such as AIDS or HIV.  If we discussed these issues and dangers openly and freely with our children and if there were proper sex education programmes, it would be easier to deal with the education process to cover AIDS and HIV.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn and Senator O'Kennedy spoke about their concerns for the family and for young people, but because of our attitude to sex, because we do not speak openly about it, many myths have grown up around it.  We do not talk about the responsibilities of young people and, in particular young boys.  One of the issues we must address, which is not directly related but which affects women, is the huge growth of teenage pregnancies. If one looks at first time births the statistics are frightening.  Many of these girls are condemning themselves to a life of poverty, and their children will inevitably be condemned to disadvantage. Many of these girls come from areas where they are already disadvantaged. This issue must also be examined in the context of education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> Sex education should be developed to deal with sexuality in the wider context. We must talk about relationships and responsibilities.  Responsibility is a word we do not dwell on.  Everybody has responsibilities and people should be made aware of that.  I would like to see an emphasis in sex education programmes that would educate girls to the cost, in terms of missed opportunities, of early, unplanned pregnancies.  It is also important to develop an awareness among boys of accountability for the consequences of their sexual activities.  A realistic approach to the AIDS threat also requires a realistic approach to sex education. This is an area which we seem reluctant to talk about but when we are discussing AIDS we must consider the area of sex education.</P>
    <P>I would like to highlight the risk to women of AIDS.  It is accepted, and we should be concerned about it, that proportionate to the same exposure women are at a greater risk of becoming HIV positive than men.  Statistics show that male to female transmission of the HIV virus is twice as likely as female to male transmission.  The risk of transmission of the virus from women to their babies should they become pregnant is another specifically female aspect of HIV transmission, and this should be examined.  It should be highlighted that older women are at a heightened risk from the virus.</P>
    <P>It is essential for women to realise that safer sex should be as big an issue as contraception in a relationship.  They should be made aware that they need, for their own sake, to take safe sex precautions as well as using contraceptives in any but an established, mutually exclusive relationship.  This is a difficult message to convey particularly as many women who are at a high risk of exposure to AIDS may have partners who do not use condoms, and a targeted health promotion programme in this area is vital. We do not know exactly how many women are HIV positive nor how they contracted the virus.  We tend to know more about the instance of HIV infection among drug users and other high risk categories, such as homosexuals.  We <Col N="205" /> should have figures establishing the number of women who are HIV positive and also how they contracted the virus, not only because of the risk to the women themselves but also to their children if they become pregnant.  We must be aware that when women are pregnant their immune system is not as strong as when they are not pregnant and that the rate of transmission of the disease to their children when they breastfeed is high.</P>
    <P>These are important issues which should feature in any information campaign. We do not tend to accord the same urgency to issues where women are at risk.  We must consider the children of women who are HIV positive or those who are orphaned when their mothers develop full blown AIDS.  We must take account of these issues in any long term planning in relation to AIDS.  Furthermore, when women who develop AIDS are hospitalised their children have to be looked after.  All these issues are specific to women.  I am sure the Minister is aware of them and I urge him to consider them all.</P>
    <P>I would also pay tribute to the many organisations, particularly the voluntary ones, that have been involved in work relating to education and awareness about AIDS, such as Aidswide, the Aids Alliance, the Merchant's Quay project, Condomsense and also the individual GPs, consultants and doctors who are involved in this area.  We have not tended to give large amounts of public funding to these organisations and I wish to pay tribute to them.</P>
    <P>I welcome and fully support the Bill. There are many other issues I would like to see the Minister tackle.  I know he is favourably disposed towards them and I am sure he will deal with them.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be a Member of the Oireachtas taking part in the enactment of this legislation since we have finally reached a stage where we are acting responsibly and with realism in dealing with these issues which for so long have been dealt with in a hypocritical manner by the Irish public in general. This Bill is a serious approach to a serious <Col N="206" /> health problem and deals with the greater availability of contraceptives and, in particular condoms.  Although I realise that this Bill specifically defines a condom as no longer being a contraceptive, I understand that is purely for technical reasons and I accept it in that regard.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there are genuine concerns as expressed by Senator Quinn and many others with regard to the wider issue of public morality.  There are a lot of lies and rubbish peddled with regard to sexuality by the people referred to by Senator Norris and Senator McGennis. While we are sometimes accused of labelling some people as being antediluvian and we are labelled as being anti-family, it is not helpful to label people on either side.  There are many genuinely concerned people on both sides of the argument. I reject being labelled anti-family because I support legislation such as this. It is out of genuine concern that we face the realities that makes us want to deal in a direct way with the issues of contraception, AIDS and HIV.  The primary concern of this legislation is the prevention of the spread of AIDS and HIV. It is a serious health and life issue and must be taken seriously and this can only be done by this kind of direct approach. We cannot hide behind euphemisms.  We must be honest about what we are doing.</P>
      <P>I live in the real world where people are sexually active.  The term &ldquo;sexually active&rdquo; might be objected to in this House but I cannot think of any other way that it can be described.  This is the reality of the world in which we live.  It is represented on television every day of the week and children and young people are aware of the kind of life that is lived in the modern world.  We must face this. We cannot pretend it does not exist.  The Minister was careful to point out that obviously the safest way to protect oneself from HIV and AIDS is to be faithful to one faithful partner, and that is obvious.  However, the reality is that not many people behave in that way and we must face this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that condoms are being taken out of the definition of contraception but I realise that must be done in order to <Col N="207" /> make them more widely available.  I believe condoms should be more widely available from a contraception point of view as well as from the point of view of the prevention of the spread of HIV and AIDS.  I support having condoms made more widely available for contraception. I have been a member of the family planning clinic in Limerick city for a long time.  I fully support the wider availability of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>I also support what Senator Norris and the Minister said about the section which deals with standards of condoms.  It is very important that proper standards are set so that ineffective condoms will not be on the market.  Obviously the condoms that are on the market must be totally effective.</P>
    <P>I also support the point made by Senator Henry and Senator Honan in relation to the availability of tubal ligation in public hospitals.  I am not too sure what the present position is and I would welcome the Minister's response. It is not right that hospital ethics committees can refuse women access to such an operation.  The Minister should take whatever action he can to eliminate that practice if it still exists in some of our public hospitals or in any of our hospitals.</P>
    <P>I support the views expressed about the State not intruding on citizens' private lives in as much as is practical. The State should not intrude, although it has done so in the past.  I realise that there must be public morality but the State must also take a responsible attitude because people's private morality is their own business.  As long as it is not interfering with the public or private rights of others the area of sexuality is a private matter for adults.  This general point should be made, and this Bill takes it into account.  The advertising campaign on television at the moment also acknowledges the personal nature of private morality.</P>
    <P>I am speaking as a mother of teenage children and I understand the pressures parents are under trying to guide their children in a world where there is access to all sorts of information, particularly <Col N="208" /> through the medium of television, and we debated that and the inability to restrict what is on our television screens previously in this House.  In my view the most responsible way we can deal with this &mdash; and I am speaking as a parent as well as a public representative &mdash; is by trying to educate our children to the realities of life and take responsibility for themselves and how they behave as individuals.  Sex education is very important. I fully support the kind of programmes that are being initiated now in the education system to deal with a real and honest way with the kind of sexual problems young people will encounter as they grow up.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and what it does from the point of view of the spread of the HIV and AIDS viruses and also from the point of view that it is, in effect, making condoms more widely available as a contraceptive.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to contribute to this debate because I think hypocrisy has been redolent in this debate over the last while.  There is unfortunately in this country a tyranny of political correctness and an appalling fascistic attitude to speaking one's mind. Senator O'Kennedy came in here today and gave what I felt was a thoughtful contribution, although not a contribution with which I would agree.  This is the 30th anniversary of the visit to this country of John F.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is a friend of mine; we go back a long way.  He will not be insulted if I say that I am dismayed at the smugness of the penultimate paragraph in his speech where it stated that we are leaving behind the &ldquo;era of Irish solutions to Irish problems&rdquo;.  Why are we so fearful of Irish solutions for problems which exist in this country?  Why have we become so fearful, so terrified, so paranoid at thinking for ourselves?  What is wrong with coming up with solutions based on whatever our <Col N="209" /> ethos, morals or general principles are for the problems which face this country?</P>
    <P>There are two major debates ongoing at the moment &mdash; this debate and the debate that has just finished in the other House.  What really annoys me about the debates is that there has been a concerted effort to avoid really discussing the issues.  I will deal with the other debate next week, but I wish to deal with the humbug in this debate today.  We are actually going to describe the contraceptive sheath, the condom, as being not a contraceptive.  That strikes me as infantile.  The reality is &mdash; and just in case anybody has any doubts &mdash; when the first of these Bills on condoms was going through the other House I argued that there should be sales through vending machines and that the idea of age limits was simply unworkable in any event.  I am not coming from a conservative point of view, and God forbid that I should allow myself to be labelled as such&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is much to be said for conservatism in its own place.  There is a lot that is good and that is worth conserving in Ireland in its own place. The problem with conservatism is that it has a got bad reputation because it has become one of those convenient labels that we, in our intolerance of other people's attitudes, hang on them.  I was amazed and I laughed when the former Soviet Union was collapsing and the most extreme members of the Communist Party, whom I used to regard in my own simplistic way as the ultra-left, were described as conservatives.  I thought &ldquo;God bless, Mrs. Thatcher, what would she think of her new bedfellows&rdquo;?</P>

In my belief, what the Minister is doing now is what should have been done previously, that is, the law relating to one element of contraception is being brought up to date.  The reality is that the use of condoms could have a side effect in that it could help in the fight against the horrific diseases of HIV and AIDS.  We should not avoid these issues but rather we should face them courageously.</P>
      <P>It was the contributions of Senator Quinn and Senator O'Kennedy which prompted me to speak.  Ireland is at a cross-roads in the way we deal with issues, such as family planning and human sexuality and in the way we recognise the fact that young people are now more sexually active.  We are going to deal with the homosexuality issue next week.  Why can we not have the moral fortitude and courage to come out and deal with these issues straight up?  Why should we deal with legislation bringing the law on contraceptives up to date, which is basically in line with the views of most people in this country, by disguising it as something which it is not? Fundamentally, that is the only quibble I would have with the Minister's address.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the point made by Senator Quinn, there is a need for a wider debate here and I hope that next week we would have more courage than they had in the other House.  I hope we will be able to sit here and listen to the diversity of views dealing with one element of human sexuality.  I hope there will be more than 15 minutes left at the end of all the first speakers for people to deal with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that we continuously try to fudge the issue of sexuality in all debates in both Houses.  I accept the point was made by Senator Quinn; I have four children and I would be derelict as a parent if I was not concerned about the direction Ireland is taking.  I also know from my own dealings with young people that they are sexually active and that one of the horrific problems is unwanted pregnancies which arise because of that <Col N="211" /> activity by young people who frequently have not reached the maturity to control their own fertility.  We need to look at that directly; we need to discuss and debate it and we need to consider where this country is going on this matter.</P>
    <P>I have no problem supporting this Bill. I already called for all the measures in this Bill when in the other House and within my own parliamentary party. Senator O'Kennedy may not agree with my views and I may not agree with his, but there is a tyranny abroad in this land in that we are not prepared to listen to each other particularly in these matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris rightly touched on the objectionable nature of material which is coming through the post at the moment. I received a document yesterday and I cannot begin to comprehend the mentality of the people who put it into our letterboxes.  They were dealing with abnormalities and aberrations and they were suggesting that if we enact legislation and take steps in the direction we are heading, the sky is going to fall on us and we will be wiped out by fire and brimstone.  What sort of an attitude is that in a Christian society?  The hallmark of a civilised society and the hallmark of a Christian society is one and the same; we are prepared to deal with compassion and to listen to the other person's point of view.</P>
    <P>I support and commend the Bill and I have no problem in doing so but when we are dealing with these issues we should deal with them in a more &mdash; to use the young person's term &mdash; upright and forthright manner.  This Bill is welcome because it is an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  It is welcome because there has been a change in attitude in society and the law is following that change in attitude.  I cannot understand some of the fears and trepidation which are being expressed but I do accept that they are genuine.</P>
    <P>As I said I had not meant to contribute to this debate but I hope that henceforth in our discussions on sexuality we can have a little more maturity, frankness and, above all, a greater willingness to <Col N="212" /> listen.  It is time we had a full and honest discussion as to the direction in which this country is going.  I am not sure that any of us can solve the problem but if we all have the honesty to say exactly where we feel we are going, what the challenges are and how we respond to those challenges, we would deal with the issues that face this nation.  They are not the major issues which face this nation but we would be dealing with them in perhaps a more constructive, forthright and honest way than we have in the past.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the legislation.  I am glad it was done by a primary teacher.  It has brought some sense into a mess which has been there for a long time.  I would just like to make one brief comment on the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was discussing this legislation with some of my family recently.  My daughter said she had been discussing the fact that this legislation was being introduced with some of her friends who are in third level institutions.  The majority of the people in her group could not visualise how a day in the time of the Dáil and a day in the time of the Seanad could be wasted dealing with this matter.  They felt it fell between the height of hilarity and a total lack of contact with the real world.  It brings to light the importance of politics being in contact with young people.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the legislation.  It would be easy to nit pick but I feel it is a step forward which needed to be taken.  It is not really our business but apparently somebody made it our business and I support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the wide-ranging contributions and I will try to respond to as many of the points as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good that there was not a unanimous view in relation to the Bill.  The variety of opinion is welcome and I listened to all contributions with great care. It would be odd if there was a bland uniformity of opinion in this House because there certainly is not a bland uniformity of opinion outside the House. <Col N="213" /> It has taken 20 years for the present situation to evolve.  It would be remarkable if issues contained in a Bill which went through both Houses a few months ago with some difficulty and divided Houses would be resolved in a uniform manner a few months later.</P>
    <P>It has been said that I have overemphasised the prophylactic use of condoms in this debate rather than stressing the traditional use of condoms as the oldest contraceptive.  I do not mean to do that; I mean to stress their use for family planning and their contraceptive value.  I hope I have used this occasion to stress a new and important use, a use that is literally a matter of life and death, and that is, the preventive, prophylactic nature of a condom as one of the most valuable devices in the battle against AIDS.  That is not only my view.  It is the view of my colleagues in the World Health Organisation that there is an important prophylactic use for condoms, that they are an important part of the international campaign against AIDS. We are not immune from that.  So while I laid emphasis on that, I hope it in no way diminished the focus on the traditional use as well.</P>
    <P>I would have brought this Bill before the House had there been no AIDS scourge facing us.  I honestly say that because I have never changed my view on this issue in the ten years since I first came into this House.  I have been consistent in all I said, publicly and privately, in relation to this matter.  We have grown as a community in understanding needs such as this.</P>
    <P>The first point which I want to address is the redefining of condoms as contraceptives. I said to my officials that I wanted to deregulate condoms and I asked them what was the legislative measure for doing that.  Quite bluntly, we have put such tortuous, convoluted legislation in place &mdash; Bills amending Bills amending Bills &mdash; that when I gave my opening address, I was referring to amending legislation which amended legislation, subsections repealing sections and subsections.  Senators should read my opening speech.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> I had two choices.  I could simply deregulate condoms; by defining them not as a contraceptive they are not subject to this painful morass, or I could have gone <i>seriatim</i> through every clause and subclause of every existing piece of legislation and remove every barrier &mdash; if Senators will pardon the phrase &mdash; which was imposed on the distribution of condoms across the community.</P>
    <P>I chose the simpler course which I thought was less painful for this House and for the community.  However, the intent was simple &mdash; to deregulate condoms so that they are seen for what they are: a simple piece of latex available for people who want to use them while having sex to prevent the spread of the HIV virus, other sexually transmitted diseases and to prevent conception.  That is the road I decided to travel and I did not mean it to be an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  It was a clear, definite solution.  I wanted them deregulated.</P>
    <P>I only sought to keep two controls in force in this Bill.  First, on balance I thought it was important to have residual powers to determine the siting of vending machines because it is possible they would be sited in a place which most of us would find unacceptable.  I wanted the residual power to forbid that should it arise.  I think there would be a consensus that such an objective would be desirable. The other power left to me in the Bill is the power to define standards for condoms.  It would be worse than useless, it would be positively dangerous, if there was a proliferation of condoms which were of inferior quality and had no prophylactic value.  Those are the only two powers which I have retained.  I hope that explains in some measure what I tried to do in relation to the redefinition.</P>
    <P>I hope I have explained the definition Senator Reynolds raised.  He asked me to define what is meant by inappropriate locations.  I do not wish to start listing places where they should not be, rattling my brains and getting my officials to rattle their brains collectively to compile a list. If there are inappropriate places they will present themselves and I will then deal with them.  I want the power to forbid <Col N="215" /> rather than list all possible locations.  I hope that power will not be needed.  I do not envisage that such powers will be needed because most inappropriate places are controlled by people who would not tolerate that.  Commercial entities will not put machines where they will be offensive.  There are people in the commercial world present who would understand that logic.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis spoke about family planning legislation in general.  This Bill is dealing with condoms and I wanted it out of the way, to be clear and a final solution.  There is a broader question of family planning which will be addressed in full.  I am concerned about the <i>ad hoc</i> way in which health services have developed, responding to need and pressure points across the country.  We do not have a uniform standard quality care in any provision across the country.</P>
    <P>To that end I have a strategy committee in my Department putting together a national health strategy which I will bring to this House before the end of the year and which will map out the direction in which health policy is going in every area between now and the next three or four years.  We will then have measurable objectives and can have an inclusive debate.  There will be, as I have found, huge pressure points within the health services demanding resources.</P>
    <P>There must be an open, democratic debate on where money is expended because there is a common pool of money and where one area wins, another area loses.  That cannot be decided by me or people in Hawkins House but, ultimately, by the democratic process itself. Family planning and women's health will be an intrinsic part of that strategy.  I hope to have an opportunity to return and talk to the House specifically about that in due course.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis commented on the AIDS and HIV programmes and sex education. I agree there is a need for a better sex education programme.  It is something I have already discussed with my colleague, the Minister for Education, and I know that she is working on that. <Col N="216" /> In relation to discrimination, I will respond in more detail about the specifics of the recommendation of the National AIDS Strategy Committee.</P>
    <P>I think it is indicative of the approach of this Government that we have, for the first time, a Minister for Equality whose <i>raison d'être</i> is to examine the whole area of discrimination in our society and to legislate to ensure that discrimination is eliminated as far as practicable.  That will affect the disabled, the mentally handicapped, travellers, women &mdash; all communities in society who are marginalised. This is a commitment of the Government and I know that my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, is actively addressing those issues, and I think Senators will find the legislative framework will improve dramatically in the course of his tenure in that important new Ministry.</P>
    <P>I will give some details in relation to the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, of which I am chairman. The recommendations fall broadly into a number of categories: prevention, care and management, HIV surveillance and anti-discrimination.  In all, there are 54 recommendations and of these, 37 have been, or are in the course of being, implemented right now.</P>
    <P>All the recommendations have been referred to the appropriate agencies responsible for funding, and moneys from my Department have been made available to ensure that the momentum of the struggle against HIV and AIDS is maintained.  I have provided an additional £4.4 million this year.  Senators have spoken about specific voluntary agencies working in the HIV and AIDS area and I have allocated an additional £400,000 to such bodies to help them in their activities this year, and I know will be welcomed by Senators across the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about family planning legislation, I have dealt with it now, and, I will be dealing with it in the national health strategy.  I understand the point made by several Senators in relation to teenage pressure.  It is hard to see how that balance can be struck.  Part <Col N="217" /> of the solution is proper education so that there is neither embarrassment nor intimidation in relation to the development of one's sexuality.  It should be equally acceptable and appropriate to be celibate.  Such pressures should not be placed on people.  I believe fundamentally that will not be achieved by a closed society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to return to a society which is so rigid and oppressive of nature, that it resulted in the dreadful suffering which most of us who run clinics and have contact with the public have seen.  I agree strongly with Senator Henry's view that we should try by education and a new maturity and openness to ensure that such pressures are not on teenagers.  I genuinely think that the best way to do that is by allowing teenagers to speak, and to answer their concerns.  The solution will not be found by being moralistic &mdash; to use that word which has caused umbrage to some &mdash; but by listening, being caring and understanding.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry also spoke about Dr. Joe Barry and his work in relation to HIV and drug abusers in Dublin city in particular.  Tremendous work is being undertaken by the Eastern Health Board.  The needle exchange and the methadone programmes are impacting and great work is being done.  I have had the opportunity to talk to Dr. Barry and many of the people involved, and I visited one centre on the quays, which is very impressive and is doing tremendous work.</P>
      <P>There is a real problem out there.  We can put our heads in the sand and pretend it does not exist but I know the priests and friars who work in the inner city, are dealing with this in a most realistic and non-judgmental fashion.  It is a real social problem which needs to be addressed.  I am also interested in the mortality figures given by Senator Henry which are worth noting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> Senator Henry talked about reaching out to prostitutes to educate them about the risks of unprotected sex.  Part of the special funding allocated to the Eastern Health Board for HIV/AIDS has been used to develop a clinic for female sex workers &mdash; the new phrase for prostitutes. A total of 70 prostitutes currently attend this clinic where HIV testing and counselling is provided together with advice and information on reducing the risk of HIV virus.  A fundamental element in that programme is the provision of condoms and advice on their use.  The Outreach programme for prostitutes at the AIDS Resource Centre in Baggot Street offers condoms, and that is an important aspect of the programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator Maloney's kind comments about the multi-media campaign and this Bill.  Senator Quinn, in his thought provoking contribution, talked about the direction society is taking.  That subject is worthy of reflection.  The Senator had a gut reaction to general developments in society as opposed to reacting to the specific content of this legislation.  He talked in a holistic way about likely Bills that were coming before this House.  We must address issues that are real.  We can either ignore reality and legislate as if an ideal society existed or we can deal with reality, warts and all. Addressing painful issues is part of the healing process that produces a better society.</P>
    <P>I share Senator O'Sullivan's view that it is too easy to label people.  A person is considered a reactionary troglodyte if he is not in step with the latest thinking or he is considered anti-life or anti-family if he seeks change.  My postbag during the last number of months has not been edifying. Some of it is disturbing in that it demonstrates that there are disturbed people who need counselling and help. Some of the mail, from people who are concerned about the direction society is taking, is well motivated and thought provoking.</P>
    <P>Although I am not as long in public life as many of the Members here, I have held long clinics every week-end for ten years.  Some of the family values people <Col N="219" /> praise so highly here worry me.  A woman came to my clinic and told me she had been married for 40 years, 40 years of torture.  To the outside world she kept up the pretence of having the perfect family with the perfect family values.  However, the woman, who was in her sixties, told me she had suffered 40 years of torture and had nowhere to go because she had no financial independence.  That is not an isolated case.  I do not believe that addressing existing family values need necessarily worsen the situation.  There is much hidden hurt and frustration in Irish morality that has never been confronted. If we allow shafts of light to penetrate that darkness we can only do good.</P>
    <P>I am not as widely travelled in Europe as some Members of this House but I know from talking to European colleagues that their societies are not universally bad.  I do not think Northern Ireland, where condoms have been available for generations, is any less moral or any less religious as a result; I do not believe the Nordic countries, with their compassion and fairness, are savage societies because they are tolerant of others; I do not believe our EC partners have societies that are more depraved than our own, and all have long permitted freedom of conscience in the use of contraception.</P>
    <P>I was involved in the preparation of the inquiry into the Kilkenny incest case and I read the report.  Those events occurred in a family, an Irish family. Unfortunately there are many such cases around our country within the safety of Irish family values.  We cannot be complacent or self-righteous about the high standard of family values in this country alone.  That is not to say that we should diminish real Irish family values which are important and must be upheld. However, we should allow in light where it is necessary and not have a closed mind to reasoned, balanced change.  I hope that this Bill facilitates that level of change.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy talked about the title of the Bill.  The Senator will know from his extensive period in Government <Col N="220" /> that, as the Bill is an amendment of existing legislation, the Title derives from that legislation.  There is no subterfuge or sleight of hand; it is not my style and will not be.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns expressed about the social pressures on young people and will talk to my colleague, the Minister for Education, about how such pressures can be avoided.  However, there are many pressures in society, some of which we cannot control, and often we will be required to sacrifice the best for the general good.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not exclusively my legislation. It is Government legislation agreed unanimously at Cabinet and supported by the partners in Government. My constitutional responsibility is to enact the legislation decided by Government in my area of responsibility and I will execute that responsibility honourably, I hope.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy said that the only effective means to prevent the spread of this virus is through being faithful to a faithful partner.  I have said that already. Assuming that neither partner uses intravenous drugs and is sharing needles that is the ideal and we should encourage it.</P>

      <P>The non-moralistic programmes mentioned in my speech were criticised.  If one is of the opinion that homosexuality is intrinsically wrong one cannot initiate a programme to educate gay men about the prevention of HIV and its transmission.  A colleague in the other House said yesterday that homosexuals had his pity but not his tolerance. We must have more than tolerance; we must have understanding for everybody in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of campaigns will be targeted at specific vulnerable groups. <Col N="221" /> Already, these have been targeted at the homosexual community.  Specifically detailed campaigns have been devised for intravenous drug abusers, who are still statistically the most vulnerable group. They have been going on for many years and will continue &mdash; I will try to devise new campaigns to reach out to them &mdash; but this campaign had a different function. It was to tell the public at large that no one is immune from HIV/AIDS and there are some who believe they are, regardless of their behaviour.  That is the impact, I hope, of the campaign.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the efficacy of condoms.  I do not want to go into that argument again because I have made that case so often.  I have reports from the World Health Organisation, and I have asked my Department to trawl every report, from the Paracentre for CoOrdinating the Campaign on AIDS, from the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta which co-ordinates the American campaigns, and other reports.  I have reports running into the tens on the efficacy of condoms in preventing HIV/AIDS transmission. I have not a single report to the contrary; if someone has such a report please send it to me and I will have it examined and validated.  If no such report exists, then please stop talking about it.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also referred to the role of the national AIDS co-ordinator.  The previous AIDS co-ordinator, Dr. James Walsh, did a Trojan job.  I commend his tremendous work and will bear in mind what the Senator has said.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to the national health strategy on contraceptives; I hope that has been explained already.  She said that strong and effective action is needed to deal with AIDS; I hope I will act in that manner to combat this dreadful scourge.  I appreciate the Senator's comments about specific difficulties for women and I have taken careful note of them.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan referred to the availability of tubal ligation.  I support what she said in relation to availability and it may be of interest to her to hear which public hospitals provide tube ligation. They are: St. James Hospital; the <Col N="222" /> Adelaide; the Meath; the Coombe Hospital; Holles Street; Portlaoise General Hospital; Mullingar General Hospital; St. John's Hospital, Limerick; Limerick Regional Hospital; Monaghan General Hospital; Cavan General Hospital; Letterkenny General Hospital; Sligo General Hospital; South Victoria Cork; Cork Regional Hospital; Erinville Maternity Hospital, Cork; Tralee General Hospital; Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and University College Hospital, Galway.  There is a broad range of hospitals where that procedure is deemed to be appropriate by clinicians and patients.</P>
    <P>I can understand what Senator Roche was talking about when he referred to the tyranny of political correctness.  Perhaps in the context of the matter we are discussing people feel now that to be in the majority is a surprise &mdash; it takes some adjusting &mdash; because there were many difficulties about this matter for so long. I hope my words did not intimate any smugness &mdash; they were not meant to &mdash; but I do not accept that this is an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  It is a solution to a problem that needs to be addressed.  That phrase has become a synonym for fudging and I hope that whatever I bring to this House will not be described as such.  I have been consistent in my dealings on this issue and I do not want this Bill to disguise the intent, which I hope I clearly explained to the House.  I thank Senator O'Toole for his clear and brief support for the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope I have answered all of the points raised.  I thank all Senators and respect all the views expressed and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>From the Minister's explanation regarding the Title of the Bill, may I refer him to section 8, and to many sections of other Bills that have been passed through the Oireachtas. Section 8 states &ldquo;Sections 5 and 6 of the principal Act and sections 5 and 6 of the Act of 1992 are hereby repealed.&rdquo;  I am sure that no solicitor of any standing, much less the Attorney-General, would suggest to the Minister that he is not empowered to introduce legislation that repeals existing legislation he finds unacceptable; of course the Minister can do that.  However, to be consistent in the views he has expressed &mdash; they may not necessarily be in line with my views &mdash; he would repeal all existing legislation concerning health and family planning in one fell swoop and would then introduce legislation for the purposes he has expressed today, particularly for the control of AIDS.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that his advisers &mdash; legal or otherwise &mdash; have suggested to him, as he said here, that the reason this is being presented under health and family planning is because one has to work within existing legislation.  Have they not heard of repealing Bills <i>in toto</i> and replacing them with new legislation?  Legislation should be as precise as possible.  I tell the Minister I can see solicitors having a field day with this Bill, especially in regard to section 2, where a contraceptive sheath is no longer defined as a contraceptive.</P>

The Japanese can have Japanese solutions to Japanese problems &mdash; that is entirely appropriate &mdash; and the Australians likewise, but Ministers come here and denigrate the notion that we have responsibility to legislate for Irish solutions to Irish problems, that we are failing in our responsibility, are ridiculous and are figures of fun because of this.  The attitude is let us have African or other solutions to Irish problems but do not contemplate having our own solution, as other countries would do in regard to their problems.  We should take action that is appropriate to our circumstances.</P>

      <P>I had some reservations about the fact that this was not described as a contraceptive Bill, but the Minister has explained this to my satisfaction. I was the first speaker on this side of the House to refer to the phrase &ldquo;an Irish solution to an Irish problem&rdquo;, and I do so again.  There are Irish solutions to Irish problems.  It is widely acknowledged that this phrase was first used in relation to sexual matters and especially in discussions on legislation on contraceptives.  There are universal solutions and ways to control fertility, including the rhythm method, IUDs, the contraceptive pill, the sheath, etc.  There is no specific Irish solution to control fertility.  That is why I used this term in my contribution.</P>

I was a Members of the Dáil when Senator O'Kennedy was a member of the Government which enacted the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1992.  It was the most appalling piece of legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  Unlike this legislation, it did not deal with reality.</P>

      <P>There has been a synonym for fudges, and that is an &ldquo;Irish solution to an Irish problem.&rdquo;  Perhaps we should stop using such phrases because they bring us into disrepute.  Like Togo or any other country, we must deal with our problems as part of a world affected in the same way. Our physiology is the same as other peoples.  We must address issues on that basis and learn from and improve on the experience of others.</P>
      <P>The definition in section 1 amends existing legislation; it does not seek to repeal all the existing legislation in this area because other issues relating to family planning must be addressed and will be addressed by me in due course.</P>

      <P>The Minister is defining what is understood to be a contraceptive as something else.  Perhaps he wants to maintain the corpus of family planning legislation.  Such a disparity should not exist in legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris allowed himself, for once, to support what he would regard as obfuscation &mdash; an Irish solution to an Irish problem &mdash; because it suits his purpose.  At any other time this would not be acceptable as Senator Norris was honest enough to say.  This is a matter of precision in legislation and if the Minister and his advisers are satisfied to adhere to this, then so be it.</P>
      <P>Although it is unlikely to happen, the manufacturers of contraceptive sheaths could contest the notion that what they have been producing has been excluded as a contraceptive by definition in Irish law.  This is the irony and the contradiction in this law.</P>

      <P>I do not want to engage in semantics but the deregulation of the condom is surely unique to this country. I have heard of the deregulation of airlines, etc., but never deregulating a condom.  That is the quintessential Irish solution.  It is an elegant solution to a problem and illustrates the point that we must look at appropriate solutions to problems.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister content with the substance of section 2?  The fact that the word &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; appears before the word &ldquo;sheath&rdquo; is a recognition that for 150 years this has not been a balloon, a water bomb, etc.  Is the Minister satisfied that the word contraceptive means any appliance or instrument, excluding the contraceptive sheath?  By so describing the product we are deregulating, are we leaving ourselves open to a perverse interpretation which may negate the Minister's actions?  I hope that would not be the case.  I support this section, but I have a concern.</P>

      <P>We have had many definitions of contraceptives.  The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, defined contraceptives as &ldquo;any appliance, instrument, drug preparation or thing designed, prepared or intended to prevent pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse between human beings&rdquo;.  The 1979 legislation repeated that definition. The contraceptive sheath was never specifically mentioned in legislation until the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1992, introduced by my distinguished predecessor. He included contraceptive sheaths because he wanted to make regulations dealing with distribution, age, location, etc.  It is my objective to remove regulations relating to age, location and availability.</P>

      <P>I suggest it would be more appropriate and more of a safeguard for the purposes the Minister wishes to achieve if condoms were available in places where young people were fully in control of their senses, were fully <i>compos mentis</i>, and were not influenced by alcohol or drugs.  They would then be able to make an intelligent and measured decision and would be able to use condoms as advised by people who say how they should be used in an intelligent and rational way.  Such places seem to me to be as appropriate, to say the least, as places where they would congregate and, <Col N="228" /> unfortunately, be influenced and have their judgment and capacity diminished by the consumption of alcohol.  Is the Minister of the view that the latter places I have mentioned are appropriate or inappropriate?  I suggest that places where young people are subject to parental or even school guidance would be appropriate.  I do not know the Minister's view on this but I would feel more reassured, although I do not support the thrust of this Bill at all, if condoms were available in places where young people could make properly balanced decisions and would not be influenced by alcohol or drugs.</P>

      <P>I would support Senator O'Kennedy's line of argument if I thought he was serious and believed that people should not be encouraged to use condoms if they are not in full control of their faculties and senses.  However, what happens in reality is that sex often takes place without protection after young people leave discos and pubs.  This section of the Bill is necessary.  I believe, perhaps in contradiction to Senator O'Kennedy's argument, that primary schools and libraries, which are places where people gain information and knowledge, would be totally inappropriate for the sale of contraceptives. Senator O'Kennedy may be making the argument that these would be the appropriate places to have them on sale if we are to convey to users how they are to be used and their function but I regard these places as inappropriate.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he will not list where they should not be sold.  One is allowed to object to the Advertising Standards Authority if one finds advertisements on bus shelters or other advertising hoardings to be offensive.  This section of the Bill is sensible.  If people regard places where condoms are on sale through vending machines as offensive or objectionable the Minister will have the power to prohibit their sale in such places. Objecting to this section is quibbling for the sake of quibbling.</P>

      <P>To respond to Senator Reynolds, I have said I have no intention of listing places because it would be difficult to compile an exhaustive list.  I genuinely do not believe, as I said in the other House, that there will be inappropriate locations but should this happen and my attention is brought to the matter I will deal with it.</P>
      <P>I was concerned that in some countries there are external vending machines.  I do not think, for example, that putting an external vending machine adjacent to a church would be appropriate.  I do not think, like Senator McGennis, that a primary school would be an appropriate location.  I have no fears that anybody would seek to site such machines in such places.  I have every faith that this provision in the Bill will not prove to be necessary but I want the legislative authority to deal with such a problem if it does arise.</P>

    <P>I believe it is consistent to change the legal framework to allow for broad availability and to remove most of the statutory regulations other than two of these regulations.  It is entirely appropriate and right that we maintain the two regulations regarding location and the ability to set standards which we will deal with in a later section.

What I am saying is that I would have thought that a fundamental precondition for using condoms is that people would be able to exercise capacity, mental and otherwise, in their use.  I worry greatly that where young people are influenced by alcohol and where their capacity to make rational judgment is thereby greatly diminished, there will be pressure on young girls particularly to concede to what is nowadays called &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo;, the pre-sexual negotiation of young men who will not be in a condition in which they are concerned.  That is the risk I am talking about.  I am more concerned about the availability of condoms in public houses than I would be about their availability in places where people are fully <i>compos mentis.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this important issue in the House.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, there has been a power station and coal mine in Arigna for many years.  Unfortunately it has been decided by the Government that next week the Arigna power station will cease operation.</P>
      <P>Mining began in Arigna in the 19th century.  In the present century it was carried on by one mine proprietor and subsequently followed by at least two others.  The Arigna miners played a crucial role in the national economy during the war years when some 350,000 tonnes of coal was taken annually to the ESB and other semi-State operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1958 the power station at Arigna was commissioned and has since performed at a high efficiency level within plant parameters. In 1989 it was the fifth most efficient power station in the ESB network, well above the efficiency level of <Col N="233" /> even the Moneypoint power station.  In over 30 years it has produced electricity economically with technical efficiency.  In 1989 the work cost was almost £4 million, nearly £1 million less than 1988; 45.8 million units were generated and 42.3 million units were sent into the system.</P>
    <P>An undertaking initially established for social considerations has become an efficient user of natural resources in the area.  We have reached the point where a natural resource in Arigna has been used to provide 300 well paid jobs and is now to be taken from the area.  The people concerned have a considerable fear of the problems ahead with respect to the future and alternative opportunities.</P>
    <P>The loss of 300 jobs in an area such as Arigna would have the same relative impact as the loss of a major multinational enterprise employing thousands of people in a recognised industrial zone. The major difference is that the people now being put on the dole do not have alternative employment within the State. They will be forced to emigrate or to move to larger centres thus depriving businesses of the area of their spending power.  This will have knock-on effects in terms of retail and other job losses.</P>
    <P>Since the 1970s oil crisis, EC member states have sought to reduce dependence on external energy supplies through greater efficiency, diversification of sources, increased use of solid fuels and the development of renewable energy. Coal is still a major source of energy throughout the world.  In other Community countries such as France, Germany and Spain a recommendation has been made to concentrate on the construction of new, small, environmentally friendly coal-fired power stations able to generate sufficient electricity for a region rather than feeding the national grid. This development should be considered for the difficulty now posed for Arigna.</P>
    <P>Over the years a large 445 megawatt generating station was promised for Arigna and tests were carried out on the availability of suitable coal and the use of same through a fluidised bed system for the generation of electricity in the <Col N="234" /> larger power station generating unit.  At the time it was considered that the capital outlay was considerable, but there was no other reason for not proceeding with it.  However, the people of Arigna believe that this proposal should now be developed in the area to save these jobs.</P>
    <P>Some 60 jobs will be lost at the week-end, and this decision has been taken by the Government.  Arigna power station will stop producing electricity next Friday and the socio-economic effect that this will have on the mid-Leitrim north Roscommon area will be devastating.  The people who travelled from the area today came up for one last attempt to persuade the Government to allow the station to continue at Arigna.  I know the Minister has been very involved in the county enterprise boards.  The Culliton report, which we have all heard so much about, contained recommendations on the development of industry and the creation of jobs in this country.  One of the cornerstones of the Culliton report was indigenous industry.  What more indigenous industry is there in this country than the mining of coal?</P>
    <P>Reports were produced stating that coal deposits in Arigna, County Roscommon, and Athacashel, County Leitrim can last up to 15 years.  A number of proprietors of mines are willing to mine that coal and employ extra people. Over 250 jobs have been lost in the mining industry already.  Some of those people have been waiting for those jobs to come back, since coal deposits are still in the area, but the Government has decided, wrongly I think, to close down the power station.  It is a bad political decision for this area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach took a personal interest in the proposed research and development work.  He represents the area and MF Kent will be involved in the research and development of the gasification of coal.  The previous Minister for Energy was given reports which show that this effort is only prolonging the life of the power station.  The Government is receiving money from Europe for three years to carry out this research.  This proposal is not feasible for the people who <Col N="235" /> now face unemployment and life on the dole.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from the west; County Leitrim and that part of Roscommon have been ravaged by emigration. We need to keep jobs in the area.  We have an indigenous industry and employers who are willing to keep jobs in the area, but this Government does not have the political will to allow the power station to say open.  This political decision can be taken by the Taoiseach. This Government can save 60 jobs and create extra jobs in the indigenous coal-mining industry.</P>
    <P>We must make one last effort, as public representatives for the area, to have the station kept open.  My colleagues, Senator Naughten and Senator Finneran, who represent the area, are here, and also Senator Mooney, Deputy Ellis, and Deputy Doherty are present in the House.  They want this station to be kept open and the mining to continue.  There is cross-party unanimity that this power station should be left open, because the area faces an economic disaster if it closes.  Some 60 jobs will be lost in Drumshanbo and Ballyfarnham.  The people of Arigna, especially those who have been mining there for generations, who hoped that they could go back to mining, will be devastated by this decision.  I make a final appeal to the Minister to allow Arigna power station to continue; we need it very badly in the area.  I am not trying to raise any political hackles about this.  I genuinely believe the station should be kept open as we have deposits there to last 15 years.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the present Tánaiste, who was then Minister for Energy, gave a categorical assurance to Members of the Dáil that Arigna power station would not be closed until all the deposits of coal in the area were exhausted.  That decision was altered by the previous Government, and this Government is continuing where it left off.  This is a political decision which can only be changed by Government. I hope the Minister will announce this evening that Arigna power station will be kept open.</P>

Mining has been their livelihood for generations and very little alternative employment is available to that community. I do not agree with the ESB's proposal to close this station.  The mining and burning of coal is the way to keep that community vibrant and alive.  I welcome the developments taking place with regard to MF Kent, and I hope that Arigna and its catchment area of Ballyfarnham and Drumshanbo will rise from the ashes and that we will return to a situation where coal mining will be carried on there, where coal will be burned locally, and where the community will again be involved in coal mining and in the provision of jobs for this generation and the next.</P>

It is very difficult for us, as public representatives of an already deprived area, to understand why this power station is being closed down when there are still deposits of coal in the region.  I understand from meeting the delegation today that 100,000 tonnes of coal, worth approximately £1 million, have been left on the site.  I do not believe the introduction of MF Kent to the area will create any local jobs.

      <P>It does not give me any pleasure to come into this House to participate in a debate like this.  I sympathise with the plight of the people in this area.  I wish to put a few facts on the record, because it is not the Government who has taken a decision to close down this station.  We manage the country and the economy to the best of our ability with the resources we have in the national interest.  We have inherited a situation where at the end of the day we must allow a semi-State body like the ESB operate its commercial mandate and to use the energy resources in the best interests of the nation.  The ESB decided to close down the station at Arigna at the end of this month, June 1993.</P>
      <P>Arigna power station was commissioned in 1958 and has been in operation for 35 years.  It was originally proposed to close the station eight years ago, but this was deferred.  The ESB's decision to close now has been taken in the light of the depletion of the reserves of main seam coal in the Arigna area and the knowledge that the continued operation of the station would be so uneconomic that the necessary expenditure to keep the station going safely cannot be justified &mdash; and safety is of vital importance.</P>
      <P>Some years ago Arigna Collieries, the ESB and the unions agreed that there were no qualitative coal reserves in Arigna and, consequently, the coal mine closed in 1990.  This has ultimately led to the decision which we are debating this evening.  The continued operation of the Arigna power station has been the subject of several consultancy studies, by the Geological Survey of Ireland and other consultants in Ireland and the UK.  These studies concluded that it is no longer economically viable to continue producing electricity at Arigna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> The Minister, Deputy Cowen, recently met with a delegation representing the workers at Arigna who argued that there are sufficient supplies of coal in the Arigna area and that the station should not be closed.  While we are aware that a body of coal exists in the locality we have not been convinced that a sufficient quantity can be produced at both a price and a quality which would make the continued operation of the Arigna power station an economic prospect.</P>
    <P>Although there have been suggestions that coal could be supplied for £65 per ton, this appears optimistic.  When the ESB last accepted coal at Arigna the price was over £90 per ton.  Even if a long term price of £65 per ton was possible, the cost of Arigna electricity would be over two and a half times its economic value based on fuel costs alone compared to electricity generated at other stations. The continued operation of the Arigna station would, therefore, require a major and open-ended financial commitment from the ESB.  This would also give rise to the prospect of already high costs escalating further to unacceptable and serious levels.  We have found no basis for an other interim extension of the life of the station.</P>
    <P>The reliability of the station is poor and any extension past its closure date would require significant capital investment. We are advised by professionals in the field that there is no reliable prospect of electricity being produced at Arigna in the future at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that there will be no compulsory redundancies among the ESB staff at Arigna.  All staff will be offered the choice of voluntary redundancy or relocation to other stations within the ESB network.  That is important because there are opportunities at the moment within reasonable distance of Arigna where staff can be relocated; these opportunities may not continue to be available.  It is important that people are maintained as close as possible to their own communities.</P>
    <P>The community in Arigna has enjoyed substantial benefits from the Arigna station for 35 years.  Closure of the station can no longer be deferred and we feel it is time to take a long term view of the <Col N="239" /> future and focus on new developments. Since the decision to close the station was taken by the ESB, considerable resources have been directed towards developing alternative job opportunities with some success.  Indeed, the ESB has been approached recently about the possibility of basing a gasification demonstration project at the Arigna plant.  These initiatives deserve all our support and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Over the past year in the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance and now in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications I have done what I can to ensure this project is brought on stream but it depends on co-operation, co-operation between the ESB and the local community to create the opportunity through research and development to provide a viable alternative for the people of the Arigna area to utilise the natural resources in a more diverse way and to maximise opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, myself and the Department have received strong representations on this project over time from Deputy Doherty, Senator Mooney, Deputy Ellis, Senator Finneran, Senator Naughten, Senator Reynolds, Senator Belton and others.  We are fully aware of the situation; no later than today we had two meetings with Members of the Oireachtas from the area and they have again impressed on us the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    <P>I concur with the aspirations of the Oireachtas Members in the area.  I come from a rural area where we had a similar situation.  The local indigenous industry, Bord na Móna, closed down an operation which employed 600 people.  Today 35 people are working there in a private sector operation.  I can understand the serious consequences this closure will have on the economic life and vibrancy of the community.  However, after consultations between the Minister, myself, our officials and the ESB, we want to ensure that this closure is reasonable and will create further opportunities for people.  We have asked the ESB to treat everybody with the maximum generosity by way of relocation and further opportunities. We hope that with the co-operation <Col N="240" /> of the ESB and the new project, there may be options for people to find alternative employment.</P>
    <P>Is oth liom nach bhfuil níos mó deaeolais agam ar an ócáid seo, ach ceapaim go bhfuil tuiscint maith ag na ionadaithe ón gceantar go bhfuil orainn an obair seo a chríochnú.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to put this matter on the record.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of concern that teachers throughout the country appear to have been targeted recently by An Post for the purchase of TV licences.  The Irish primary school system is the only one in Europe that does not have access to a schools educational programme on television. I have consistently said RTE is remiss in its responsibilities under its charter to educate, inform and entertain; I mentioned this yesterday on the Second Stage debate on the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill, 1993.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Minister for Social Welfare on behalf of the Government announced a commitment to provide free colour TV licences for the up to 95,000 pensioners in the State &mdash; that initiative is welcome.  There are marginally more than 3,000 national schools and, in the words of the Minister for Education, they are &ldquo;grossly under-funded&rdquo;.  According to the OECD's recent report on European and world countries, ours is the most under-funded primary education system in the developed world.</P>
      <P>Nine out of ten primary schools are involved in fund raising.  This has always been part of the operation of primary schools, but in recent times fund raising has been directed towards providing heat, light and sanitation.  I said yesterday that between a third and a half of all grants available to primary schools are spent on insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of a TV licence to a school of 20 or 30 pupils is equal to the total grant for two of those pupils, making a serious inroad into the money the school has available.  The need for a licence would be understandable if televisions were used generally in the school but because <Col N="241" /> there are no educational programmes available, it is not.  Televisions are only used to show BBC programmes in schools with large outside aerials or, usually, with video machines.</P>
    <P>Generous parents have provided some schools with television sets either through fund-raising or by donating a barely working TV set from the home.  The school then borrows a video machine from a teacher, principal or parent to show educational videos.  These people are now required to have TV licences.  This is grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>Recently I was advised that a school, which does not have a television, was being pressured to obtain a TV licence. The reason was there was a broken piece of aerial protruding from the roof of the school; at one time the school had a licence.  However, under the legislation, the holding of an aerial or part of a receiver or even a monitor or screen requires a TV licence.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of computer facilities in primary schools.  Many schools are endeavouring to raise funds for some form of computer facilities in order to provide children with practical experience. Such schools are stretched in this regard through organising a range of fund raising events such as cake sales, sponsored walks and sales of work.  When these schools obtain the necessary equipment, part of that equipment includes a monitor which is not used as a television. Because of this they are being pressured to obtain TV licences.  This amounts to an extraordinary tax on education within the State system.</P>
    <P>I hope that in his response the Minister will not elaborate on the provisions contained in the relevant legislation.  I contacted the Department of Education this morning and requested them when formulating a reply not to advise on what is already known.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not allow for any exceptions to be made in regard to TV licences.  It requires those using a television to have a TV licence.  The Minister will note that I have not requested that schools be exempted from having TV licences and I hope his response will not be to advise me of that position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> My proposal is that schools be issued with TV licences by the Department of Education, or by the Department of Education negotiating a licence with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications for all schools or by the two Departments negotiating a fee or transfer of resources or notional transfer of money to allow individual licences to be issued to the 3,000 or more primary schools.  This proposal is clear and simple and should resolve an issue of concern to schools.  It is a particular problem in County Galway and County Cork and in the areas around County Louth and County Monaghan.  The problem arises because An Post has targeted primary schools as an area where it will earn more revenue from TV licences.  While not criticising An Post in this regard, I believe this needs some form of regulation by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is possible that court cases may arise from this issue.  I am aware that two schools have indicated that they do not have the money for a TV licence.  Action will have to be taken against these schools.  Will such action be directed at the chairperson of the school board, who is usually the parish priest, the principal of the school, a class teacher, a member of the board of management or the patron, usually the bishop, as owner of the school?</P>
    <P>The only positive developments on this issue has been the initiative by the Minister for Education, for which I compliment her, that schools designated as disadvantaged who require a TV licence will be refunded the cost.  However, there are approximately 200 schools in that category throughout the country out of approximately 3,000 schools altogether. It is, therefore, necessary to act quickly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in his reply at least to provide a commitment that the Department of Education will put a proposal to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to resolve this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  No doubt, he is aware that legislation would need amendment in order to exempt schools <Col N="243" /> from the purchase of TV licences.  Also under present legislation there is no distinction made between television sets used as monitors for videos and those used to receive television programmes; therefore, an amendment would be required for such exemption.</P>
      <P>Such changes would be a matter for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and not for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications as suggested.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the cost of a licence is set out in Government regulations.  Therefore, it would not be possible to arrange for a national fee to apply to schools which would be different from what is already prescribed.  The Department of Education consulted with the relevant Department and have been informed that under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1988 all apparatus must be licensed and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has no power to exempt television sets used for specific purposes from the licensing requirement.</P>
      <P>They are of the view that schools are just one of the many institutions and categories of person that would regard themselves as worthy of exemption.  They also consider that the removal of the necessity for the payment of television licence fees would have to be compensated for from other sources, for example, from the general body of licence payers through increased licence fees or by means of subvention from the provisions of another Department.</P>
      <P>I certainly can see some merit in their arguments.  As a general issue I am of the view that such payments should be covered as a cost to the school in its normal operation.  Such cost are assisted by way of the capitation grant and I wish again to remind the Senator that I secured a substantial increase in the grant for 1993.  This is a recognition of the need for extra funds in this area and I will continue to improve this grant, as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course I accept that arrangements could be made to cover the cost of TV <Col N="244" /> licences for schools by recouping, from the Department of Education to An Post the relevant amount.  Thus, schools would have a &ldquo;free&rdquo; licence but this would mean a further drain on our resources.  I know the Senator has expressed the view on numerous occasions that the resources available are already inadequate.</P>
    <P>The view of the Minister for Education is that the licence fee should be paid directly by the school in the ordinary way as with any other operational cost. However, in line with my policy of priority assistance and extra support to the disadvantaged I decided, exceptionally, that in schools designated as disadvantaged there was merit in covering the cost of licences.  Arrangements for this are being put in place at present and will help those in the schools in these disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked for a commitment which, regrettably, I am not in a position to give.  However, I personally believe that there is merit in the Senator's suggestion and that perhaps some mechanism can be considered in the future to facilitate a phasing in of this proposal.  I will bring the Senator's views to the attention of officials in the Department of Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am obviously unhappy with it and I would ask him to take one message back to the Department of Education.  In view of the unemployment problem there is a consensus that there should be more computerisation and technology in education. However, those who take the trouble to raise money for computers in schools are being asked to pay an extra tax of £66 on top of costs already incurred.  This is wrong, it is counterproductive and is against national policy. The National Economic and Social Forum was established yesterday; yet, efforts being made to give people practical experience in job creativity are penalised.  It is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 29 June 1993.</P>
