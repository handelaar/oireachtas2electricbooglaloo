      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to ensure payment of all headage grants before Christmas.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We must deal with all Stages of the two Bills before the House today.  We do not want to conduct our business in this way, but it is part of the system and has been for the last 20 years. Each year we receive calls from Ministers' offices to say we must have a certain number of Bills passed by the end of the year.  Therefore, today we are dealing with all Stages of the two Bills in the time allowed and I hope the House agrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure everyone will want an opportunity to discuss yesterday's historic <Col N="1614" /> statement but I suggest that we wait until next week because I hope we will receive a positive response from the men of violence over the weekend.  We will be in a good position to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.</P>
    <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 1993, all Stages, between now and 1 p.m. I suggest a time limit of 15 minutes per spokesperson and ten minutes thereafter. Item 2, the Greyhound Industry (Amendment) Bill, 1993, all Stages, from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., or later if needed. The Adjournment will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business the House sent its good wishes to the Taoiseach and Tanáiste for their talks in London.  This morning all parties would like to join in congratulating the Taoiseach, the Tanáiste and their team on a good day's work which is for the good of all people in this country.  It is also important to remember that what happened yesterday is only the beginning of a process to establish a framework.  It is not a submission and a lot of hard work must be done between now and the attaining of concrete results. We also send our wishes to those who are involved in that process.  I agree with the Leader of the House that it would be better to have a debate on this issue next week after we have had time to reflect on the situation.  I hope we have a full, comprehensive and constructive debate on this subject next week.</P>
      <P>In the spirit prevailing today and in view of the non-contentious nature of the legislation, I will not oppose taking the two Bills.  Senator Quinn said yesterday that it may be useful to have a break between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It would help if this could be arranged by the Whips.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House said, and I agree with him, that each year legislation is rushed through the House.  At the beginning of each session we warn that this will happen and every year Bills come late to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1615" /> I want to refer briefly to next week's business, although it is not appropriate to today's Order of Business.  Next week a number of Bills must be passed.  We have been told that the Attorney General wants a particular Bill passed by the end of the year.  If this is the case, why did the Bill not come to the House earlier? Why should this House bear the brunt of the incompetence of Departments who rush in at the end of the year and expect us to rubber stamp their legislation?  I know this is not the Leader's fault and it has been happening for a long time.  I resent being told by civil servants in a roundabout way that the Minister or the Attorney General must have a Bill by a certain date.  Why must he have it by a certain date?  Why was it not introduced earlier?  All parties share the grievance about being used in this way by Departments. I want a fuller explanation from the Attorney General as to why this Bill is so urgent and must be passed next week.</P>
    <P>I also signalled yesterday that there is increasing unease among Members of all parties about certain sections of the Bill dealing with the allowance for office holders which will be before the House next week.  I refer to the position of secretaries. It would be useful to have an all party discussion on that before the Bill is presented to the House.  I am aware, from conversations with people from all parties, that there is a great deal of unease and unhappiness about some of the proposals contained in two sections of the Bill; everyone knows the two sections to which I refer.  The implications of the Bill should be teased out. It should not be rushed through.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am interested to note that the intervention of my colleague, Senator Taylor-Quinn, has had some effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the comments by the Leader of the House about delaying the discussion on Northern Ireland until next week, I agree and I repeat and support Senator Manning's comments as to how pleased we are at the marvellous achievement of being able to get a joint declaration agreed between two Governments that, we hope, will bring peace to this island.</P>
      <P>I am torn between whether we should delay speaking on this issue until next week or use this opportunity to speak on it in order to influence those we wish to influence.  I accept and understand the reason we should delay but I am a little concerned that we are delaying until we get a response.  I believe it is the duty of this House to influence that response.  I hope we will discuss this issue in a positive way, and that every word spoken in the House will play a part in bringing peace to this island.</P>
      <P>May I repeat my concern regarding the reference to taking all Stages of the Bills? I understand the comments of the Leader of the House.  However, if the Departments are pressing the Leader for all Stages to be passed, it should be possible to divide them during this week or next week to ensure that there is only a gap of a few minutes between Stages.  I understand from Senator Manning that this is a regular occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had planned to speak on the GATT debate last night, but realised that the GATT agreement had occurred only an hour or two ahead of time and I was unaware of the details of that agreement. It appears to me that if we are going to use GATT as a benefit for this country, now that we know the content of the agreement, we would welcome an opportunity to speak on it; regrettably, the motion last night was debated at the same time as the GATT agreement was successfully concluded.  Perhaps we will have an opportunity to recognise the benefits <Col N="1617" /> for us as a nation in GATT and to return to that subject on a future occasion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mixed views on deferring the debate on Northern Ireland until next week.  However, I take the Leader's point that it would be useful to reflect on it in the interim.  We all welcome the joint declaration between Mr. Major and the Taoiseach.  I am sure our hope is that it will advance the cause of peace.  I believe it re-emphasises a point made in the House when we condemned the Shankill bombing, and that the message remains unchanged: give up violence. That is the simple message from this House and if the issue is to be debated today that is the message that will go out from this House.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to deal with this matter by way of a new motion or a separate matter, rather than a resumption of Item 11 on the Order Paper, because people who have already spoken may wish to speak again.</P>
      <P>There has been a pre-emptive strike by the Leader in relation to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>He is very good at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noticed that.  The House is to take two Bill through all Stages today.  To take one Bill in this way is bad, but, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to take two looks like downright carelessness. There is an important principle involved in dealing with Bills in this way, it can lead to bad legislation.  A classic example was the rod licence issue which was caused by rushing a Bill through both Houses at the end of session.  This is something we need to bear in mind.  The Leader has said he considers it is undesirable to handle business in this manner.  I put it to him that he needs to be cautious in handling it in this way, because it will meet stiff resistance from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There appears to be an attitude in some quarters within this Administration that <Col N="1618" /> the Oireachtas is an inconvenient irrelevancy. That is a dangerous view to take in a democracy because this is where the law is made, not in the offices.  It is important to state that fact.</P>
    <P>I hope all Members will join with me in welcoming Mr. Yassar Arafat to this country.  Hopefully his stay will be productive. The EU has an important responsibility in providing the funding to making a Palestinian State viable.  In welcoming Mr. Arafat may I congratulate Senator Lanigan for his efforts over the years in advancing the cause of Palestinian self-determination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government made two decisions affecting Ireland this week: one is welcome but I believe the other should be condemned.  The decision we all welcome is the joint declaration by the Irish and British Governments. The decision we should condemn is the commissioning of the THORP nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield.  It is unbelievable that even after Chernobyl we have on our doorstep a nuclear rubbish been which is coming into commission this week.  This House should debate this issue at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the remarks by the Leader of the House on the joint declaration and his proposal for a debate on the issue.  I have also listened to Senator Manning's comments. However, like Senator Quinn and Senator Dardis I have reservations about postponing a debate for a week in order that we might think about the issue and make a considered response.</P>
      <P>A week might be too late.  I believe it would be better if this House, today, tells the men of violence where the finger now points &mdash; stop today.  Next week their response may be negative and we will have missed the boat.  I earnestly plead that we be afforded an opportunity today, if only for 15 minutes, to make our case in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can speak with more conviction and authority than Senator Wilson.  My disposition is to support <Col N="1619" /> the comments of the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition. However, if we simply need to say stop, I believe that the view of this House can be proclaimed now.  We have said what we have to say on this issue in the House many times.  I do not know if it takes a debate to do it, but I believe we could almost resolve, by unanimous consent, that this is one universal wish of this House and that it would be given with all the force of our authority.  However, I agree with the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition that we might be in a better position next week to make proposals which will create permanent conditions for the securing of the peace, for which such magnificent work was done by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>I was privileged to be in London on an Anglo-Irish delegation in the House of Commons.  There was a feeling of history there.  I believe all of us, and all parliamentary houses, have an obligation to work to create conditions to secure peace.  Therefore, I look forward to a debate next week, but if there is to be motion this morning I believe the House would unanimously support it.</P>
      <P>May I express the hope that over the weekend the media at home will take a more restrained view than they have sometimes done. <i>The Sunday Independent</i> in particular made highly personalised criticisms on this issue.  I hope it will refrain from doing so and act responsibly.  Words can kill and if motives are ascribed to certain people, they may be targeted in a way the newspapers did not contemplate.  I heard some evidence of that in London yesterday.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the visit of Mr. Yasser Arafat.  In 1979 at the UN, I had the privilege of being the first President of the Council of Ministers to mention the PLO.  That was regarded as a breakthrough. It is wonderful to see him here this morning as an emissary of peace and I hope we will also be able to act on the principles of peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with other speakers in regard to the joint declaration.  The unprecedented level of agreement on all sides in both Houses is most encouraging. The debate should be held at a later stage because, at present, peace in Ireland depends on the IRA and Sinn Féin.  We hope they respond positively.</P>
      <P>The other matter is the visit to Ireland of Mr. Arafat.  I was a member of a delegation which went to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip three years ago.  It was great to see the progress made there but unfortunately, matters have not developed as quickly as perhaps they should.  However, Mr. Arafat is a survivor and I hope everything will work out properly.  I am delighted he is in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the rest of the House in congratulating the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, for their conviction and courage in seeking peace.  It must be recognised we are starting a process and that there can be further dialogue in the eventual peaceful conditions.  I also join Senator Dardis and other Members in welcoming Mr. Arafat to the Oireachtas and in paying tribute to Senator Lanigan.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that the House has a debate in the new year to encourage the Government to ask the European Commission to take action against the proliferation of nuclear energy plants in Europe, especially those near our coast, such as THORP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>My two points are related.  I thank the Members who have welcomed the visit of Mr. Arafat.  That should be seen in the context of the superb work done by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and everyone involved in securing a declaration which may bring a peaceful resolution to the problems on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peace process between the Palestinians and the Israelis, like the process in Ireland, has just started.  The current process in the Middle East is not the end of conflict, although some have called it that.  It is not even the beginning of the <Col N="1621" /> end of conflict, it is the beginning of a peace process.</P>
    <P>It is historically symbolic that the peace delegation from the Middle East should be here on the day after Mr. Major and the Taoiseach signed an accord which might give hope to Senator Wilson, the people of this island and western Europe. I hope the courageous work of the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister, their Ministers and advisers will lead to a peaceful resolution to the problems on this and other islands.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Leader that we should perhaps reflect before speaking.  The sentiments of this House are to tell the men of violence on all sides to stop the murder.  We can speak for hours but if we simply say &ldquo;stop the carnage&rdquo;, that will be enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that representatives of all groups in this House should welcome yesterday's declaration by the two Governments.  I agree with Senator O'Kennedy we should tell the terrorists this is an opportunity for them as well as us.  That may be enough to say today because this is the beginning of an ongoing process.  By next week there may have been further developments and enough material for a full debate.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the visit of Mr. Arafat at this appropriate, historical moment. While there are differences there are also many parallels between the problems in our two parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I join speakers in congratulating the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on successfully concluding the joint declaration.  The House should pay special attention to the views of Senator Wilson on this matter.  I suggest to the Leader that the Whips should find space in today's business for discussion on the North to begin and then continue next week.  Perhaps that could happen between the two Bills or at the conclusion of business.  Considerable weight should be attached to Senator Wilson's belief that it is imperative the views of this House should be expressed today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome next week's debate on Northern Ireland.  We should have an opportunity to express our views. I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on their handling of these sensitive and difficult negotiations.  I hope Sinn Féin and the IRA show an equal sensitivity, although they have not shown it in their use of language, which is still hectoring and bullying.  They use words like &ldquo;require&rdquo; but they are not in a position to &ldquo;require&rdquo; anything.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the visit of Mr. Arafat. I understand there will be an announcement about the establishment of diplomatic representation between the Palestinian people and the Israelis in Ireland.  I have been campaigning for this for many years in a climate of hostility towards the State of Israel and this is a positive development which I welcome.</P>
      <P>On the way in to the House this morning we passed a gentle picket we should consider.  A well-known Irish literary personality is carrying a placard appealing to us to do something about the children begging on such a widespread scale throughout our city.  Perhaps in the new year we could have a debate about this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the many contributions this morning on yesterday's joint declaration, this House formally urges an ending to the violence there. Senator Wilson, Senator Manning and Senator O'Kennedy all referred to it and we will debate the issue in greater detail next week.  The all-party support for this measure is important and welcome and will help get this message across.  The motion for this debate next week will be a new motion, not Item 11 on today's Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Magner, I strongly condemn the decision to proceed with the THORP.  It is unwelcome and disappointing.  I hope the Government and other interested parties will find some way of stopping that development.</P>
      <P>Finally, I welcome President Arafat and I sincerely hope his visit will lead to more positive decisions.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, is mór agam an deis seo a fháil chun an díospóireacht ar an mBille um Bord Scannán na hÉireann (Leasú), 1993, a oscailt go hoifigiúil anseo i Seanad Éireann agus tá mé ag súil anois le túairimí Sheanadóirí a fháil ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.</P>
      <P>Níl ach aidhm amháin ag an mBille seo atá ós comhair an tSeanaid inniu.  Is í an aidhm sin ná méadú a dhéanamh ar an méid airgid &mdash; idir infheistíochtaí, iasachtaí, deontais, nó aon freagrachtaí eile &mdash; gur féidir le Bord Scannán na hÉireann a chaitheamh sna blianta atá romhainn.  Is é an t-uasmhéid gur féidir leis an mBord a chaitheamh sa tslí seo faoi Alt 10 den Act um Bord Scannán na hÉireann, 1980, ná £4,100,000.  Tá an t-uasmhéid sin bainte amach anois i mbliana, agus tá mé ag moladh don Oireachtas sa Bhille seo go n-árdofaí an t-uasmhéid seo go dtí £15,000,000.  Má ghlacann an Seanad leis an mBille seo, leanfar leis an gcóras faoina gcuirfear an ciste airgeadais do Bhord Scannan na hÉireann os comhair na Dála gach bliain faoi Vóta 42 de na Meastacháin don Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to open this debate on Second Stage of the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 1993, and I look forward to hearing the views of this House on the future priorities and needs of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 1993, is to increase the limit of the total amount of funds which can be expended by way of investments, loans grants or other liabilities, by Bord Scannán na hÉireann &mdash; the Irish Film Board &mdash; under section 10 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, from the present limit of £4.1 million to £15 million. I must emphasise to Senators in this context that the Bill before the House is <Col N="1624" /> enabling legislation which does not automatically give rise to Exchequer costs. However, in raising this limit on the amount of funds which the board can spend, the provisions of section 5 of the 1980 Act remain in force.  Section 5 provides that &ldquo;the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may from time to time make out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, grants to the board to enable it to perform its functions and to meet its administrative and general expenses&rdquo;.  If Oireachtas approval is given to the Bill now before the Seanad, the effect of raising the limit of the amount to be spent by the board to £15 will be that, through the annual Estimates process, Dáil Éireann can vote moneys to the board annually &mdash; through the Vote for An Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta &mdash; up to this new limit. However, since the £4.1 million limit under section 10 of the 1980 Act has now been exhausted, it will not be possible to provide funds for the Irish Film Board in 1994 or subsequent years unless this limit is increased, as envisaged in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that I have only recently had the opportunity to come before this House &mdash; on 24 November to be precise &mdash; to discuss a motion on film and broadcasting in Ireland.  I availed of that opportunity to place on the record of the House a detailed account of the range of measures which I had already taken to promote the Irish film and audio-visual industry which involved the re-establishment of the Irish Film Board, the enactment of new broadcasting legislation and significant tax concessions in the 1993 Finance Act last June.  In the meantime, the Government has approved my proposals for the new Teilefís na Gaeilge service.  Senators will be pleased to learn that I do not propose to take up their valuable time today in repeating my earlier contribution.  Suffice it to say that the Bill before the House is a key element&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the integrated package of policy initiatives which I believe are necessary to place the industry on a sound footing, commercially and artistically.  I can, therefore, confidently recommend the Bill to the House and stress the urgent need for its enactment.</P>
      <P>It is no exaggeration to say that the Irish film and audio-visual industry has had a chequered history in terms of the policies which successive Governments have pursued to develop it.  This history, frankly, has led to many disappointments and even failures, but remarkably, it has also left our country with the basic infrastructure for an industry still intact, in terms of management and financial expertise; experience with the complex regime of co-productions and the requirements of the European market in particular; a continuing wealth of creative and artistic talent in the preproduction, production and post-production processes of individual projects; an important film studio facility which exists at Ardmore, County Wicklow and a strengthening relationship between our national broadcasting organisation, Radio Telefís Éireann, and the independent television production sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the creation of an Irish film industry perhaps began with the making of the first indigenous films by Denis Johnston and Tom Cooper in 1935, followed by a series of unco-ordinated developments.  These included interventions by American film companies making films on Irish subjects; efforts at home to establish cinema newsreels, support documentaries and Irish language initiatives, most notably by Gael Linn, who deserve our gratitude for their marvellously evocative films such as <i>Mise Éire</i> and <i>Saoirse</i>; several efforts were made to place Ardmore on a sound commercial footing, involving State intervention in some instances; the establishment of Telefís Éireann in 1961; the Huston report on the film industry in 1968; the inclusion of film in the Arts Act of 1972, enabling An Chomhairle Ealaíon to promote low budget films since then; the establishment of Bord Scannán na hÉireann &mdash; the Irish Film <Col N="1626" /> Board &mdash; in 1980; its replacement in 1987 by a tax-based incentive for corporate investment in Irish film projects; leading us to the obstacles to the industry's commercial and artistic development which I, as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, have identified and the measures which I have promptly put in place to address these obstacles.  I intend to continue at the same pace.  I will be delighted to tell the House later that a number of further initiatives may be taken in the course of the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>The report of the special working group on the film production industry, which was submitted to the Taoiseach last Christmas Eve, played a pivotal role in highlighting the obstacles to the industry's development and, notably, in recommending the establishment of a dedicated film fund which would, in turn, be administered by a dedicated State agency.  Since the 1980 legislation dealing with the Irish Film Board was still on the Statute Book, I decided immediately to reactivate the board and, with the broadcasting and tax measures, create a strong momentum which I am confident will serve at last to place this industry on a process of sustained development.</P>
    <P>I had no hesitation in taking this course of action, instead of, perhaps, enacting legislation to establish a new dedicated State agency, because I have always felt that the first Irish Film Board was not treated fairly.  I had a high regard for its performance and I believe that, in retrospect, the expectations for the first film board were probably unrealistic.  It is now demonstrably clear that there was an over emphasis on the direct commercial aspects of the film industry, without having due regard to the significant spin-off advantages which it can bring to our economy in terms of employment creation and value added, not to mention the unquantifiable but equally important contribution which investment in Irish films can make to the flourishing of our culture and the telling of our story to a contemporary audience.  Cultural rights have at their root recognition of the right to tell one's own story.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> Senators should also be aware that, apart from supporting screen plays and film and television projects, the board also ran notable training courses, especially for producers, many of whom were later to achieve international acclaim.  It helped in the establishment of a national film archive; provided a presence for Ireland at markets and festivals abroad; assisted Irish film festivals and events; and formed co-production partnerships and contacts with the international film sector.</P>
    <P>In the course of its life, the first board supported over 25 shorts and documentaries and enabled more than 12 feature length films to reach cinema and television screens at home and around the world.  It achieved an approximate 10 per cent return on its investment, raised the level of skills and employment, enabled new facility houses to contribute to the economy and gave a start to many careers as well as encouraging talent which is, happily, still with us.</P>
    <P>The board was also involved in the early negotiations for Ireland's participation in the very successful MEDIA programme of the European Union.  The significance of this was that, in what I might describe as the lean years for the Irish film and audio-visual industry from 1987 onwards, the MEDIA programme was, apart from grants from An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the Arts Council for low budget films over those years, the only source of direct funding to our Irish industry practitioners.  Indeed, such was the dearth of funding for our practitioners at that time, they wholeheartedly became involved in the MEDIA programme, As a result, it is estimated that Irish projects and audio-visual professionals in this country received some £1.8 million in the form of loans and repayable grants from the programme in 1991 and 1992.  At a time when none of the measures which I promoted was in place, Senators will appreciate this was a significant source of funding for our industry.  Moreover, the success of this first major encounter with the European audio-visual industry <Col N="1628" /> prompted the Government to join EURIMAGES, the Council of Europe's co-production fund for cinematographic co-productions. EURIMAGES will have a budget of over £15 million next year and I am pleased to inform Senators that, since joining the fund in September 1992, three of the four Irish films which submitted applications for assistance have been successful.</P>
    <P>As a follow up to the re-establishment of the Irish Film Board, I have taken steps to ensure that the considerable investment which the State is now putting into the Irish film and audio-visual industry &mdash; directly by way of seed funding and indirectly by way of tax concessions and programme commissioning by RTE and the new Teilifís na Gaeilge service &mdash; will be complemented by the activities of other relevant agencies in the semi-State sector.  It is enormously important that all remaining obstacles to the full development of the industry be tackled over time.  Among these remaining obstacles, I cite the absence of a film commission in the semi-State sector which would facilitate offshore and indigenous production companies; the need for new training strategies for the industry; the whole question of distribution of Irish films for Irish audiences, including metropolitan-regional imbalances; the promotion of Irish films abroad; and the question of the Irish language and film.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that I have secured nominations from the relevant Ministers and senior officials of the semi-State sector who will participate in a new committee established by the Irish Film Board under section 16 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980.  This committee will address the issues I have just listed, as well as other issues, over time.  The committee is chaired by the Irish Film Board and comprises senior representatives of Radio Telefís Éireann, Údarás na Gaeltachta, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Industrial Development Authority, FÁS, An Bord Tráchtála and Bord Fáilte.  My Department is also represented on the committee.  It will serve to complement my own policy initiatives by monitoring the industry's progress and <Col N="1629" /> responding to its requirements over time. Most importantly, it will send out a strong message that this Government is in earnest about the future development of the film and audio-visual sector and that, for the first time in the history of this State, we are treating the sector for what it is &mdash; an industry in its own right which has now attracted an integrated package of incentives to ensure that it makes a significant contribution to the economic and social progress of the State.  This committee, therefore, will act as an important proactive mechanism for the industry.</P>
    <P>One of the more important subjects I expect this committee to address in the short term is the whole question of the training needs of the industry.  I am setting out to achieve the creation of a new generation of Irish film practitioners who will work side by side with established practitioners and, I hope, secure a self-sustaining high level of activity in the industry for the future.  It follows that we must now examine whether the existing training components of the industry &mdash; which are currently either industry led or involve educational courses in some of our third level colleges, with almost no direct involvement by FÁS &mdash; are sufficient to match the expected uptake in demand for skilled practitioners.  I expect this new committee, which includes a representative from FÁS, to address this issue as a matter of urgency.  Given FÁS's overall remit to assist in meeting the training needs of industry in general, I am hopeful they will be in a position to respond to this crucial aspect of the industry's future development over time.</P>
    <P>Another important link in the chain of promoting the industry and monitoring its progress is now being put in place. The Audio-visual Production Federation of IBEC, in full consultation with my Department and the Irish Film Board, has devised an economic database.  Information to be supplied by all practitioners in receipt of State support for their projects &mdash; whether in the form of direct film board assistance, section 35 finance or programme commissioning from either RTE or Teilifís na Gaeilge &mdash; will form part of the database.  I warmly welcome <Col N="1630" /> this initiative and I believe it will represent an important instrument to illustrate to the taxpayer the return, in terms of employment creation and value added to the economy, which their considerable investment in the industry is making. Indeed, the economic data which this database will provide will be crucial for me in my ongoing discussions with my ministerial colleagues as the direct and indirect needs of the industry from year to year arise.  I am preparing submissions.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated my remarks so far largely on the recognition which this Government has placed on the potential for growth and employment which the art form of film now holds.  However, Senators will be pleased to learn that I am not overlooking the fact that film is an important art form in its own right. Indeed, the centenary of the cinema will be celebrated throughout Europe during 1995 and 1996 in recognition of its past glories and achievements.  Ireland will take part in these celebrations.  The measure before the House in no way diminishes the responsibility of the Irish Film Board, under section 4(2) of the 1980 Act, to have regard to the need for the expression of national culture through the medium of film making, in so far as it considers it appropriate.  In this context, I look to the board in its future activities to strike a balance between cultural and commercial aspects of film making and so create a fresh and vibrant synthesis in this long standing discourse.  I should add that the special working group on the film production industry also identified the creation of such a synthesis as a key element of the new funding structures which they recommended in their report.</P>
    <P>I believe it is also important to clarify for Senators what role An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council, will have now that the Irish Film Board has been reestablished. Since the Arts Act, 1972, film had been included among the arts disciplines which An Chomhairle can address.  Since then, An Chomhairle has played an important role in funding film related organisations in an effort to create a coherent infrastructure in the <Col N="1631" /> areas of exhibition, preservation, training, education, information and support for film-making of artistic value.  This involved some £100,000 per annum to film makers on a non-repayable grant basis and approximately 12 awards were given each year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform Senators that I foresee no change whatsoever in the role of A Chomhairle Ealaíon in relation to film and film-making, notwithstanding the re-establishment of the Irish Film Board.  An Chomhairle can be proud of the role it has played in such projects as the magnificent Irish Film Centre in Dublin and in providing funding for new Irish film makers for many years.  It is crucially important, both from a cultural and an educational and training perspective, that the production of shorts and low budget indigenous films is supported and I foresee An Chomhairle Ealaíon continuing to play an important role in this area.  The House can be assured, therefore, that the emphasis on the cultural significance of film making both under the Arts Act, 1972, and the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, will facilitate the achievement of an adequate balance between the cultural as well as the commercial aspects of the film making.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to refer to the GATT negotiations which were concluded last night.  I have been amused by the fact that it is only in the past week or so that the media here have become aware of the critical issues at stake for the European audio-visual industry in these negotiations.  I, on the other hand, have been articulating and developing my views on this matter since I took office both during the Danish Presidency and especially during the Belgian Presidency of the European Union when issues involved began to move to centre stage in the negotiations.  That involved a combination of two fundamental issues.</P>
    <P>The issue of culture, the right to make images and the right to have a plurality of image making, can be made concrete by the fact that 81.06 per cent of all images seen in Europe are sourced in North America.  Some 91 per cent of films <Col N="1632" /> seen in Ireland and 93 per cent in Britain are sourced there.  There is a domination in relation to the images available.  The commercial argument concerns jobs in the audio-visual industry in Europe.  Will these jobs be in Europe or in North America?  People will know from newspaper reports the size of the balance; £3.66 billion comes from the US to Europe, while £288 million leaves Europe for the US. Senators will be familiar with arguments made in this regard.</P>
    <P>I addressed these issues from a cultural and economic perspective during the Danish Presidency.  We are indebted to a special seminar held during the Belgian Presidency at Mons.  The position was concentrated and various countries took different positions, for example, the French position was strengthened. Ireland had already adopted a position in relation to State aid, plurality, dubbing European films in Europe rather than the US and the purchase of film rights both in terms of its cultural and employment aspects.  It is an interesting concentration of European thinking.</P>
    <P>Something which concentrated many of minds during the Danish Presidency was the fact that 72 per cent of images seen in Europe were sourced in North America and watched on machines which were 84 per cent sourced in Japan.  European cultural space is in between.  There is a strong cultural argument and an immense commercial argument because hundreds and thousands of jobs are at stake.  This concerns not only cultural rights, but it also has an economic dimension.</P>
    <P>Since taking office I advocated and supported in all relevant fora that European producers of audio-visual material should have adequate space for European programming on our television screens.  One of the reasons for this was that our position was ahead of and, in some respects, different from the French position.  The French position was based on an anxiety to preserve what is one of the surviving pillars of the European film industry.</P>
    <P>We must maintain existing programmes, both European and national. <Col N="1633" /> We must support and develop the industry and allow flexibility so we can vary and develop these programmes as appropriate in the future.  As Senators will know, there were three positions: exclusion, exemption and specificity. While it will be necessary to study the fine print of the agreement just concluded, I am satisfied on the basis of assurances given by the Commission to the Presidency of the European Union yesterday that, in the audio-visual sector, the agreement gives us complete freedom to pursue current and future policies in all areas of relevance to the industry and represents a satisfactory outcome to the negotiations for the industry.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to inform the House that I have obtained Government approval to prepare and publish a Green Paper on future broadcasting structures and policy.  Senators will be aware that. for some time, I have been undertaking a review of this policy.  In view of its complex nature and the enormous technological advances which have visited broadcasting in recent years and can be expected in the future, I believe that the consultative process which is implicit in the publication of a Green Paper will enable me to arrive at the best conclusions for the future policy orientations of this important sector.  This initiative is yet one more example of my resolve to address the needs of the film and audio-visual industry, as well as broadcasting policy in its own right, in a comprehensive fashion over time.  Work on the preparation of a Green Paper will proceed in the months to come.</P>

      <P>There is nobody in this House or in the country who does not wish the Minister well in his endeavours <Col N="1634" /> to develop a strong film industry.  Indeed, we all appreciate the sincerity with which he approaches this problem.  His Second Stage speech has shown energy and imagination in regard to where he wants to see the film industry in the future. However, he did not offer any specific or practical projections in relation to prospects for the film industry.</P>
      <P>There is an acceptance among all parties that it would be healthy to encourage development of this industry if it provides employment and, what the Minister called, spin-off effects.  While it is a &ldquo;good thing&rdquo; that its future is in doubt, we should not take it for granted that the film industry and the Irish Film Board which the Minister has re-established will be successful.</P>
      <P>I would like to see specific projections for the future of this industry.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we are entitled to those projections.  We are being asked to extend the expenditure potential of the Irish Film Board by a massive amount.  The Minister said &mdash; and this is cause for alarm &mdash; that the £4.1 million which the board was entitled to spend has been spent and he is asking us to authorise another £11 million while saying the Bill may not necessarily cost the Exchequer money and it will not until the Exchequer calls it in.  We are entitled to know about what the Minister called an over-emphasis on commercial aspects. I think we are entitled to be told exactly what the commercial implications of this Bill are.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Minister, I look forward to your reply.  I think we are also entitled to know what the Irish Film Board committee, which the Minister is setting up, is going to do.  The Minister described it in rather vague terms when <Col N="1635" /> he said he was pleased to have secured nominations from various Departments to the committee.  He went on to state that: &ldquo;the committee is being chaired by the Irish Film Board and comprises senior representatives of Radio Telefís Éireann, Údarás na Gaeltachta....&rdquo;, and he went on to mention various other semi-State bodies.  That sounds like a nightmare to me but probably sounds like paradise to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The disease has caught me badly.  While I accept the Minister and I would disagree on the great benefits of a super quango of extraordinarily able people from these nightmare-type bodies, I would like to know exactly what it is going to do.  Its terms of reference are very vague.  The Minister also said: &ldquo;It will serve to complement my own policy initiatives by monitoring the industry's progress and responding to its requirements over time.&rdquo;  He went on to say that the Film Board will send out a message that the Government is committed to the film industry.  We know that, we do not doubt the commitment of the Minister and the Government to the film industry, that is why we are here today, but I cannot understand what this committee is going to do, apart from giving the impression of activity which is a permanent and disastrous feature of semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>The Minister might have been better off calling on the private sector to give advice and insist that commercial criteria are paramount.  There is an enormous danger that the money we are talking about will be used for extremely patriotic and worthy objectives but will not do anything except create an artificial film industry.  The Minister was loud in his praise of the last Film Board which was a failure.  The last Film Board was set up, I think &mdash; and the Minister will correct. me &mdash; in 1982 and lasted five years until 1987.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the last Film Board was closed down in 1987 because it was judged by the Government of the day not to have given a return on the State's investment at the time.  It should be pointed out that the great successes of the Irish film industry have occurred outside the period of the Film Board. Films like <i>My Left Foot, The Field</i>, and <i>Hear My Song</i> were produced without subsidy or advice from the Film Board, and these are Oscar-winning Irish films which have received international acclaim.</P>

      <P>Section 35 was expanded in the last Finance Act so that the risk of the company could also be taken on by the risk of the individual, as the Minister is aware.  I do not understand why, if he makes that commitment, he cannot give a greater commitment to tax incentives. <i>Eat The Peach</i> was funded under the BES as the Minister knows.  Section 35 of the Finance Act has been used by companies in the past but the dangers of going two ways are that film makers will rely too much on grants, loans and the Film Board and too little on their own initiative.  State support of this sort is very dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already promised that a great deal of RTE's profits will go to <Col N="1637" /> the independent film producers.  We are in danger of creating an artificial film industry which is not subject to serious commercial criteria but instead is directed by the Minister's enormous energy, enthusiasm and political views to which he has every right but with which I would disagree.  In the end it will collapse under the same weight of semi-State inefficiency as the last board.  That is the danger the Minister will have to accept.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should recognise that other sources of funding are seeking homes for venture capital of this sort.  There are banks with money to lend, and all sorts of organisations with hundreds of millions of pounds in venture capital funds, not only in Ireland but <Col N="1638" /> internationally.  For some reason, however, they do not consider it worthwhile to invest in the Irish film industry and the reason is very simple: they do not think they will get a return on their money.  This Bill, which increases the amount of money that can be spent by the Film Board, is the last resort of the Minister because nobody else will produce money for the Film Board.  That is a <i>caveat</i> the Minister must recognise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be over-subscribed but it is a <i>caveat</i> which must be recognised because the Irish film industry has not been able to attract capital in the past which the Minister's feels it has merited. That is the reality.  We can have all the vision and ideas in the world to attract a certain amount of capital but we must demand a commercial return if the Minister is to get a successful Film Board.  Its beginnings must be modest because the Irish Film Board has failed in the past. In future it must be subject to far greater and more stringent monitoring than in I the first five years.</P>

      <P>I am all for positive thinking and here is a golden opportunity. This Bill is to put the industry on a sound footing.  It is an integrated package of policy initiatives that I welcome. The Minister spoke of the fragmented efforts and long history of events through which our film industry has gone. <Col N="1639" /> We have interjections here and there from American film companies and Gael Linn has also played its part in films like <i>Mise Eire</i> and <i>Saoirse</i>.  These were very good films which attracted international attention.</P>
      <P>Ardmore Studios opened in 1958 and Telefís Éireann came into being in 1961. This was at the start of the decline of the cinema.  Nothing much happened in the industry between 1960 and the establishment of the Irish Film Board in the 1980s.  The board did a great deal of work in that five years.  It undertook a range of work and organised training courses.  It enhanced our image abroad and was involved in partnerships with the international film world.  It did a great deal of work in short films and documentaries and enabled feature films to reach cinema and television screens at home and abroad.  I welcome the Irish Film Board being put on a sound footing.  We must receive a return on our investment, raise the levels of skills, generate jobs in a variety of disciplines and enhance the image of Ireland at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The success of the Irish Film Board will be measured by increased employment and value added to the Irish economy. There is good economic justification for State involvement.  We see this in the Cooper and Lybrand report referred to in detail by the Minister which says that for every £1 million spent on feature films and television programmes, 48 to 50 full-time jobs will be created in any given year.  This is to be commended. We are doing research and our new approach to the industry is a step forward. The industry has earned a fine reputation abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister introduced measures in three key areas.  He spoke about raising the limit of the amount which can be spent by the board and extending section 35 to individuals who will be able to spend up to £25,000 in film investment each year.  He also talked about Teilefís na Gaeilge, which is a great step forward for our national language.  These measures will tap the great reservoir of talent in the independent production sector. <Col N="1640" /> Through a series of Irish films which it made, this sector has received wide acclaim in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The board should concern itself with making good films but we must also be concerned about marketing those films at home and abroad.  The Minister may not have referred to this.  We must make sure our talent is marketed abroad but there is nothing in the Bill about such marketing. We should look again at this area.</P>
    <P>Access to international films in Ireland is very poor.  We must get away from the mass culture of American films.  The Irish Film Centre in Dublin provides an excellent service.  However, it is almost impossible for audiences outside Dublin to have access to a wide range of world films.  Those shown by the Irish Film Centre are accessible to film goers in Dublin and the Irish Film Board should ensure that people in country towns and villages can also see international films.</P>
    <P>The board should concern itself with short films such as fiction and documentaries. This is the cradle of the industry where young people with talent can learn their craft with Irish short story writers such as O'Faoláin and O'Connor. RTE and the board should work together to encourage the making and marketing of short films and documentaries.  This should be a key area for the board.  There is great potential for co-productions between RTE and, perhaps, BBC Northern Ireland.  The Minister should explore this possibility as part of the board's terms of reference.  There is great potential and young talent in the country.  Jobs can be created in the arts, the media, entertainment and broadcasting.  This industry has the capacity for job creation in a great variety of disciplines.  We have made a start with this Bill.  The film industry has a great future and I commend the Minister for reconstituting the Irish Film Board under the chairmanship of Lelia Doolan.</P>
    <P>Irish films such as <i>The Crying Game</i> and <i>My Left Foot</i> have gained a huge reputation on the world stage.  Films like <i>Into the West</i> and Pat Murphy's <i>Anne Devlin</i> are of the highest quality.  We must get our marketing skills right.  We <Col N="1641" /> have the talent and the industry is well positioned to expand.  Film making has enormous potential.  However, our script writers and producers are, by nature, undisciplined people.  I was not sure what the Minister meant when he referred to a database.  Is this designed to monitor the talent available?  The Irish Film Board, in conjunction with RTE, should maintain a tight structure because of the reservoir of talent which exists, otherwise it will not be tapped.</P>
    <P>There are-signs that those engaged in film making are ready to meet the challenge provided by the board.  I look forward to the industry's future development.  In a few years it will be necessary to review the industry and the Minister says he intends to do so.  It is a huge industry and will enhance Ireland's image at home and abroad and I look forward to future developments in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a further indication of the commitment of the Minister to develop our film industry. There now seems to be a strong awareness by the Government of the importance of the industry, both from a cultural viewpoint and the important dimension of creating jobs.  In relation to the former, I was interested in the Minister's remarks and had not heard that viewpoint before. I was impressed by the words the Minister used in relation to the Irish Film Board committee.  He spoke about policy, monitoring and responding.  It was a recognition the Government is in earnest and that the board intends to be proactive and involved in training.  I welcome all this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State can properly do three things in relation to the film industry.  The first thing it can do has been addressed in the Bill.  It can, through the Irish Film Board, support the early development of film ideas by providing money at the crucial first stage.  This is where film-makers find it most difficult to get support.  Fortunately for the State, it is an area in which relatively little money can go a long way.  The board's job is to bring as many ideas as possible to the stage where they are viable and can get the full scale <Col N="1642" /> backing necessary to be brought to full production.  The State is a banker of first resort.  Its involvement can open doors and lend credibility to the project.  The board should support as many projects as possible.  It should not support rubbish although it is not easy to know at the incubation stage what will be rubbish.</P>
    <P>The second way the State can get involved is by creating a financial environment which encourages investment in film making and encourages people, regardless of whether they are Irish, to use that environment to make films in Ireland.  Supporting films must be a notoriously high risk business.  It would be hard to think of a riskier business.  We tend to hear of the very successful films but not about those which bite the dust and never come close to covering their costs.  For this reason alone the State should not be a major backer of films. It is too difficult to be sure of picking winners.  The State can create a favourable tax regime which cushions the risk to the investor and makes it relatively easy for the film maker to raise money.</P>
    <P>As in so many other industries, there is competition around the world.  People will invest in films where they get the most favourable tax deal, which is sensible and prudent.  In the same way as the IDA goes into the international market place for mobile investment and bids against the competition, we must create a competitive tax regime if we want to attract film projects and stimulate Irish people to invest in films.  We have recently made some progress in this second area, which I welcome.  It is obviously not enough to please Senator Ross, but it is a development in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if we have gone far enough to make a real difference.  I am impressed by the story of the two Irishmen who returned from Canada in the 1960s and convinced the Government there were mining opportunities in Ireland.  We all learned in school that there were no mining resources in Ireland as we were an agricultural country with no natural resources.  They took advantage of a generous tax regime which did <Col N="1643" /> not cost us anything because we had no mining and the result was Tara Mines Limited and huge investment in mining, which I assume is now generating tax revenue.  A generous tax regime allowed a business to be created out of nothing. We should further encourage a business which is tiny in Ireland compared to its potential.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the State can improve its welcome for incoming film makers, people who consider coming to Ireland to make a film or even part of a film.  We must not forget we have two separate interests in this.  On the one hand we want to encourage the making of Irish films by the growing body of competent Irish film makers while on the other, we want to encourage everybody else who considers coming to Ireland to make films.</P>
    <P>Film making is the highest yielding tourism possible.  The making of a film in Ireland pours money into the country because it is such an expensive process. It gives employment in the film industry itself, which is important, and scatters money around the economy.  In tourism we rightly target convention and conference business because it brings in big money.  However, people attending them spend nothing in comparison to what is spent in making a big film.  We are not being sufficiently proactive in seeking film projects for Ireland or in smoothing the way for incoming film makers.  It is not the job of the IDA or Bord Fáilte &mdash; I do not think it is anybody's job at the moment.  Perhaps it will now be the job of the film board, which I know is in the Minister's mind.</P>
    <P>There is a publicly funded office in every state of the United States, whose job is to attract film makers to that state and to help them when they arrive.  I do not often go to the cinema but, being romantic, I took my wife to a film a couple of weeks ago.  She thought I would be surprised there were talkies and technicolor nowadays, it is so long since I took her to the cinema.  We went to <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>, which was made in two cities.  The end credits indicate that <Col N="1644" /> there were two huge film crews, one in Seattle and one in New York.</P>
    <P>Anybody who sees that film would want to visit those cities, so I can understand why they invest in attracting film makers.  Every state in the United States, of which New York is a good example, invests publicly funded money into attracting film makers for the money and employment generated during the making of the film and for the eventual tourism benefit.</P>
    <P>Many other countries have followed that lead.  It is now widely accepted that it is the role of the State to stimulate such business.  It is a competitive business and we should go out there and compete.  I am sure that is the Minister's intention. Films are occasionally made here but we have not reached out to develop this business. We have only scratched the surface of the potential which is there if we go about it in the right way.</P>
    <P>Those are the three areas of film making in which I think the State should be involved.  However, there are other areas in which the State should never get involved.  It should never protect the film industry, despite the interesting figure which the Minister cited that 81 per cent of images in Europe are produced in North America.  The State should nurture, encourage, support and even, to a limited extent, fund the film industry. However, it should never get involved with the film makers and their customers who go to see those films.</P>
    <P>That is why the European position in the recent GATT negotiations &mdash; which up to now has really been the French position &mdash; is wrong.  It is not in the best long term interests of the European film industry.  Any attempt to interfere with the free choice of film goers or television viewers to choose their own entertainment is wrong headed.  I say this despite the fact that I am concerned, like everybody else, about the North American domination of the world film and television industry.  There is a cultural issue here which the Minister described well.  However, it is not one which we can address through quotas or protectionism. We must leave it to the audience to <Col N="1645" /> decide and be customer driven in this, as in so many other areas.</P>
    <P>What the French have done with their film industry should give us pause for thought.  They have, behind a row of protectionist barriers, created a large film industry of unparalleled mediocrity.  In Paris ten or 20 years ago I saw large queues outside cinemas, which the Russians filmed in !he early 1980s and showed on Russian television to prove there were food queues in Europe.  We at the time had forgotten about cinema queues.</P>
    <P>Those queues are not seen in Paris to the same extent now.  We do not realise how poor recent French films have been. Few French films are good enough to merit being shown outside France.  The vast majority are low budget pot-boilers with even lower production values.  They find it increasingly difficult to get an audience even in their own country, despite the protectionist support.  Audiences are voting with their feet and not watching the films made by big decision makers at a central operation.</P>
    <P>GATT was yesterday afternoon's story.  However, this is still highly relevant to us because we are part of Europe and, therefore, we should be playing a role in developing any future European policy on film making.  I hope that in this debate Ireland will take the role of the free trader.  I am getting off lightly using such a word when Senator Magner is here because he did not so generously allow Senator Ross to push for that direction. I hope we will strongly push the view that the best way Europe can support its film industry is by nurturing &mdash; not by protecting &mdash; it.</P>
    <P>Rinne mé dearmad ar gach seanfhocal a d'fhoghlaim mé ar scoil ach tá cuimhne agam ar an seanfhocal &ldquo;Éist le fuaim na habhann mar gheobhaidh tú iasc&rdquo;&mdash; listen to the sound of the river if you want to catch a fish.  That attracted me as a marvellous seanfhocal from a business point of view.  In any business if one listens to the customers and the market place, one will catch a good fish.  That is what we must do in this case.  We must make sure that those in the business of film making listen to what the audiences <Col N="1646" /> want.  The State should not be involved in film making but leave it to the risk takers and those who wish to please their audiences by giving the cinema going public the films they wish to see.</P>
    <P>The way forward lies in projects such as the European script fund where a small amount of money has had a tremendous impact in nurturing good films.  The way forward is not through protectionism because this merely underwrites mediocrity which, in this of all sectors, is certainly what we want to avoid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn's contribution and his reference to the old adage about listening to the river is lost on Senator Ross because he would start from the basis that there are not any fish so there is no point in listening.  There was a contrast between Senator Ross's contribution and the Minister's speech which, as Senator Ross said, was enthusiastic and visionary.  However, Senator Ross then tried a little trick.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>He tried to portray the Minister as an enthusiastic visionary but highly impractical person.  I have known the Minister for over 20 years and he is a hard-nosed political operator who is more than conscious of the fact that this is an industry.  If we were talking about plastics, concrete blocks or Christmas crackers this morning this point would not arise but, because it comes under the aegis of arts and culture, it is said to be impractical.  This seems to be the basis from which Senator Ross starts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with seed funding.  There is a limit to the money requested however, it is not money which will be used tomorrow but money that may be available. Senator Ross is a broker and he knows all about making projections.  It is not realistic to make accurate projections if one is unaware of how much money will be available to develop an idea.  The Minister is trying, through Government investment, to put the industry on a sensible <Col N="1647" /> footing which will, I hope, make it viable and attract to this country industry such as that which Canada and Australia got down through the years and which created employment.</P>
    <P>I want to address a different aspect of this by thanking the Minister in one instance and asking him for a favour in the next.  I have had the benefit of assistance from his Department in trying to bring to this House some examples of paintings and portraits currently hanging in other places.  I very much appreciate the assistance of Colm O'Briain in getting paintings from the Arts Council which will be hung in the restaurant in this House during the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>I often go to the visitors' room in the main hall to bring people into the House. There is not a single print or painting there, yet this is the first glimpse visitors get of our Parliament.  There is nothing to display the cultural and artistic wealth of the country.  With the Minister's active assistance, I hope, as Chairman of the Joint Services Committee, to address those problems.</P>
    <P>Another point is relevant.  Children came in here this morning and sat in the public gallery.  Between 15,000 and 20,000 school children visit the House every year and are taken on a tour of the building, shown photographs and so on and that is the end of the tour.  Under the auspices of the Minister's Department and with his active co-operation I want those children to come in here and see all the archival film that shows the foundation of this State, how this House came into being, who was in it in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s and the people who helped to found this State.</P>
    <P>It will not require much money because there are many areas, meeting rooms, and other places where we could bring groups of school children.  They will leave with a better understanding of the foundation of the State and its democratic institutions. I came here this morning because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

An innovation of this kind in the House for school children would be an enormous benefit and we would have the queues that Senator Quinn spoke about, not in Paris but maybe outside the door here.  This House must become more user friendly and one of the best ways to do it is to make it interesting.  Schools will send their children here to see, on film, the foundation and institutions of the State. I ask the Minister publicly to support me in that request and thank him in advance.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom an Bille a mholadh agus mo comhghairdeas a ghabháil don tAire tuisc an Bille seo a chur ós ár gcomhair sa Seanad.  This Bill concerns Irish life, how we can promote our country and create jobs.  In the period 1967 to 1968 I lived in a part of the country which was dying because of emigration. Then <i>Ryan's Daughter</i> was made there and large amounts of money were injected into the economy of the Dingle peninsula.  A village had to be built, people were looking for accommodation which was not there initially but created while the film was being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The film was seen in other countries and subsequently large numbers of people came to visit the place where it had been made.  Everybody gained from the film in some way.  If they were not working on the film, they were supplying produce to a guest house or a hotel.  For the record, I was a stand-in for Robert Mitchum for a week in the film.  I am still doing a bit of acting but in a different <Col N="1649" /> way.  I worked on the film for nine months.</P>

      <P>I have a great and deep interest in the film.  I have a half hour of old movies which I made on the making of that film.  They are of historical interest.  I have been asked many times to show them to people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I could go back further to the making of <i>The Dawn</i> in Killarney. If those people had even the simplest camcorder at that time or a small percentage of the money we are talking about today to help them out in making that film what would it have meant?  I do not agree with Senator Ross when he says that the old film board did nothing. Regardless of what the board did, arising out of their deliberations people entered the market because of the help they got from the film board.</P>
      <P>Gabriel Byrne started in a simple little serial on television called <i>Bracken</i> and he is now an ambassador for the country. One could mention others in the film industry such as Noel Pearson.  I do not want the Leas-Chathaoirleach to tell me that I should not mention the names of those who are not here but these names should be mentioned.  <i>The Field</i> and many other films were made down through the years without help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind if money is given to a private company that wants to make a film.  We do not have the resources for making films in Ireland.  If Senator Ross thinks there are millions of pounds available to invest in a film, I will give him and the Minister a film to invest in and much groundwork has been done on it. The late Donnchadh O'Malley's son bought the film rights of the book <i>An tOileánach,</i> and he resold them to an Australian company some years ago because he could not get anybody to invest in making the film.  I was involved <Col N="1650" /> at the time and a man from home, Lorcáin Ó Cinnéide, is still pursuing the matter.  If an English version of <i>An tOileánach</i> was made, it could be on a par with films like <i>Gone With the Wind</i>.  It would be an epic, a fabulous film, if it was made in a proper fashion.  I would not like to see a shoddy film made, I want to see a top class professional film with Irish actors and Irish people.  However, if we need to employ outsiders I cannot see anything wrong with that provided it is done in a professional way.</P>
    <P>The village on the Blasket Islands is in ruins.  If a film was made, all the ruins would have to be rebuilt.  Fondúireacht na mBlascaoid is trying to rebuild that village and, therefore, two things could be achieved simultaneously.  A fabulous film could be made, employment created and all the houses on the Blasket Islands rebuilt.  The Film Board should invest in it and if the film made a profit the Minister could ask the film makers to whom he gave the grants for something in return for his investment.  It should not be all one sided.  If Senator Ross knows people who have money to invest, I am interested in them.</P>
    <P>Gregory Peck was asked whether he would play the part of the Islandman because he is a tall gaunt man, you could imagine him with the same black hat as Tomás Ó Criomhtháin.  He would be perfect for the part and he is half Irish.  I met Gregory Peck in 1950 and again in 1970, because his first cousin was my neighbour. If we want to trace relations in the film business, he was also a close relative of the famous patriot Thomas Ashe and Tom Crean who went to the South Pole, so I&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have supported him.  Perhaps the spending of money at times can be a little too narrow. I have no objection to big film industries coming in.  People like Noel Pearson are <Col N="1651" /> needed to advise on the film industry.  A film can create many jobs in on location; a crew can transform a place overnight. Éamonn De Buitléir, a former Member of this House, produced another film on wildlife recently.  He has done a lot for the film industry and I do not know whether he gets help.  There is plenty of talent in this country.</P>
      <P>I hope the extra £14 million will be put to good use.  There is a great future for the film industry but we have to shake the cobwebs off.  We cannot adopt Senator Ross's attitude about this.  He represents a part of Wicklow in which many films were made but I am not altogether in favour of making films in studio.  I would like to see them made on location all over Ireland.  I do not like studio films despite all the things that can be done with a camera nowadays.  It is better to make them on location.  I am not a film maker but I have a video camera and I had a movie camera before that and I take a deep interest in film making and how it is done.  If it is done properly and money is spent wisely, it can do a great deal of good in publicising our country and creating employment.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, he should not pay attention to the critics of Teilifís na Gaeilge who say he is spending too much money and that it could be done some other way.  If that is the case why was it not done 15 or 20 years ago?  It is being done now and the money will be well spent.  The Minister should not pay attention to the critics.  Is maith an tiománaí é an té a bhíonn ar an claí.  I wish him every success and I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will have to grow a few more inches first.  I welcome the Bill which must be passed quickly because I understand that the £4.1 million given to the Film Board under previous legislation <Col N="1652" /> has already been spent.  If we are to give it any money next year it is important that this legislation goes through.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he looks to the board to strike a balance between cultural and commercial aspects of filming and so create a fresh and vibrant synthesis in this long standing discourse.  The two elements are the cultural and the commercial. Much of the emphasis &mdash; rightly &mdash; in the debate has been on the commercial side of film making, because anybody involved in the arts knows it is necessary to have commercial sense to sell the product and get it into the distribution networks to be successful.  It is important, therefore, to be involved in Eurimages and that the committee the Minister is setting up involves organisations like FÁS, an Bord Tráchtála, Bord Fáilte, the IDA, RTÉ and so on. The commercial side is obviously important if our film industry is to be successful in the wider world.</P>
      <P>The cultural aspect is crucial to the business.  The Irish have made an extraordinary impact in the cultural area, particularly in the literary world where we have pushed out the frontiers of the use of language in a way which no other nation could claim.  We have people like Joyce and Beckett who did more with the written and spoken word than writers in any other nation.  Similarly in the area of drama we have people like Wilde and Shaw and poets like Yeats and many others since then who are acknowledged as geniuses.  There is no reason this kind of tradition cannot be followed in the 20th century art form of film.</P>
      <P>The Irish are probably particularly suited, as we have been to the written word, to the kind of speed of images needed in film.  We are quick witted and quirky, we have the kind of outlook and characteristics that will &mdash; and already have &mdash; made us very successful.  The two elements, the cultural and commercial, will intertwine very well when a decent amount of funding is given to our film makers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Senator Quinn and others touched on the area of European culture, the European dimension to film <Col N="1653" /> making and the dominance of America. Australia has begun to have a fairly strong role also in commercial film.  There is a great diversity of cultures in Europe which has been very strongly maintained over the centuries and can clearly be seen in the difference between Italy, France, the Eastern and Northern European countries like Sweden and the far west of Europe.  The difference in our cultures and the way we express ourselves has been clearly maintained despite the fact that we are a small geographic unit in comparison to the United States or Asia. Through film and supporting our own film industry we will be able to maintain our place in the European network of cultures.  We owe that not just to our own country but to Europe and the world.  I want to broaden the view of this Bill as it has those aspects which although difficult to define and to narrow down, are important to recognise.</P>

      <P>The film industry is quintessentially creative.  It is a modern art form which is vibrant, quixotic, ephemeral and quirky.  It also has an element of the cut-throat about it.  In many ways, therefore, it is ideally suited to the Irish character because we portray all these qualities and drawbacks in abundance. Last month the Minister, Deputy Higgins, detailed at some length the various measures which are being taken by the State to assist the film industry.  The Bill, which is an addition to those measures, is welcomed by all sides with, perhaps, one notable exception.  However, there always has to be somebody who is out of step with the rest of the world.  I will not say any more as he is not listening to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of speakers made the valid point that the State's role in the film industry must have a gentle touch.  The State can only play the role, if I may use the Minister's phrase, of creating the right environment.  Perhaps we have become economic environmentalists. The State cannot be directly and specifically involved in the creation of a film industry, rather, it can put in place factors and supports which will aid development. I see the State's role as primarily that of <Col N="1654" /> promoting development, and its function in doing that is quite limited and is a hard balance to find.</P>
    <P>The Minister and other speakers mentioned past disappointments, which illustrate my point.  They were in part related to the extraordinarily mobile nature of the film industry, its dominance by the United States, and the view it had of this country, which meant we were pigeon holed for a certain type of film investment from the international sector.  That stereotype or pigeon hole attitude needed to be, and has been, broken, not by anything the State has done, but by the creativity of individuals.</P>
    <P>When one looks at films such as <i>My Left Foot</i> or the film made recently by the BBC of Mr. Roddy Doyle's book, <i>The Snapper</i>, we see extraordinary examples of the celebration of human life and of the oddities and quirkiness of the Irish character.  They portrayed the battle of a family in an environment with which most of us are familiar, not necessarily the glamorised environment we see in films.  It is interesting that the breakthrough in the Irish film industry has been made because of an upsurge and an assertiveness of Irish creativity.  We have broken that stereotype which did a lot of damage to Ireland as an international centre for film making.</P>
    <P>We must accept that many of the policies and interventions in the past were misdirected and misplaced although they were well intentioned.  What should we do?  Senator Quinn made the point, and I agree with him, that we should focus primarily on the conditions.  The film industry is an extraordinarily cost conscious industry.  Since the making of <i>Cleopatra,</i> the first great film to go vastly beyond budget and bankrupt its studios, the accountant has played at least as strong a role as the director or producer or any of the creative talents involved in a film.  From what I read accountants are creative in the film industry because some of the cinema blockbusters have yet to return profits and, apparently, this is something to do with the tax arrangements. We should focus on how we can creatively use tax incentives.  There is a <Col N="1655" /> purist attitude that we should not do so. Ultimately, however, a pragmatic attitude is that it is better to have a proportion of something than to have all of nothing.  We should look at the use of the tax incentives in the film industry to try to focus more production here.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald made a valid point &mdash; and I know from the experience of Bray &mdash; that when a film production is in town, the range of people who benefit is extraordinary &mdash; from extras to the local shops and pubs.  There is a major input to the local economy from any film, no matter what size the budget.  We should also focus on facilitating film makers. Every American city of any great size &mdash; and most states &mdash; have film boards.  They are not there to intervene directly but to make the film makers' passage easy.  They are there to create the environment, to help organise outdoor shots and locations and generally to facilitate the film makers by putting in place supports from all statutory and private agencies.  This is an important role the Irish Film Board could and should play.  Perhaps we could go a step further.  IBEC is examining this matter.  There is a need, particularly for cities like Dublin and County Wicklow, and I am not just being parochial, which have great location possibilities to have a menu of supports in place to show to film makers and entice them to come here to make films by making the passage easier for them.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not wish to be parochial, but although the Ardmore Film Studios is an excellent facilities studio it is, unfortunately, showing all the signs of decay. As we all know, its chequered history and multiplicity of owners have not been helpful.  Anyone who passes the film studies, just off the Herbert Road in Bray, can see the signs of decay.  It needs an injection of funding and if the State intends to give direct funding to the film industry, it would be prudent to investigate the capacity of maintaining, improving and upgrading the facilities studio already in place.  A good studio with a wide range of facilities, combined with the talents that exist in Ireland, <Col N="1656" /> excellent locations and a relatively cheap film making environment, can help to attract films.</P>
    <P>Let us return then to the question of how we mix all this together and use the film board as a way of attracting films. The facilities at Ardmore have been proven to be superb in the past.  As Members know there is a threat to the studio.  Planning applications have been sought for the back lot but it would be a tragedy to build over it.  Some years ago there was an imprudent sale of the sets and property master's equipment, which I do not think raised any more than a couple of thousand pounds, and there was a loss of a good deal of our film heritage.  I argue strongly that if we are looking for a place to invest, we should look there.</P>
    <P>The dominance by the North Americans has recently come to the fore with the GATT negotiations.  I enthusiastically supported the French view. They made no apologies for having an aggressive attitude towards defending their own culture through what they regarded as a strong medium.  The rest of Europe has not given sufficient consideration to this matter.  It is something which we need to examine and to continue to support as we have a unique mix of culture to offer.</P>
    <P>The French have an interesting way of imposing tax on film and video and of using that revenue to invest in their film industry.  It is something we should consider.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to make a parochial appeal to the Minister.  When the Film Board is set up it must have a headquarters. The Government had a policy of decentralisation.  The Film Board headquarters will consist of two offices, a boardroom and a cleaning lady.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Two cleaning men.  To indicate we are serious about preserving what is already in place serious consideration should be given to establishing the headquarters in Ardmore studios, not because it would be a major financial fillip <Col N="1657" /> but because it would make a statement about protecting an existing facility.  I realise the Minister is creative and enthusiastic about his brief.  I know he will forgive me for being parochial but there is a good fundamental reason to consider my suggestion.  I am pleased to support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the House is anxious to hear the Minister's reply so I will just make a few points. First, like my colleagues on both sides of the House, I welcome this Bill.  I also welcome the initiative being taken by the Minister in his new Department and the speed with which he has implemented many of the long held aspirations of people in the cultural and artistic area &mdash; a speed that has left many of us breathless. Long may he continue to do so.  The artistic sector &mdash; especially the film sector &mdash; has been crying out for a coherent strategy to exploit this country's real talent in the creative and literary areas.</P>
      <P>The aspects of the Film Board and its activities in the context of this Bill which I wished to discuss were mentioned by Senator Roche.  One of the main reasons over 80 per cent of the world's film output comes from Hollywood is its extremely sophisticated infrastructure in that it has brought a sound business approach to an artistic medium.  I note the Minister is anxious to strike a balance between the artistic and commercial merits of film. However, I hope this does not indicate the Film Board will favour the artistic and cultural aspects and perhaps forget we are living in the real world where commercial film, to be successful, must be accepted by the widest possible number of people.  I know the Minister may not agree with my concept of exclusively chasing the audiences.  However, the film industry is littered with pious aspirations and major movies which may have had enormous artistic merit and aesthetically beautiful to watch yet failed miserably in the commercial <i>milieu.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to be negative.  There is now a real opportunity for the artistic talents to coalesce and provide a view of contemporary Ireland in the film and <Col N="1658" /> audio visual context to the world. Through the years the general public has voted with its eyes and supported home produced programmes.  One need only look at the TAM ratings for any one week to find that <i>Glenroe, The Late Late Show</i> and many other in-house productions are way ahead of many of the American imports, despite the high production values of such programmes.  The film industry in this country has lagged behind in that it has not identified and exploited this support among our people and those overseas who bought our television programmes. I am referring to Irish themes.</P>
    <P>In more recent years the films that have achieved Oscar status, for example, <i>My Left Foot</i>, have been very Irish.  That screenplay could not be transplanted to any location other than Dublin.  The characters involved could not be seen as anything other than Irish.  Contrast that with the Hollywood perception of Ireland as seen in <i>Far and Away</i> starring Tom Cruise which had elements of stage Irishness in it which I thought had gone out with the ark.  In that respect, we should not only have a Film Board which acts as a facilitator to provide seed capital and to exploit the benefits from that in terms of in-house training and providing facilities for a new generation of film makers, we should also aggressively market our country.</P>
    <P>Why is Toronto rather than American cities probably the most popular location for Hollywood produced movies in the North American continent?  Obviously the city has been aggressively marketed as a location.  Cost is also a major factor. Senator Roche was right in saying that an accountant's regime rather than an artistic regime rules among the bigger Hollywood production companies. However, the people of Toronto and the Canadian Government have obviously learned from their experiences.  I am sure the Minister will remember, as I do, the short films by the National Film Board of Canada shown in the local cinema.  They seemed interminable but sometimes were very entertaining; they were also informative.  By the time I reached my early teens I think I knew more about <Col N="1659" /> Canada as a result of watching the short films made by the National Film Board of Canada than I did about aspects of my own and neighbouring countries.  They have been in the industry for a long time and were obviously able to harness the experience they had gained during those decades to exploit the real advantages and opportunities presented in Toronto.</P>
    <P>There are similarities in the Australian film industry.  Not long ago if one were to suggest that a film from the Antipodes would be of Oscar standard, one would have been laughed out of court. However, there was a recognition by the Australian Government in the late 1960s and early 1970s &mdash; mirrored by the recognition the Minister is giving to the Irish film industry &mdash; that if all the component talents &mdash; literary, engineering, production and financial &mdash; were brought together and if there was encouragement at State level a viable and commercially successful Australian film industry could be the result.  The result is there for all to see.  Obviously location had nothing to do with the worldwide success of Australian films.  They were as far off the rim as any country could be: next stop Antarctica.</P>
    <P>Ireland is central; we are the interface between the North American continent and Europe.  Therefore, we are ideally placed geographically to take advantage of the facility presented by the Minister under the second Film Board.  The fact that the industries in Canada and Australia, which in their infancy were by no stretch of the imagination capable of competing with the best of Hollywood, are now challenging Hollywood and have produced films of not only great commercial value but of great artistic merit points the way for us.  The Minister and his appointees to the Film Board will be well aware of the experiences in those countries, perhaps they are already learning from the experiences of those small indigenous film industries which have exploded on the world stage and are proving to be extremely successful.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more films with Irish themes.  We have not exploited our Irishness internationally to the extent <Col N="1660" /> that other countries have exploited their identities.  When one considers the GATT negotiations and the fact that 80 per cent of films watched in Europe come from America, I can understand the uphill battle which the Minister and the Irish Film Board face in establishing a viable Irish film industry.  When the Minister has the various components in place, I hope he will consider, perhaps as an extension to the Irish Film Board, the establishment of film agencies which will aggressively market this country as a suitable location.  One should be able to go into the marketplace and say that Ireland is a place to which people should come because it has the infrastructure, in terms of production and artistic and literary merit, and a low cost regime.  It also has a wonderful environment and it would be able to make world class films which would be commercially successful.  We are on the threshold of something exciting and I commend the Minister for taking the initiative in this area.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions which reflected the influence of the cinema, or the picture house, in every Senator's life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the most practical matters which several Senators mentioned. It would be wrong to believe this is a vague area and I will clarify what I mean. After aviation, audio visual products are the second biggest United States export to Europe.  Exports in audio visual products account for £3.65 billion, while computer related products account for £10.59.  The imbalance is approximately 12:1 in film and it goes as high as 25:1 in some other products.  I do not state this defensively, negatively or protectively. There is an immense space which can be filled with audio visual products.  It is interesting that one country dominates and occupies over 80 per cent of the market.  We are a country which speaks English and our products are made in the English language.  We have a good production agreement with Canada and I hope to have good production agreements <Col N="1661" /> with Australia and New Zealand in the near future.  We have immense opportunities in this regard.</P>
    <P>We must return to the practical realities in case anyone believes they are vague.  Last year I gave permission to the Irish Film Board to spend £1.5 million but it could spend only £945,000 because it was near the ceiling contained in a previous Act.  It followed a regime of giving 10 per cent advances so that for every £10,000 it spent, £90,000 came in. The reality was that for £1 spent, £9 was secured from outside.</P>
    <P>Coopers and Lybrand was one of the organisations which contributed to the working group on the film industry.  Its figures showed that every £1 million spent on features and documentaries in the film industry produced 48 and 50, respectively, annual full-time job equivalents.</P>
    <P>I have combined a mixture of different strategies to establish the generic side of the native industry which was to come through the Irish Film Board.  We have a market which is unfulfilled in Europe and dominated by a North American source, a product which is suitable and the film industry is the fastest growing sector in the services sector in Europe.  To say that one should not get involved in this industry because the banks do not have the nerve, is as sensible as flying to the moon.  For every £1 spent, £9 comes in through the Irish Film Board.  This produces the job numbers I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Several Senators spoke about the effect of film expenditure in different parts of the country.  As pointed out, when a film is being made, caterers, carpenters, electricians and the people &mdash; there are over 2,000 &mdash; who work as extras at different times in film making in Ireland benefit.  It is diffused expenditure. Films were made this year in Counties Leitrim, Wicklow, and Kerry and Mr. John Sayle's film was made in County Donegal.  The thrust of the Irish Film Board has been positive in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 35 changes at the other end were described recently by Mr. David Puttnam as one of the most imaginative packages available to film makers anywhere <Col N="1662" /> in the world.  My information is that since last February we have taken in more money at that end that we did since 1987.  A series of other things must happen in between.  One considers training if one is building the employment between section 35 and the Irish Film Board hence, the idea of Teilifís Na Gaeilge, for example, which fits in with audio visual training and this means the jobs come together.</P>
    <P>I refer Senator Ross to the Coopers and Lybrand report.  Senator Ross's point is true in relation to risk-taking films, but it does not compare with some of the risks taken by those who bought shares on the Stock Exchange in recent years. Coopers and Lybrand suggested that 80 per cent of feature films and television programme funding comes from abroad. We should be clear about this issue and the changes when I examine section 35.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to some local authorities about the advantages of location.  This is about generating the greatest amount of added value in the economy.  The money is coming from outside.  It is working and will be a success.  I will give people more details if they so wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>People are entitled to examine the figures.  I will spend £16 million between 1994 and 1998 on the Irish Film Board.  Some £13 million will be spent on funding the projects and £3 million will be spent on training.  The £2 million I will spend in 1994 will produce £18 million from outside and it will have the capacity to create 1,000 jobs.  Other Senators stressed, rightly, that we are not talking only about economics.  There is also a cultural dimension.  An unanswerable argument is that there is a future in audio visual, that we have the capacity for great opportunities and that we are now on our way to creating jobs in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without putting a tooth in it, let me state what those who counsel despair are saying, that the audio-visual jobs which should be in Ireland and Europe should go to North America because we have <Col N="1663" /> lost faith in ourselves.  North America is delighted to take these jobs.  This is an eccentric and cranky view and I am glad it is not a general one.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the Irish Film Board will spend £2 million in the coming year. Its objectives are to support 25 development projects and four to six production projects in 1994.  This will rise to 30 development projects and six to eight production projects in the 1995-97 period.  This is how the money will be spent to build a generic industry based on the talent, ingenuity, individuality and tenacity of the film community which continued when the going was not too good.</P>
    <P>This industry is enormously attractive to young people, particularly school leavers who want to become involved in it. It would be ridiculous not to plan it in a practical way and, therefore, it is being carefully planned this time.  That is why I referred in my speech to the database. I am accounting for every penny spent. Senator Ross mentioned that perhaps it was a flaw in that it was not attracting bank investment, knowing as he does, and as I do, the amount of risks taken by banks.  There is a facility available to us now where there is a European source that will underwrite the risk of a bank investing in film so that their nervousness can be massaged to the point at which they may wish to invest in something like that.  The Senator will be pleased to hear that, as mentioned, the film <i>Eat the Peach</i> received £100,000 from the first Irish Film Board and it is an excellent example of the board's capacity to support films in the modernist mode.</P>
    <P>Regarding the emphasis which the Government is placing on films as an industry, I was asked about the proposed activities of the committee I have composed. One gets production going in the film industry and one then has to consider distribution.  Distribution is not all about taste &mdash; it was never said that no citizen of the USA will ever watch a dubbed film &mdash; it is about much more.  It is about the economics of distribution, monopoly and the absence of fair trade in distribution <Col N="1664" /> as about anything else.  If one is serious about film one must consider not only production, but distribution and so on.</P>
    <P>It is precisely to address all of these issues that I spoke of the need for a commission that would look after the whole question of the availability of Irish films.  The practical tasks to be undertaken by the commission will include training.  The feasibility of the commission will not stop short of facilitating foreign, indigenous productions, but will be able to tell people exactly what is available in different locations in terms of electricians, carpenters, caterers, accommodation and so on.  We have started on this process and it is the kind of work that is very important.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn, in a thoughtful speech, is correct about New York and the practical arrangements both there and in many other cities.  I am familiar with these cities and I agree with the Senator on how people go about selling their space as a location for film activity.</P>
    <P>Senators will be pleased to note that the commission will also look at the regional distribution network for our films within Ireland.  In this context Senator Ormonde asked about the availability of films in the regions.  The Senator will be pleased to note that next year this is one the projects to be taken on by the Irish Film Board.</P>
    <P>The commission will also consider the question of language and film and so on. It is a practical, deliverable agenda in which I have confidence.  This is not an exhaustive outline of all the activities which the commission is undertaking.</P>
    <P>Regarding regional distribution and availability, mentioned by Senator Ormonde, the figure that will be spent on this will be approximately £370,000 next year.  On this point I was asked questions about the allocation of expenditure by the Irish Film Board.  Approximately £370,000 will be spent on administration and approximately £2 million on capital expenditure.  I believe this is modest and wise and the board will be thanked for it.  In this respect I wish to pay tribute, yet again, to Lelia Doolan and the other members of the Irish Film <Col N="1665" /> Board who are making the board a success.</P>
    <P>What we view is not a matter of accident; it is a wonderful expression of ourselves. There is nothing narrow, backward, or old fashioned about it as it is concerned with being positive and with living in an era of new technology.  It is about being able to make products that we have the confidence to sell around the world without endlessly lashing ourselves that we are so small and hopeless that not even the banks have confidence in us.  Such would be a message of despair to make Cassandra weep.</P>
    <P>I have explained the purpose of the data base.  To answer all those who wish to know where the money comes from, I am in the real world; I consider section 35 and am aware that there are different ways of raising finance.  For example, if one makes a film in two tax years one gets two tax breaks.  However, does this facilitate a person who wants to make a good film in one summer, or two less adequate films in two bad winters and so on?  I continually consider section 35 to see how it can be further refined.  The purpose of the data base is to ensure that the money that goes to, for example, Teilifís na Gaeilge, the Irish Film Board and section 35 is accounted for so that we know where it is going and what kind of return we can expect from it.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, Senator Quinn gave a thoughtful and valuable speech.  The Senator made three suggestions and I disagree with him only on one.  The Senator and I would be at one regarding the seed funding and I have answered the question in relation to the favourable tax regime.  I have to see the refined figures yet, but, as I have said, I believe that we have taken more in since February than since 1987.  It is an example of how it is working in each of its component parts. It is a success story and nobody can deny that in terms of the available facts.</P>
    <P>Regarding incoming film makers, I agree with Senator Quinn.  It is a function of the commission.  However, I believe it is important that we know what is happening in the battle for distribution.  It is not accidental, as I have pointed out, that <Col N="1666" /> we are in a time, for example, when film makers may have their film sold into a film bank.  Take satellite and cable and conditions of monopoly and, for example, Mr. Murdoch's purchase of, I understand, the Asian Footprint.  This was effectively accompanied by his purchasing 350 films made in Asia; therefore, no one can see an Asian film made in the last ten years without purchasing it out of a film bank.  These are conditions of monopoly; they are not ones of free trade or anything like that, rather of straightforward distortion and abuse.  In this context it is part of our own project to make and defend the capacity to provide alternatives.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Irish Film Board, Senator Quinn raised a specific question on the proportion of the board's annual capital allocation which is designated to development funding.  The figure is approximately 20 per cent and it is expected that 25 to 30 development loans will be made each year.  This will address the issue of the young person who will be able to get a start from the Irish Film Board before finding it difficult after the exciting people who want to bank the film industry have arrived.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a number of Senators' questions in detail.  However, let me assure the House that my approach to this issue is to offer accountability and transparency, because I believe it is an exciting aspect to job creation.  I have welcomed, and continue to welcome, the emphasis placed by Senator O'Sullivan that this issue is much wider than economics. There is indeed a cultural dimension to it.  I understand it was President Mitterand, when he was speaking about Portugal, who said if the Portugese listen to Bach and Beethoven, does one request them not to produce music?  If the Irish read Proust, does one ask them to stop writing?  There is such a thing as cultural pluralism and cultural values, and of defending the space for the assertion of the culture and imagination of one's people in conditions of the new technology.</P>
    <P>If any Senators have any specific points which they wish me to answer in more <Col N="1667" /> detail, I will be pleased to do so.  It is the approach of my Department to provide as much information as possible.  I visited Ardmore a few weeks ago and it has benefited from the measures I have already taken.</P>
    <P>I also listened with interest to Senator Mooney's remarks on the nature of Irish material.  Needless to say, my dear friend here, Senator Fitzgerald, who is so much more experienced in the world of film and acting than I am, made some good points regarding the value in a local community of this kind of activity.</P>
    <P>If one was to think of an appropriate activity which should be assisted by the State that is ecologically acceptable, that is diffuse regionally, that is close to the capacity of people, that has a background in it in terms of narrative ability and for which there is a scarcity in Europe that is being filled by people who are at a distance from our own experience, one probably could not come up with anything better than the film and audio visual sector.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members of the House for not only the support they have indicated for the measures I have taken, but for their obvious, genuine interest and enthusiasm for making sure that we have an exciting film and audio visual sector in the future.</P>

      <P>The Bill now before the Seanad proposes to amend and repeal sections of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.  The main provisions of the Bill are the reduction of the term of office of the board's ordinary members from five to three years, terminating on a rotational basis and for the removal of the specific vocational requirement for board membership; the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings and trials and for the veterinary supervision of hares before, during and after such meetings and the removal of the prohibition on greyhound racing on Sundays.  This Bill represents the first amendment to be proposed in respect of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.</P>
      <P>When the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, was enacted, its primary aims were the development of the greyhound industry, including greyhound racing and coursing, and for better control of greyhound race tracks and coursing grounds. Under that Act, Bord na gCon was established and assumed the role performed since 1916 by the Irish Coursing Club in relation to the control of greyhound racing.  The board was also charged with the responsibility for the improvement and development of the industry as a whole while the coursing club retained control of coursing throughout the 32 counties.  Indeed, the 1958 Act recognised the special position of the coursing club, providing as it did in a Schedule to the Act the constitution for that body. The club itself was given responsibility under the Act for maintaining the greyhound stud book and for controlling coursing, subject to the general direction of Bord na gCon.</P>

    <P>The relationship between the board and the club is, it would be fair to say, unique in Ireland.  The 1958 Act shifted <Col N="1669" /> responsibility for the overall control and development of the industry from a private body, namely, the club, to the newly formed board.  In doing so, the Act acknowledged the contribution made by the club to the industry by recognising it as the keeper of the greyhound stud book and the controlling authority for the breeding controlling authority for greyhound coursing and by reserving three seats at the board for members of the executive of the club.</P>
    <P>The importance of the greyhound industry in rural areas cannot be underestimated. Some 8,000 people are involved in the industry as breeders, owners and trainers.  The breeding, rearing and training of greyhounds is, as I have said on a number of occasions outside the House, an integral part of the fabric of rural life in Ireland.  It is an alternative enterprise of not insignificant proportions.  When compared with the more glamorous alternative enterprises, such as horse breeding or agri-tourism, it may seem at first glance to be of minor significance.  However, the figures tell a different story.</P>
    <P>The University of Limerick and Bord na gCon have carried out surveys recently which show that three-quarters of the 8,000 people directly involved in the industry are small farmers.  The activities of greyhound breeding, rearing and training generated an estimated farm income of £16 million or an average of £2,600 per farmer.  Overall, the value of the industry to the national economy is put at £40 million.  At grass roots level, the industry is in reasonably good condition.  Breeders and rearers have a great deal of expertise and enjoy natural advantages in the production of greyhounds.  However, the sector has not reached its full potential.</P>
    <P>The industry is basically export-orientated, its main market being the United Kingdom.  If the sector is to reach its full potential, existing export markets must be exploited to the full and new markets identified and developed.  To achieve this aim, it is critical that buyers are attracted from abroad.  A key variable in this equation is the performance of the greyhound racing sector.  Aside from the <Col N="1670" /> merits which this sector has to recommend it on its own account, such as the direct and indirect employment that it provides and its contribution to the quality of life for residents and tourists, it is also the shop window for the industry.</P>
    <P>Against this background of opportunity and potential, it is regrettable to have to report to the House that the current state of the greyhound industry as a whole is far from prosperous.  The vital statistics of this sector of the industry speak for themselves.  Attendances at greyhound race meetings fell from one million people in 1975 to approximately 700,000 in 1992.  Levy income, one of the board's two main sources of generated income, increased between 1981 and 1991 by only £100,000 to £1.2 million. This, of course, represents a substantial reduction in real terms.  Levy income is believed to have dropped to a figure slightly in excess of £1 million in 1992. Reduced attendances have also affected the tote.  Net proceeds from the tote dropped from £700,000 in 1981 to 169,000 in 1991.  Provisional figures for 1992 show a slight recovery to about £300,000.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the board's income has been supplemented by grants-in-aid from revenue generated by the off-course betting levy.  These grants-in-aid amounted to £0.5 million in 1990 and £0.75 million in each of the years 1991, 1992 and 1993. Despite this, all of the board's income is now used up on administration and prize money, leaving no funds available for developing the industry or for grant aiding the maintenance or improvement of facilities at tracks.</P>
    <P>It is significant to note that against the backdrop of an on-course betting levy and tote income declining in real terms, the board found it possible to maintain its contribution to prize money.  The board's contribution to prize money is in excess of £800,000 per annum and represents some 55 per cent of the board's operating income.  Total prize money has seen a marked increase since the mid-1980s with the contributions from private sector sponsors increasing steadily.  The sponsors <Col N="1671" /> were recruited by the board and the track managements themselves.</P>
    <P>The tracks have to rely on income from administration fees, trial fees, bookmaker pitch fees and profits from bar and catering activities.  The tracks find it difficult to operate profitably on this basis and there are no funds generated which could be used for reinvestment in facilities. The net result is that the tracks have become progressively run down.</P>
    <P>It is particularly unfortunate that this should happen when the development of the positive showcase features of the industry, mainly the racing sector, has been identified as a key element in reviving the fortunes of the industry as a whole.  There is little prospect, given the ever expanding variety of leisure activities from which the general public can choose, of attracting increased attendance at greyhound race meetings unless the facilities provided are upgraded to the standards expected today.  This simple truth must be fully appreciated and addressed by those involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>The board has recognised the difficulty within the industry and responded by drawing up a five year development plan. This plan, which was adopted in 1990, is aimed at restoring the board to profitability and redeveloping the industry. Its principal features are computerisation of operations; adoption of cost cutting measures and the reorganisation of management functions; reallocation of prize money with emphasis on raising attendance at the premier tracks; securing increased sponsorship and other income generating activities; the introduction of improved controls of racing and betting; greyhound breeding to be designated as an alternative farm enterprise; a national stud and a marketing centre to be established; and Shelbourne Park to be developed as the premier greyhound track in the country.  As part of this plan Clonmel track was sold and Youghal track has been put up for sale.  The question of the disposal of the Harold's Cross track, and the transfer of its racing fixtures <Col N="1672" /> to Shelbourne Park, is under consideration.</P>
    <P>These measures have not, however, been enough to give the necessary fillip to this depressed industry.  It is obvious from the board's experience and to any informed observer of the industry that nothing less than a fundamental restructuring of the industry is necessary. Indeed, as I indicated at the outset, it is now 35 years since the Oireachtas had the opportunity to consider in detail the legislative foundation for this industry.  In this context the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, established a task force consisting of representatives of Bord na gCon and officials from the Department to examine the structures, financing and legislation governing the whole industry.  The group was established in 1992 and its remit included the issue of coursing.</P>
    <P>The task force concluded its deliberations some time ago.  Subsequently the Department submitted a position paper on the industry to Minister Walsh and myself.  Following consideration of the issue by us, proposals were put to and approved by Government last June.  The Government recognised that a comprehensive amendment of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, is desirable and that this would be a time consuming and complex exercise.  It, therefore, approved the preparation and introduction into the Dáil of a short Bill dealing with three issues of an urgent nature. Heads of a second Bill updating and amending the provisions of the 1958 Act are at present in the course of preparation in the Department and I will be pressing to have this work completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset, the Bill now before the House contains the following provisions (1) to amend section 9 of the 1958 Act by reducing the term of office of the board members from five to three years, terminating on a rotational basis, and by removing the specific vocational requirement for board membership; (2) to amend section 36 of the Act to provide for the making of regulations concerning the muzzling of greyhounds <Col N="1673" /> at coursing meetings and trials and for the proper treatment and veterinary supervision of hares before, during and after such meetings; and (3) to amend section 23 of the Act by removing the prohibition on greyhound racing on Sundays, Good Friday and Christmas Day.</P>
    <P>The current legislation provides that the board consists of six ordinary members and a chairman.  Under the Act as it stands, the terms of office of all ordinary members of the board expires at the same time every fifth year.  This arrangement is undesirable for two reasons.  The five year term in office is too long and can lead to stagnation closing, as it does, the opportunity of introducing new people and ideas onto the board for a five year period.  It also dilutes the Minister's responsibility to tailor the composition of the board to address current issues facing the industry as they arise.  The appointment of a new board every five years also militates against continuity and an entirely new board would obviously take some time to find its feet.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed in the Bill will, I hope, remedy this situation by reducing the term of office to three years and by providing that members retire on a rotational basis.  This simply means that every year the positions held by two ordinary members of the board will fall vacant.  This rotational mechanism has worked to great effect in a number of State bodies and is becoming increasingly popular in modern legislation.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of the removal of the specific vocational requirement, the Act as it stands provides that three of the six members of the board, and not more than three, shall be members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  It should be clear to Senators that this provision has as its <i>raison d'tre</i> the very historical basis of the board itself. As I already said, the board took over the club's role in relation to greyhound racing when it was established in 1959. In recognition of this and of the fact that the expertise in the control of greyhound racing at that time resided in the club, it <Col N="1674" /> was considered desirable to reserve these places on the board for club members.</P>
    <P>This provision is now too restrictive and means that only three places are available for all other sectors of the industry, such as owners, breeders, trainers, private track owners and bookmakers.  A case could also be made that the board should include someone with good business and financial experience and expertise. I fully recognise that members of the ICC could claim to represent greyhound owners, breeders, trainers and even private track owners, and, indeed, a new board might well contain several people who happen to be members of the standing committee of the ICC.  However, the statutory requirement is no longer valid and should be removed.  The inclusion of this provision in the 1958 Act must be looked at in the light of the circumstances obtaining at that time.  That is to say that it was a recognition of the <i>de facto</i> position that the club had a role in relation to the control and organisation of greyhound racing up to the establishment of the board.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the question of coursing was given a comprehensive examination in the Dáil in the context of the Wildlife Bill, 1993.  The debate on that Bill was valuable.  As I made clear at that time, and on several occasions since, my aim to remove the kill.  This feature of coursing is unacceptable in the current climate and taints the entire industry.  I will use every means at my disposal to achieve this end.  The Irish Coursing Club has voluntarily introduced controls and measures aimed at eliminating the kill during coursing meetings and trials. These include rules changes to reduce the number of courses; improved veterinary supervision; better conservation of hare stocks and the development of a muzzle. This latter measure has required significant research by the club.  Initially a soft leather muzzle was used and more recently a plastic one.  The search for the most suitable muzzle from an animal welfare point of view will continue.</P>
    <P>I have set up a monitoring committee within the Department to oversee the implementation of these measures, to <Col N="1675" /> assess their implications and to advise on the need for any other measures.  In accordance with the agreement they reached with me, the ICC commenced the phasing in of muzzling on a trial basis at the beginning of the current season.  In the initial stage of the trials, the greyhounds participating in the semi-finals and finals of all stakes were muzzled.  The ICC recently agreed to extend these trials on muzzling to over 50 per cent of all courses.</P>
    <P>The latest information available to me, covering the period up to 10 December, is that out of 1,932 courses involving muzzles six hares were killed and ten more were injured and were put down.  The momentum towards increasing the level of muzzling will continue with all greyhounds being muzzled at enclosed coursing meetings before the end of this season and possibly as early as January.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the agreement which we have reached with the club will be observed without the necessity of legislative backing.  Nevertheless, I consider it prudent to avail of this opportunity to include a provision authorising the Minister to make regulations providing for the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings and for the proper care and veterinary supervision of hares before, during and after such meetings.  These are enabling provisions which will give the Minister power to introduce the required measures without delay if the need arises.  In the present circumstances and in view of the responsible attitude adopted by the club, the need for the regulations is questionable.  I hope Senators agree that my policy of control by consent is the correct one in this issue. However, I assure the House that if the need arises I will have no hesitation in introducing appropriate regulations.</P>
    <P>Turning to the third and final substantial issue in the Bill, it is proposed to remove the statutory provision prohibiting greyhound racing on Sundays, Good Friday and Christmas Day.  The removal of the restriction on holding greyhound races on particular days is universally welcomed by all sectors of the <Col N="1676" /> industry.  It should be clear that the greyhound industry is in direct competition with other activities in the leisure business. No similar restrictions concerning the days on which horse racing may take place exist and I believe it would be only fair to apply the same principle to the greyhound industry.  For this reason I seek the removal of references to all prohibited days.  While I have no particular desire to see greyhound racing on Good Friday or Christmas Day, I am staunchly of the view that the greyhound industry should not be seen as operating at any disadvantage, whether real or perceived, <i>vis-à-vis</i> other forms of entertainment against which they have to compete for customers.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that this measure will be effective from 1 December 1992. This is being done to regularise the position regarding two particular meetings held on Sundays during the past year, one of which was a charity event organised by the board and the other major international event at the privately owned Dundalk track.  At the time both of these events were run, Government policy in regard to the ban on Sunday racing had been publicly stated.  Consequently, I believe this measure is warranted and desirable.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say that it is our responsibility as legislators to provide the statutory framework which will enable the industry to reach its full potential. The current legislative framework is the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.  A thorough overhaul of this legislation is now called for and I hope to present a Bill to the House in the new year which will hopefully establish a legal framework which can be instrumental in enabling the greyhound industry to reach its full potential.</P>
    <P>In the interim this preliminary Bill, dealing with three urgent matters, is presented to the House for adoption.  The issues &mdash; the reconstitution of Bord na gCon, the removal of the ban of Sunday greyhound racing and enabling provisions empowering the Minister to make regulations governing the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings and veterinary <Col N="1677" /> supervision of hares &mdash; are desirable and I recommend their adoption to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Naughten has given way to Senator Dardis.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Naughten for facilitating me.  This legislation would not be before the House were it not for the courage of Deputy Gregory in putting forward his Bill in the other House.  This Bill was introduced as a response to that. The Minister said that the heads of a second Bill updating and amending the provisions of the 1958 Act are being prepared. Why not do the two things together?  This matter is being dealt with hastily, although I realise the Government gave a commitment on the basis of what was said in the Dáil and it is now being honoured.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction, but I have one serious reservation regarding the manner in which members are appointed to the board.  We are going backwards rather than forwards in this regard.  The industry is in crisis, but it has enormous potential.  It has been identified as an industry which could contribute significantly to farm incomes as a secondary activity or as an outside industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of cases where Leader funds have been used to help improve greyhound breeding and the industry and that is sensible.  However, the State cannot be happy about the way the industry is supported or the way it has declined.  The Minister mentioned figures in regard to the fall-off in attendance at race meetings and the fall-off in revenue from the tote and betting in general.  Reasons for this include a lack of facilities at race tracks. The public is becoming more sophisticated and demanding in terms of facilities and of sport, probably as a result of televised world events.  Many greyhound tracks in this country leave a lot to be desired in terms of facilities.  I do not blame those managing these track because there is a shortage of funds.  The industry needs a shake-up and I hope the <Col N="1678" /> Minister and his Department will try to effect this shake-up when they produce the promised legislation.  An industry worth £40 million to the Exchequer, with significant export earning potential, deserves more than lip service.  Successive Governments should examine their consciences in this regard.</P>
    <P>I refer to the shipping of greyhounds to countries like Spain and the conditions in which they are shipped and kept in such countries.  I realise it is difficult to intervene in the internal affairs of another country, but it is important that animals, greyhounds or otherwise, are shipped to other countries in the best conditions.  They should not be subjected to any pain or torture, just as the hare should not be subjected to pain or torture.</P>
    <P>I object to section 2 of the Bill, which states: &ldquo;The Minister shall before the 1st day of January, 1994, [he is going to have an interesting Christmas if he must do this before January 1994] appoint 6 persons to be ordinary members of the Board.&rdquo;  The section also refers to the term of office and so on.  It is bad practice that the Minister is in a position to unilaterally appoint six members to the board without reference to their qualifications.  It is a case of jobs for the boys at its worst and it is manifested in the legislation. Provision has been made in successive legislation which has gone through this House in the past few years to allow different vocational interests to have representation on boards.  In a Bill from the Department of Agriculture relating to An Bord Glas vocational interests were taken into account.  The Environmental Protection Agency Bill, introduced in this House by Deputy Harney, was another example of this and there are many more.  This is the only recent example I can think of where this is evident.  It has not been specified that some members of the board should come from the Irish Coursing Club, breeders, the veterinary profession, the IFA or bodies who have a direct interest in the sport and industry. I oppose the Bill only on those grounds. However, given the seasonal nature of the debate, I will not push it to a vote.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> Another matter I am unhappy about relates to section 3, which states that the Minster may make regulations providing for the muzzling of greyhounds.  I would say he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make regulations because it should not be discretionary.  Given the outcry about coursing and its associated activities, it should not be a discretionary matter.  It is explicit that muzzling should come into force and for that reason I do not think the discretion should be there. It is questionable whether muzzling has had any effect and, although I am not speaking from first hand experience, I understand there have been incidents where muzzled dogs have destroyed hares.  That is my understanding, though I am open to correction.</P>
    <P>It is a step in the right direction to have veterinary supervision.  Section 3(a)(iii) states that the Minister may make regulations providing for the supervision by a veterinary surgeon of hares coursed in events prior to, during and after the events.  I am not clear as to who will appoint the veterinary surgeon or from where he will come.  Will the Irish Coursing Club or the Minister vest authority in the veterinary surgeon?  I am not clear about that and the Minister might clarify it in his reply.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to table amendments to sections 2 and 3 but their value is likely to be extremely limited as they have been debated exhaustively in the Lower House.  We would only be going through a charade if we did the same thing here. It would just be wasting the time to go back over the same arguments without making any progress.</P>
    <P>As regards the days on which racing can take place, I do not think they should include Christmas Day and Good Friday, but that is a personal observation.  It is sensible to have it on Sunday but I do not think people want to go to the dogs on Christmas Day.  They might want to go to the dogs in another sense but hardly in the literal sense of attending a dog track.  From that point of view I do not see this provision as being of any value. There is no doubt that, over the years, the Christmas holiday period has become <Col N="1680" /> more commercialised.  One only has to see English football matches being played on St. Stephen's Day to recognise that.  If the greyhound industry is competing within that environment, then I suppose some argument can be made that there should be racing on Christmas Day, but I do not see the sense of it.</P>
    <P>The issue of the Minister appointing six persons to the board was also mentioned. It should be noted that the Irish horse racing authority &mdash; to be established &mdash; will involve breeders and others in that industry.  Given our recent progress in stopping abuses, such as packing a board with pals, whether suitably qualified or not, it is not good enough to have the same thing appear in section 2(2)(a) which states that &ldquo;The Minister shall, before the 1st day of January, 1994, appoint six persons to be ordinary members of the Board...&rdquo;.  The Minister should look at that again but, unfortunately, I suspect he will not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I know him well; we have been good friends since he became a Member of the Oireachtas.  On occasion we have both served as members of delegations abroad.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in introducing this Bill and thank him for the great interest he has taken in the greyhound industry since becoming Minister.  Like so many Members of the Oireachtas, past and present, I have always had a keen interest in the greyhound industry and its varying aspects from breeding to track racing and coursing.  I have bred greyhounds and raced them on the track and at coursing meetings.</P>
      <P>The final paragraph of the Minister's speech stated that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim this preliminary Bill dealing with three urgent matters is presented to the House for adoption. The issues &mdash; the reconstitution of Bord na gCon, the removal of the ban on Sunday greyhound racing and enabling provisions empowering the Minister to make regulations governing the muzzling of greyhounds at <Col N="1681" /> coursing meetings, and veterinary supervision of hares &mdash; are desirable and I recommend their adoption to the House.</P>
    <P>I will make further comments on those points later in my contribution.  I have always regarded greyhound people as being the salt of the earth.  Coursing and greyhound racing are two of the greatest traditional sports in this country.  I have also been a member of another traditional sporting organisation, the GAA, and I feel that coursing and greyhound racing follow the same fine sporting traditions.</P>
    <P>The main interest of those involved in greyhound racing is the welfare of the dog.  Such people escape the stressful life of business or politics through this leisurely pursuit.  I recall reading an English book on greyhound racing which mentioned the great nights in Cruise's Hotel after Irish Cup meetings.  It is a great sport which keeps people's minds occupied in a beneficial way.  Those involved in greyhound racing contribute much to the life of the country, particularly the social life.  A night at the dogs can be both rewarding and entertaining.  In their own way, greyhound industry people are a breed unto themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Definitely, Senator.  I agree they are a race unto themselves. The true dog enthusiast would prefer to spend his last £25 or £30 at the veterinary clinic to treat his dog's injury than meet his own medical needs.  The real greyhound man has such a love for his dog that he would buy the best mincemeat or round steak for the animal rather than for himself or his family.  The Minister may consider this an exaggeration but I can assure him that this happens all over the country.  I have seen it for myself and I have done it myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House deals with muzzling greyhounds and the reconstitution of Bord na gCon before 1 January 1994.  I will have more to say on the latter point later.  The provision in the <Col N="1682" /> Bill for muzzling greyhounds may have been unnecessary despite severe pressure from the anti-coursing lobby.  I have always believed that those who do not run coursing meetings properly should not be allowed to run any meetings.  At one time, the most important meeting in the country, the all-Ireland meeting, did not run a quality meeting.  Many hares were killed and the organisers should have been reprimanded for that.  They should also have abandoned the meeting when it became obvious the hares were not strong enough to avoid the dogs.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3)(a)(iii) states that the Minister may make regulations providing for &ldquo;the supervision by a veterinary surgeon of hares coursed in events prior to, during and after the events.&rdquo;  Subsection (3)(a)(v) states that the Minister may make regulations &ldquo;prohibiting the coursing of a hare in an event if the hare has been coursed in an event at a prior authorised coursing meeting...&rdquo;.  These provisions should have been in place long before now.  If they had, the anti-coursing lobby would not be as strong as it is today.</P>
    <P>I refer to an article I read in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 1 December 1993 entitled &ldquo;Hare Coursing: A View from Outside&rdquo;.  It was written by Zarina Geloo, a visiting journalist from Zambia, who attended a coursing meeting for the first time and found it did not live up to its reputation as a barbarian or uncivilised sport.  She wrote:</P>
    <P>I thought it would be blood and gore &mdash; it was not.  And I was disappointed. I had heard so much about Ireland's most &ldquo;despicable&rdquo; pastime.  I had flown thousands of miles to be told in Dublin that I would see the worst possible side of Irish national barbarism.</P>
    <P>Why did she come to Ireland to see this? She did so because people were decrying one of our great national sports and were depicting Irish people as worse than they actually are.  This is a shame.  She continued:</P>
    <P>I was told I would cringe to the dying scream of the poor hapless hare and be <Col N="1683" /> revolted by the savage exultation on the faces of its supporters.  I had all the literature on this abominable act and was ready to do battle for the hare, but more importantly, launch my own savage attack on coursers.</P>
    <P>It is obvious where she acquired the literature.  Irish people always criticise our great national pastimes in such a way as to suggest they should be eliminated. This would be very wrong.  She wrote:</P>
    <P>I saw a watchful vet look out for unfit hares.  Cheers went up for the hare.  I saw no savage exultation on the faces of the crowd when two hares got killed.  [I would prefer if no hares were killed but some do] The only indication I got that something had happened was the silence from the crowd at a time when I expected them to go into a wild frenzy.</P>
    <P>She pointed out that:</P>
    <P>The coursers showed remarkable restraint in dealing with attacks on their characters merely saying it was just like people in big towns to condemn a sport some of them had only heard about [the problem is those in the anti-coursing lobby have only heard about but not seen coursing] or seen on television.  As far as they were concerned the game would go on.</P>
    <P>This journalist from Zambia heard so much about the barbarism of this sport that she had to come and see it for herself. However she found it was the opposite to what she had been led to believe.</P>
    <P>The anti-coursing lobby have gone too far.  They have sent letters to farmers, who allow coursing meetings to be held on their Land, threatening that their hay would be burned if they allowed their fields to be used for coursing.  It is outrageous for this to happen in a civilised country like Ireland.  On some farms hay was burned and there was a strong suspicion that the anti-coursing lobby was responsible.  Those opposed to coursing should use legitimate means to advance their case.  They have gone too far. <Col N="1684" /> Coursing is a way of life for us and should always remain so.</P>
    <P>I hope the muzzling of greyhounds is a success.  Those who take part in coursing should continue to experiment during the year on the type of muzzle to be used.  I have reservations as to whether muzzling is necessary or not.  Coursing meetings should be properly run and only fit hares should be used.</P>
    <P>The anti-blood sports lobby has contributed to the decline of hares.  I read an article in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> which stated that foxes have eliminated hares.  People ceased killing foxes because of objections to the wearing of mink and fur coats. Other animals are killed for the provision of clothes.  Leather comes from the hides of cattle.  There are so many foxes in the country that they are hungry and are eliminating good hares.  This is the problem facing our great national sport of coursing.  We do not have strong enough hares to ensure the continuation of the sport in the way we knew it years ago.</P>
    <P>I understand that leather and plastic muzzles have been used, but no doubt a lighter form of muzzle would allow the hare through it.  Dogs must be given a chance to ensure they can give of their best.  Owners must ensure that the work they put into training dogs is rewarded.  I urge the ICC to have appropriate muzzles in place for the 1994-95 season.</P>
    <P>I have said the anti-coursing lobby is unreasonable and there is no doubt about this.  Its true colours were shown on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; programme last September when it firmly aligned itself with an organisation which attempted to sabotage our tourist industry.  This organisation's aims includes the abolition of shooting, to which I already referred, fishing, the killing of all farm animals and other outrageous aspirations.</P>
    <P>Coursing has always been and will be an integral part of the greyhound industry. Coursing is all about pace.  This is the real pace of the dogs as distinct from the pace one would witness at the track where trapping and bend trouble can play a role.  Pacing is proved by the continuous coursing of dogs.  Coursing is vital to breeding.  Prudent breeders would far <Col N="1685" /> prefer to buy the pups of a coursing bitch which has won a trial stake than those of a bitch which has won a good stake on the track.  Very few Oaks winners at Harolds Cross have proved to be outstanding brood bitches.  On the other hand, a bitch called Little Shoe, who refused to run on the track when trialled in Galway, subsequently won two Waterloo Cup plates and a number of cups including Corn na Gaillimhe.  She was sold to her owner, Brian Divilly, for only £100 because she would not track.  Yet she proved to be an outstanding brood bitch over the past ten to 12 years.  All of her litters were successful.  She bred six or seven qualifiers for the national stakes held in Clonmel.  Dogs must be good to qualify for such an event.  I know this from my experience of greyhound breeding. It is track, not coursing, dogs which make money for their owners.  Coursing is necessary to produce good track dogs which will benefit the industry and the economy.  Arguably the top sire of the same period, I'm Slippy, came from good coursing stock.  I make these points to emphasise that coursing is vital to the success of the industry.</P>
    <P>I presume open coursing will not be subject to these regulations, particularly in relation to muzzling.  Open coursing is different to closed coursing.  I have been an attender at and a follower of coursing. As I said already, I am a member of another sporting organisation, the GAA. Many great exponents of hurling and football were involved in greyhounds, such as Seán Purcell of Galway, Mick Higgins of Cavan, Kevin Heffernan of Dublin, James McCarton of Down, Dave Heaney, of whom I am privileged to be a colleague on the Munster council of the GAA, and Jimmy Barry Murphy, who won all-Ireland medals in both hurling and football.  The three members of the senior hurling selection committee in Limerick, of whom I am one, are great greyhound enthusiasts, including the manager, Tom Ryan.  It is a traditional Irish sport which goes hand in hand with the GAA.  As an Irishman, I would like to see it survive and prosper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> Section 2 of the Bill refers to the reconstitution of the new board.  I am somewhat disappointed that it will no longer be compulsory for three members of the ICC to be members of the board.  The ICC was the first body set up to control coursing and the greyhound industry. There was coursing in Ireland long before there was greyhound track racing.  It controlled all greyhound racing and tracks until the formation of Bord na gCon and has played an important part in the promotion of the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis made the point, with which I agree, that appointments should be made from the representative bodies. The Minister will appoint the six members; and there are people whom I would like to see him appoint, although he may not be in a position to do so.  I may be disappointed when I see who is appointed because people who have contributed to the greyhound industry and coursing all their life &mdash; and not just my friends - should be appointed.</P>
    <P>I know a man who is the secretary of a coursing club; his father was involved in coursing and his uncle was probably the greatest sportswriter in the country on both GAA and greyhounds.  I cannot mention his name, but I would like to see people like him appointed to the board. Such people deserve to be appointed. When the board is announced by the Minister, before 1 January, people will be disappointed and interested lobbies should be represented.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's concern about having a more balanced board representing all interests in the industry and this provision will not exclude coursing people.  I do not know whether the Minister or the Minister of State who is here today will decide that, but if the Minister of State has an input I would stress to him that the coursing people who were responsible for the greyhound industry in its initial years should be represented.</P>
    <P>The new board must make every effort to make greyhound racing more comfortable and prove that a night at the dogs is an enjoyable social occasion or else the crowds will not return.  The board must also address the question of our having <Col N="1687" /> too many tracks for the size of our population and, more importantly, for the number of dogs in the country.  It is well known that there is a decrease in meetings resulting in fewer pups, as was referred to already, saplings and race dogs being available.  It was disappointing to see people going to greyhound racing tracks and seeing races with only two, three or four dogs.  That will not attract people in the future.</P>
    <P>Sometimes owners were annoyed that dogs were not being raced at tracks and would go out of their time.  That happened a long time ago but now it is quite the opposite.  The same dogs seem to be running at every race meeting held at some tracks.  Many stakes did not fill during the year, which indicates to me that all is not well in the industry. However, that does not apply to all tracks.  In Limerick, Kerry and Cork, which is the home of greyhound racing &mdash; although the Cathaoirleach may not agree &mdash; there are good stakes and entries.  There are other tracks which are not so good, so I would like that question to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I also hope that the board will address the question of the sale of greyhounds. I accept that most greyhounds are sold subsequent to performance or trial, having been seen performing by the new purchaser or agent.  Unfortunately, the official sales at Shelbourne Park and in Limerick do not seem to be very successful for this reason.  I would further question the role of the Bord na gCon sales force.  This body seems to be practically non-existent and the whole question of sales needs to be fully addressed by the board.  There are some fly-by-nights buying greyhounds and selling them wherever they buy them at a profit. If they make a profit, the poor greyhound owner is left with the dog and may lose the sale.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the generosity of Bord na gCon and compliment the present board, especially the chief executive, Seán Collins, and the chairman, Kevin Frost.  They are extremely generous to charities which <Col N="1688" /> seek permission to run meetings at tracks to raise moneys.  They do not charge much and the charities benefit financially and otherwise.  I know from my own experience as a member of a GAA club and the county board that we have used tracks and made money for charity.  With these reservations, which I hope the Minister of State will consider, I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have a few things to say which will not please my good friend Senator Rory Kiely, or even, perhaps, the Cathaoirleach.  Far from seeing this as a great national sport, I think it is a great national disgrace of which we should be thoroughly ashamed.  I am not the slightest bit intimidated by Senator Rory Kiely describing this as an Irish activity, with almost the implication that one is guilty of un-Irish activity by opposing it.  Of course, I oppose it; I think most civilised people do.  I do not see anything elevating in the spectacle of a small, frightened animal being torn to shreds by these revolting dogs.  I rather like dogs, but the most obscene of all dogs is that disgusting, semi-naked animal, the greyhound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I would take pleasure in it and I very much doubt if Senator Kiely would either.  Is the House aware of the meaning of the expression &ldquo;going to the dogs&rdquo;?  It is certainly an expression with which I am familiar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that one is morally going down the drain because one is witnessing the disgusting spectacles with which the Irish public have become so familiar that they are now totally against the alleged sport of coursing.  The arguments propounded by Senator Kiely would equally apply if he was attempting to defend cock fighting, bear baiting, bull fighting or dog fighting.  One could raise exactly the same arguments such as that it strengthens the racing of the dog or the bear.  It is all nonsense because it excludes any degree of understanding of or compassion for the innocent victim.</P>
      <P>I am not always given to quoting the sayings of great saints of the Roman Catholic Church and I have to say that St. Thomas More is not a person who appeals greatly to me.  However, I recall that when I read <i>Utopia</i> I was amazed by his callousness towards human beings, but even more amazed by the vehement feelings he expressed on hare coursing.  I passed this quotation from <i>Utopia</i> to my good friend, Deputy Gregory, whose valiant work in this area I commend.  At lunch today he very kindly gave it to me and saved me the trouble of going down to the College of the Sacred and Undivided Trinity and looking for it in my own copy of <i>Utopia</i>.  Senator Kiely and the clergy who deface their cloth by attending coursing meetings in Roman and other collars would do well to read <i>Utopia</i> and particularly the section where St. Thomas More puts the moral position clearly on the record.  He says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> Thou shouldst rather be moved with pity to see a silly innocent hare murdered of a dog, the weak of the stronger, the fearful of the fierce, the innocent of the cruel and unmerciful. Therefore, all this exercise of hunting is a thing unworthy to be used of free men.</P>
    <P>There is a comprehensive answer to any suggestion that this is an innately Irish sport and that we are not fully Irish if we do not endorse this bloodthirsty activity.</P>
    <P>My hands are not entirely clean in this either.  I understand the hunting instinct as it is something we all have.  I speak with some feeling on the matter because I remember as a child going out to Bull Island.  I was pretty fit in those days and I was able to catch two leverets and bring them home with me.  They were frightened but seemed to be all right.  I did not realise the damage I was doing and the terror I was causing to these unfortunate animals.  We kept them in an outhouse overnight and next morning inevitably they were dead.  It was explained to me by my mother that one of the reasons was that hares have an unusually sensitive nervous system and they can die very easily of fright.  This is one of the answers to the nonsense suggestion of muzzling the dogs.  Why half measures?  Why not just ban the thing outright?  Muzzling does not work.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis made an interesting and careful speech, but his attention must have been distracted when he said he was not sure whether hares were ever actually killed by muzzled dogs.  I say his attention must have been momentarily distracted because the Minister quite forthrightly places on the record&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris, you are inviting me to respond and I am doing my best to resist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>You are very good at resisting.  Six hares were killed and ten more injured and put down within the last year by muzzled dogs.  This is mentioned in the Minister's own speech, so we know that they are injured and that <Col N="1691" /> they do have to be put down.  The terror of the hare which St. Thomas More insists upon is a thing about which I feel strongly. The terror of these small animals is something that can easily lead to their death because of their unusually delicate nervous system.</P>
      <P>I was fortunate enough to have lunch with the greyhound espousing Senator Henry and the hare loving Deputy Gregory.  When we were discussing this, Deputy Gregory told me that the old Northern Ireland Assembly voted overwhelmingly to outlaw this vicious sport. The man who proposed this Bill said that putting the racing board people in charge of monitoring the hares was like putting Dracula in charge of a blood bank.  I oppose hare coursing, but if one is going to allow muzzling one must have independent monitoring.  There is no point in having discredited organisations like the Irish Coursing Club doing their own monitoring.  Apart from anything else, it is not fair on them, not that I want to be fair to them.  It does not produce any objective criteria to reassure the public that the welfare of the hares is being ensured.</P>
      <P>It is also extraordinary that although the Northern Ireland Assembly passed that Bill, the British Parliament declined to implement it.  Perhaps Senator Kiely will not be quite so pleased to learn that in this instance at least it was not an Ulster activity but that the British Parliament obviously felt it was part of the British way of life.  Perhaps he will be pleased to join in what is apparently quite a British activity.</P>
      <P>I have put down some amendments. One seeks to replace the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The argument was made effectively this afternoon by Senator Dardis.  I also, in consultation with Deputy Gregory, put down an amendment dealing with the monitoring and supervision by an independent authority and another amendment which would allow access to veterinary officials and the fee paying public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is such a wonderful Irish sport why do these shy little rural flowers, who <Col N="1692" /> are so terribly misunderstood by Dublin 4, Dublin 1, where Deputy Gregory comes from, and Dublin 2, where Senator Henry is admiring the greyhounds, feel it necessary to exclude people who might not share their unqualified delight in butchery?  Why are they so retiring?  If it is such a lovely thing to witness a small animal being torn to shreds, why do we not have everybody going and being morally improved by this spectacle?  Why are certain groups and categories of people or people who look as if they do not agree with the sport excluded?</P>
    <P>I honour Deputy Gregory for his work on behalf of the innocent, frightened and small animal.  I hope the Minister will take on board some of the arguments, particularly with regard to independent monitoring, otherwise the system becomes a farce and useless.  I wish there was no hare coursing at all.  It seems to me to be the same kind of activity as bear baiting, cock fighting, dog fighting, all of which we disapprove.  The only argument I can see for continuing to allow it is that by driving it underground one would make it even more vicious.  We have the spectacle of the continuation of cock fights and dog fights in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on the Bill.  I am pleased the Government agreed to undertake a comprehensive review of the greyhound industry.  There is a serious need to revamp the greyhound industry with a view to enhancing it as a tourist attraction, as a means of creating further employment and increasing its export value.</P>
      <P>As a tourist attraction there is a need for proper marketing of the sport and for publicising its star attractions such as the Derby, the Puppy Derby, the Leger and the Irish Cup, right down to the smallest coursing meeting of the year.  The greyhound industry is export oriented and we must see tourism as a means of ensuring that the attraction and value of the industry is highlighted at all times and in as many places as possible.  While we see calendars with listings and timings of all the year's horse racing meetings, I have yet to see such presentation for the greyhound industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not recall hearing meetings advertised or broadcast on local radio.  I hope this situation will be reversed and that it will follow the example of RTÉ which has Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh introducing an excellent advertisement for the industry, &ldquo;A Night at the Dogs&rdquo;.  With tourism also in mind this Bill will allow greyhound racing on previously prohibited days and while I agree with the Minister I do not agree with greyhound racing or coursing on Christmas Day or Good Friday.  It is imperative to allow the greyhound industry to have the use of Sundays and other days when there is a festival or a tourist attraction in a particular area.  It is proper for the greyhound industry to display its ability to <Col N="1694" /> provide entertainment for all on such occasions.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the industry, through this Bill, will have wider representation on Bord na gCon which will ensure a far wider view of its problems and possible solutions.  In regard to increased interest in the industry, I was always a little disappointed that Bord na gCon did not initiate, as in other sports, a national track championship for all the tracks in the country and then, on a knock out basis, advance to a grand final, which would create enormous interest at local and national level.  This competition could be determined on an eight race programme with three dogs representing each track in each race and a points system, the total result at the end of the night determining the advance to the next round.  It would give owners of all grades of dog a chance to show their wares as representatives of their local track and create an interest and potential that could only be to the benefit of tracks, owners and breeders.  I hope that such a suggestion will be investigated.</P>
    <P>In a short time the Minister has taken an important step towards creating a situation acceptable to all.  In providing for the muzzling of the greyhound and the presence of veterinary personnel, he has ensured that every possible effort has been made to allow coursing to continue as a sport to be enjoyed and not as a hunt for hares to be killed.  I ask the Minister to continue monitoring the situation regarding coursing meetings, the release of hares at the end of each meeting and to ensure that the hares are returned to their natural habitat.  It should not be a major problem in the modern electronic world to ensure that hares released at the end of a meeting are not coursed again by marking them with a chip or similar device.  I commend the Minister on this Bill and look forward to the future review of this industry in a subsequent Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and am delighted that he has responsibility for the greyhound industry because he will do his utmost to get it back on a proper footing.  There is no <Col N="1695" /> question about it, much work needs to be done with regard to the industry.  The industry is a shambles and needs a direct injection of capital to get it back on its feet.</P>
      <P>I regret we do not have a comprehensive Bill dealing with the greyhound industry.  This Bill makes only two major changes to the industry, one in regard to the board and the other in regard to the muzzling of dogs and the requirement of veterinary inspection.  A more comprehensive Bill would, I hope, restore confidence in the industry and create the type of development we would all like to see in the greyhound industry in general, as distinct from open air coursing.</P>
      <P>The Minister presented this Bill as part of a wider review of the greyhound industry and intends bringing in further legislation within the coming year.  I regret that all the changes to the industry were not made in one Bill as we would then be in a better position to judge precisely what the Minister had in mind.  As things stand it seems there are serious difficulties in the relationship between Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club.  In regard to the membership of the board, if I were putting down an amendment, I would put down one to increase the number of directors appointed and to ensure that the Irish Coursing Club had representation on Bord na gCon. However, I am long enough in this House to know the Minster will not accept an amendment that would send the Bill back to the other House in the new year.  I hope he will see his way to expand the board and allow the Irish Coursing Club to have representation on it.  Senator Kiely referred to the same difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many Members of this House, I occasionally go to coursing meetings and the track, although not nearly as often as I would like.  I have always enjoyed it. Very often people who talk about live hare coursing are those who know nothing about the sport and have never seen what happens at a coursing meeting. Anybody who goes to a coursing meeting will know that everybody there will cheer <Col N="1696" /> when the hare gets away.  Nobody goes there to see hares being killed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately hares are killed and the Irish Coursing Club have contributed in no small way to much of the bad publicity in so far as they allowed hares, which should not have been used, to be raced. I welcome the introduction of the veterinary inspector.  Many of my friends are breeders and owners of greyhounds and as Senator Kiely said earlier, it is a great sport in rural areas.</P>
    <P>As a very small boy I remember people hunting hares with dogs, it is a sport that goes back for generations.  I agree with everything done to regulate the sport. If the regulations were implemented the brutality on an occasion last February would not have taken place.  Those positive aspects of the Bill are welcome.  The importance of coursing and the whole greyhound industry and the part it plays in rural Ireland must be recognised.  It often provides an alternative income for farmers who rear, train or course dogs. It is a sizeable industry and anyone who has been to Clonmel in February will have seen the size of the industry and the level of interest in it.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a couple of points not dealt with in this Bill but which may arise if the Minister brings forward another Bill next year, with regard to the issue of alternative farming.  Nobody knows better than the Minister of State that farmers' incomes will reduce over the next couple of years as a result of what happened with CAP and GATT and we need other industries and opportunities to develop alternative incomes. The greyhound industry would present more opportunities than deer farming or other industries that have been encouraged because there are limited markets for them.  The greyhound industry can be expanded substantially and create different incomes for many farmers.  I would like to see that dealt with and grants for the industry reintroduced.  I understand that under the last grant scheme there was a requirement for planning permission for the construction of kennels or for putting in runs, for example.  I do not see why the planning permission <Col N="1697" /> should be needed in rural areas.  I hope that a grant scheme will be reintroduced in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the survey done by the University of Limerick which showed that 6,000 of the 8,000 people involved in the industry come from farming backgrounds.  The rural environment is an ideal one for breeding and rearing young dogs.  Therefore, it does not surprise me that 75 per cent of the people involved come from rural areas.  That gives an indication of the vital importance of this industry and I understand its value is in the region of £40 million.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of work to be done with regard to the breeding and rearing of dogs, particularly breeding, and only a little research has been done here.  I would like to see more research and development on breeding and on the type of dog bred in this country.  We breed more of the sprinter or short distance runner dogs whereas, if we bred dogs for stamina, we might be able to open up an export market to the USA, another aspect of the industry that needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I hope the directors the Minister appoints to the board can contribute to the development of the industry and will not be appointed simply because they know somebody.  They should be committed to developing the industry.  I take the point that one also needs business people involved, but it is important to have people who know the industry and that is why the Irish Coursing Club should have representatives on the board.  I am a member of another society, people who knew little about it gained control of it and some of the decisions they made were totally unsuitable for the breed of animal with which they were dealing.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely referred to one of the best breeding bitches in the country, Little Shoe, which happened to be bred and reared close to my home.  That dog would not run on the track but it coursed and became one of the best breeding dogs in the country.  It proves there is a need <Col N="1698" /> for track racing and coursing.  I mentioned it is a declining industry, that a new board must concentrate on improving the facilities at dog tracks and coursing meetings and, thereby, try to encourage the participation of more people in the sport and increase attendances. If that can be done there will be more meetings and a healthier and better industry.</P>
    <P>Often, when we hear the anti-coursing lobby talking about coursing, it is because they do not understand the sport.  It is a rural sport and often those who object to it are urban based, which is a great pity. Occasionally there is a meeting, and I referred to one held last February where even the old guidelines or principles were not adhered to, if they had been we would not have had all the bad publicity which resulted in Deputy Gregory's Private Members' Bill in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision regarding the veterinary inspection but I wonder, and the point has been raised already, whether it will be a veterinary surgeon from the Department or a local veterinarian who might be involved with the coursing club.  It is important that the criteria laid down in this Bill are implemented and that we would encourage coursing clubs to insist on muzzling rather than legislating for that.  It is also important that the veterinary surgeon should be independent and carry out the job in an effective and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>The contribution by those who catch hares for coursing meetings and the procedures they follow are not often fully appreciated.  Without them there would be an unlimited amount of inbreeding and, inevitably, disease.  By virtue of the fact that these people go out and hunt the hares, catch them for the coursing meetings and let them out again in another area, they are automatically introducing a safeguard as far as a breeding programme is concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in the regulation regarding Sunday racing and I have no difficulty with that.  I can appreciate that <Col N="1699" /> the same will apply to Christmas Day and Good Friday, but I do not think there is a great demand for racing then so I have no problem with it.  I stated that the industry is of major importance and I would like to see every effort made to improve it.  That would be possible with a few simple changes and good management so that we can increase the attendances at meetings thereby increasing the revenue, a good breeding programme would increase our exports.</P>
    <P>On the issue of exports one matter concerns me.  The Department should examine the situation regarding the sale of dogs to Spain which is, undoubtedly, causing concern to genuine greyhound breeders.  They are not happy with people who buy dogs for export to Spain.  Often, the dogs are shipped in undesirable conditions, but when they arrive I understand they are badly treated and raced when they are barely able to stand up.  I know greyhound owners with dogs of limited value &mdash; they might not be fast enough or they will not course or track &mdash; and the owners would put their dogs down before they sell them to that market.  I appeal to the Minister to examine that aspect of the industry to see what can be done to prevent abuse in that area. I would propose an amendment if it was another time of the year but I appeal to the Minister to listen to the sentiments expressed by Senator Kiely to amend the figure of six to nine.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad and congratulate him on his work for the greyhound industry.  The Minister said the greyhound industry is a significant source of employment in rural areas.  I understand that 8,000 people are involved in the industry as breeders, owners and trainers.  It was estimated that about 10,000 people are employed in the operation of tracks and the supply of ancillary services.  This is a significant figure in view of our employment problem. <Col N="1700" /> As it is an indigenous industry it should be nurtured and developed.</P>
      <P>I come from an area that borders a disadvantaged area.  There are no cereal or root crop industry there and the cattle, sheep, pigs and greyhounds industries are significant contributors to income.  Greyhound breeding is an integral part of rural life.  It is the small farmers' occupation. The country cottier may turn his acre into a kennel where he keeps three or four dames to breed the greyhounds.  He may sell some of these at three months old or rear them to 14 or 18 months when he will take them to time trials or sales.  It is a significant means of financing for the farmer and cottier.  These small farmers have carried on this tradition for many years.  Bord na gCon, in their survey of small farmers, stated that 6,000 of the 8,000 breeders are from agricultural areas.  That firmly places the industry's base in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister also stated that these activities generate an estimated farm income of £16 million or an average of £2,600 per farmer.  That is a nice handshake at the end of the year.  The industry is worth about £40 million to the economy which is a great achievement and by nurturing the industry that figure can be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my area of Kanturk there are many such breeders and trainers.  I was involved at an early age helping in the training of dogs.  One of my chores involved going to the public houses for waste porter which was fed to the puppies. Of course, in County Cork we had three brands of stout and this probably accounted for many fine dogs bred there. I bought my first pair of football boots with the proceeds of a well placed bet on a greyhound in the Cork track many years ago.  One of the most outstanding dogs from my town was Kilcasken Kern.  In the mid-1950s he won the St. Leger in Limerick, the Cloth of Gold in England and many other awards and trophies.  He created much excitement for the local people, even those who were not <Col N="1701" /> interested in the greyhound industry.  To think that a small town like Kanturk could breed and train a dog that could achieve such heights was a source of great pride.</P>
    <P>Such feats by Irish greyhounds became the shop window for the greyhound export industry.  It appears that we have the skills to breed good greyhounds, as is the case in the horse industry.  The horse, too, has played a significant role in my area.  There is an international showjumping arena in the area and if we continue along similar lines with greyhounds, we may eventually have an international greyhound arena.</P>
    <P>England and America are our largest export markets.  Some of our greyhounds have had some fine achievements in Florida. We are now talking of getting into the North American market.  It appears that American buyers have recommended to the Irish greyhound industry that dogs destined for export to America should be trained in Ireland for American conditions.  If we wish to expand our export industry we should not hesitate in conforming to their requests.</P>
    <P>I regret that attendance at greyhound tracks has fallen because the development and expansion of these tracks depend on gate receipts.  Like every other sport, this sport is open to competition. Over the years greyhound tracks and stands have become shabby, draughty, and that is unacceptable.  To correct that we must invest money.  It is envisaged that Shelbourne Park be established as the premium greyhound track and that Clonmel, Youghal and Harold's Cross be sold.  If Clonmel is sold, the Limerick track is not too far away; Youghal is near the Cork track and if we sell Harold's Cross, we will still have Shelbourne Park. We will not be without tracks.  The provision of modern amenities and comforts at our tracks will attract the support the industry deserves.</P>
    <P>Coursing is older than time.  In 300 BC hounds hunted hares in Egypt.  The sport was brought to England by the Normans <Col N="1702" /> in 1067 and eventually reached our shores.  Recently there has been much controversy about coursing.  I agree that much of this was the result of carelessness and slippage.  The provision of veterinary care for dogs before and after coursing was scant; sheep foodstuffs were provided for the hares; and hares were bought from previous meets.  As a result the industry attracted the anti-coursing lobbyists and the industry had the task of proving that it could restore some sanity to coursing and restore the sport to the pinnacle it deserves.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted figures regarding the provision of a temporary muzzle for dogs which show that up to 21 November, in 1,029 courses where the muzzle was used, four hares were killed and eight were injured and had to be put down. This is a remarkable achievement.  There was an experiment with a muzzle 20 years ago which ended in failure.  Some dogs broke their necks as a result of wearing it.  The muzzle has now been perfected and I hope that it will be used at all courses.  I hope we see wild hares outwitting and outmanoeuvring well fed dogs instead of the unsightly image of two dogs tearing an animal apart.  That was never meant to be part of coursing. My people were involved in coursing all their lives and they have a perpetual cup for coursing in Dromina, Charleville, County Cork.  We always had a connection with and a love for the dog and hare.</P>
    <P>I support the introduction of the Sunday meet.  I hope this will generate the revenue which Bord na gCon requires to help it through its bad times.  I congratulate the Minister on his handling of the situation and I wish him well in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Senator Norris's dislike for the well muzzled greyhound because he goes to the gym every night and I thought he was trying to improve his physique.  In fact, he might be an admirer of the greyhound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> I listened with great interest to this debate because Members talked about the decline of the greyhound industry. Has it occurred to them that the decline in the interest of greyhound racing may be due to its association with coursing? This is important.  I did not realise the decline was so bad until I looked at the Minister's figures.  I have often gone to greyhound races and they are entertaining, apart from the fact that the races are too short because the greyhounds are too fast.  However, someone who owns a greyhound or has a lot of money on it would have a different view.  This cannot be said for coursing.  Is it wise for people to have this close association between coursing and greyhound racing?  Certain things are unacceptable to the public in the entertainment arena.  People such as Senator Kiely, Senator Wall and Senator Cashin may be able to have their coursing meets, but not greyhound racing.  Surely we are talking about racing and the export of greyhounds to countries where coursing is not their traditional sport.  The closer the association between coursing and greyhound racing the more damage will be done to the greyhound racing industry and to the export of greyhounds.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable to most people that hares should be coursed as a sport and form of entertainment.  It was suggested that anyone who had been to coursing meetings would be in favour of coursing. I was brought up on the Mahon Peninsula outside Cork and there were green fields around my home.  Opposite our house was a large field where some of the major Munster meets were held.  Members who have been to greyhound meets may have visited this place.  It was a 20 acre field surrounded by walls.  A gate allowed access to Walsh's field and another gate opened on to the road on our side.  I remember the meets in this field and where the hares were kept in boxes.  I remember the man on the horse who went with the greyhounds to the kill and I saw the hares being torn apart.  I remember <Col N="1704" /> seeing hares for coursing lying dead in the boxes.  Therefore, we should not say it is only people who have never seen such things who are against coursing.  I saw these incidents of barbaric cruelty and there is no reason this should continue.</P>
    <P>I understand muzzling has been introduced to deal with the kill and it may help.  The number of kills has decreased dramatically and I am delighted to hear this.  However, we are talking about the terrorisation of one animal by two others. I have nothing against greyhounds or those who bring the greyhounds to race meetings.  Is this the type of violent sport we want to see in this country?  If one cannot have greyhound racing without coursing, there will be less greyhound racing in future.</P>
    <P>Some Members talked about closing greyhound tracks because they are too draughty and unpleasant.  How many people go to point-to-point meetings and have a great time?  There are no comforts at these meetings, but this does not stop people from going.  People are not going to greyhound racing because of the association between it and coursing.  It is anathema to people.  Most greyhound tracks will need support, not only from people involved in the coursing industry, but from the public, although they will not be enthusiastic about giving it. I am not only talking about people involved in anti-blood sport campaigns, but about the public who must go to these meetings.</P>
    <P>Those who say coursing should continue should remember they may be cutting their own throats.  If they claim that coursing is necessary to encourage the greyhound industry, people will believe that the greyhound industry and greyhound racing are barbaric, which it is not. It is not that long since dog fighting and cock fighting took place.  In fact, the gardaí still investigate illegal cock fights and dog fights and people are arrested. However, the public are not in favour of such events.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> Violence in videos &mdash; and I am not trying to equate this with coursing &mdash; and violence of any sort, particularly involving terror and destruction of an animal, is deplorable.  I listened to Members who said that everyone cheers when the hare gets away.  Of course they do, but how often does the hare get away?  Not too often.  I remember that field on the Mahon Peninsula and some Members must have been there.  Houses have been built there now, but anyone who says they followed coursing for years must have been at those meets in Blackrock, County Cork.  I remember the dead hares in the boxes and the hares being killed.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that the coursing body seems to be self supervised.  I agree with Senator Dardis and Senator Norris that the Minister may make regulations in this regard.  However, that is not good enough.  &ldquo;May&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; are different words with different meanings, although they are sometimes transposed in the English language.  The Minister must agree that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; must be included in this section, otherwise there is no point introducing the Bill because there is no sense of commitment.</P>
    <P>The issue of veterinary surgeons has already been referred to.  They must be appointed by the Minister.  The coursing clubs must not be allowed to appoint their own veterinary surgeons.  I am not questioning the integrity of members of the veterinary profession, but a conflict of interests is bound to arise.  It would be foolish to include those clauses if veterinary surgeons are not independently appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the marking of hares before they are released into the wild. We are not living in the dark ages, therefore why are we talking about putting dye on their coats?  For example, is it not possible to put electronic pellets under their fur if they are released?  This would be a definite way to mark them.  It is pathetic to suggest dyeing hares or putting a mark on them which can easily be removed.  If these animals are released, <Col N="1706" /> modern marking must be put on them to prevent them from being recoursed.</P>
    <P>A supervisory role for wildlife officers could also be important at these meetings, but this has not been suggested in the Bill.  I deplore the idea of holding meetings on Good Friday or Christmas Day.  I understand why Sunday meetings are held, but I have not heard anyone supporting Good Friday and Christmas Day meetings.  I strongly suggest to the Minister that he remove those two days from the Bill before it is enacted.</P>

      <P>I want to address the last point made by Senator Henry about coursing on Good Friday and Christmas Day.  I am not seeking to promote greyhound racing on Good Friday and Christmas Day.  Indeed, a decision to hold greyhound racing on either of those days would be a commercial decision.</P>

      <P>Holding a race meeting on either of those days would be a commercial decision.  I do not believe that there would be any validity to a decision of that kind.  However, my position on this issue is one of equality of treatment among sports.  There is no such restriction on horse racing or on other sports.  Therefore, while I am not promoting the sport on Good Friday or Christmas Day, there should be equality of treatment between sports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis questioned the need for two Bills.  The comprehensive legislation which will be introduced in the new session is complex and, therefore, requires time to prepare.  It was not possible to have such legislation enacted before the end of the year.  However, there were three important issues which had to be dealt with urgently.  First, if legislation is introduced to change the <Col N="1707" /> composition of the board it must be enacted before 31 December 1993, otherwise the three reserve places for members of the standing committee of the ICC would be maintained and a board would have to be appointed on that basis.  Secondly, we have been waiting for the earliest opportunity to introduce legislation to remove the ban on Sunday racing.  This was the opportunity to do so, which we grasped.  Thirdly, the section giving power to the Minister to introduce regulations for the muzzling of greyhounds and for stricter veterinary controls were introduced on foot of undertakings given in the Dáil earlier this year when the issue was debated.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Department are seeking to put in place the legislative framework for the industry to get back to where it was, as Senator Naughten said, and to prosper in the future.  On a specific point which the Senator made, that the Department supported the case strongly, with the EU Commission, to have greyhound breeding recognised as supplementary farm enterprise for the purpose of EU grant schemes, we are aware of the difficulties breeders have in regard to planning permission for on-farm kennels qualifying for Structural Funds.  We made representations to the Minister for the Environment on this matter and as far as we are aware, the problems have been resolved.  Therefore, the scheme of aid under this heading is expected to continue in the next round of Structural Funds, covering the period 1994-97.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis made the point, which I believe has support in the House, with the possible exception of Senator Henry, that there is a need to upgrade facilities at greyhound tracks.  The 1958 Act came into operation in 1959 in a period before we had RTÉ, or a national television service.  In the intervening years, many competing entertainments have emerged. I have seen tracks in other countries and I conclude that we must provide <Col N="1708" /> facilities whereby people can have other aspects of entertainment when they go out for a night's racing, such as a meal, a drink or the possibility of viewing racing from an indoor heated area.  We have those facilities at some tracks, but the problem is that there has been no money to make grant aid available to tracks to enable them to upgrade and refurbish their facilities.  Such measures are vital.</P>
    <P>I take issue with points made regarding nominations to the new board.  Until 1958, when the Greyhound Industry Bill was enacted, the track side of the industry had been administered by the ICC. Therefore, in terms of continuity and expertise, it made sense to reserve three of the six ordinary places for members of the ICC in 1958.  However, in the interim, the board has been in charge of the industry and approximately 20 groups have a valid case in terms of being represented on the board.  Seven is the requisite size as the industry needs a board that can be decisive and effective.</P>
    <P>In addition to knowledge of the industry, the board must have expertise, legal, commercial or whatever, to ensure that the industry is, in the latter part of the 20th century, able to develop to the level of other industries to enable it to compete. Many factors compete against the industry, for example, in the USA, State lotteries have pulled away patrons from greyhound racing.  I cannot say that our national lottery has stopped patrons going to greyhound racing, that is something I can only guess at.  However, it is a measure of the competition which the industry faces.</P>
    <P>When I took up office, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, had set up his task force in July 1992 to examine the industry.  One of the areas under review was coursing.  I consulted widely, listened to arguments and attended a small number of coursing meetings.  Personally I found the kill unacceptable.  I did not consider either extreme, on one side total abolition and <Col N="1709" /> on the other the <i>status quo</i>, as a solution. I believe that we have presented a sensible, middle ground solution which most people consider reasonable.  Extreme solutions do not solve problems.  Whereas there are strongly held views, which I respect, there are many views which I have sought to accommodate.</P>
    <P>Finally, a couple of Senators made comparisons with cock fighting, dog fighting and so on.  The object of coursing is not to maim, injure or kill.  It is a contest between two greyhounds chasing a hare.  Unfortunately over the years hares have been killed and maimed. When the Wildlife Bill, 1993, was discussed earlier this year I gave a commitment to the Dáil to introduce measures to eliminate the kill.  That is my commitment and that is what I will continue to pursue.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> You may recall that Senator Norris told me when I came into the House that I was to say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; to everything he said.  This is another day on which to comply with his request.</P>
    <P>The amendment suggests that mechanical hares be used at coursing meetings. I am not quite certain how this would work.  However, Senator Norris must have some experience of meetings which were satisfactory where mechanical hares were used, otherwise he would not be in agreement with the amendment.  Sadly, have no experience of the use of mechanical hares at coursing meetings.  It may be equivalent to a drag hunt.  The Minister might consider the use of mechanical hares if it is feasible.  It should not be beyond the ingenuity of mechanical engineers to produce such a hare and there may be prototypes available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> I wish to clarify one point.  Senator Norris seemed to suggest I favoured hare coursing, but that is not the case.  I am certainly concerned about the decline in the greyhound industry and attendances on tracks, but that is not to say I am in favour of hare coursing.  The two subjects are separate.</P>

I am prepared to accept that the present Minister's credentials are good and he has made a determined effort to deal with this problem, but the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; leaves far too much latitude. The public expectation is that muzzling will occur and the Minister will ensure that, but the section leaves too much discretion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I said earlier that the Irish Coursing Club would encourage the use of muzzles.  We must do everything possible to ensure that the body regulating the sport helps eliminate the killing of hares.  No one in this House wants to see hares killed if it is avoidable.  The controlling body should ensure the muzzle is used.  The Bill provides that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; intervene if the club is not doing that.  I have no difficulty with the current wording. We must encourage the club to provide <Col N="1712" /> maximum safety for hares in live hare coursing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is far too much self-regulation in the Bill.  This provision weakens the legislation.  The public think the Minister's intention is that muzzling will be obligatory, not that he will rely on the Irish Coursing Club to use muzzles and follow it up if it does not.  It will be easy to monitor closed coursing meetings. It will be different with open coursing meetings, which are arranged at short notice and irregularly.  It is not clear how they will be inspected.  Not using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; weakens the measure enormously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has discretion under six other subsections of this section, not just the muzzling provision.  I sympathise with Senator Naughten's call for self-regulation.  Unfortunately, the history of the Irish Coursing Club suggests it was indifferent if not hostile to the clear signals coming from the public. There was little desire on its part to regulate the sport.  It was only as a result of Deputy Gregory's Bill that a degree of regulation was introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue here is whether the Minister should have discretion in making the regulations.  I believe he should have that discretion and I have not heard any argument which convinces me to the contrary.  Most Acts passed by the Oireachtas in recent years have allowed Ministers to retain discretion.  It is important to have that in Bills such as this which provide for an evolving situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1713" /> I reached an agreement earlier this year with the Irish Coursing Club about experimenting on muzzles and this anticipated the legislation.  For the welfare of both hares and greyhounds it is important to use the correct muzzle.  It is also important to provide the correct veterinary and other necessary controls.</P>
    <P>My Department has a monitoring committee which is attending all coursing meetings this year.  I believe it missed one meeting.  At the end of the season, when we have received data from all the meetings, it is our intention to review that information.  We will then decide on the best course to give effect to the commitment to eliminate the kill which was given to the Dáil by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and myself.</P>
    <P>This provision is not new in legislation and I believe it is necessary because the Minister needs to have flexibility.  I can give a commitment to the House that the requisite regulations will be introduced as speedily as possible.  We have to do it properly and we have not yet identified the type of muzzle most appropriate in this case.  All courses, as of next season, will feature muzzles.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(vii)  the supervision by a veterinary surgeon or Wildlife Officer of the release of the hares into the wild (and not on the preserve of any coursing club) after each Coursing Meeting, having been marked so that they may not be recoursed,</P>
      <P>(viii)  the media and the fee paying public shall have access to all coursing meetings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have modern day electronic marking of dogs, which would be an excellent idea.  The same marking could be done for hares so no one could say that the same hares would be caught and recoursed.  We should not leave ourselves with regulations which are open to claims <Col N="1714" /> of being inadequate as soon as they are introduced.  I would be grateful if the Minister would try to make this happen.</P>
    <P>It is important that coursing clubs hear what Senator Norris is trying to say on this matter &mdash; of course Senator Norris would never try to talk; he would always talk.  Senator Norris is anxious that there should not be such a high level of self-regulation. The releasing of coursed hares should be done outside the territory of the coursing clubs and it should be supervised by a Minister's agent, who could either be a wildlife officer or a veterinary inspector.  As I said earlier, this is not an attack on the integrity of any veterinary officer who might be there in his auspices as a member of the coursing club, but it is wiser not to have a conflict of interest in these areas.</P>

      <P>My point is slightly different to that of Senator Henry.  At the conclusion of Second Stage the Minister may have referred to a query I raised.  If he did refer to it, I would be grateful if he would repeat it.  My point concerns the supervision by the veterinary surgeon and about how that person is appointed. Who is the agency that appoints that person?  Are they an agent of the Department or of the coursing club?  My concern is that if the coursing club is the appointing agency, they can be selective in the surgeon they choose.</P>

      <P>I referred to that matter as well when I made my contribution and the Minister, in his reply, probably omitted it.  The point raised by Senator Dardis is a valid one.  Senator Henry made a similar point.  It would be important from everybody's point of view to have an independent veterinary officer. Bad publicity was generated last year when unfit hares were raced.  It is important that the veterinary officer examining the hares would carry out his job in a fair minded way.  Therefore, the question of who appoints them is an important one.</P>

      <P>We are referring to areas which will essentially arise in the context <Col N="1715" /> of the regulations and our experience during the year.  In a direct answer to Senator Dardis, the Bill makes no provision in relation to the appointment of veterinary surgeons.  However, it is the intention that the regulations will require the ICC to hire veterinary surgeons from the private sector.  I have problems with the tenor of some of the contributions which seem to infer in some way that some veterinary surgeons might act in a less than professional way.  It is regrettable that this type of comment should be made.</P>

      <P>Essentially, the regulations are flexible and provide for the ICC to hire the veterinary surgeons from the private sector.  Some measure of monitoring will be carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I am not in a position to say anything about the extent and form that will take at this time.  I ask the Senators to bear in mind that trials are going on at the moment, both in terms of the muzzling and new regulations on the veterinary side.  We need the opportunity to review all of these results at the end of the season and to introduce the best possible regulations to achieve the objective that both I and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, gave a commitment to in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I said twice that I did not say in any way that any veterinary surgeon connected with a coursing club would act unprofessionally.  It is important, and I know this is a professional matter, to avoid a conflict of interest.  I brought up a similar matter concerning doctors in casualty departments under the Road Traffic Bill and this is also relevant for the patient and the police.  It is hard on the professional person if they end up in any situation where there may <Col N="1716" /> be even a suspicion of a conflict of interest.  Not for one moment would I suggest that any member of the veterinary profession would behave in this manner, but it is always wiser to ensure that they cannot be in conflict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest, Sir, that you arrange to provide Senators with accommodation closer to the Chamber so that they are not impeded by traffic as they cross Kildare Street?  I put my life at risk on behalf of the constituents of County Clare, who are currently experiencing difficulty because headage payments have not been paid before Christmas.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, for coming to the Chamber to respond to the issue.  In my previous dealings with the Minister of State, I have found him exceptionally helpful and cooperative. I wish him well for Christmas and a happy 1994.  I understand that he has a number of political plans in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> The major part of County Clare is classified as a severely handicapped area. Most farms are small or medium and the farmers qualify for headage grants and most types of premia.  Many of them are small dairy farmers who no longer go to the creamery and they rely heavily on these payments as a major source of income.  It is particularly important to them that the payments be made before Christmas.  Unfortunately, to date there is quite a substantial number of farmers in County Clare who have not received any portion of their headage grant.  I appreciate that there can be difficulties in relation to the administration of this but I ask the Minister of State and his Department to examine and recognise the serious position that many of these people find themselves in.  Many of them are facing personal difficulties coming up to Christmas.  If the Minister bears this in mind, I know he will do everything possible to ensure that cheques are received prior to Christmas, thus making it that much easier for them.</P>
    <P>There is another difficulty in County Clare in so far as some owners have split herds.  This means that part of their land is in a severely handicapped area while the other is in a mildly handicapped area. In those circumstances, I understand, it is the Department's policy not to make any advance payment prior to Christmas. That is extremely unfortunate because these people are experiencing similar difficulties to people in full severely disadvantaged areas.  The situation cannot continue.  A number of years ago practically 90 per cent of headage grants were paid prior to Christmas, but in recent years that system has dramatically changed.  Some instalments are paid before Christmas while others are paid after Christmas.  Last Monday a constituent complained to me that they had received no headage payment yet and that last year they did not get any portion of their headage until March.  They made <Col N="1720" /> special representations to try to get an advance.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fully familiar with the details.  I appeal to him to make a special plea, given that there are only ten days to Christmas, to ensure that every farmer, whether they are in a severely disadvantaged area or have a split herd, gets a cheque in the post before Christmas to alleviate some of the financial difficulties that many of them are facing.  One must recognise that this summer was bad and that many farmers are reaping the conequences of these difficulties, particularly in western counties.  There are special circumstances because the rainfall there is much higher, double that in the east. The Minister is aware of the quality of the land and the particular difficulties that arise, such as the far greater length of time that cattle must be housed and the amount of feeding they must receive, as opposed to other areas where the land is much drier.  Overall there is greater expense for the farmers concerned and much narrower margins in relation to profit, if profit arises at all for many.  I am familiar with that through processing unemployment assistance applications for smallholders.  The overheads and margins are extraordinary.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State and I recognise that he fully understands the position.  As a junior Minister, he has been extremely helpful and I make a special appeal to him to try to respond positively to the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>In keeping with the Christmas tradition, I reciprocate the kind comments of Senator Taylor-Quinn.  I thank her for her good wishes and I fully acknowledge her sincerity in raising the payment of livestock grants to farmers in County Clare.  I know from what she said that she is well intentioned in relation to the problem facing many farmers and I acknowledge that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> Over £350 million has been paid to farmers to date in 1993 under the various premia and headage schemes.  That represents an increase of 27 per cent on the £275 million paid during the comparable period in 1992, a year in which record payments were achieved.  The record set in 1992 has already been surpassed and I expect a further amount of £30 million will be paid before the end of the year. The Senator will be pleased to hear this because she deserves a sincere reply. During the coming week an additional payment of £30 million will be paid to farmers.</P>
    <P>These high payment levels are being achieved against a background of EU regulations which preclude payments under the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes before 1 November and even then limit the payment of 60 per cent in relation to advances.  As the Senator correctly identified, 100 per cent payments had previously been possible. Disadvantaged area headage payments other than for sheep headage are normally on the basis of advance and this was the practice in 1993.</P>
    <P>The introduction of CAP reform has had the effect of increasing the number of applications under the various measures. Total applications in connection with livestock schemes in 1993 are expected to reach £640,000; the comparable figure in 1992 was approximately £370,000. Arising from the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy the number of applications have almost doubled, as have the administrative problems associated with such a huge volume of new applications. As the Senator said, many of these scheme are complex from the farmers' and administrative points of view.  It is a problem for personnel in the Department to try to adjust to the complexities of the various schemes which have been introduced.</P>
    <P>I am often asked why there are so many schemes.  We want to maximise the benefits to agriculture under the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We <Col N="1722" /> negotiated the maximum number of schemes dealing with the various livestock sectors in this country.  The increase in the number of applications and new schemes has caused a serious administrative problem in the short term. However, we are making every possible effort to deal with the administration and to streamline the system so as to ensure farmers receive the payments to which they are entitled.  I would not come to the House other than to defend a system which ensures farmers receive payments in the qualifying year.  We are committed to this and officials are working hard to ensure that desirable situation is brought about.</P>
    <P>To meet the various additional demands, the administration of the special beef premium scheme was centralised in Portlaoise and 80 additional staff are in place in that new office for the purpose of dealing with the special beef premium scheme.  Today's <i>The Farmers Journal</i> acknowledged that the new system in place in Portlaoise is speeding up the administration of some of these schemes.  I anticipate that we will be able to transfer more schemes to the new centralised computer controlled offices in Portlaoise.</P>

I believe this objective is being achieved and I am satisfied that my Department is coming to terms with the complexities and the extra administrative burden of the CAP reform arrangements.  I will not be content until we overcome all the problems involved.  I am currently reviewing all our systems in the interests of further improvements for the 1994 scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for raising this important matter in relation to <Col N="1723" /> farm incomes.  I assure her we are doing everything possible to speed up these payments.</P>
