      <P>We agree with the Order of Business.  May I again ask the Leader of the House if he could tell us when we will have a debate on Northern Ireland?  The Tánaiste does not have to be present for the debate; we could hold it in his absence.  The sooner we could have a debate on it, the better. Obviously, we would hope that the Tánaiste could be here and we would like him to conclude the debate.  I realise he has a busy schedule &mdash; he may be out of the country next week &mdash; but if the debate could be started soon, we would appreciate it.</P>

    <Title>Adoptive Leave Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Adoptive Leave Bill, 1993, is the second Bill which I have had the pleasure of initiating in this House and I am pleased to commend it to the House this morning.</P>
      <P>The Bill will give effect to the commitment of the Government to provide leave from work to adopting mothers. The Bill primarily envisages a ten week period of leave which is intended to be covered by a social welfare payment and an optional four weeks' additional leave which will not attract payment.  This scheme is modelled on the existing arrangements for natural mothers.  The Bill will apply in the case of both domestic and foreign adoptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware also that the Bill gives effect to one of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The Commission's report, specifically recommended that ten weeks' leave from work should be provided to adopting mothers. I know the House recently debated the Commission's report and the House will be aware that this is but one of a number <Col N="408" /> of initiatives which the Government is taking to implement the recommendations of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The existing Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, which came into force on 6 April 1981, provides in general for 14 weeks' leave from work for natural mothers with an extra entitlement to four weeks' maternity leave.  The social welfare code provides for the payment of maternity benefit for the duration of the 14 weeks of maternity leave.  These provisions are re-enacted in sections 37 to 41 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, 1993.  It was widely perceived as an anomaly, however, that women who adopted children were excluded from these arrangement, and this Bill redresses that anomaly.  When enacted, this Bill will be accompanied by a change in the social welfare code to provide for payment of an adoptive benefit during the ten weeks of adoptive leave.  I assure the House that this Bill is simply a first step in my examination of the entire area of reconciling work and family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Further measures will include a review of the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, which I am currently undertaking, with a view towards improving and updating the Act and giving effect to the EC Council Directive of 19 October 1992, on the introduction of measures to encourage improvement in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. The Directive is due for implementation on 19 October 1994, and I intend to have the necessary legislation in place by then.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need for provision to be made for men as well as women to enjoy conditions of employment which enable them to reconcile work and family responsibilities.  There is some provision for adoptive fathers in this Bill, in the case of sole male adopters and in other circumstances.  However, it would have been inappropriate in a Bill such as this to have dealt extensively with the wider question of leave for fathers.  It is worth emphasising in that connection that the Bill gives effect to what was <Col N="409" /> envisaged by the Second Commission on the Status of Women, namely that the provision of ten weeks' adoptive leave would be primarily geared towards women who adopt.</P>
    <P>However, the broader questions relating to the involvement of both parents in domestic responsibilities are receiving attention in my Department, particularly in the context of the draft EC directive on parental leave and leave for family reasons which has been revived by the Belgian Presidency of the EC Council. The House will be aware that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, recently made a commencement order bringing into force, with effect from 1 November 1993, the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1992, which makes certain provisions of the Treaty on European Union, including the Protocol on Social Policy, part of Irish law.  The entry into force of the Protocol on Social Policy will set a new context for the future development of EC legislative initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>I will now outline some of the main features of the Bill.  Part I of the Bill contains preliminary and general provisions. I draw attention to section 4, which ensures that persons cannot contract out of their obligations or entitlements under the Bill but which allows for the provision of arrangements to an employee more favourable than those provided in the Bill.  Part II of the Bill provides for the grant of adoptive leave. Section 6 provides for the grant to an adopting mother or to a sole male adopter of ten weeks' adoptive leave beginning on the day the child is placed for adoption.  There is provision to allow for alteration of the length of leave by ministerial order.  Similar provision is contained in existing maternity legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 7 requires an employee who wishes to avail of the adoptive leave to inform her employer of her intention to take the leave and of the expected day of placement.  The employee must give at least four weeks' written notice of taking the leave and furnish appropriate evidence of the placement.  In line with existing <Col N="410" /> provisions on maternity leave, section 8 allows an employee to take up to four consecutive weeks of additional adoptive leave, immediately following the adoptive leave.  Again, to qualify for the leave, the employee must notify her employer, in writing, of her intention to take the leave at least four weeks before the date on which she would have been due to return to work if she had not applied for additional adoptive leave.  There is provision in the case of a foreign adoption, subject to certain notification requirements, for some or all of the period of additional adoptive leave to be taken before the day of placement.  This provision is intended to facilitate the employee to travel abroad for the purpose of familiarisation with the child to be adopted.</P>
    <P>Sections 9, 10 and 11 entitle an adopting father to leave where the adopting mother has died either after giving notice of the intention to take the leave, or at any time during adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave.  In such circumstances, the legislation will entitle the adoptive father to the period, or remainder of the period, of leave to which the adopting mother would have been entitled if she had been alive.  No such provision exists in relation to existing maternity leave, and I would be disposed to making a provision of this kind in the context of my general review of the 1981 Act which will be completed early next year.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the return to work of an adopting parent in circumstances where the placement of a child has been of less than 14 weeks' duration.  In such circumstances, the adopting parent must inform her employer that the placement has terminated no later than the date of termination. The employer is obliged to give such an employee notice of at least one week of the day on which she is required to return to work.  The employer must take her back, in any event, no later than the due date of expiry of adoptive leave or additional leave, as appropriate. Section 13 requires the agency placing the child for adoption, or the Adoption <Col N="411" /> Board in certain circumstances, to issue to the adopting parent a certificate of placement no later than seven days after a request for one by an adopting parent.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains provisions relating to contracts of employment. Section 15 provides that an employee absent on adoptive leave will be treated as if she had not been absent so that all her rights, except the right to remuneration, will be unaffected during the leave. It also provides that employment before the absence on additional adoptive leave will be regarded as continuous with employment following such absence in respect of all rights, other than the right to remuneration which will stand suspended. Periods of probation, initial training and apprenticeship will be suspended during adoptive leave and additional adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>Section 16 renders void any purported termination of or suspension from employment during adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave or any notice of suspension due to terminate during such leave.  Section 17 provides for the extension of the date of any termination of or suspension from employment beyond the end of adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>Section 18 entitles an employee to return to work after adoptive leave and additional adoptive leave to the job she held and under the contract of employment current before the leave.  The section also deals with arrangements for the return where there has been a change of ownership of the enterprise concerned. Section 19 provides for the offer of a new contract of employment to an employee in circumstances where it is not reasonably practicable for an employer, or the new owner, to allow the employee to return to her usual job.  In such circumstances, the new contract must offer work which is suitable to the employee concerned and its terms must not be substantially less favourable than the old contract.</P>
    <P>Section 20 requires an adopting parent to give to her employer, in the period of two to four weeks before the due date of <Col N="412" /> return to work, notice of her intention to return to work after the leave.</P>
    <P>Section 21 allows for the postponement of the resumption of work by an employee in a situation where she is due to return to work on a date on which there is a general interruption or cessation of work at her employment.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill provides for the amendment or application of other social protection legislation so as to guarantee the rights of adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>Under these provisions, the dismissal of an employee for reasons connected with the exercise of rights under the Bill will be deemed to be an unfair dismissal.</P>
    <P>In addition, the failure by an employer to allow an employee, who is otherwise entitled to do so, to resume work after the adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave will be deemed to be an unfair dismissal (unless there are substantial grounds justifying it).  The Bill also provides that the termination of the employment of an employee, engaged to replace an adopting parent during adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave, when the adopting parent returns to work, will be outside the scope of unfair dismissals legislation.</P>
    <P>There are also amendments to the redundancy payments and minimum notice legislation to protect the rights of workers on adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill establishes redress procedures in the event of a dispute relating to entitlement under the Bill between an adopting parent and her employer.  A dispute relating to dismissal will be dealt with under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 as amended by Part IV of the Bill. The main features of the redress procedures in cases other than dismissals are a right of redress in the first instance to a rights commissioner, followed by a right of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal on the facts and to the High Court on a point of law.  Provision is made for compensation of up to 20 weeks' remuneration.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a constructive debate on this measure in the House and I wish to assure the House that, subject to and consistent with the general aims of the <Col N="413" /> Bill, I will be prepared to give sympathetic consideration to all constructive suggestions for amendments.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it in the Seanad.  The Bill is being introduced 12 years after the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981.  I fail to understand why the provisions of this Bill were not incorporated in the 1981 Act at the time.  It makes a statement on the attitude of the State to adoption.  State agencies have never fully accepted the spirit of equality of adoptive parents in comparison to natural parents, and I congratulate the Minister on redressing this today in initiating this Bill in the House.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that the Minister will be initiating further legislation to introduce recommendations outlined in the report of Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The Women's Rights Committee is at present prioritising those recommendations and will have completed its work within weeks.  I hope the Minister will look at its recommendations as they affect his Department.</P>
      <P>In the 1960s, some 1,650 adoptions were placed annually.  This figure has progressively decreased and is now between 200 and 300 per annum.  The figure is still falling.  The figures I mentioned include inter-family adoptions, so the true figure for adoptions involving adoptive parents and children without a blood relationship is much lower than I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it, the Bill introduces similar entitlements for adoptive parents to those already existing for natural parents. I believe, however, that the operation of the Bill will create problems. There are about 16 adoption societies in Ireland including those under the auspices of the health boards.  The majority of these societies put pressure on adoptive mothers not to work outside the home.  While one will not find this in any written policy of the adoption societies, in practice this approach is strongly promoted and many women do give up work to enhance their chances of adopting a child.  The only profession excepted from <Col N="414" /> this approach by the societies is that of a teacher who is also a mother, the theory being that a teacher continues her presence with the child while at work.  This approach by the societies makes a mockery of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should look at the situation of adoptive parents and the type of people who become adoptive parents over a period of a year to examine the correlation between the number of mothers who remain at home at adoption time and the number who are working. These figures should be compared to the applications, if the Minister can obtain that figure, to see if there is discrimination by adoption societies against women who work.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial improvement in conditions of work for women since the former Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government introduced a comprehensive range of labour legislation in the 1970s.  This Bill is one of many needed to ensure that all sections of the community have fair and equal rights in the workplace.  There is no doubt that the omission of this legislation to date has perpetrated an injustice against adoptive parents, especially adoptive mothers.  My main criticism of the Government would be over the delay in introducing the legislation. The right of women, while adopting children, to have their jobs protected would be widely considered today to be a basic social and human right.  I and my party are strongly of this view.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with the area of adoption procedure.  The present situation is that the societies operate in privacy.  The criteria for placing adoptions is not transparent and the decision making process of the societies is not open to scrutiny.  It is healthy that this process which affects vulnerable children, and parents who are anxious to love and provide for them, should be open and transparent.</P>
    <P>The adoption societies are the sole arbiters as to whom they place a child with.  It is apparent that at present the adoption societies are not accepting names from the general public.  Has the Minister information on the procedure <Col N="415" /> for placing one's name on a potential adoptive parents' list?  At least once a year, each adoption society should be open to public applications and should advertise as such.  This should remove the secrecy that surrounds the whole area of placement.  I have no doubt that adoption societies do an excellent job but it is important that they are also seen to be doing so.  It is in their interest to be more open and transparent in their decision making.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise the question of the upper age limit for adoptive parents. There is no consistency in the approach of the adoption societies.  Many adoption societies have an upper age limit of 35 years for the father and 32 years for the mother.  This is too rigid and discriminates against parents in their late 30s and 40s.  In fact, the British Adoption Society's recent recommendations suggest that adoptions should be allowed well into the 40s.  One accepts that there should be an upper age limit but it should be more in line with the age range of natural parents.  I see no reason this should not be so.  Surely a father in his early 40s and a mother in her mid-30s are capable of being excellent parents for an adopted child.  If not, then there are a lot of natural parents whose ages do not comply with the adoption societies' age criteria for rearing children.</P>
    <P>I am aware of one recent case where an adoptive father of 54 years of age was granted an adoption.  The reason for this was that the child had Down's Syndrome. I raise this point to illustrate the inconsistency and anomalies in the age criteria.</P>
    <P>In general all adoption societies seek mothers in their early 30s and fathers not older than their mid-30s.  It is inherently unfair there is no system of appeal for a potential parent where an adoption has been refused or where a society fails to give a decision.  Some objective system should be available to such parents.  An office of adoption ombudsman should be considered by the Government to redress the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> Foreign adoptions have been facilitated by the foresight of Deputy Shatter who introduced the Adoption Act, 1991, to cater for adoptions effected outside the State by Irish residents.  The objective of this Bill, which is to facilitate foreign adoptions, is being frustrated.  It is the view of the Adoptive Parents' Association that there is a general feeling &mdash; to date adoptions have been to a large extent from Romania &mdash; that children should not be taken out of their ethnic environment.  This is the general view of the adoption societies.</P>
    <P>All who have seen on television the atrocious conditions in which children exist in orphanages, and the life they face, must surely accept that life in this country, in a caring and loving family, is much more beneficial than their present circumstances or future prospects.  I fail to understand how anybody could suggest conditions and experience in Ireland are not far better than they could expect from their future in Romania.  I know a family who have adopted a Romainan child.  One can only be impressed by the joy she has brought to that family and the great love she is experiencing from her adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>At the last meeting of the Mid-Western Health Board I asked the Chief Executive Officer for a report on the number of couples and individuals who applied to the board for assessment for foreign adoptions under the Adoption Acts and the number of completed assessments forwarded to the Adoption Board.  There have been 80 applications for adoption since 1991, yet only four assessments have been completed.  This is an indication of the unnecessary delay, not only in the Mid-Western Health Board, but throughout Ireland, as outlined in a reply by the Minister for Health to a recent Dáil question by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <P>There has been a debate on the right of adopted children to be informed of the name of their natural mother.  It is the right of everybody to know their origin. A contact register should be available to enable people to obtain this information. Everybody should have the right to obtain their original birth certificate.  If <Col N="417" /> an adopted child knows the name of his or her natural mother and birthplace he or she has no difficulty in obtaining a birth certificate.  Nobody has difficulty in obtaining a birth certificate for such a person.  If, however, they do not know this, they cannot obtain the original one. This is discriminatory against one section of adopted children.  The contact register should be available and the natural mother should be contacted to note on the register whether she wishes to have contact with her natural child.</P>
    <P>The State should provide a counselling service in this area to ensure that any personal difficulties which may arise can be dealt with.  The present situation, where natural mothers or adopted children are paying astronomical sums to private detectives to obtain such information, is totally unacceptable and unfair and should be eliminated.  The present situation, where the birth certificate of an adopted child outlines the country of birth and not the county of birth, has created difficulties for many adopted children. For example, adopted children are immediately turned down for US visas if they cannot disclose their place of birth. Surely it is the duty of the Government to eliminate these anomalies and ensure that adopted children have equal treatment to natural children in these areas.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government examines the succession rights of adopted children.  Adopted children and their parents were shocked to discover in August 1992 that two adopted girls were, because of their status, unable to inherit their father's farm following a decision of the High Court.  In the case taken by a County Wexford farmer, Patrick Stamp, his father's will provided for the property to be left to a grandson if Mr. Stamp died without leaving issue.  Following his father's death he adopted two children. The use of the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; in the will was deemed to exclude them from the inheritance since they are not regarded in law as their father's issue.  It is in this precise wording the difficulty lies.</P>
    <P>Under the Adoption Acts any property of a person who dies intestate passes to the adopted child as it would to a child <Col N="418" /> born to that person.  In any will a reference to a child, whether expressed or implied, is construed to include the adopted child.  Similarly, following the Adoption Act, 1976, any Act of the Oireachtas which referred to a child is interpreted as including an adopted child unless there is an intention to the contrary.  The Status of Children Act, 1987, ensured that a reference to a child in a will is to be interpreted as including a child adopted subsequent to the will.  The peace of mind engendered for adopted children and their parents by this legislative background and the clear legislative intent that all children should be regarded equally in law was distrubed by the decision of the High Court in the 1992 Stamp case.  Are there other such cases and might legislation be appropriate to prevent a recurrence?  The Government should introduce such legislation.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board warned adoptive parents to seek legal advice when making a will and, on adopting a child, to take advice about any pre-existing wills from which the child might benefit.  Nearly 40,000 children have been adopted in the last 30 years.  It is possible many of them might be affected by this or other wordings in wills which were not envisaged under the Adoption Acts.  There is a strong body of legal opinion which believes legislative change is necessary to prevent a recurrence of a case similar to the Wexford one.  I ask the Minister and the Government &mdash; it may be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice &mdash; to initiate legislation to tidy up this area to ensure that adopted children are fully protected regarding succession to their parents' property.  Approximately 40,000 children have been adopted in the past 30 years.  The system of adoption has removed the responsibility of the State to cater for many children who have been adopted.</P>
    <P>I now refer to legal costs which may arise in adoptive cases.  Where a court case ensues with regard to final consent of the natural mother, the onus should be on the Adoption Board, not on the adoptive parents, to sort out the difficulties. The High Court, under section <Col N="419" /> 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974, has the power to decide the final outcome of the adoption but the adoptive parents or the natural mother must initiate this action. This should be completed by the Adoption Board.  Under the Child Care Act, 1988, the costs of legal proceedings ensuing from adoption completed by health boards are paid for in full.  The adoptive parents concerned are not responsible for any of the costs under such circumstances. Having two sets of criteria is discriminatory.  We have two types of parents, one under the original Adoption Acts and the second under the Child Care Act, 1988, and both are treated separately for cost purposes by the court.  I believe the Government should harmonise these and place th onus on the Adoption Board for difficulties arising for adoptive parents who are not included under the provisions of the 1988 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill, which states that a person is given:</P>
    <P>In the case of an adoption other than a foreign adoption, entitlement to the minimum period of adoptive leave... having, as soon as is reasonably practicable but not later than four weeks before the expected day of placement, caused her employer to be notified in writing of her intention to take the adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>In other words, an employee must give four weeks' notice of her intention to take adoptive leave.  I would like to ask the Minister if he has discussed this section with the adoption societies.</P>
    <P>The practice heretofore has been to give much less than four weeks' notice to a prospective parent of an adoption.  It has not been unknown in certain cases for just several days notice to be given of an adoption.  I am concerned that this will introduce a further discriminatory angle to the procedure if the adoption societies are not fully prepared to accept the spirit of the Bill.  I would like the Minister to outline the outcome of any discussions which he has had on the Bill with the adoption societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it in.  It harmonises the position of natural and adoptive parents.  I believe that it should have been done in 1991, but better late than never.  I commend the Minister for so doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for initiating this Bill in the Seanad.  I welcome this Bill in which I have a personal interest, as I was extraordinarily lucky and blessed to have been adopted by two wonderful parents.  I am particularly glad to be a Member of the Oireachtas when this legislation is being initiated in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The need for this legislation is so glaringly obvious that, as Senator Neville said, it is a wonder it was not introduced before now.  It seemed to form part of written and unwritten regulations that when a couple applied to adopt, there was a semi commitment required or a demand made that the woman would not work.  This was discriminatory.  My mother worked much of the time when I was growing up but she did not work during the time of the adoption.  I welcome the fact that this legislation will mean that women who are working and want to adopt will not find themselves at a disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I know the legislation refers specifically to adoptive leave for women, but in my circumstances my father was in the Army, so both parents could have been working.  The Minister will find that where both parents are working, it may be necessary to be flexible and allow time off to both parents.  That probably is a minefield but it may be necessary to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest that parents who adopt children and children themselves do not need that bonding which all children and parents need is ludicrous.  A mother who had adopted would probably need more bonding than in the case of a natural mother.  I am loath to use the term &ldquo;natural mother&rdquo;.  I am equally loath to use the term &ldquo;biological mother&rdquo; because it carries a suggestion of being less than warm towards the mother who brought <Col N="421" /> the baby into the world.  However, there is no doubt in my mind that there is a huge need for a mother, father and adopted baby to spend time together and for that bonding to take place.  In the past, if the mother was working, I have no doubt that they made the choice for the mother to give up her job to stay at home with the child.</P>
    <P>On a more practical note, if my mother was still alive she could confirm that I did not cry any less at night than my three natural children did.  An adoptive mother who is working would be faced with the same sleepless nights, teething, wind pains and all the wonderful experiences and traumas which go with child rearing as a natural mother would.  If they decided to continue working, they might find themselves with two and a half hours sleep, perhaps with a baby in the bed, as often happened to me with my children, and still have to go to work.  They might have to work out of economic necessity and not necessarily out of career choice.</P>
    <P>The other obvious need for this legislation is in the case of foreign adoptions. It must be almost impossible for families who adopt children from abroad to make those numerous trips to Bosnia or other countries.  It must take years out of their lives to go through this procedure.  I welcome this legislation particularly for those people.  I have no personal experience of foreign adoptions aside from what I have read in the newspapers and seen on television.  It certainly would not be possible to do it by making phone calls over a period of a week.  It would take numerous visits and much time to be successful in adopting a baby.</P>
    <P>I want to cover some of the areas which Senator Neville raised.  It may not be the responsibility of this Minister, but I agree with Senator Neville that there is discrimination attaching to adoptive children and families as distinct from normal family situations.  On a lighter note, a close friend's mother was insulted by the suggestion that her youngest child might have been adopted because she had red hair and the other five children were dark.  They meant that there was a <Col N="422" /> suggestion that this was not their real child but something less than that.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville touched on the problems faced by people who attempt to search for their natural mother.  I recognise that we should never do anything which would put at risk the absolute right of privacy or confidentiality of a natural mother.  Any legislation in that area must start from that premise.  As Senator Neville said, there is a huge problem for those who attempt that search, the most obvious aspect of which is access to records, in particular one's birth certificate.</P>
    <P>All adoptees have, as I do, the extract from the adoptees' register.  I did not know that might cause a problem in relation to visas.  I had no problem getting a visa for the United States but perhaps that was because I was married when I applied for one.  The register of adoptees is a separate register and is the document which is furnished to adopted people who seek their birth certificate.  If there is some way of guarding the confidentiality but still allowing access to one's natural birth certificate, it seems discriminatory and wrong that people would not have their natural birth certificate.  There was a woman on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; two days ago who found out that she had been abandoned.  She does not know what day she was born on and does not have a natural birth certificate.  That must leave a huge void in somebody's life.</P>
    <P>I know there is a problem in that sometimes the mothers may have put their home address on the certificate and obviously access to this information could give direct information to tracing a parent.  That is not the best way for things to be done.  I support Senator Neville's call for some sort of a register.  Barnardo's are very active in bringing together parents and adults who search for their natural mother.  However, this is all voluntary and ad hoc and can, perhaps, be done in not the best way, although Barnardo's have a great record.</P>
    <P>When I wanted to trace my natural mother, I went to the institution from which I had been adopted which was operated by a group of sisters.  The reaction <Col N="423" /> of the sister there was that I really should not do it and that I should rethink the matter.  They were not supportive.  I do not mean the nun was obstructive but she probably felt it was not the best thing for me.  She was an older nun and her experiences would perhaps have been different from other agencies.</P>
    <P>I went along this road and I did it myself.  It is not an easy thing to do and that is why the relevant Minister must examine this area.  It is becoming more and more a topic for discussion.  The Magdalen laundries, the exhumation of those girls and their being reinterrment in the plot in Glasnevin is something I found distasteful.  That is another story but it has brought the subject out in the open.</P>
    <P>Much of the social legislation discussed here and in the other House recently had previously been brushed under the carpet.  We had a very frank discussion on the Kilkenny case.  Incest, sexual abuse and other issues had been hushed up.  There was a climate in Ireland where adoptees and adoption was another topic not discussed.  One did not talk to people about it and that is unhealthy, it may be why I am standing here discussing it.  I ask the Minister to seriously look at this area and influence it in whatever way he can.  We need to put structures in place to tidy up what can be a very problematic area.</P>
    <P>I share some of Senator Neville's worry in regard to families where adoptions fell through and they were later informed, literally with 24 hours' notice, that a baby was available for placement with them. The Minister may need to look at the section which requires that the employer be given four weeks' notice.  It may not be possible to give that much notice but I am sure that an employer would be sympathetic and flexible.  If we are to enshrine the rights in law, we may need to amend that.  The Minister said he is amenable to any suggestions or modifications to the Bill which will improve it. I ask him to advise us as to the reasons for the time scale.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> I have no criticism of the delay by Deputy Taylor in bringing this legislation to the House.  The Minister is nine months in office, the length of a pregnancy preceeding the birth of a healthy baby.  It is unfair and a little harsh on the Minister to be critical of the fact that legislation has not been brought to this House before now.  He has gone through gestation and delivered legislation which is healthy and will work well.</P>
    <P>This legislation is important in its own right but also because it recognises an inequality to which Senator Neville referred.  More significantly, it sends out a message to society and especially to adoptive parents and their children, that the State recognises them as a family unit and the same as all other families, not a minority grouping who have to be dealt with separately.</P>
    <P>I would like to give a personal message to those who have given up their children for adoption.  Theirs was a great sacrifice and the State will not be found wanting in treating all children equally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for initiating the Bill in this House.  I praise Senator McGennis for her contribution, which was very brave and courageous.</P>
      <P>This Bill is, as Senator Neville pointed out, long overdue.  The fact that it has taken 12 years is an indication of society and the attitudes that prevailed a decade ago.  We should not blame the Minister of nine months for his failure to move any faster to right a wrong perpetuated for decades.  To continue the imagery, I hope that we will adopt this Bill in this House and make it our own.</P>
      <P>The Bill recognises the importance of the role of adoptive parents.  One of the reasons adoptive parents were omitted from the 1981 Act may have been that maternity leave was originally seen in terms of the mother's physical condition. It was felt that a mother could not physically go back to work.  The health of the mother was the primary concern and that is why there is a pre-natal as well as a post-natal need for leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Modern psychology and thinking has recognised the need for parents to bond <Col N="425" /> with their children.  This has led more and more to an awareness of the need for parents to spend a great deal of time with young babies and children to develop that relationship.  Adoptive parents need more time than natural parents because natural parents have been building up to the birth of their child.</P>
    <P>I know, as a mother, of the expectation one experiences.  As the baby grows in the womb so does one's affinity with the baby.  The baby is a person from about the fifth month and some mothers talk to their growing babies.  This relationship is built up in the months prior to the birth and continued after the birth.</P>
    <P>The natural mother has an advantage over an adoptive mother.  It is, therefore, correct to provide for ten weeks' leave to enable an adoptive mother to become familiar with the child, watch the child grow and be with him or her in those crucial months.  One advantage a natural mother has over an adoptive mother is the ability of most women to breast feed their own children which brings a closeness which is not always possible when one is bottle feeding a baby.  Therefore, an adoptive mother has to work harder than a natural mother.</P>
    <P>It is right that we allow time to women who have brought babies into their homes.  As pointed out, this can often be at very short notice.  It is not always possible to have four weeks' notice that one is about to receive a child into one's home and prepare for it.  Adoptive parents get very short notice and have to be mentally prepared, particularly if they are adopting for the first time.</P>
    <P>As any parent will verify, it becomes easier with experience.  However, for a person adopting for the first time, to be suddenly told with three or four days' notice that they will have a baby in their house at the end of the week can be a major shock to the system.  Everything must be arranged, including practical tasks, such as buying a cot and other equipment.  Natural parents have months to make such preparations.  Adoptive parents do not have the same luxury and move straight into caring for the needs of babies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> The Minister recognises that there is a need for fathers &mdash; natural or adoptive &mdash; to become more involved in parenting their children.  I welcome his commitment to look at this issue in the future. I strongly believe that if fathers bond with their children and take care of them from the earliest moments the relationship is stronger for that bonding.  If that relationship is not there from the start it can lead to problems in the future.  Many of the problems of incest and child abuse are caused by the fact that fathers do not relate to their children.  If someone loves and cares for a child it is much more difficult to abuse that child.  However, if the child is seen as an object, not one's responsibility and not as someone close, it is easier to treat the child as an object. For too long in Ireland we have seen fathers distancing themselves from the caring role.  Encouraging fathers to become more caring and responsible for the day to day care of their children will force them to become less violent.  We could see a change in society if caring is recognised not just as a female attribute but as a human attribute.  It should be encouraged in males as well as in females.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Neville's criticisms of the existing rules and procedures for adoption and, for example, the pressure on mothers not to work outside the home.  Some mothers from the lower socio-economic groups often find it difficult to adopt a child because they cannot offer the child the same material comforts as a better off family.  Material comforts are not everything; love and caring really make the difference between a successful happy childhood and a not so successful childhood.  I have known cases where children were adopted into relatively well off homes but the caring was not there. There was always a barrier and these children could have been better off if they had been given more caring than luxuries.</P>
    <P>The idea that a woman of over 40 years of age cannot adopt a child is rubbish. There is no law which says that a woman cannot have a child after 40 and if a <Col N="427" /> woman can have a natural child after that age&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>After 32 years sometimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is even crazier because a woman can have a natural child up to her mid-forties.  If a woman can have a natural child and is capable of looking after it she is certainly capable of looking after an adoptive child.  It is as if one suddenly becomes a geriatric at 33 or 34, infirm of limb and wind and incapable of rearing a child.  Many of us would not be here if the same rule applied to women over 40 giving birth to natural children.</P>
      <P>Like the Senators who spoke earlier, I query the need for four weeks' notice prior to taking adoptive leave.  From the employer's point of view I understand that some time is necessary to second an employee to take over the adoptive mother's workload.  In some job categories four weeks' notice is necessary. However, if a teacher falls ill there are teachers' centres throughout the country which have lists of substitute teachers and the school can secure such a teacher in a matter of hours.  If that can be done in the teaching profession I am sure a similar system could be put in place for other professions.</P>
      <P>One of the criticisms of the existing maternity leave provisions is that often another person is not employed to fill in for the woman on maternity leave.  The workload is often transferred to her coworkers and this can lead to friction in the workplace.  At present there is no obligation to employ somebody to do the work of a person on maternity leave.  I hope the Minister will look at that issue when he is revising the law as there should be a provision whereby fellow workers of a pregnant woman are not disadvantaged as a result of her being granted maternity leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad this Bill includes provisions for foreign adoption and the needs of parents who decide to take children from a different country and culture into their homes.  Their need for time is perhaps greater than the need of a couple adopting <Col N="428" /> an Irish child.  I would not like to see too many children being taken from their native country and brought up in a different culture and climate although when one sees the terrible conditions in places like Romania, Bosnia and Serbia in which children have to live one can only feel great sympathy for them.  I admire the parents who adopted them. However, when the countries in which these atrocities have taken place eventually become more humanised and, as occurred in Ireland, the number of children available for adoption is reduced I hope the children will be adopted in their own homeland.</P>
    <P>Children need to grow up with their own cultural identity.  From that point of view, traveller children who are put up for adoption in Ireland &mdash; the number is small &mdash; should, where possible, be adopted by members of the travelling community.  Otherwise, it can lead to split cultural personalities, I am not criticising parents who have adopted foreign children, but each child is entitled to be brought up in its homeland.  In America people go to South America and bring back children to feed the demand of rich Americans for adoptive children.  The export of live children from places like South America is becoming a trade.  As many American adoptive parents are white, the demand is for lighter skinned children.  A balance must be struck between the good and absolute need of people to love and to be loved and this trade in children.  I would not like to see such a trade in Europe.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to examine the rights of foster parents and the whole concept of fostering which usually takes place at a later age than adoption.  Parents who take in foster children should have a right to parental leave, not 10 weeks, but a couple of days, to bring the foster child into the home, spend the day with the child and look after him or her while settling in.</P>
    <P>Will section 9 of this Bill allow a natural father to adopt his own children on the death of the mother?  I am thinking of a situation where the father and mother are not married but may be cohabiting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> I thank the Minister for initiating this Bill in this House, it brings us one step closer to true equality.  Some day we will have a situation where all the children of this country are treated equally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for initiating this Bill in the Seanad.  As a member of the women's rights committee, it is nice to see action on the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and that it is not simply gathering dust.</P>
      <P>This legislation is very important because, for far too long, adoption and the vetting of prospective adoptive parents was a taboo subject.  There is too much discrimination by adoption agencies in regard to people who would like to adopt children, sometimes on the basis of socio-economic background.  People who would genuinely be good parents often do not meet the criteria because of the stringent regulations laid down.  I ask the Minister to look at the age limit for people who wish to adopt.  It is an insult to anybody over the age of 32, 35 in the case of a male, that they would not be allowed to adopt a child.  This issue must be addressed immediately because the more regulations we have the more we send out the message that there is something wrong with being adopted.  Some of my peers in secondary school were adopted and they had a rough time.</P>
      <P>This and other legislation which the Minister plans to bring forward will remove that stigma and taboo.  I do not have much to say on this subject because the Bill is excellent, it provides for equality between natural and adoptive parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of foreign adoptions, having looked at television and having been in foreign countries where atrocities were committed, while a child has a right to live in his own country, if that country cannot provide for its children, I see no reason they cannot be adopted and brought to live in an environment which will cherish them and provide them with an education and the basic standard of living to which any child is entitled.  I would deeply appreciate if all the criteria <Col N="430" /> that must be met to adopt a child could be examined, including the criteria of age and socio-economic background.  I compliment the Minister again and thank him for initiating the Bill in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate for their very constructive contributions, I wish to pay particular tribute to Senator McGennis for her excellent speech which I am sure moved everybody who heard it.  We should all express our appreciation to her for giving such a personal, interesting and moving note to the proceedings here this morning.  She did a very brave thing and we should all express our gratitude to her.</P>
      <P>I am sorry about the delay in bringing this Bill forward but I take no personal responsibility for that.  As Senator Neville and other Senators said, it should have been brought forward a long time ago.  Queries about it were raised in the Dáil on many occasions but I am pleased that we have managed to finalise the Bill within a relatively short period of operation of this Government and bring it before the House this morning.</P>
      <P>There were references to many matters which do not fall within the ambit of the Bill but which are referable to the issue of adoption generally.  Some Senators raised the question generally of secrecy in many adoption societies and the fact that they do not operate with the degree of transparency desirable in their methods of operation, how they carry out their investigations and reach their decisions, the fact that they do not give reasons for their decisions and that there is no appeal procedure against them. These are all important issues although they do not come within the ambit of my Department or of this Bill.  They are matters primarily for the Minister for Health and the adoption board.  I assure Senators that I will refer comments by Senators on these issues to my colleague, the Minister for Health, and ask him to investigate the various points in regard to adoption procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the view that the procedures should be as transparent as possible <Col N="431" /> having regard to the sensitivity of the whole adoption procedure.  A message of supervision and control should be sent to the agencies and a good balance achieved.  I include in that the question of the right of the adoptive child to know the identity of the natural parents.  The point was made by Senator Neville and others that there should be a contact register and these are matters I will certainly raise with the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The question of upper age limits for adoption was referred to by all the Senators who spoke this morning.  It does not come within the ambit of the Bill, but as far as I know, there is no legal official age limit which would be discriminatory and not acceptable to me as Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  What may happen in practice is quite a different matter and it appears from what has been said here that some adoption societies operate their own discriminatory rules in so far as age is concerned.  That is something which will have to be looked at.  I am working on legislation that will have an anti-age discrimination provision. In various contexts it is inappropriate that age should be used as a basis for denying people who wish to adopt a child.  It is not a position that Senators would regard as acceptable.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville referred to succession rights and to the Wexford case in particular. I will look at that to see what amending legislation may be necessary. The case was exceptional in the sense that it hinged on the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; as distinct from the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; which would be covered by the existing legislation. The word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; was not covered and the court apparently interpreted the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; to mean that it would have to be a naturally born child and that would exclude an adoptive child.  The case was exceptional, nonetheless cases could arise where other words might be used and some clarification may be necessary.</P>
    <P>However, there was a reference to the advice given by adoption societies to adopting parents that they should check their wills when they adopted a child. <Col N="432" /> That is good advice.  I urge adopting parents or those who have adopted in the past to check their wills and make sure their wishes are clearly stated and represent their intentions to avoid any unfortunate difficulties such as arose from the Wexford case which, in all probability, were not the intentions of the testator.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly, Senator McGennis and Senator Kelleher raised the question of the period of notice to be given to an employer before adoption.  I appreciate the points that there could be cases when an adopting parent would be informed on short notice that they had been approved for an adoption and that there would be a placement within a relatively short period.  I will reconsider that on Committee Stage.  One has to strike a balance between the needs of the adopting mother and the employer.  The employer's position also has to be taken into account.  An adopting mother could be holding down a crucial and important position at work and her sudden absence without reasonable notice could throw the workplace into chaos and possibly put at risk other people's jobs.</P>
    <P>Notification and communication between adopting mothers and employers are all important.  The overwhelming majority of employers would be understanding and sympathetic to any adopting mother in this situation.  Substitute teachers and nurses might be obtainable at relatively short notice but in some cases a replacement might not be on hand quickly or easily and the downstream consequences for a business could be serious.  I take the point and I will consider it in the context of Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly referred to the question of the rights of foster parents, fostering and whether some leave should be considered in that context.  I will consider that.  It covers a wide spectrum of situations and I will have to look at the age groups involved and the circumstances and see whether leave may be appropriate in the case of fostering.  The Senator also raised the issue of whether section 9 would give rights to a natural father to adopt his own child in the event <Col N="433" /> of the death of the mother of the child. This Bill is not concerned with adoption rights, it is confined to and concerned solely with the issue of leave for an adopting mother and, in some circumstances, for an adopting father.  The details of the adoption is dealt with by other legislation and would not be involved in this Bill. The context of the adopting father is confined to the question of leave.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher raised the question of discrimination and I support his view that we must do all we can to ensure that there is no discrimination against adopted children or adopting parents. That should not be tolerated in any circumstances. I thank all the Senators for their excellent and constructive contributions and I look forward to Committee Stage when we can tease out many of the matters raised this morning.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> The purpose of this Bill is to consolidate, with amendments, the law relating to the election of the President. The Bill deals comprehensively with all aspects of presidential elections from the nomination of candidates through the taking of the poll, and the counting of votes to election petitions.  The Bill continues the programme of electoral law reform commenced last year with the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1992. The objective of the programme is to update and improve the entire electoral law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1992 Act, which amended and consolidated the law relating to Dáil elections, <Col N="434" /> represented the first substantial step in this programme.  The present Bill continues the process and, as envisaged in the Programme for a Partnership Government, it is intended to follow up, in due course, with similar measures dealing with referenda and the other branches of the electoral law.</P>
    <P>The Constitution lays down the fundamental principles relating to the election of the President.  It deals with the right to vote, the qualification of candidates, the right to nominate, the electoral system, the time frame for holding an election and the term of office of the President.  The detailed regulations governing the election are provided for in ordinary legislation.  At present, the law relating to the election of the President is contained in the Presidential Elections Acts, 1937 to 1992.  The principal Act, which is the Act of 1937, has been extensively amended by the Electoral Act, 1963, and, to a lesser extent, by later enactments.  The law is rather fragmented and the conduct of a presidential election requires reference to six separate statutes. In addition, there are certain technical defects in the law which could give rise to difficulty in particular circumstances. The Bill makes good these defects, provides for a more streamlined and efficient procedure for the conduct of the count, introduces a procedure for reviewing the result of a presidential election and provides for the consolidation of the law.</P>
    <P>The most obvious change proposed by the Bill is the elimination of the central count.  Under existing law, the first count is carried out in each Dáil constituency by the local returning officer and the first count result for each constituency is announced locally.  The ballot papers are then parcelled up and sent to the presidential returning officer who is required, by law, to count the votes and ascertain and declare the result of the election.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the 1945 and 1990 elections, the result of every presidential election was decided on the first count.  However, under existing law, candidates and the country at large, have to wait while ballot papers are transmitted <Col N="435" /> to the presidential returning officer, who goes through what seems to be a superfluous and time consuming counting process, before the result can be formally declared.  There is, in fact, no necessity for a central count, even in cases where it is necessary to eliminate one or more candidates.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the conduct of the entire count at constituency level. The result of the first count will be reported to the presidential returning officer, who will then calculate the quota and declare elected any candidate who reaches the quota on the first count.  If no candidate reaches the quota, the presidential returning officer will direct each local returning officer to exclude the candidate with the lowest overall total of votes and to transfer the papers of the excluded candidate.  This operation will be carried out at constituency level and the results reported to the presidential returning officer.  Where necessary, the exclusion of candidates will continue on this basis until one candidate can be declared elected.</P>
    <P>Candidates and their agents will have the right to attend at, and supervise, proceedings at the count in each constituency and also at the central ascertainment of the result.  As at present, candidates will have the right to demand a complete recount of the ballot papers.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the time factor involved, the result of 1990 presidential election was not declared until nearly 48 hours after the close of poll.  Under the arrangement provided for in the Bill, it should be possible to have the count completed in a single day even where the elimination of a number of candidates may be involved.</P>
    <P>The apparent defects in the present law to which I referred earlier relate to the nomination of candidates and related procedures.  Under existing law, if a Member of the Oireachtas signs more than one nomination paper all papers signed by him, except the first received by the presidential returning officer, must be disregarded.  This could lead to a situation which was clearly not intended. <Col N="436" /> For example, if a Member were to sign a nomination paper which has fewer than 19 other signatures and subsequently join in an otherwise valid nomination with 20 or more members, the later nomination must be disregarded entirely while the original nomination paper would be ineffective due to the absence of a sufficient number of signatures.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that where an Oireachtas Member signs a nomination paper in respect of more than one person his or her signature on the nomination paper first received by the presidential returning officer will be regarded as valid. The signature of the member on any subsequent nomination will be disregarded without prejudice to the signatures of any other Oireachtas Members on that nomination paper.</P>
    <P>Under existing law a candidate may only withdraw during the ruling on nominations or on a later day appointed for withdrawals.  In other words, he or she may withdraw only when it is too late for the proposers to consider a new nomination. The Bill provides for a change to this.  Henceforth candidate will be allowed to withdraw at any time up to the completion of the ruling on nominations and it will be open to the proposers to nominate another candidate within the remaining time allowed for nominations.</P>
    <P>The existing law providing for procedures in the event of the death of a candidate is incomplete.  At present if a candidate dies after the election has been adjourned for the purpose of taking a poll the election is commenced afresh with a new period for nominations. However no provision is made relating to the death of a candidate when it occurs just after the close of nominations or so shortly before such close there is not sufficient time to nominate a replacement candidate.  To cover this the Bill provides that where a candidate dies more than five days before the close of nominations the election will continue and the proposers of the deceased person will be free to nominate another candidate.  If a candidate dies during the five days preceding the close of nominations or after the close of nominations, a fresh election <Col N="437" /> will be held with a new period for nominations.</P>
    <P>The law relating to the ruling on nominations provides for a judicial assessor, who is the President of the High Court or another judge of that court, and for a tribunal, consisting of three judges of the High Court, to rule on any objections. The respective roles of returning officer, judicial assessor and tribunal are not clear.  Accordingly the Bill clarifies the position.  The function of the judicial assessor will be to furnish his opinion on any matter referred to him and the provision for a special tribunal is repealed. However, a candidate or his authorised representative will still be entitled to object to the ruling on the validity of a nomination or in relation to the qualification of a candidate and the objection will be heard by the High Court.</P>
    <P>Under existing presidential election law an elector who is unable to vote at his or her normal polling station due to employment by the local returning officer may be authorised to vote at another polling station in the same constituency. The Bill will remove the provision restricting the exercise of this facility to the constituency for which the elector is registered.  At a presidential election the same ballot paper is used in each constituency throughout the State.  There is, therefore, no compelling reason an elector at a presidential election, registered in one constituency, should not be authorised to vote in the constituency in which he or she is employed by the local returning officer.  The Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Unlike the other electoral codes, no statutory procedure is provided in existing law for questioning the result of a presidential election.  It would seem appropriate to lay down a specific statutory procedure for dealing with any possible challenge, as is done in other electoral codes.  The Bill, therefore, provides for a petition procedure based on and applying, with appropriate modifications, the Dáil petition procedure contained in the Electoral Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>In addition to amending the law as I have outlined, this Bill consolidates the <Col N="438" /> presidential elections code using the Electoral Act, 1992, as a model.  It applies, with appropriate modifications, the procedures in the 1992 Act which are common to elections generally, including procedures relating to postal voting, voting by disabled electors, polling on islands, taking the poll in polling stations, arrangements for counting of votes and the retention and disposal of election documents.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides a suitable opportunity to remove deficiencies in existing presidential elections law to include desirable procedures currently omitted and to improve procedures in the conduct of a presidential election.  I am sure the House will agree that in view of the status of the office of President it is desirable that the law in relation to the election to that office should be comprehensive, watertight and up to date.  I believe this Bill provides such a law.</P>

      <P>We will support the Second Reading of this Bill.  If we were asked to name pressing legislation, this Bill would not be mentioned.  Only yesterday Members were emphasising how little legislation was being put through Parliament.  This Bill is hardly urgent given that a presidential election is not due for nearly five years.  One wonders why it is being introduced now.  Was it to keep more controversial issues at bay? However since it is here I welcome it.</P>
      <P>This is an effort to combine various aspects of the presidential elections system in one Bill, and that must be applauded.  The Minister said returning officers will now be allowed vote.  It was extraordinary that a person's role for a day as returning officer disqualified them from voting.  It was a simple matter to deal with since there is only one ballot paper nationally.  I welcome that measure.</P>
      <P>Another issue involved is emigrant voting.  This highlights how easily this operation could be undertaken in a national election, such as a presidential election.  Emigrants could vote in such polls and it seems workable for returning officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> Elections for the office of President should only take place every ten years. Such a period would give the holder more time and greater status and would give the office more permanency.  Our current President has done a great job at international level to give our country a new image.  One ten year term of office should be sufficient; the office would become more politicised if the elections were held more frequently.</P>
    <P>The count system is being changed and seemingly will be more convenient and easier to work.  It will also speed up the results.  Counting will be done in each constituency where as heretofore it was done centrally.  The old arrangement was to provide for second and third counts. The new system will speed up the process and there is no doubt that it will be welcomed by returning officers and by those who are responsible for the overall result.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will improve our voting system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;disagree with that. It is appropriate and if all matters were dealt with when they were not topical there might be more balanced debates. Often legislation is debated in circumstances when it is urgently needed. There is no urgency about this Bill with the result that we can evaluate it having adopted a cold and calculated approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to amend existing legislation regarding presidential elections and the Presidential Elections Bill, 1993, sets out to do that.  Nobody could argue with improving a situation where seven different Acts had to be adhered to in a presidential election.  This Bill streamlines the present position and is part of the ongoing process of electoral reform started by the Minister for the Environment some time ago.  This is a continuation <Col N="440" /> of that reform and is to be welcomed.  It is also necessary to do away with what appear to be anomalies in the existing legislation.  New thinking was required and this Bill is the result.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton referred to this and said it was inappropriate that presiding officers or polling clerks did not have an opportunity to vote in the presidential election if they were acting in those capacities in a polling booth that was not in their own constituency.  It is important to note that there was a great deal of debate on this issue during the last presidential election, and we propose to address it now.</P>
    <P>The anomaly in relation to the nomination of candidates is now being addressed. As regards the death of a candidate, nobody would wish that to happen but we must be realistic.  When legislation is being drafted all options must be examined. This matter is addressed in the Bill but, hopefully, the provisions in that section will never be availed of. However, it is there to deal with a particular set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>In relation to the counting of votes, I agree with the proposal that the counting should be done in the constituencies.  It is appropriate that the people who canvass on behalf of a presidential candidate should attend the local count in their constituency as in any other election. This is a most welcome development.</P>
    <P>The President's position is to some extent one of a figurehead but it is of immense importance to the nation.  I compliment our current President, Mary Robinson, on her performance in the office of Uachtarán na hÉireann.  She has been a great ambassador for this country. She has taken every opportunity to promote the trade and tourism industries. She has shown herself to be ready and willing to carry out these functions and has brought international credit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish to put a question on Sunday voting.  This issue comes up time and again, usually at election time.  People claim that if elections were held on a Sunday there would be a higher turnout and it would provide an opportunity for <Col N="441" /> people to vote who, in some circumstances, would find it difficult during the week.  I appreciate that there may be some objections from the church but I do not see any objection and I would welcome any such development.  Some people in different churches may not approve of such a development but Sunday voting in a presidential election could be used as a test case.  If it proved successful and got a positive imprimatur from the public it may be something to be looked at for other elections.  I am not sure if there is need for a change in legislation in that regard and I ask the Minister to clarify the position in his reply.</P>
    <P>Generally I welcome the Bill.  It is appropriate that the matter is dealt with now.  The provisions in the Bill are necessary. The Programme for a Partnership Government promised electoral reform. While this may not be pressing legislation at this time, it is important to update existing presidential legislation especially as there is so much fragmentation in that area.  I welcome this Bill and commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues. This is relatively non-controversial legislation. It is part of an overall electoral reform package, part of which we have already discussed on the Electoral Reform Bill, 1992.  It will not be opposed by the Progressive Democrats on Second Stage.  That does not mean it cannot be improved because there are elements that could be improved.  It raises a question about the constitutional provisions under which nominations in presidential elections are conducted.  We increasingly find, when dealing with this and other legislation, that the provisions of the Constitution are becoming more archaic. It raises the question of the desirability of an overall redrafting of the Constitution, <Col N="442" /> but I suppose that is a matter for another day.</P>
      <P>We must accept &mdash; I am sure every one in this House accepts; we have said it repeatedly &mdash; how much we are impressed by the way our President conducted herself during her term of office and what a marvellous ambassador she is.  Those who saw her on television during her tour of India were greatly impressed by her reception there, the authority and grace she has brought to her office and the obvious affection she enjoyed in countries as far away as India and New Zealand.  That affection is even more manifest in our own country.  All public representatives who attended functions where she was present were impressed at the way in which she has articulated our sense of community, the positive values in our society and how she has made herself available to many small communities throughout the whole island &mdash; not only in this State.</P>
      <P>As far as the provisions of the Bill are concerned &mdash; this brings me back to the point about the Constitution &mdash; it should be made easier to nominate people to stand for the Presidency.  It is the most important office in the State &mdash; I accept that it must have a status because of that &mdash; but restricting a nomination to certain members of the Oireachtas or a number of county councils is not democratic. There should be facilities to make it easier to nominate contestants for the election.</P>
      <P>When we discussed the Electoral Reform Bill in the House, there was a certain dialogue concerning the desirability of having frivolous candidates on the ballot paper.  Some of us thought that it would be no harm if the Monster Raving Loony Party, or its Irish equivalent, offered itself for election.  That might bring a certain degree of levity to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>People who may be on the political margins should be allowed to contest an election campaign, if they are willing to put up the money.  However, I draw a distinction between the presidential and other elections.  It would not be desirable to make it easy to nominate a person on a ballot paper for the most significant office in the State who may only want to do it for the crack.  Having said that, however, we should look at the way in which the President is nominated and make it easier for nominations to be made.</P>
      <P>The role of emigrants in elections &mdash; not only in presidential, but in all elections &mdash; has been referred to already.  I strongly support the view that emigrants should be entitled to vote, especially in the presidential election.  If they wish to do so, procedures to facilitate this could be devised through the embassies or through the post.  Those who left the country within the last seven to ten years &mdash; I would be flexible as to the time limit &mdash; should be especially entitled to vote. There is interest among all our citizens, however widely spread, in the presidential election and there should be a mechanism allowing them to participate. I look forward to future legislation on that matter.</P>
      <P>I support the comments by Senator Finneran about Sunday voting, not only for presidential elections but for elections in general.  This practice is common in other countries.  Many people, especially university students and those commuting to Dublin for work, are greatly discommoded by the present system and it would be better to hold elections on a Sunday so that they would not be disenfranchised. The objective of legislation should be to ensure the maximum degree of participation in elections and that people are not disenfranchised because they find it difficult to get to their home constituency.  Senator O'Kennedy may have some views about getting people to Tipperary, for example, from Dublin to cast their votes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that worries me &mdash; it is a technical one &mdash; concerns the ruling on votes that are not valid.  If one returning officer in a certain county rules in a particular way and another officer rules in a different way, that could have a substantial bearing on the outcome of the election.  In the last European election, the Leinster returning officer ruled certain papers to be invalid while similar papers were deemed valid in other constituencies because the general election was held on the same day, one could have 1, 2, 3 on one ballot paper and 4, 5, 6 on another paper.  A general election could be held on the same day as a presidential election and the same practice might occur.  One returning officer could say that option No. 4 is a clear preference and, as an indication, equivalent to a No. 1 and another officer may say no.  This could decide the outcome of the election. It would be desirable to adopt a uniform <Col N="445" /> method of ruling on the validity of ballot papers from county to county because it appears from the legislation &mdash; I have not read it in great detail &mdash; that different decisions could be made as to the validity of ballot papers, that needs to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>In this modern and technological age, in addition to the name, a photograph of the candidate should also be on the ballot paper.  It could be done cheaply &mdash; it will not greatly increase the cost of the election &mdash; and it would be desirable. After all, there are some in our midst who are not literate and it would help them.  No one, by virtue of disability or any other matter, should be excluded from participating in the democratic process.  If that facilitates it, it is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Second Stage of the Bill will not be opposed, but improvements could be effected on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, I also welcome the Bill.  I agree with Senator Belton that it is not urgent, but it is important that reform of the electoral law is ongoing and this Bill falls into that category.  The legislation the House dealt with this week can be categorised into three different types. The Irish Aviation Authority Bill produced a robust and controversial debate on some areas, which were hotly contested on all sides.  On the other hand, the Adoptive Leave Bill, while considered to be pressing, was non-contentious and was agreed on all sides.  This Bill is also non-contentious and not as urgent as the Adoptive Leave Bill, but we need to continue to update and reform our electoral law.  As Senators Belton and Finneran said, it follows from the Electoral Act, 1992, which updated other aspects of the electoral law.  Senator Finneran also said that it is consolidating and tidying up legislation &mdash; seven pieces in all &mdash; that have dealt with presidential elections in one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several aspects to the Bill.  It is mainly intended to update the Bill on electoral law in comparison to other aspects of this law.  It deals with areas <Col N="446" /> such as postal voting, special voting, questioning the results of elections, etc., and brings them in line with general and other elections.  All elections should be run in accordance with the same laws and systems.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the change in relation to the count.  I support this change.  At present, the first count takes place in the constituency, then, if necessary, the contents of the boxes are brought to a central location for further counts.  This time wasting procedure is necessary even if there is no need for additional counts.  This is unnecessary given the nature of a Presidential election where the electoral area covers the entire country.  There is no need for this distinction between local and central counting. Allowing all stages of the count to be carried out in the constituency would save time.  As the Minister said, it would enable the count to take place in one day. This is desirable because everyone wants to know the result of an election as soon as possible, including the candidate and those working for the candidate.  This aspect of the Bill is welcome.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Dardis's comment about consistency in relation to the various rulings in different consistencies. Different rules should not apply in different areas, the count should be same throughout the country.  Members who have been involved in elections know how decisions are made in relation to deciding whether a vote is valid and they have seen such decisions questioned.  It is important that the same rules are applied throughout the country.  I concur with Senator Dardis in this regard.</P>
    <P>Members referred to the fact that the Presidency, while it does not have a legislative role, is important to our image, how we see ourselves and how we are perceived abroad.  We can be proud of the President in this regard.  She has been a morale booster for us and our emigrants. It is important that presidential elections are up-to-date, consistent and organised.  In that context, I welcome this Bill and I hope it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  While I welcome the Bill, there are few aspects of it which we would like changed.</P>
      <P>Regarding the present system of counting votes, the first count is in the constituency and subsequent counts at a central location.  We could use the system applied in European parliament elections where there are four centres.  Perhaps the counting of votes could take place on this basis.  Under the new system the first, second and subsequent counts will be in the constituency.  As Senator Dardis said, a serious situation could arise in relation to deeming votes spoiled and this could affect the outcome of the election.  If elections were held in accordance with European parliament elections rather than on the 41 constituency basis, there would only be four centres to deal with.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Finneran's point about Sunday voting.  It should be introduced and I do not foresee any activities which might affect this.  Although it may clash with another event, a Sunday is always available.  Wexford might not always win the All-Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is one day the Minister would take off.  I agree with Senator Belton's suggestion in regard to a ten year term.  A term of office should be for ten years and for one term only.  Having served one term, the President should be ineligible for re-election.  I support Senator Dardis's comments in relation to the right of emigrants to vote in presidential elections.  A presidential election would provide an opportunity to make a start in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another provision which should be included in the Bill relates to photographs on ballot papers.  There are 400,000 illiterate people in this country. The Constitution provides for voting in secret, yet one must question this secrecy when people must ask others to vote on their behalf or ask the presiding officer to call out the names.  In a Presidential election there are usually only two, three <Col N="448" /> or four candidates and this would be an ideal opportunity to put photographs of candidates on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>A recent radio programme dealt with illiteracy in this country.  A Mr. Ernie Sweeney from Castlebar, County Mayo, who was illiterate up to ten years ago spoke on the radio and, within 30 minutes 60 telephone calls were received by RTE from illiterate people.  The photographs of candidates should be on the ballot paper.  I welcome the changes in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other speakers, believe this is worthwhile legislation.  I take issue with Senator Belton who suggested that this legislation is not important enough to be considered at present. This is a good time to introduce such legislation because we are a long way from another presidential election and we can look calmly and dispassionately at this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was interesting given the plethora of presidential electoral law.  The consolidation of legislation in this area is welcome.  As Senator Dardis and other speakers said, there is a welter of law in this area and alternative determinations on points of law may arise, particularly during a count.  One could end up with a catastrophic situation during an election for the highest office in the land, the Presidency.  It is proper that there should be a consolidation of law in this regard and it is surprising it is not in place.</P>
      <P>I too welcome the change to the count, the elimination of the central count is a sensible and worthwhile innovation.  It does, however, raise a series of other issues.  Although the Presidency is the most senior office in the land, a unique one representing the people, including those who live abroad, such elections offer us an ideal opportunity to look at the way we conduct elections in the widest sense.  For example, the abolition of the central count is a worthwhile proposal. It is surprising that it has never been thought of before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When acting with Members of this and the other House as a UN observer during the Nicaraguan elections, I was amazed <Col N="449" /> at the efficiency and high technology of elections in a country I had thought of as relatively primitive.  While they did not have our electoral system, they counted votes in each individual polling station. The information was then sent down a phone or fax line &mdash; in code to avoid any interference &mdash; to a central location. There were two separate transmissions of these local results to further ensure there could not be any interference.  By midnight, three hours after the polls closed, they had full results for the entire country, and that was, after all, a country that had gone through the turmoil of civil war.  It was impressive to see how they could introduce modern technology to ensure absolute uniformity in the electoral system, even among primitive people.  I remember that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and I had the task of observing voting in a tribal area.  It was quite extraordinary how modern technology fitted in and how easily they handled it.</P>
    <P>That leads me to another point which, I suggest, is a deficiency.  If we are talking about experimentation or electoral change, one area where change is long overdue is the automation of the voting system.  Our PR system would ideally lend itself to automation.  The system of counting tens of thousands of votes in most constituencies by hand, drawn out through a day and half of sweating on both sides of the Border, is primitive to say the least.  As we all know, it can also be subject to significant error.  From time to time we have witnessed examples.  I remember a famous case in an election many years ago &mdash; I was not involved in it, I was on the far side checking the votes &mdash; where a bundle of 100 ballots went missing in County Wicklow.  It would have had an absolutely catastrophic effect on one candidate and an absolutely marvellous impact on the votes of another candidate, because in our system the voting is very tight.  We should give serious consideration to automation in that area.</P>
    <P>Computerisation in every polling station would be difficult but there is no reason some sort of computer card <Col N="450" /> system could not be introduced to allow people to clearly mark their voting preferences on computer legible cards.  These could then be taken to a central location to be counted automatically and quickly. The various preferences could equally, with a high degree of security, be cross tallied and counted to arrive at a final result.  That would do an awful lot to alleviate the nerves and hypertension that some of us feel at election time. Having gone through a recent election, not the best from my point of view, but very close, I can imagine the tension during long recounts such as in the case of Deputy Briscoe and Councillor Eric Byrne.  Frankly, while that made good spectator sport for some people on the periphery of politics, it was inhuman for both candidates.  I know that, for some strange reason, politicians do not have any right to claim compassion from anybody but at the same time, in the interests of democracy and simple humanity, I would like the Minister to look at the whole issue of automated voting.  An election for the Presidency, particularly with the local counts going through, would be an ideal area for the introduction of automated voting.</P>
    <P>Like the Acting Chairman, I welcome the tidying up of the nomination procedure. He would probably go a little further than I in questioning the democracy of the current procedure.  That point should be debated.  It is a fact, as he said, that we do not want to allow every person just looking for personal publicity to utilise the presidential election for that purpose or to gain notoriety.  We should, however, be looking at the system of nominations for presidential elections to ensure that it does not exclude people who could have a great deal to offer.</P>
    <P>The President is President of all the citizens and people of this State regardless of whether they are resident here. Therefore, in a sense, the Presidential Elections Bill, 1993 is ideal legislation to discuss the issue of ex-patriate, nonresidential voters, or emigrant voters, to use the more emotive term.  We need to get our minds clear about this debate.  In principle, I cannot understand the arguments <Col N="451" /> against giving votes to non-residential citizens who happen to be ex-patriate at a particular time.  We have been dragged along on the emotive aspect of this and I would be as guilty of that as any other person.  We have not given enough consideration as to how this will be put into operation.</P>
    <P>I would like to instance a couple of cases from the European Community and elsewhere.  The Italians introduced nonresidential citizens' votes some years ago and have had strikingly poor results. People simply have not voted although it seemed like a simple thing to go along to a consulate or embassy to do so.  If you happen to be an Italian running a chip shop &mdash; or a high-tech industry, let us not be insulting to our EC colleagues in this matter &mdash; will you travel the equivalent distance from Killalla to Dublin to vote? I think not.  That issue will have a big impact here too because the willingness to travel long distances to vote will be determined very much by class.  People of a certain class or profession, with a certain income, will be far more willing to travel a long distance to cast their votes than those of our fellow citizens, perhaps of a different class, who cannot afford to. We have not given enough consideration to this aspect.</P>
    <P>The alternative to voting in a legation or embassy is postal voting.  It does not stretch the imagination too much to see that the registration of postal voters could be grossly abused by political parties, particularly by parties that have the funds or ideological inclination to do it.  My reaction has been to say yes whenever I have been asked but there are practical problems.  The British introduced the postal voting system purely and simply because the Conservative Government of the day took the view that middle and upper middle class people would vote. Therefore, they cynically took the view that this would bring more support for themselves.  In the not too distant past, British ex-pats all over the world were surprised when Margaret Thatcher Christmas cards fell by the ton through their letter-boxes to say that she was <Col N="452" /> caring for and thinking about them.  It was the first time that happened.  Perhaps if the British ex-patriates were as cynical as some Irish people about politicians they would have seen through the ploy. Without overly stretching the point, Members will see that there are practical difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>The American experience of ex-patriate voting has been very interesting.  In some parts of the United States more ex-pats from the various states vote in elections than residential citizens.  I know that the US primary elections were very well contested last time.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Finneran that we should be looking at weekend voting. The present situation is crazy because there is such inflexibility about voting that many people are denied the vote.  In fact, if there had been more flexibility in the voting system, there could have been different results in upwards of a dozen constituencies in the last general election. I am not saying that one party or the other would automatically be favoured but when a handful of votes can decide elections in constituencies, it is clear the inflexibilities in our current system which make it difficult, if not impossible, for gardaí, electoral workers, teachers, shift workers and travelling salespersons to vote need to be addressed.  This could be done in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the consistency of rulings.  It is imperative there be consistency by returning officers in all constituencies. We would all wish that results, whatever they are, be reached in a consistent manner throughout the country.  We are mindful of what happened in the last European elections.  I am sure the personnel in the relevant section in the Department, Mr. Sexton and his staff, are conscious of the need to issue clear guidelines.  Senator Dardis's point is very valid.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that we also consider the use of photographs.  That would favour some of us more than others.  I am not sure whether it would favour me. Senator Norris would gain immeasurably if that were the case.</P>

      <P>Do not be jealous.  I would favour photographs on ballot papers if they made voting more accessible to people.  I am not certain whether it is a major step forward or a major step backward.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke raised the issue of the shouted vote.  The instance of this type of vote should be looked at by the electoral section in the Department of the Environment in the interests of consistency. Some years ago I did some academic research on the shouted vote.  This vote was regarded by Sax and Bax as part of Irish gombeen politics, a way of enforcing repayment of political favours.  I thought this was spurious nonsense until I looked at a ballot box in one of the Galway constituencies, where the highest proportion of shouted votes is recorded.  I inquired about this.  It would be unfair to identify the candidate whose name was being shouted so loud that it could be heard at the crossroads.  It was pointed out to me that not all of those who shouted their votes were illiterates.  One of them was a BA graduate of UCG.  An unkind person may say that this does not automatically mean such persons are literate but I would not agree with that, I might be looking for their vote some time.  Abuse of the relevant section of the Electoral Acts providing for the shouted vote and the tendency to overuse it in particular ballot boxes should be examined. If this practice is used for political purposes it should be stopped and shunned.</P>
      <P>This is good legislation which is ideal for discussion on a quiet afternoon in the Seanad.  We could range very widely over it.  We could talk about the democracy of looking after middle class young people who attend university and consider the extension of the ballot to others.  Senator Norris will be politically correct and agree with me, whatever his inner feelings are in this area.  It would be unfair for me to continue on this course.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> This Bill will be welcomed by all in the House.  It gives us the opportunity to consider a number of issues, including votes by emigrants and a general tidying up of our electoral system.  The Minister should consider automated voting.  I favour weekend voting.  There should be more flexibility in the voting system but this would have to be consistent with the protection of the integrity of the ballot. This is an area about which I would be worried if we are to give votes to emigrants. We will have to consider this very carefully because I can foresee circumstances in which it would be easily abused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. This is an opportune moment for us to have a calm and reasoned debate on this important matter because we are not in the immediate run up to an election when things would be more heated.  The Minister has experience of presidential elections and the heat that can be generated during them.</P>
      <P>I accept it is useful that counting be done in the constituencies for reasons such as efficiency and the feeling of direct local participation in the excitement of the election.  With the proliferation of local radio stations, local areas can have a direct focus on the situation as it emerges in their constituencies.  However, I slightly regret that the count will no longer be centralised in Dublin.  I am glad that during the last election the count was held in Ballsbridge.  Ballot boxes from all over the country arrived there.  I found it an electrifying moment when the ballot boxes from the Aran Islands were opened.  Since the foundation of the State voters there voted solidly for Fianna Fáil. I remember the excitement of the crowd when they saw a majority on those islands voted for Mary Robinson, who is now Her Excellency, the President of Ireland. I was glad to experience this kind of electoral excitement before the situation is reformed.  As the result will be declared at the central count in Dublin we will still have that excitement in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not very much in favour of Sunday voting.  Perhaps it is because of my Protestant <Col N="455" /> background even though I disclaim the title of Protestant because I am of the view that the Church of Ireland is the church established by St. Patrick in 432 AD.  The rest of you went wrong somewhere around the 12th century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I am delighted to have my etymologically pure Protestantism confirmed by Senator O'Kennedy.</P>
      <P>I like the idea of the sabbath, not just from a religious point of view, although this would be part of my tradition, but for a very practical reason.  It is important people have a day on which they do not have public obligations.  One thinks not just of the voters but of the people employed in polling stations.  Such voting would compel people to work on a Sunday.  I do not say this from any narrow Protestantism.  I spend quite a lot of time in the Middle East, both in Muslim countries and in Israel.  I have been very practically confirmed in my belief of the usefulness of a day of rest by the beauty of the Jewish sabbath, during which virtually nothing runs.  At first this is an irritant but it is immensely refreshing.</P>
      <P>In case this does not go straight to the Minister's heart, may I produce economic arguments?  I presume if elections are to be held on Sundays workers will have to be paid triple time.  This would increase expenditure on the election very considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not that difficult to vote.  My withers were not particularly wrenched listening to the argument about teachers.  I am a teacher.  I am also a Member of the Seanad.  I have many irons in the fire.  I have never missed voting in an election. Polling stations are open until 9 or 10 o' <Col N="456" /> clock in the evening.  There is no excuse whatever for not voting unless someone is geographically displaced.</P>
    <P>In the near future we should look at the whole electoral system and make it much more modern and computerised.  I do not see why people should not be able to vote by inserting a card with a magnetic tape into something like a banklink machine anywhere in the country.  This card would indentify them.  This is the way we will have to go.  It would simplify the system.  I know the technology exists to enable this to be done although I may not have described it very accurately. This would be an efficient voting method.</P>
    <P>With regard to the nomination of the President, I have memories from the last election of one person ganging up on me and haranguing me because I would not nominate them.  I had already given a commitment to somebody else.  The system of nomination should be much wider and this Bill does not go anywhere near addressing the situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche tempted me to go down the road of opening up the university seats.  Some day I will take him on in that argument and I will demonstrate, once again, that the university seats are the most democratically elected because the nominating body is itself enfranchised, as the Senator knows.  All this talk about delegated universal suffrage is the greatest load of rubbish and codswallop anybody ever heard.  It only does what it is intended to do, which is to allow the political parties to have a stranglehold on the whole senatorial process.  Everybody knows that.</P>
    <P>It is the same in a sense with the presidential election.  It was a miracle, almost a fluke, that we elected our current President because she emerged as an independent candidate in a certain sense &mdash; not directly in the control of one party. She made it clear throughout the election that she would not be a captive of the two parties which were principally promoting her.  I was honoured to be one of the signatories to her nomination.  However, I do not agree with allowing the Oireachtas or four county councils to nominate, which is where this delegated <Col N="457" /> universal suffrage rubbish which is trotted out for the Seanad elections comes into play.</P>
    <P>Why are we so suspicious of our citizens? Why do we think that they are not entitled to nominate candidates?  We should set a figure, for example, 1,000 or 5,000.  If somebody is able to convince 1,000 or 5,000 of his or her fellow citizens to nominate them, why can they not be put forward directly without this patronising involvement of county councillors in what I regard as a completely fraudulent machine?  I do not think the county councillors are any more gifted or intelligent than the people they represent. In fact, sometimes I think the inverse ratio would be more appropriate. It seems that there is a suspicion of the voter.  Why should a certain number not be allowed to nominate directly?</P>
    <P>I also do not see why there is all this fuss about people nominating two or three candidates.  There is an elaborate machinery which stipulates that it will be the first paper which arrives on Sunday 3 February, or whatever.  Who cares?  What difference does it make?  It all evolves around whether a person who signs a nomination paper is saying that the person they nominate is the only person who has the exclusive capacity to become President.  Nobody really believes that. In signing a nomination paper one is saying that this is a person worthy to be President.</P>
    <P>In most presidential elections, I think all the candidates are worthy to be President. One may strike a person as being better than the others or reflecting their ethos more strongly but in the last election we had three excellent candidates.  I knew early on which one I was going to vote for, but I think we would be would have been ably represented, for different reasons, by any one of the three candidates. To say that a person cannot nominate more than one candidate is nonsense, if it is accepted that nominating a candidate means saying that this is a person worthy to represent the people of Ireland as President.  I cannot think of an occasion on which somebody has been <Col N="458" /> nominated to be President who would not have been a suitable candidate.</P>
    <P>I agree with the idea of a photograph of the presidential candidate, not because it is terribly important in the presidential election.  By the time voters come to the polls, they know who is in the race and if they do not they ought to stay at home. However, it introduces a precedent for having such items in electoral systems.  It would be valuable during general elections where there are many candidates and sometimes there are candidates with similar names.  I would not be surprised if there were even two John Brownes. Repeated names can be confusing, particularly for elderly people or those who do not have good literacy skills. Although I do not think it is vital in this election, it would be a good headline and might make it easier to get it into a revision of the general electoral system.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that one is now permitted to withdraw from the list once one dies.  It seems a rather extreme measure to have to take in order to get off the list, but I suppose it is legitimate that one cannot be elected as a dead President.  It is the &lsquo;drop the dead President&rsquo; clause, of which I approve.</P>
    <P>It is a disadvantage that there is nothing in the Bill about the amounts of money which are spent on election campaigns.  Senator Roche touched on this issue.  There should be an examination and a ceiling set on the amount of money which any candidate or party can spend.  Perhaps this could be looked at at some stage.  It gives the candidate of the major party a considerable advantage over any smaller party's candidate or an independent candidate who emerges.  I would like to see some ceiling set on the amount which can be spent.  It is possible to envisage a situation where unscrupulous interests could attempt to buy the presidency.  One has only to look at the United States of America where one has to be a millionaire and get the support of wealthy interests to be elected to the presidency.</P>
    <P>I am happy to support the suggestion that people outside this State should be permitted to vote in presidential elections. <Col N="459" /> The stronger we keep the links between our emigrants and the mother country the better, and I cannot think of a more appropriate presidency under which this change should take place.  I know it is almost becoming a cliché that the President has the light in the window but it is a moving image, particularly in a country which has traditionally suffered so heavily from emigration.</P>
    <P>I have been among those who, for a number of years, have proposed that the ideal place to have a constituency is the Seanad where, for example, in the university seats we successfully and efficiently deal with the registration of voters abroad and have a high level of participation.  Considering the fact that it is a postal ballot and that the register has to be kept up to date, it is astonishing that up to 55 to 60 per cent of the electorate votes for the Trinity College seats, it shows that people do appreciate this. However, I would not want to overestimate the level of their appreciation.</P>
    <P>I was in Australia a year ago and a number of Irish emigrant groups told me they felt they were disenfranchised.  I made what I thought was a generous suggestion and said I had put on the record when discussing reform of the Oireachtas that there ought to be two seats in Seanad Éireann for emigrants. They did not regard that as the greatest offer they were entitled to expect.  I was rather hurt that they held the Seanad in such moderate esteem.  They wanted participation in the Dáil elections.  I would not overestimate the gratitude of our emigrants for being permitted to vote in the presidential election.  However, I think there would be a high level of participation and they would appreciate being involved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  There are certain areas which I think could have been spelled out a little more, such as the question of the amounts of money spent on the campaign.  The most central point is the machinery by which people are nominated. I do not think it is satisfactory to keep this process of nomination so firmly locked in the grip of the political party <Col N="460" /> system.  I would ask the Minister to look at that once more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When one addresses the issue of the election of President one should also have a look at the base text in relation to the presidency, which is the Constitution.  Article 12.2 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;The President shall be elected by direct vote of the people.&rdquo;  It goes on to state that every citizen who has the right to vote at an election for members of Dáil Éireann shall have the right to vote at an election for President. It equates the right and responsibility of the electors in relation to the election of the President with that of election to the Oireachtas and that is how it should be. The President has a constitutional function and at different times Presidents have interpreted that constitutional function in slightly different ways.</P>
      <P>The former President, Dr. Hillery, will be remembered as one who vigorously defended the Constitution and who always worked in a conscientious fashion within the confines and direction of the constitutional framework.  He was a President who certainly thought that was the fundamental priority he was going to attach to his office.  In my view and I am sure in the view of everyone in the House, he did it remarkably well and resisted attempts to bring the presidency into areas where, in his strict interpretation of the Constitution, it should not be involved.  We were lucky to have such a President.</P>
      <P>This debate is both important and appropriate.  The current President has certainly established the style, authority and impact of this presidency both at home and abroad.  She clearly has a rather different view of the presidential role under the Constitution.  I have, perhaps, known her longer than anyone else in this House.  I hate, each time I stand up in this House, to have to refer back to things that happened 30 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have known our current President on a personal level as a fellow member of the Irish Council of the European Movement in the early 1960s, a fellow member of the Bar and other organisations and, <Col N="461" /> once in a while, as a fellow member of the Oireachtas.  Our views did not always coincide but I have always acknowledged, privately and publicly, the unique capacity of our current President, her personal ability, constitutional awareness and her awareness of the relationship between laws and the citizen.  It is evident that in her pursuit of her presidential responsibility she has interpreted the Constitution in a way that some might be surprised others before her did not.</P>
    <P>I expressed the view on her election, without any degree of apprehension, that we were going to see the limits of the presidency greatly extended within the Constitution.  It has, in my view, been a remarkable and healthy development and one to which the people have responded.  For this reason, when we now talk about election to that office, we have to treat it with a degree of seriousness and responsibility that we might not have attached to it 15 to 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>I always wondered about Article 15 of the Constitution but it was not for me to interpret it.  I had little doubt about its meaning and stated this publicly in our own party rooms, as some of my colleagues will recall.  It says very simply in Article 15:</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas shall consist of the President and two Houses, viz.: a House of Representatives to be called Dáil Éireann and a Senate to be called Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>That is a simple assertion.  Article 15.7 states: &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall hold at least one session every year.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be the simplest statement of a mandatory obligation on the Oireachtas, comprising the President and both Houses yet I do not recall any previous President who saw it that way.</P>
    <P>Some thought this would be a matter of discretion or a possibility.  What I read and indicated then has since emerged to be the case.  I could not imagine that President Mary Robinson would not be aware of the mandatory effect of that Article and, not surprisingly, we had a joint session of the Oireachtas addressed by the President on 8 July, 1992. <Col N="462" /> Although it is for the President herself to interpret her constitutional function, I imagine that it will not be the last such occasion.</P>
    <P>I welcome all this greatly because it is within the terms of the Constitution.  The laws must put in place effective machinery for the exercise of the constitutional function.  We must do what we can to assert the link between the people and the presidency or an t-uachtaránacht, as I would perhaps prefer to have it called. That link must be promoted and built into our legislative process, particularly legislation which relates to the election.</P>
    <P>In future there will be a new dimension to the presidency.  It will be seen very definitely as representing the mood, will and ethos of our people at home and abroad.  By coincidence, I collected my local papers on my way in here and found the following article on page one of the <i>Tipperary Star.</i></P>
    <P>The President, Mrs. Mary Robinson visits Tipperary Town this afternoon, Wednesday during which she will present the first Florence Nightingale Medal ever awarded to an Irish Red Cross recipient for work carried out by the Red Cross in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The medal will be presented by Mrs. Robinson to Nurse Nellie Keane of Murgasty, Tipperary town for her exceptional dedication and pioneering work in the promotion of nursing care at home.</P>
    <P>It is obviously the first time this medal has been presented to an Irish person and the President is adding distinction to the occasion and the achievement by presenting it.  One can illustrate the sharing and participatory role of the President at home and abroad by reference to a variety of events.</P>
    <P>We will experience an interesting constitutional development over the next number of years.  Looking at the Constitution and the capacity of people who understand and interpret it to use and expand their role within it, we could be on the verge of a shift between the various functions of the Constitution.  It is important that we recognise that reality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> These things are not always decided by the civil servants who prepare legislation and I have the greatest of regard for those civil servants.  These issues are more often determined by people who use imagination and conviction.  We are looking at something like that now.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge that we have not been true to ourselves as politicians If we truly understood political representation as derived from the Greek concept of the <i>polis</i> and the representative of the city state, we would not see the term &ldquo;Politician&rdquo; used in such a denigratory way.  We would not tolerate our reputations, personally and collectively, being tarnished as they have been.  We would not accept being regular targets of implication and innuendo in the press and otherwise.  Each of us would always be conscious of our role and not our passing advantage and that is something which cannot be said too often.</P>
    <P>If we are conscious of our role as distinct from our passing political advantage &mdash; and I agree with what has been said recently in the Seanad in terms of whether an initiative comes from one or other side of the House &mdash; surely we can find that collective sense of responsibility which is emerging in these debates.  Then we would find a respect for each other and for the Legislature and Government.</P>
    <P>It is evident that politicians at all levels do not enjoy the esteem we would like to have.  However, it is equally evident that the presidency does.  That applies to this President and the previous President who, in different ways and for different reasons, were greatly admired.  That is a tribute to both of them.  We must come to terms with that welcome fact and ensure that the presidency is not only representative but also linked as closely as possible to the people at all stages from nomination to election.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill and the progressive changes in it.  Clearly, it is the result of much thought and appropriate amendment. I tend to support the view that the nomination procedure should be, as far as possible, operated through direct universal suffrage.  After all, the Constitution <Col N="464" /> refers to the people.  It does not refer to county councils.  I think it would be appropriate, although it might be practically difficult, to have a nomination function for the people, subject to certain limits in law.  I express that as a personal view and one that is consistent with the role of the presidency both in the Constitution and in its execution in recent years.</P>
    <P>I have a reservation in relation to the election, which is the next stage.  The citizens entitled to vote are the same age as those who are entitled to vote in Dáil elections.  However, I offer a reservation to those who enthusiastically support &mdash; and I understand why &mdash; the case for votes for emigrants.  Emigration is an emotional theme in Ireland and has been throughout our history.  Irish culture and literature cannot be understood unless one is aware of the dán deoraíochta.  We do not spend as much time thinking about it now as our predecessors did.  However, the deoraíocht &mdash; the tears that were shed and the beautiful music &mdash; was part of Irish culture every minute of every day, and it still is.  That is a demonstration of respect and regret for those who are away.  In the course of my visits abroad as Minister for Foreign Affairs I always considered it a privilege and obligation to meet our emigrants wherever they were &mdash; India, Australia, America and other countries.</P>
    <P>We would do well to ponder the issue and I agree with Senator Roche in this regard.  We are different from the Germans, the British and the French who have a voting facility for emigrants.  The great difference is that there are more of our emigrants abroad and that is a regrettable fact.  When Senator Dardis made his proposal I did not violently disagree with the sentiment but we must ask at what stage would a person be determined to be eligible to vote as an emigrant &mdash; after ten years out of Ireland, 15 years or 17 years?  We should be aware that if we introduce that proposal there are two or three consequences which I will outline.  I have met many emigrants who have told me to be very careful because it is difficult to say you are <Col N="465" /> against votes for emigrants because they are likely to reply there is no point listening to politicians who are responsible for them having to emigrate and then opposing them getting the right to vote at home.  One can see the emotional responses.</P>
    <P>Equally, we would be foolish to ignore the fact that the imbalance between the number of Irish abroad and the number of Irish at home could mean that emigrants would determine the government, the implementation of policy and the selection of every representative from President down.  Maybe the Italians are more casual.  There is always something <i>tutto differente per gli Italiani affari</i>.  They can wander around the world and do their own thing.  I know their style well: I have lived with them, I love them, but the Irish might take a different view.</P>
    <P>I wish to caution that the consequences of universal suffrage for emigrants include the practical problem of counting emigrants' votes and the balance that would arise where by those who decide the Government and the presidency would not be resident here and would not have to live with the consequences of their decision.  That said, I greatly sympathise with their right.  I consider Senator Norris's suggestion that they be represented in this House significant although he said that the Australian emigrants did not see it that way.  We should be a little more sensitive to their views in this House as distinct from the direct political arena in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Although it is not in this Bill I believe it is time we automated our counting system.  It was one of my privileges to be a member of the constitutional committee under the late Seán Lemass which looked at a range of constitutional options for voting in 1966 and I regret that most of our recommendations in relation to elections and electoral systems have been left lying.  That is a great pity as we put much thought into it over 12 months on a non partisan political basis.  I would like to see some of those recommendations resurrected.</P>
    <P>The electoral system &mdash; the PR system &mdash; as it applies to the presidency is, as <Col N="466" /> Senator Roche said, haphazard.  Let us not delude ourselves.  Some say it is fair and proportional but it is haphazard, particularly in respect of transfer of surplus after a second or third count when the top bundle of votes is picked.  People say that is a representative sample of the total bundle of votes: it is no such thing and it is a distortion to pretend that it is.  I ask those who vigorously and consistently argue for a fair system, PR, to look at the counting system and see how a number seven vote can effectively become a number one.  Is that a fair system, never mind the haphazard fashion in the transfer of surpluses?</P>
    <P>The election of the President and the counting in the presidential election is an ideal opportunity to try the automated system and I hope in time, we would be able to extend that.  I wish to see the linkage between the electoral system for the presidency and the role and status of the presidency being recognised by us. Our people recognise the role and status of the presidency and we as politicians must not drag our heels when their views are coming across clearly and consistently. I would like to see the automated system introduced.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the electoral system and the arrangements, whether for Sunday or otherwise, must be such as to maximise the response from the electorate at every level, from the youngest to the oldest, from the most intelligent to the disabled, intellectually or otherwise.  I share that view in respect of President Robinson or any other President. We have had some very distinguished Presidents, each of whom in his own way broadened understanding and respect for the Presidency.  I think of the late Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh and the late President Childers.  The office of President will feature more prominently in Irish life because of the status and the contributions of our Presidents over the years.  We must ensure that our electoral system is extended to and includes the marginalised groups for which our current President shows particular concern and properly so, sometimes to the extent of shocking the awareness of some of us <Col N="467" /> who are a bit more comfortable in our general attitude.</P>
    <P>You have been patient with me, a Chathaoirligh, in allowing me to range a little more broadly than one should over this area.  I have little to add to what most of what my colleagues said with regard to the mechanical arrangements on election day.  I hope what I have said puts in context why it is important to acknowledge the fact that the Minister is introducing this Bill to make the election of the President more directly responsive to the people and why it is important that this should be done in view of the enhancing role of the Presidency, particularly in these times.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  When I was elected to the Seanad I naturally took advice from Senator Norris as to how I should behave here.  He told me that the most important thing I had to do in the House was to say &ldquo;hear hear&rdquo; every time he spoke.  Most of what I will say is in agreement with what he said.</P>
      <P>Our President has enormously expanded the role of the President, I will not argue with Senator O'Kennedy as to which of us has known her longer.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy spoke about the Florence Nightingale medal awarded today.  It was already awarded to another Irish nurse, Helen Staunton, some years ago, for her work in Uganda with the Red Cross.</P>

      <P>Some of the important points I support have been in regard to the nomination from people other than Members of the Oireachtas.  This is very important because it narrows enormously the number of people who can be put forward and if this can be included in this Bill it would be welcome.  Senator Finneran spoke about Sunday voting, which would maximise the opportunity for people to vote.  I hope it will be <Col N="468" /> seriously considered for all elections because, particularly for young people living away from home, it is very difficult to vote on a Wednesday or Thursday.</P>
      <P>If postal votes are being examined, could we kindly work out why disabled people have to be certified sane when the rest of us can go in and do what we like?  There is a strange anomaly that just because a person may be unable to get into a normal polling station, that person needs to be more mentally alert than those of us who can wander in off the street.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that emigrants should have a postal vote.  The Presidential election would be an important one to start with because people abroad see the President as someone who represents them internationally as well as in the local sphere and I hope this could be examined when discussing this Bill.  The Bill is great in its scope and there are marvellous things in it as Senator Norris said, such as the fact that a candidate can avoid running for election if he or she is dead.  I was very pleased to see that a retiring President, if he or she wants to go for re-election will get the papers free of charge.  That is a nice touch in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  If the Bill does anything to update our electoral laws it has to be welcomed.  It will bring us into the 20th century if that is possible.  The Dáil elections were the first to benefit from the process of reform.  This is the second and I hope there will be referenda later because we have seven different electoral codes in force at present.  I am glad that the necessary reforms are being introduced in this House instead of leaving it to lawyers.  It says a lot for the elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with the right of people to vote, the qualifications of candidates and the rights to nominate people.  One of the important factors is that it eliminates the central count which was a terrible burden during election time.  It meant that the first count was carried out in the constituency and then votes were sent to the Presidential returning officer <Col N="469" /> where they were counted again and so on.  It is nice to see it being done in the constituency because that is where the interest lies.  The last time there was a count it took 48 hours to elect the President. The system is a bit cumbersome and the counts should be quicker next time.</P>
    <P>Our President is performing excellently on our behalf at home and abroad. She has been a unifying force for all parties in the Dáil.  Other Presidents have also performed admirably.  They are always a unifying force and people do not set them up as political scapegoats. Sunday voting was mentioned and we should examine this issue.  European countries do it and it cuts out the need to lose working and school days.  It does not create a problem in other religious countries, they seem to operate it very well and there is no reason we should not do the same.</P>
    <P>It bothers me that there is an age limit &mdash; 35 &mdash; for standing for the election of President.  When a person reaches voting age, 18, I do not see why that person is not considered mature enough to stand for President.  There is no great need for the age limit when people are considered mature from 18 onwards.  Other reforms, such as improvements for disabled voters and the elimination of intimidation outside polling booths are welcome.  We could improve the Bill further but it will reform our electoral system and I welcome it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Senators for their contributions and I am glad they have no great difficulty in supporting the Bill.  I wish to deal with some of the issues raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis and other Senators referred to certain aspects of change required for nomination procedures. While the Bill provides for certain changes in this regard, the matters referred to by the different Senators are issues governed by the Constitution.  Any change in the provision in question would require amendment of the Constitution. <Col N="470" /> It is not relevant to this Bill and, therefore, we cannot take any suggested changes by the Senators in that particular area.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton raised the issue of duration of the office of President.  He suggested that the President should hold office for ten years.  Again this is a constitutional matter and, regardless of our views on these matters, they are covered in the Constitution and cannot be dealt with in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>A strong case was made by most Senators for Sunday voting although Senator Norris gave reasons for not doing so.  The Electoral Act, 1992, removed the statutory barrier to voting on Sundays and there is now no reason an election should not be held on a Sunday.  It is a matter for decision on each occasion which day should be appointed as polling day.  However, as Senators mentioned, some minority churches would have difficulty with the concept of voting on Sundays on grounds of conscience and, as legislators, we have to take that into account.  I am not sure that Senator Maloney's point that the children would not have a day off would go down well. Most school children love an election because they have a day off.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the view expressed by Senator Dardis and others about the need for a uniform approach by returning officers in relation to the validity of ballot papers.  I assure Senators that I will arrange for my Department to take this up with returning officers in each constituency.</P>
    <P>The automation of elections was raised by a number of Senators and there are no specific proposals on this matter.  A preliminary examination of this issue some years ago indicated that computerised voting is technically feasible but would involve significant practical difficulties and costs, particularly on account of our single transferable vote system.  It is not clear that the advantages derived from automated voting would outweigh the difficulties and costs involved.  I assure Senators that we will keep the position under review particularly in the light of technological <Col N="471" /> developments during the past few years and perhaps we would have further discussion on it in the Seanad at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy referred to the commission of which he was a member in 1966 which made a number of recommendations in relation to the electoral system.  Perhaps we could take its report off the shelf, dust it down and look again at some of its recommendations, they might be relevant.  Senator Norris raised the question of declaring the result of an election.  I confirm that while the counting of votes will take place in the constituencies the overall result will be declared centrally by the presidential returning officer.  A number of Senators put forward arguments in favour of including a photograph of each candidate on the ballot paper.  There are advantages in favour of this proposal, but there are also disadvantages and problems associated with it, particularly the danger of mistakes being made under pressure at an election.  It would be turning the election into some kind of beauty contest and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Votes for emigrants is a major issue which was raised in previous discussions in the Dáil in relation to this Bill and touched on yesterday in relation to electoral reform.  Senators also made a number of suggestions in this regard today.  The legal advice available to the Government is that under the relevant provisions of the Constitution it would not be possible to extend voting rights to citizens who are not part of the population of the State except to limited categories such as those who are abroad for only a short period of time.  As the House is aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government accepts in principle <Col N="472" /> that there should be constitutional change to give voting rights to emigrants and the programme indicates that the issue will be further examined.</P>
    <P>The ongoing examination is a matter initially for the Minister for the Environment. It will be comprehensive and all the options will be fully considered. There are many different opinions about the type of votes emigrants should have for a presidential election, a general election, a European election or in referenda. The examination will be thorough in the sense that it will explore the detailed technical arrangements required to give effect to each option and the nature of the constitutional amendment required in relation to each.  Having completed the examination the Minister will invite the Government to examine the different options and those put forward by the Seanad will be considered in this examination. It is expected that the completion of the examination will be concluded in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>There are major problems in this area and Senator Roche touched on some of them.  I will not go into detail but one has to consider the different viewpoints and options and the ways in which we could give voting rights to emigrants.  It is the view of all political parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas that some voting contacts should be made with emigrants and I hope this can be considered as fairly and as equitably as possible during the lifetime of this Government.  A decision will be made on the matter as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>While the Bill may not be the most glamorous or exciting legislation coming before the House, as many Senators pointed out it is timely to discuss it now rather than prior to a presidential election. The reality of any good legislation is that it is not over exciting or over glamorous and does not provide an opportunity for punchy media sound bites.  It is right that we should discuss this matter and make the changes and the Bill amends and consolidates the law relating to presidential elections.  Many Senators felt that this was important, bringing together all the different legislation <Col N="473" /> we had over the years and ensuring that the Presidential Elections Bill is given a status and an importance it deserves.  I am looking forward to further debate in the Seanad in the coming weeks to discuss further any amendments that may be put forward.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Shannon Airport Transatlantic Status.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I appreciate that you have many calls and claims on the time allocated to the Adjournment and I am pleased you recognised that this is a matter of such significant importance that it may be raised this evening.</P>
      <P>The situation in Shannon as a result of the Government's decision to change the transatlantic status of the airport is significant and there is much concern in County Clare and in the mid-west region regarding the fallout of that decision.  I am pleased that the Minister is here this evening to answer a number of questions I will be raising in relation to the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the decision there has been an examination locally in relation to the fallout in the region.  There is particular concern with regard to the effect this decision will have on industrial development and industries in the area, not only in County Clare but as far south as County Kerry, as far as County Tipperary and indeed up to Loughrea in County Galway.  There is concern in relation to the effects lack of direct flights around the entire year may have on the industries in these areas because they have relied in the past on the New York flight in the morning arriving <Col N="474" /> at Shannon to provide them with material.  What is the future for those factories and similar industries who might have decided to set up industry in the region if the transatlantic status had remained?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister and his colleagues in Government undertake an impact study on the economic and social fallout of this decision in County Clare and in the entire region?  I am seriously concerned about this matter, that the Government undertook this decision solely in respect of the criteria relating to Aer Lingus and did not consider the overall situation in the region.  The economics of the region were not considered in coming to a decision in relation to the status of Shannon.  Arriving at the decision the Government was severely handicapped, as it had not considered the overall problem when it decided to change the status.  That is unfortunate and it now behoves the Government to undertake an impact study on the potential fallout of its decision.</P>
    <P>Another matter that arises is the overall impact of the change in the system occasioned by the 50/50 proposal under the amended bilateral agreement.  Under this agreement, 50 per cent of scheduled flights are supposed to operate direct to Dublin and 50 per cent to Shannon and similarly with charters.  There is concern in relation to this issue because automatically there will be an immediate loss to Shannon when this agreement is implemented.  I gather the agreement can be operative immediately and will definitely be operative from the beginning of the next season commencing in April 1994.</P>
    <P>Shannon has been getting direct flights, termed international flights.  The airport and Aer Rianta, on arrival of a plane at Shannon, were paid international charges or international dues.  As a result of the change, many of the flights now coming back through Shannon will be classified as domestic flights and there will be a reduction in the landing fees of over 80 per cent on 50 per cent of them. That will mean substantial loss of revenue <Col N="475" /> to the airport resulting in deep concern in relation to the revenue accruing to it.</P>
    <P>In addition there is grave concern in relation to the catering services and the flight kitchens in Shannon which have been providing the catering facilities for transatlantic flights.  There is now a question mark over their future, where they stand and what the situation is for those working in flight catering kitchens. Equally there is much concern in relation to the reduction in transit passengers in the shops at Shannon.  There is a fear that there will be a serious fallout for these shops.  On a general note, therefore, there is great concern in the airport regarding potential job losses in the immediate area of catering, shops and in baggage handling by Aer Lingus staff on the ground.</P>
    <P>Regarding the flights themselves the Minister must clarify a number of issues, I especially refer to the bilateral agreement. A flight operating directly to Dublin, then to Shannon and from there to Boston or New York or wherever is known as a round robin system.  Could the half leg from Shannon on to the USA be classified as a direct scheduled flight and could that half leg fall into the category of the 50 per cent?  There is need for urgent clarification of this issue.</P>
    <P>The biggest charter airline operating into Ireland last year brought in approximately 27,000 people, 20,000 of whom were brought to Shannon and 7,000 to Dublin Airport.  If that airline charter facility is to continue it will operate under the new system and there would have to be 50/50 throughput between both airports, 13,500 people to Shannon and 13,500 to Dublin.  Huge difficulties can arise in the charter business if this situation is implemented.  Is the Minister in contact with the authorities in the USA to further review the system, especially in relation to charters, because I do not believe that the present proposal is viable?  Furthermore, I do not believe that even Aer Lingus is happy that charter flights are getting this same facility or that this is being directed as a 50/50 operation.  Effectively, by allowing charters <Col N="476" /> the 50/50 facility there will be further competition against Aer Lingus to the Dublin route and that is highly unsatisfactory. The situation needs to be clarified. We must know, for instance, if there will be a 30 per cent reduction in the number of people who will arrive into the mid-west region under the current proposal.</P>
    <P>One of the issues of serious concern to the people in the mid-west is what type of monitoring system will be introduced by the Minister and his Department to ensure that there is a fair crack of the whip in relation to the arrival of flights. This matter has been raised with the Minister at a number of meetings, and I am raising it again this evening.  The mid-west region does not rely on &mdash; and cannot depend on &mdash; the type of system that currently operates.  There is a need for the Minister to establish an independent body to operate and monitor the type of scheduled and chartered flights that arrive in Dublin and Shannon to see that there is a fair crack of the whip.  We are especially concerned that a promotional programme will be engaged in which could result in Shannon being bypassed. This is of great concern in the mid-west region.  The Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Tourism and Trade, should specially direct Bord Fáilte to undertake an active and strong promotion in relation to tourism to the west.  It would be unfortunate if semi-State operations, such as Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus promoted Dublin and the Dublin region to the diminution of the mid-west and the County Clare region.  That is a matter of great concern and I ask the Minister to give an assurance that a special tourism promotion will be undertaken and that he will exhort Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus to implement an active promotion.  It is also incumbent on the Minister, with the Minister for Employment and Enterprise, Deputy Quinn, to ensure that there is active industrial promotion of this region.</P>
    <P>There is great concern in the mid-west region and there is now an opportunity for the Minister to assure people they are not forgotten and that constructive steps <Col N="477" /> for active tourism and industrial promotion of the region will be taken to ensure no further jobs are lost.  Further investment that would have been made should go ahead and there should not be a huge economic fall out from the Government's decision to change the transatlantic status of Shannon Airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the social and economic implications for the Shannon region of the total package Aer Lingus and the Government intend to implement for Shannon are negative.  I believe this is so for the change in the Shannon stop policy and I am certain it is so when other elements of the package are taken into consideration.  If the energy and commitment of the people in the region are now channelled towards taking advantage of the opportunities for growth available to the airport under the total Shannon package, the implications will be positive, not only for wealth creation but also for jobs in the region.</P>
      <P>I am equally certain the social and economic implications for Ireland and for Shannon would have been disastrous if the Government had not taken a decision earlier this year to rescue our national airline.  That was the context in which the negotiations to change the Shannon stop policy took place.  I will not repeat all the arguments why the Aer Lingus strategy had to be adopted in full by the Government. We have already had an extensive debate on this issue in both Houses of the Oireachtas and elsewhere.  However I will put some relevant facts before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus lost £12.9 million on its transatlantic operations last year.  Without the changes proposed in its strategy for the future it would have lost £20 million this year.  This was clearly unsustainable. Aer Lingus accounts for 70 per cent of north Atlantic scheduled services through Shannon.  Without Aer Lingus the future of Shannon would be bleak. Let it also be said that without Shannon the future of Aer Lingus on the transatlantic route would be bleak.  Aer Lingus <Col N="478" /> needs Shannon just as much as Shannon needs Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>With full Government support and approval Aer Lingus have put together an imaginative and progressive package for Shannon.  For the first time Shannon will have its own transatlantic operation, based in and managed from Shannon.  All Aer Lingus transatlantic services will stop and start at Shannon.  The number of Aer Lingus transatlantic services will increase by 13 per cent from next year.  There will be a year round daily New York service and a dedicated Shannon/New York service in the peak summer season.  There will be no change in the current Boston service.</P>
    <P>Pick-up rights for US carriers at Shannon to all points in Europe and beyond are guaranteed.  US carriers have pick-up rights at Dublin to only one point in Europe which is outside the EC.  Aer Lingus is examining ways of developing new business, including significantly lowering fares from the US in order to extend the peak summer season.  It will work closely with local travel and tourism groups in the Shannon region.  In addition other opportunities for the new low cost airline operation at Shannon will be exploited for other business in all markets, particularly in the off peak season.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus will base an extra aircraft at Shannon to operate a new early morning Shannon/Dublin service, greatly improving the service out of Shannon by providing new connections to six European and three provincial UK destinations. The Aer Lingus strategy for the future envisages replacement of the transatlantic fleet in 1995 or 1996.  However because of the positive response from tourism interests in particular to the Aer Lingus plan, the company is now examining the possibility of accelerating its fleet replacement plans.</P>
    <P>The renegotiation deal we made was excellent and is recognised as such by all fair minded people.  The President of the Irish Airlines Pilots' Association wrote to compliment me and my officials on achieving the difficult task of reconciling the requirement to protect the survival and development of the Shannon area <Col N="479" /> with that of ensuring the viability of Aer Lingus.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>We believe that the formula reached will prove the best foundation for controlled growth in both the tourism and business traffic markets on the north Atlantic for the foreseeable future. This provides the best solution for the Irish economy while protecting the ongoing viability of the Irish air transport industry.</P>
    <P>It was no easy task to persuade the US authorities to forego the rights they automatically had under the old bilateral agreement.  I travelled to Washington to meet the US Secretary for Transportation to impress upon him the importance for this Government of a vibrant Shannon Airport for the mid-west region.  Following my intervention we obtained an early resumption of talks despite the heavy schedule of the US negotiators.  What is more, we made a deal of which we are proud.  Under it any US airline operating a direct flight into Dublin must also put one into Shannon.</P>
    <P>In the plain terms used by one operator based in Shannon, there is a &ldquo;kicker&rdquo; in the revised bilateral agreement for Shannon. I am confident tourism and business interests in the region will avail of this to obtain the extra business Shannon not only deserves but needs to get a return on the huge investment in tourism plant which has been made in the region over the past few years.  This investment was grant aided by the Government.  We too have a stake in ensuring the future prosperity of the airport and the region.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I place on the record of this House my sincere appreciation to the staff of Aer Lingus for their sacrifices and commitment to ensuring the future viability of the national airline and Shannon Airport.  I also thank the many tourism representatives who co-operated with Aer Lingus in finding new business opportunities for Shannon.  Many more in the region could make a similar contribution and commitment.  I appeal to them to do so now.</P>

      <P>We must first look at the role local authority representatives have played since the foundation of the State. They are owed a great debt of gratitude for their hard work.  They are the unpaid servants of this country.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment because the issue warrants immediate attention.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the Minister at the end of October and I thank him for his prompt reply.  I received a further letter this week about councillors' expenses.  County councillors are at one in agreeing that the Minister is sympathetic to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my main reasons for raising this matter is that councillors are at the critical stage of formulating their estimates for 1994.  When we spoke with the Minister over the year in relation to councillors' expenses criteria were being used as to what they may receive regarding mileage or attendance at meetings. In 1993 councillors were anxious that whatever they received would be retrospective <Col N="481" /> to 1 January 1993.  I understand the Minister has not as yet made an announcement in relation to the new memorandum on councillors' expenses. If it is not made until 1 January, where will councillors and local authorities stand?  Will it mean that local authority members continue what they have been doing over the last number of years?</P>
    <P>The Minister made proposals in relation to bands and stated that he was in favour of bands of 30, 50 and 70.  Some time ago the Local Authority Members' Association submitted a proposal to the Minister that they would be in full agreement if those bands were widened to 40, 60, 80 and 160, respectively.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that two ballots were carried out in 1993, by the General Council of County Councils and the Local Authority Members' Association.  As I saw it the General Council of County Councils' ballot was put to the local authority members in a way that was designed to ensure that they accepted there should be a change and that it would not be the last word in accepting the Minister's proposal at that time.  It is interesting to note what happened in that ballot.  Eleven counties were unhappy with the Minister's proposals while the members in Cork city, Dublin city and Dublin County Council did not vote at all, and they are the three biggest local authorities in the country. Eight counties were in favour of accepting the Minister's proposals and half were against.</P>

    <P>In the Local Authority Members' Association ballot the indications were that the proposals would be acceptable provided the bands were widened to 40, 60, 80 and 160.  There were a number of <Col N="482" /> other issues in the LAMA ballot which included that a statement of practice should be obtained from the Revenue Commissioners to the effect that payments to councillors, including the chairperson's allowance, would be tax free. Another was that local authorities should continue to pay expenses of members attending meetings of LAMA, the AMAI and the General Council of County Councils; that clarification was needed on mileage and subsistence rates for conferences, regional meetings and seminars; and that telephone, postage and miscellaneous expenses were inadequate. Overall, I feel that if the bands were widened and the other criteria, which were circulated to the Minister, were met, there would be general acceptance.</P>
    <P>The main reason I raised this matter is that most local authorities may not make the necessary provisions in their 1994 estimates for any increases that would be incurred as a result of any announcement by the Minister in this regard in early 1994.  Under the Minister's proposals a small town commission would need £3,600 and a small urban council would need a minimum of £7,200 to cover expenses and they will not adequately provide for those in their estimates if the Minister does not make the announcement immediately.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  Everybody respects what he has done and what he intends to do.</P>

      <P>I too welcome the Minister to the House.  As Senator Burke said, councils are dealing with their 1994 estimates at the moment they would be glad to know exactly where they stood and for what they have to budget.  There is no doubt that councillors, in their capacity as public representatives, carry a large workload at local level.  We hear a great deal nowadays about development at local level and within the community and it is only right that this important area of <Col N="483" /> local democracy should be encouraged. Councillors are reasonable people and many are prepared to give their time voluntarily but, at the same time, they are entitled to reasonable expenses.  At present it is very difficult to get anybody to do anything for nothing but even with the expenses the Minister is proposing, councillors will still have to meet huge individual outlays.</P>

      <P>I commend Senator Burke for raising this matter at this opportune time when local authorities are preparing their 1994 budget. As Senator Burke and Senator Belton stated, all local authorities are facing problems.  When it comes to attending conferences some of them will have a problem because of the reduced amount provided for expenses.  It is important that local democracy is recognised, that local councillors are treated properly and respected for the valuable work they do at local level and the service they provide to the community.  I have no doubt that the Minister, who was a member of a local authority for a number of years, appreciates the huge effort that is being put in by councillors.  It is time councillors were give proper recognition by his Department.  I support everything my colleagues said and I urge the Minister to act on this matter quickly because it is currently being discussed at estimates meetings across the country.  Councillors and county managers need the position clarified.</P>

      <P>I join in the request for the Minister to outline his final proposals in relation to a new system of allowances for local authority members as soon as possible.  The Minister will recall that my Fianna Fáil Seanad colleagues and I had a very constructive meeting with him about this matter last July.  At that time we discussed the proposals the Minister had circulated and we made a number of suggestions.  The Minister indicated that he would be prepared to look sympathetically at the possibility of increasing the minimum band to 40 meetings. <Col N="484" /> This was a realistic request to the Minister because even the smallest local authority holds in excess of 30 meetings which are vital to allow it to do its business properly but that does not provide for meetings which have to be held in connection with revisions of the county development plan, estimates, etc. Because of the Minister's attitude when he met us, I know his final proposals will incorporate some of the suggestions we made that day.  I hope he will outline his final set of proposals as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Burke, Senator Belton, Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Mullooly for raising this matter and I am glad to have the opportunity to put the significant changes I am proposing in this area before the House. Senator Burke's matter refers to conditions for local authority members.  I could point to several measures introduced during the past few years that have improved the conditions of elected members of local authorities &mdash; statutory recognition of their policy making role, extra reserved function and allowances for chairmen.  My proposals for a modernised system of expenses payments to councillors constitute yet another measure designed to secure and enhance the position of local authority members, thereby strengthening our system of democratic local government.</P>
      <P>The mark of the Victorian legislators is still evident in local government law and, moreover, there has been a considerable accretion of primary and secondary legislation either in addition to, or in partial substitution for, the original codes.  All this has made for an unwieldy and confusing maze of local government law.  Next year, I will be introducing a Bill to streamline the law on meetings, procedures and other operational aspects of the local government system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before then, however, I intend to have implemented regulations under the Local Government Act, 1991, to rationalise and modernise the system of allowances for local authority members.  The need for such reform becomes clear when one <Col N="485" /> considers that the existing law is scattered between at least five different Acts, going back as far as 1885, and numerous statutory instruments and departmental circulars. However, it is not so much the age or the diffuseness of these provisions, but rather their content, that primarily necessitates change.  The existing regime &mdash; I hesitate to refer to it as a system &mdash; is rife with anomalies, unnecessary bureaucracy and centralised controls. The most compelling reason perhaps for introducing a revised system of councillors' allowances is the need to take due account of the demands and burdens placed on members of modern day local authorities, without weakening the basic voluntary nature of local government service. For example, it is essential that local authority meetings are organised in such a way as to make it feasible for people in the widest possible range of occupations to participate as members.</P>
    <P>With the foregoing considerations in mind, I set about seeing what could be done to arrive at a modern, efficient and equitable system of allowances.  I was determined to pursue this issue through a consensus approach, to involve councillors and to get the views of as wide a spectrum of members as possible.  My efforts to this end have been largely successful. Although not obliged to do so by law, I facilitated an extensive degree of consultation on the matter.  I made my proposals known to the local authority associations and to each individual councillor in every part of the country, from the largest local authority to the smallest. I met councillors' representatives and endeavoured to explain the implications of what was proposed.  Most importantly, I tried to take account, as far as possible, of the feedback from councillors in drawing up revised proposals.</P>
    <P>Members of this House who are local authority members will be well aware of what is involved, but for the benefit of Members who may not be familiar with the matter, I will mention a few of the more significant improvements involved.</P>
    <P>The central element is the annual allowance, payable in instalments, instead of a payment per meeting system. <Col N="486" /> The annual allowance will take full account of the distance which each councillor has to travel to the council headquarters and will be based on a meetings index relating to bands of local authorities drawn up on the basis of data received from the local authorities and having regard to broad orders of scale and population.  One of the most significant features of the new system is that it will incorporate an element for postage, telephone and miscellaneous representational coats for which there is no recognition at present.  I made substantial improvements to the package of allowances, following consultations with councillors and their associations.  For example, the meetings index was increased for each band of authority; the postage, telephone and representational allowances was doubled and the mileage and subsistence rates on which the allowance will be calculated were substantially increased.</P>
    <P>While some councillors would wish to see higher rates of allowance introduced, there is a general appreciation of the constraints which must apply in this regard.  The overwhelming majority of members acknowledge that the revised package represents a substantial advance.  Indeed, this is reflected in the results of polls conducted by the Association of Municipal Authorities and the General Council of County Councils among their members which showed a significant majority in favour of the new system.  In Senator Burke's own council, for example, I understand that almost 80 per cent of councillors voted in favour of the measure.  The new arrangements will significantly improve the position of most members.  What is more, every councillor will know exactly where he or she stands with regard to expenses and there will be a degree of consistency and equity, which has been noticeably lacking under the old arrangements.  I have also given a commitment that the operation of the new system will be adequately monitored and that the various rates will be kept properly updated.</P>
    <P>The detailed arrangements for implementation of the new system of <Col N="487" /> allowances will be provided for in the regulations under section 51 of the Local Government Act, 1991.  These regulations are being prepared and indeed, this work is at an advanced stage.  I expect to make the regulations shortly providing for commencement of the new system at the earliest feasible date, which I hope will be 1 January 1994.</P>

      <P>There is an old story &mdash; I do not know if it is true &mdash; told in the other House.  A former representative from a western constituency in the late 1940s refused to take an increase of £100 in the Dáil salary at the time.  In the subsequent election, he was defeated. Some interested members of the media went down there to find out how such an honourable man could have lost.  They were told in the first public house they <Col N="488" /> went to that anyone who could not look after himself could not look after his constituents. I assume that county councillors who are doing estimates in anticipation of my intentions will take due regard and be sensible.</P>

Does the Minister not think that is unfair to councillors?</P>
